The issue of child sexual exploitation is undoubtedly complex, and John Wilson was right on the money in pointing out how uncomfortable the evidence-taking process was for the committee at times. The harrowing and distressing case studies that David Stewart mentioned could not have failed to touch anyone who read them or heard them in person.</p><p>I was first made aware of the committee&#8217;s work in the area through the committee&#8217;s application to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body for agreement to support an extension to the work of the committee&#8217;s adviser. That illustrated the complexity of the issues with which the committee was wrestling, and highlighted its determination to do justice to those issues.</p><p>I put on record my gratitude to Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland&#8212;that is becoming a bit of a common refrain, not least from me, given my work as a member of the Education and Culture Committee, which has spent at least a couple of years examining issues concerning those who are going through our care system and has more recently been considering the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. I acknowledge that Barnardo&#8217;s work gave rise to the inquiry on child sexual abuse through its petition and has been instrumental in informing what happens thereafter.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report and the recommendations that have emerged from the process are welcome and well balanced. The central call for a national overarching strategy strikes me as sensible. I was interested to hear the exchanges between the minister and Jackson Carlaw, as there appears to be a perception of greater disagreement than actually exists.</p><p>The minister was right to point to the call from Aberlour Child Care Trust to work with existing work streams, including the short-life ministerial working group, which, as the minister has just confirmed, will be extended to look at the issue. However, given the evidence of a lack of co-ordination, I do not think that we can dismiss the call for a national overarching strategy to pull all the work together.</p><p>I was aware of concerns around child sexual exploitation and of the sense that it is on the increase, with the forms that it takes quickly developing through, for example, online grooming and the opportunities afforded by chat rooms and social media. However, I confess that it is not an area that I felt that I understood in any great detail. I was reassured by Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s salutary warning about well-intentioned politicians blundering into the area armed with silver bullets, but I was also reassured by the committee&#8217;s findings, which point out that there is an imperfect understanding of the issues&#8212;there is not even agreement on what constitutes child sexual exploitation.</p><p>It is therefore absolutely essential to build up understanding and awareness through national data gathering and scoping exercises. However, that awareness and understanding should be built up not just among children, carers, parents and the wider public but among the professionals involved. Again, the point about what appears to be an absence of adequate co-ordination is one that we ought to take cognisance of.</p><p>There are of course specific challenges for the police and for justice bodies. The committee found that they appear not to be using current legislation to the fullest extent, not least to give effect to the disruption of perpetrators, which a number of members have mentioned. I ought perhaps to acknowledge the minister&#8217;s valiant efforts to point to a potential benefit from pulling together a single national police force. Given the extended debate on a topical question earlier this afternoon, that seemed a brave endeavour indeed.</p><p>The committee also calls for engagement with children on the issue through education and work in schools. I listened with interest to what Jackson Carlaw said in that respect, but I believe that it is absolutely right to do such work. Apparently consensual relationships are often anything but, and there is a lack of understanding of the signs of grooming among not only children who are being groomed but teachers and parents.</p><p>The way in which such education work is undertaken is critically important. I have long had concerns about the unintended consequences that can flow from campaigns around stranger danger. The committee heard evidence that a lot of child sexual exploitation happens within families and care settings, so it would be wrong to overstress the extent to which those unknown to individuals should be the focus of attention. There is a need to build confidence in children so that they recognise and can deal with the problems or know who to approach to help them deal with problems. There is also a need to build resilience in individual children&#8212;David Stewart alluded to that. However, there is a risk that we will cultivate an atmosphere of fear and suspicion that could ultimately be counterproductive in meeting the objectives that we are all intent on meeting.</p><p>I will refer briefly to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. The minister has obviously been intimately involved with the bill process, and she was right to point to some of the improvements that will be delivered through the passing of that legislation next month. However, I am conscious that Tam Baillie, Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, the together coalition and other bodies have pointed to the bill&#8217;s deficiencies in terms of the rights of children and, in particular, the failure to include in the bill articles 3 and 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. That represents a missed opportunity. For those less familiar with the UNCRC, I point out that article 3 is about ensuring that the voice of the child is heard in all decisions that affect him or her, and article 12 says that the best interests of the child should be treated as the paramount consideration. Although very valuable steps are being taken through the bill, the failure to incorporate more fully those articles is a deficiency. I think that the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s report simply reinforces that point.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report is by no means a magic bullet for addressing an issue that is complex and pernicious and whose nature is evolving. On that basis, I again congratulate the Public Petitions Committee on not being put off by the scale of the task that it undertook, on grappling with the issue and on coming forward with what I think are sensible recommendations. I certainly look forward to hearing the minister&#8217;s closing speech, but I think that we have the basis on which to address some of the shortcomings that the committee identified.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Stewart and his Public Petitions Committee colleagues on their work.

That underscores John Finnie&#8217;s personal commitment to the issues that are under discussion.</p><p>The point about a chain reaction or a virtuous cycle was well made and should inform our approach to the debate, which is about the longer term and development of self-help, about which Rob Gibson made some interesting comments. I know from my experience of visiting Malawi that the way in which international aid is delivered has different facets. There is an antiretroviral programme, which is&#8212;thankfully&#8212;beginning to get some traction, but without investment in the fertiliser programme, there is a lack of the foodstuffs that are absolutely essential to making the antiretroviral programme work and to tackling the incidence of HIV/AIDS.</p><p>If we look further forward, education issues are absolutely paramount. The investment in building and expanding the schools network and supporting more children, not just through primary school but on to secondary school, was a natural and necessary development. I know of a community group in my constituency that is looking to fund solar power packs to support mobile phones in the north of Malawi. We are seeing a logical extension of international aid in some developing countries.</p><p>I understand that the mother appeal and the lift lives for good appeal are umbrellas that cover a range of initiatives. The mother appeal, which is run in conjunction with Marks and Spencer&#8212;perhaps making it slightly less accessible for some of my constituents than for those of other members&#8212;aims to raise &#163;10&#160;million by mothers day on 30 March. It encourages people to contribute and to celebrate motherhood at the same time. As John Finnie said, it is focused on projects in Bangladesh, Tajikistan and rural Zambia. In Bangladesh, many poor households are headed by women and depend on livestock. Those women are being encouraged and supported to form dairy producer groups and to work co-operatively. In Tajikistan, the focus is on smallholders. Women fruit and vegetable farmers are being helped to unite to sell collectively, and to become more than the sum of their parts. There is also access to finance and business training, which has long-term benefits.</p><p>In Zambia, women in the Copperbelt province are being trained in soya and dairy farming techniques and are being provided with information on crop rotation and water conservation, which will help to build resilience to the climate change impacts to which Rob Gibson and others referred. The aim is to raise &#163;5&#160;million through public donations through M and S or direct to Oxfam, but as others have said, that will be backed by the UK aid match programme, which will take the figure up to &#163;10&#160;million.</p><p>The aid match programme was launched in September last year, following a successful pilot covering 17 charities and about &#163;40&#160;million of donations. The aim is to give &#163;120&#160;million to UK charities over the next three years by match funding&#8212;up to &#163;5&#160;million&#8212;the sums that are raised by a variety of projects. Sensibly, the programme also ring fences allocations for smaller projects in 26 developing countries. The programme will give real impetus to fundraising efforts; people tend to give more if they are encouraged because their donations will be matched by additional funds.</p><p>I accept that there are, in times of austerity, those who question the legitimacy of using public money to support people in other countries. The argument is that it should be left to the discretion of individuals and that the funding would be better deployed at home. However, I simply do not accept that even our own interests are best served by looking inward and turning our backs on those who are in desperate need of our help. I am thankful that most people in the UK agree, with more than 60 per cent backing the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on international aid. That may or may not be because, as Save the Children suggested, it is in our DNA.</p><p>However, the benefit that that aid&#8212;good aid, as Rob Gibson rightly pointed out&#8212;is delivering is in no doubt at all. In 2012, UK aid prevented 2.7&#160;million mothers and children from going hungry. It vaccinated 12&#160;million children against killer diseases and supported more than 5&#160;million children in going to school by building classrooms, training teachers and providing cash grants to poor families. We should all acknowledge that success, which should embolden us to do more.</p><p>I welcome the debate and congratulate John Finnie again on allowing it to take place and allowing Jackie Baillie the long-overdue opportunity to raise her voice in praise of the UK coalition Government. I thank the aid organisations that do such invaluable work throughout the developing world. In particular, I wish Oxfam every success with its lift lives for good campaign.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lift Lives for Good"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I warmly congratulate John Finnie, not just on his motion and on offering Parliament an opportunity to debate it, but on covering many of the issues that I think members were all looking to cover in our speeches.

The issues that Tavish Scott outlined in relation to the experience of his constituents reflect very much the experience of my constituents in Orkney. I echo his remarks and will try to make some additional points that I think are relevant to the debate.</p><p>At the outset, like Lewis Macdonald, Nanette Milne, Dennis Robertson and, indeed, Tavish Scott, I put on record my admiration for and gratitude to the staff and volunteers at CLAN, who do such tremendous work on behalf of cancer sufferers and their families, not just on the islands but across the north-east, as Lewis Macdonald highlighted.</p><p>I declare a personal interest, in that my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer a couple of years ago. Thankfully, surgery and treatment proved highly effective, further illustrating the importance of getting oneself checked regularly and the markedly improved recovery and survival rates for those whose cancer is detected and diagnosed early. I know how invaluable not just my father but my mother found the support provided by CLAN both in Aberdeen and in Orkney. The advice, the therapies and the opportunity to talk to others going through a similar experience all helped at the most difficult of times. Of course, the accommodation provided by CLAN was particularly welcome. Again, that does not just apply to Aberdeen. As residents of one of the outer north isles in Orkney, my parents were often required to overnight in Kirkwall en route to and from appointments or treatment in Aberdeen. They were therefore extremely grateful to be able to access CLAN&#8217;s facilities in the toon. My parents&#8217; experience was highly typical of that of many of my constituents.</p><p>As Tavish Scott intimated, I will highlight a specific concern that I have about changes that I believe are being considered to the way in which the health boards in Grampian, Orkney and Shetland support those from the islands who are undergoing cancer treatment. During a visit that I made to CLAN earlier this week, I was told that, despite its popularity with patients and their families, the Haven is currently operating at a loss of around &#163;100,000 per year. Although fundraising efforts, not least in Orkney and Shetland, have proved phenomenally successful over the years, there are issues around core funding.</p><p>Debbie Thomson explained that CLAN has requested an increase from &#163;30 to &#163;35 a night, which would still not cover the full costs but would at least reduce the overall deficit. However, I understand that NHS Grampian and the island health boards are considering a scheme whereby patients would have their costs paid Monday through Thursday but would be expected to return home on Friday for the weekend. I am not clear about the circumstances in which that would apply, but it strikes me as utter madness in terms of the welfare and wellbeing of patients undergoing or trying to recover from surgery or treatment. As Tavish Scott highlighted, the strain placed on patients from travelling back and forth for treatment takes its toll, and it would be bordering on the intolerable if they had to do that every weekend. For those who live in the smaller islands, such as my parents, it would be logistically impossible. Moreover, I cannot see any cost saving. The travel costs would be borne centrally, rather than by individual boards, so perhaps that provides boards with a perverse incentive to act in the way that is proposed. Perhaps the minister can address the proposal in his winding-up speech, or at least give an assurance that he will look into it as a matter of urgency for the sake of patients in my constituency and in Shetland.</p><p>CLAN is not just a resource for those from the islands. The importance of the support structure that it, the Red Cross and others provide for those who find themselves far from home for lengthy periods, often under severe physical and emotional stress, really cannot be overstated. That is why there has been such concern about the implications of staffing shortages in the oncology department at Aberdeen royal infirmary. I know that other hospitals and health boards have been similarly affected, but I believe that nowhere else has the same concentration of patients being treated for a variety of cancers who have to travel such long distances and find themselves so far from their network of family and friends.</p><p>As Tavish Scott said, the numbers of Orkney and Shetland patients who have been unable to receive treatment in Aberdeen have been mercifully low, and it appears that Aberdeen now has only a single consultant vacancy left to fill. Like Tavish Scott, I acknowledge the efforts of Richard Carey and his team at NHS Grampian, as well as the intervention of the health secretary at the back end of last year. However, I associate myself with some of the questions that Dennis Robertson asked about how things were allowed to get to the stage that they were at during the latter part of last year. I also think that Tavish Scott&#8217;s points about the need for permanent appointments to ensure continuity and quality of care were well made.</p><p>A careful watching brief will certainly need to be kept on the issue. For now, I congratulate Tavish Scott once again on giving the Parliament an opportunity to debate these important issues. With my Movember ambassador hat on, I conclude by urging anyone who is watching, listening to or reading this debate to get themselves checked.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22847197", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oncology (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I offer my congratulations to my friend and colleague Tavish Scott on allowing Parliament to debate this serious issue today.

The Royal British Legion there has more than 2,000 members in Kirkwall and a further 500 in Stromness, representing not just 8 per cent but a full 12 per cent of the population all told. It is a very active branch and club, providing a focal point for bringing the local community together, both members and non-members.</p><p>Last year, I was fortunate enough to attend an event hosted by Veterans Scotland in Orkney. Understandably, it was well attended, but it was a real eye-opener for the likes of myself about the sort of issues faced by veterans transitioning out of the services. We have heard already from members about housing, joblessness and addiction issues, but it struck me that many of the issues were practical and were based on the extent to which some of those exiting the armed forces can find themselves institutionalised and unable to cope with some of the things that we find mundane and straightforward.</p><p>There are obviously issues around physical disabilities but, as Jim Eadie pointed out, there are also mental health issues. They can have a stigma attached to them and can be difficult for anybody to deal with, but they are particularly difficult for those with a services background.</p><p>For all those reasons, the way in which services are delivered, both locally and nationally, is important. It is not necessarily the case that forces veterans can access those services in the same way as those without that background, and a lot of good work is being done in that regard. Christina McKelvie has referenced the work of the citizens advice bureaux, which I am familiar with, and I echo her comments. There is growing evidence that the system is not working as well as it could or should, but I simply question whether a commissioner is the right approach.</p><p>I found myself agreeing with some of what Alex Johnstone was saying in that regard. Leaving aside the issues around the way in which the news was broken and the lack of discussion with business managers in the preparation of the motion&#8212;those are process issues&#8212;there is a more substantive risk that creating a commissioner and the staff to support that role will divert resources away from direct help to veterans. Why not use some of the additional &#163;250,000 to build capacity in Veterans Scotland, in citizens advice bureaux and in other such organisations? From conversations that I have had locally in Orkney, I know that there is a plethora of organisations all doing excellent work, but there is already confusion and, as Alex Johnstone said, there is a risk that all we do over time is to exacerbate that.</p><p>The minister is right to highlight the continued problem with enabling veterans to access services and support, particularly at transitions. He might even be right that we require some means of bringing together the various organisations and agencies that are tasked with providing that support. However, I do not think that Parliament has been provided with evidence to suggest that the plan for a commissioner is the answer. We need reassurances that the office and role will not divert much-needed funds away from building capacity in organisations that already undertake valuable front-line work with veterans and their families.</p><p>So that we are clear about what we are voting on this afternoon, we also need an explanation as to why, as Mark Griffin said, if it is such a good idea, it was not good enough to get into the motion that was discussed with business managers. As the Presiding Officer made clear, in the Parliament, debates about and consideration of issues relating to veterans have been characterised by a genuine consensual and cross-party approach. I recognise the specific and direct insight that the minister has in the area and I agree with most of what he had to say, but I am concerned that his proposal for a commissioner needs more detailed scrutiny to ensure that we make best use of the resources that are available to assist those to whom we owe so much.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.

However, to compound that&#8212;in breach of the public sector equality duty&#8212;they did not even bother to seek the views of those working in the sector. It is quite clear at this stage that the reputation and work of the Home Office have been undermined and that, more worrying still, those working on its behalf, including the likes of Refugee Action, which was contracted to run the assisted voluntary return scheme, have suffered damage as well.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the fact that, as the SRC and Jackie Baillie acknowledge, there are people who do not have protection needs and should return to their country of origin. However, that is best achieved through confidential dialogue between refused asylum seekers, their advisers and Home Office staff. Wider communications can also play a useful role in that, but not when they are as hostile and generic as those that were used in the go home campaign.</p><p>The evidence shows not only that the posters, billboards and leaflets were inflammatory and offensive but that they cannot even be claimed to have been effective.

For example, the removal of exit checks was a mistake that successive Administrations made in the 1990s, and the situation now needs to be reassessed and addressed. That will be key to restoring public confidence in this area. From rogue employers to bogus colleges, action quite rightly has been taken by the UK Government to address shortcomings, but the debate, at all times, needs to be characterised by fairness and balance.</p><p>It is worth mentioning the welcome end of child detention as part of the coalition agreement. The practice at Dungavel and elsewhere was utterly reprehensible and a scar on our conscience.</p><p>There are issues that we must continue to debate and difficult decisions that we need to take, but the serious risk arising from the go home campaign is that we make the task more difficult and in the process cause unnecessary risk and anxiety to many vulnerable people who already feel under threat and others who have made and continue to make such a significant economic, social and cultural contribution to Scotland and the UK as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22819985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Office Go Home Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am conscious that Bob Doris and Neil Findlay also lodged motions on this subject, but I congratulate Jackie Baillie not only on lodging the motion but on securing this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

None of the committee members, either past or present, would make any apology for that focus or for the time that we have committed to getting into the detail of the issues involved. The issues are complex, and that is reflected in the latest report. The area does not lend itself to neat, far less to easy, solutions.</p><p>I add my thanks to all those who gave evidence and helped in the development of the committee report, and the report that preceded it on improving the outcomes for looked-after children. One inquiry flowed naturally from the other, although even now I have the sense that we have scarcely done justice to many of the issues. As the convener of the committee indicated, it is inevitable that we&#8212;and certainly successor committees&#8212;will return to the subject in the future.</p><p>As the convener explained, the approach that was taken to the report was rather different from before, with interim findings and a parliamentary debate as well as a special hearing that involved the wide range of stakeholders whose work in the field on a daily basis deserves our respect and gratitude.</p><p>Above all, we were committed to hearing the voices of children and young people with direct experience of the care system. Their testimony was particularly powerful and at times highly creative. We owe a special debt to Who Cares? Scotland for its help throughout the inquiry, not least in the session with those with direct experience.</p><p>As well as being moved by the piece of theatre that the young people performed, I was struck by what they had to say. They wanted to feel involved in decisions that profoundly affect their lives; they wanted a sense of belonging and not to be shunted from pillar to post; and, most of all, they wanted a strong, stable, supportive and loving environment in which to be brought up.</p><p>As Jayne Baxter rightly said, those are all things that we would expect for our own children and things that we should aspire to deliver for those for whom we have responsibility as corporate parents. The committee&#8217;s report is helpful in that regard, and the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, which the committee is currently considering, has the potential to deliver real improvements for those who are in care and those who are leaving care.</p><p>I will turn to those people shortly, but I first want to reflect briefly on the Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s report. I confess that, in places, the response left me a little frustrated. It is, of course, generally very positive, and I absolutely agree with the minister&#8217;s view that the focus must be on early intervention, particularly in the early years, and also on early permanence. Nevertheless, I felt too often that the message was either &#8220;We&#8217;re doing this already&#8221; or &#8220;This is nothing to do with us.&#8221; That may be unfair and it may reflect the iterative nature of two committee inquiries in which we have been in almost constant dialogue with the Scottish Government, but in some places the response still felt a bit unsatisfactory.</p><p>For example, the minister&#8217;s letter to the convener starts by declaring that there are</p><p>&#8220;encouraging signs that outcomes are improving gradually across almost all indicators&#8221;.</p><p>I agree that the picture is not universally bleak, but that statement seems unduly upbeat. For example, the committee found little evidence that outcomes for those who are looked after at home are anything other than shockingly poor, as the convener suggested, in respect of education, health, homelessness or involvement in the criminal justice system.</p><p>Later in the response, the minister talks of her</p><p>&#8220;programme of work to encourage strategic commissioning&#8221;.</p><p>That is very welcome, but again on the evidence that we received from those who are involved in the third sector, that is a way off happening in almost all parts of the country.</p><p>Likewise, the committee&#8217;s concerns about workforce training and retention in social work appear to have been rather brushed aside. I am not suggesting that no action has been taken by the minister in conjunction with local authorities&#8212;far from it&#8212;or that there are any easy answers, but we heard firm evidence that retaining staff in what can often be highly stressful roles in children and families social work is a problem in many areas.</p><p>I think that George Adam indicated that we heard that retaining experienced social workers on the front line was a particular challenge. Obviously, that is a concern, as providing high-quality assessment of difficult cases perhaps depends more on experience than training.</p><p>That said, I recognise the steps that the Government has taken and is taking. Indeed, I welcome the establishment of the permanence leaders group. I also acknowledge the opportunity that the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill presents to make further progress, for which there is solid cross-party commitment.</p><p>Where can that progress be made? According to Barnardo&#8217;s, improving outcomes requires improvement in the consistency, speed and timeliness of decision making, and an absolute focus on securing permanency once a decision is made to take a child into care. That was entirely borne out by our inquiry.</p><p>On consistency, Barnardo&#8217;s has highlighted the different risk assessment processes that are used by authorities in Scotland and that uncertainty about what evidence needs to be gathered leads to needless delays. As such, a common framework across the country is necessary.</p><p>Speed of decision making is also crucial, notwithstanding that such decisions are probably the most difficult that an authority has to make. As the minister acknowledges, the issue is about not just speed but achieving permanency quickly. Barnardo&#8217;s proposes a six-month timeframe for conducting a parental assessment and highlights&#8212;as Ken Macintosh did&#8212;the need for much stronger support for parents when a decision is taken to leave a child in or return it to the family home. Often the reverse happens, which is a complaint that we hear particularly from parents of children with disabilities or additional support needs, although I hope that proposals in the bill for a named person and a single child&#8217;s plan will help in that respect.</p><p>Early decision making is also vital. As Stewart Maxwell said, the complaint from many of the young people that we spoke to was that they were left in a poor home environment for too long. The earlier that decisions are made&#8212;at whatever age&#8212;the better the outcomes for the child or young person.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The issue of looked-after children and young people and how we improve the life experiences and outcomes for that group has dominated the work of the Education and Culture Committee in this parliamentary session.

Nevertheless, the debate has been an attempt by the Government to trumpet the promises on childcare that were contained in the manifesto that was published last week.</p><p>I do not think that I am alone in finding it strange that the flagship policy of that manifesto appears to be in an area of devolved responsibility in which the Government has powers already. The Deputy First Minister&#8217;s response to questions about why the policy was not being put into effect now was:</p><p>&#8220;Because if we did that now the increased revenues from that would flow straight to the UK treasury&#8221;.</p><p>Therefore, the issue is not about improving outcomes for children and young people or opportunities for women to return to or remain in work.</p><p>I accept that the minister&#8217;s motion and her generally measured opening remarks go wider than that, but the policy is still hung on the premise of the constitution. Therefore, I agree with Labour&#8217;s amendment that progress will be made only when the debate is centred not on the constitution but on the real, lived experiences of women, including Jayne Baxter&#8217;s and Christine Grahame&#8217;s impressive real, lived experiences.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale was also right in forcefully reiterating the need to remove barriers to women playing an equal part in the economy and society in the UK to create a more social, just, fair and decent society. For many of the reasons that Siobhan McMahon gave, I do not accept that that is contingent on breaking up the UK. That is not to say that a great deal of progress does not remain to be made in Scotland and across the UK in apprenticeships, the enterprise gap, the pay gap and representation in a range of spheres such as women in STEM. In all those areas, much more progress is needed.</p><p>Let us consider some of the facts. First, 427,000 more women are now in employment&#8212;almost 100,000 more in self-employment&#8212;than were in employment in 2010, notwithstanding Ms Constance&#8217;s remarks about closing the enterprise gap. The creation of jobs must be the most effective way of helping with the cost of living.</p><p>Secondly, although low pay is an issue, 1.5 million women have been taken out of paying income tax altogether through the &#163;10,000 personal tax allowance.</p><p>Thirdly, more flexibility has been introduced into rules on parental leave, unlocking potential female talent in the labour market and providing a fairer balance between men and women.</p><p>Finally, the new single-tier pension is properly recognising the years that have been spent raising children and is much fairer to women, who on average currently receive considerably less state pension than men.</p><p>The Government is right in pointing to childcare as one of the ways in which we can unlock that potential. On many occasions, I have welcomed the provisions in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill that extend childcare and early learning for three and four-year-olds. Nevertheless, all the evidence shows that investment before the age of three delivers the biggest returns and that gaps are already opening up that may never be bridged.</p><p>Extending early learning and childcare to 40 per cent of two-year-olds from the poorest backgrounds is already benefiting 92,000 two-year-olds south of the border, and the figure will rise to 260,000 by next year.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781811", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women and Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Speaking as what Christine Grahame might describe as a real-life man, I approach the debate with some trepidation.

I also thank the clerks and committee colleagues for their contributions to what I think is a very reasonable report on a very wide-ranging bill.</p><p>Let me be clear: the Scottish Liberal Democrats support the bill&#8217;s principles and believe that it actually delivers on them, which perhaps distinguishes it from the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill. Like any bill, it needs to be improved in many areas&#8212;indeed, the Finance Committee&#8217;s report on the financial memorandum was particularly critical&#8212;but I welcome the minister&#8217;s willingness to address areas of concern pretty much across the board.</p><p>I am not sure, for example, that the bill properly reflects children&#8217;s rights at this stage and do not think that the committee was convinced that the case for full incorporation of the UNCRC had been adequately made. However, we were seized of the importance of looking again at incorporating specific rights, and the Law Society of Scotland&#8217;s description of the duty placed on members as a</p><p>&#8220;diluted version of the existing obligations&#8221;</p><p>and the Faculty of Advocates&#8217; view that the bill does not further develop the rights of children and young people in Scotland to a significant extent suggest that more work needs to be done, particularly in relation to putting children&#8217;s rights impact assessments at the heart of the legislative process.</p><p>One of the most controversial areas was the named person provision, which the Parliament has already debated. Although I again make clear my support for the principle, I, like all committee members, must acknowledge the inherent practical and resource issues, some of which arise from uncertainty about roles and responsibilities, the interaction with lead professionals and some of the training requirements.</p><p>That, in turn, has consequences for resources&#8212;a point that was picked up by the Finance Committee, the education unions and the RCN, which in its briefing suggests that</p><p>&#8220;concerns regarding the capacity of the health visiting workforce to deliver existing duties let alone those associated with the Named Person role&#8221;</p><p>need to be borne in mind.</p><p>The practicalities stem from the lowering of the threshold to one of wellbeing, which has implications for information sharing and, indeed, where the consent of the individual is sought. Professor Kenneth Norrie, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office and others have highlighted their concerns in relation to sections 26 and 27. I am grateful to the minister for acknowledging that and for agreeing to take that issue away. There are practical and resource issues and we need to maintain a ruthless focus on welfare. I hope that the Government will ensure that there is a presumption in favour of consent in relation to information sharing.</p><p>The political heart of the bill is to be found in part 6, on early learning and childcare. It is a vehicle by which the Government can deliver on its commitment to provide 600 hours of early learning and childcare for three and four-year-olds. I restate my welcome for that policy, which I believe will deliver real benefits. The concerns that have been raised by Liz Smith, Jayne Baxter and others about the points that were made by Reform Scotland have been taken on board by the minister. However, there is scope for more ambition, particularly in relation to two-year-olds. The minister will argue that the bill represents a first step. I acknowledge that, but I do not think that it shows sufficient ambition. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have put forward reasonable and costed proposals for extending that provision to two-year-olds from the poorest backgrounds. In its briefing for the debate, Save the Children says that</p><p>&#8220;to be effective at meeting its aims, we believe there is a strong case to also include two year olds growing up in poverty&#8221;.</p><p>It goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Evidence shows that every month of pre-school provision after age 2 is linked to improved outcomes including increased educational performance at age 14&#8221;.</p><p>That is picked up by Children in Scotland, which points to the provision for 40 per cent of two-year-olds that is delivering to 92,000 two-year-olds south of the border.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I thank the very many people and organisations that submitted oral and written evidence on the bill and those responsible for the veritable snowstorm of briefings that we have received over the past few days.

The area has been a focus for the committee in at least two inquiries, and the bill represents a real step in the right direction in aftercare up to the age of 26. However, as our inquiries show, we need a renewed focus. There is no silver bullet because the reasons why those who go through the care system struggle with outcomes are many and varied. In last night&#8217;s excellent debate, the emphasis was on the need for strong, stable, loving relationships. That is very much the message that we got back time and again in our inquiries. More can be done on aftercare, building on the good provisions in the bill to deliver what Aberlour Child Care Trust, Who Cares?

We would all subscribe to the ambition for Scotland to be the best place to grow up in. We might disagree on how far we are from achieving that, but it is the right vision. The bill can play a part in delivering that, but it needs further clarity and ambition&#8212;clarity around resources and practical implications and ambitions around early learning for two-year-olds, aftercare and children&#8217;s rights.

I hope that the minister may yet be persuaded about that in the spirit of sustaining the consensus that I know he has worked hard to try to maintain.</p><p>Before I turn to CCS and whether and how the technology might be deployed, it is essential to set the debate in its proper context, as Iain Gray, Kenny Gibson, Patrick Harvie and other members have done. Fundamentally, it is about addressing the challenge of climate change, taking the necessary steps to decarbonise our economy, and doing so quickly enough to enable us to avoid the tipping point in temperature rises. That is why the Liberal Democrats are absolutely committed to achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions from the UK economy by 2050. Challenging though that goal may be, it is entirely achievable. Concerted action across a number of fronts will be required, and if we are to improve energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions, it is clear that we will need to develop and commercialise new technologies in renewable energy, carbon capture and storage and low-carbon modes of transport.</p><p>Pinning all our hopes on technology getting us out of the hole that we have got ourselves into would, of course, be misguided. Significant behavioural changes will also be necessary. In some cases, we may simply need to recognise that the only option is to stop doing things. However, given the trajectory that is required in reducing emissions and the continued role that thermal power will need to play in our energy mix over the next decades, I firmly believe that both of Scotland&#8217;s Governments are right to look to CCS as a means of making the sorts of changes that we need to see in the necessary timeframes.</p><p>I note WWF&#8217;s concerns about what it sees as the Scottish Government&#8217;s overreliance on CCS in its latest report on proposals and policies for the delivery of our climate change targets. In its briefing, WWF calls for a &#8220;Plan B&#8221;. However reasonable and beguiling that call may be, though, there is a risk that it sends out a confused message, diverting investment and focus away from the development of commercial-scale CCS. The consequence of that would be that we either miss our targets or find ourselves importing the technology and expertise that we need at a later date.

As the minister confirmed to the Parliament recently, the deployment of CCS on a commercial scale will largely be driven by the carbon price floor, support through contracts for difference under the EMR process and the UK&#8217;s CCS commercialisation programme competition. To that, I would add the important contribution that the UK&#8217;s four-year R and D programme will make. That involves &#163;125 million of funding to support about 100 projects&#8212;many of them at Scottish universities such as Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde&#8212;and aims to reduce the costs of CCS by developing cheaper and more efficient technologies and components as well as characterising storage sites.</p><p>However, the heavy lifting, as the minister said, is being done through contracts for difference and the commercialisation programme. On the former, concerns have been expressed that the EMR process has created uncertainty. I can understand that to an extent, although I do not think that anybody realistically expected this to be a simple and straightforward process. However, I am pleased that we are now seeing some of the necessary clarity around contracts for difference. They will encourage investment in renewables technologies and CCS by reducing risks to investors and making it easier and cheaper to secure finance, as is reflected in Murdo Fraser&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>I was interested this week to hear the representatives of Summit Power talking rather optimistically about the potential effect that contracts for difference could have on helping to deliver its captain clean energy project at Grangemouth. That is certainly encouraging. That project is one of two reserve projects in the UK Government&#8217;s commercialisation programme, for which the SSE and Shell project at Peterhead is the preferred bidder. As we know from our experience at Longannet, that offers no guarantees, but it confirms that the Peterhead bid is well placed, which is excellent news for Scotland, as the minister acknowledged.</p><p>That &#163;1 billion capital fund aims to support the design, construction and operation of commercial-scale CCS, and I hope that Peterhead will emerge successfully from the competitive process. I appreciate that there was disappointment that the previous competition did not result in deployment at Longannet but, for many of the reasons that Murdo Fraser outlined, that point was reached by mutual agreement between Scottish Power, its partners and the UK Government. Those who are tempted to lambast UK ministers for not stumping up whatever money was needed to make CCS happen at Longannet rather miss the point about demonstrating the viability of commercial-scale CCS.</p><p>I believe that CCS should be part of our efforts to reduce our emissions, but we should not lose sight of its importance to global efforts to tackle climate change, as Joan McAlpine mentioned. It was put to me recently by an academic and expert in the field that Peterhead and the captain clean energy project are now a significant part of global efforts to demonstrate the type of CCS power plant projects with CO2 storage that will be critical for us to achieve big global emissions reductions. Most other projects use existing CO2 sources from gas cleaning processes and commercial CO2 injection.</p><p>All of this is contingent on our reaching a global agreement, but Scotland has a large proportion of the EU storage capacity as well as industrial clusters, relevant expertise in the oil and gas sector and academic excellence, all of which can help us to reap significant economic benefits. Indeed, with Scotland and the UK now carrying a disproportionate burden in demonstrating CCS on behalf of the EU, I wonder whether the minister will consider whether CCS electricity should be counted against our EU renewables targets. I suspect that that is not without its problems, but it would help to enhance the viability of the technology.</p><p>I welcome today&#8217;s debate and the tone that the minister set. I acknowledge the general consensus on the importance of CCS in helping to deliver on our emissions reduction and climate change targets as well as those on a global scale, and the advantages that Scotland has in the field. On that basis, I hope that the minister will accept Murdo Fraser&#8217;s amendment so that we can convey that sense of common purpose.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698981", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Capture and Storage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is not an unreasonable proposition, but the message that I gain from what we have seen in the development of renewables is that it is important to set ambitious targets and to be clear and consistent in the steer that we give to industry so that it can respond and put the investment behind that steer.

All of those are sensible recommendations. They address some of the issues that have already been raised with us at the Education and Culture Committee.

For me, the example of Sophie Turner was conspicuous by its absence. She was recently awarded a four-year apprenticeship as a stonemason at St Magnus cathedral, supported by Orkney Islands Council, the Construction Industry Training Board and Historic Scotland. That is a phenomenal opportunity to work alongside Colin Watson, the current stonemason, in a unique and iconic building, the light of the north.

I, too, congratulate Nigel Don on his motion, on securing the debate and on his role as honorary vice-president. I also congratulate the other honorary vice-president for receptions, Jackie Baillie.</p><p>I congratulate Energy Action Scotland on the 30th anniversary of the start of its tireless campaigning on the issue of fuel poverty. The figures that Nigel Don referred to should not in any way be viewed as a mark of failure on the part of Energy Action Scotland, which has been 100 per cent successful in getting the issue to the top of the political agenda, right across the board and across different Administrations, and pursuing tailored approaches. I was very interested by Nigel Don&#8217;s reference to the area-based approach, which, we would all agree, needs to form a greater part of the approach that we take.</p><p>The Energy Action Scotland briefing for today&#8217;s debate highlights some of the characteristics of where fuel poverty is most prevalent. I will not rehearse them&#8212;none of them is particularly surprising&#8212;but they indicate particular problems in rural areas such as the islands that I represent. In Orkney, we take no pride at all in being top of the list for fuel poverty in this country, second only to the Western Isles. It is not difficult to understand why that is the case, with our longer, harsher winters, more hard-to-heat properties, being off the gas grid, high fuel costs and lower incomes.</p><p>That is not to say that there has not been a concerted effort. Some innovative approaches have been taken. A pilot initiative in Westray, for example, has examined a variety of options to treat different hard-to-heat properties. There is still hope that a way can be found to harness renewables generation to supply fuel-poor households, possibly easing some of the local grid constraints. Orkney Housing Association has a decent track record in innovation in this area. It has attracted funding through Calor and Energy Action Scotland&#8217;s affordable warmth fund, which has allowed it to fund a particular position within the organisation, and that has allowed the association to carry out survey work and to provide advice to householders, as well as undertaking a range of measures that have alleviated problems for many tenants.</p><p>The move to renewable technologies was the right approach to take, although it has presented some difficulties. I know from complaints from my constituents that installation costs can be higher and that the contributions required are therefore higher. Bills tend to go up afterwards. That might be partly the result of fuel costs rising, but it is perhaps also a product of heating more of the home. There is also some uncertainty about the operation of some of the systems. There are some challenges around whether we are paying enough attention to what bills are likely to be after the installation of measures and whether adequate aftercare is being provided.</p><p>Back in 2006, Energy Action Scotland and the Scottish fuel poverty forum estimated that levels of investment needed to be at around &#163;200 million a year over a period of 10 years. At the moment, the amount that is being provided is not sufficient, given that only &#163;79 million of funding has been secured under the home energy efficiency programme Scotland.</p><p>That need for investment makes me slightly concerned about Ed Miliband&#8217;s proposal for a price freeze, which has excited a great deal of attention. For example, one issue is whether we will see spikes in bills before the freeze comes into effect or a diminution of the investment in the sort of measures that would provide a long-term solution to the problem. More interesting still, his proposal has exposed some divisions within the Scottish Government, with ministers arguing both for and against the proposal before suggesting that the matter is for the energy commission.</p><p>In conclusion, I congratulate Nigel Don on securing the debate on the 30th anniversary of Energy Action Scotland. With just over three years to go until the 2016 deadline, this is an opportune moment to restate our commitment to redouble our efforts to end fuel poverty. In one of my first debates as my party&#8217;s energy spokesman back in 2008, I called for the re-establishment of the independent fuel poverty advisory forum, and I am delighted to say that that call was successful. I also called for a collaborative effort to do Norman Kerr out of a job by achieving our goal of ending fuel poverty, but, worryingly, Norrie&#8212;who I see is in the public gallery this evening&#8212;is as safe in his post today as he was five years ago. That is simply not acceptable and we must do better.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Action Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start with an apology to all members in the chamber: as a result of a rescheduled Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body meeting, I will have to depart from the debate early.

Gavin Brown&#8217;s amendment highlights many of the same points but, in deleting the original motion, it perhaps risks glossing over the extent of the problems that we are witnessing.</p><p>Gavin Brown rightly identifies, of course, the source of many of the problems, which was an economic crash unlike any since the 1930s.

Perhaps, in writing it, I had half an eye on Jackie Baillie&#8217;s other debate this week, on challenging poverty.</p><p>As for today&#8217;s speech from Jackie Baillie, I was left wondering what it is that she is looking for. She may be right that the Scottish Government is on pause ahead of next year&#8217;s referendum, but what specific action she wanted from either Scottish or UK ministers was rather unclear. That is not to diminish the seriousness of the challenges facing those we represent: increased food, childcare and energy costs all play their part and no one can be anything other than appalled at the high levels of fuel poverty or the growing numbers of our citizens who are using food banks. Those issues demand an urgent response from both Scotland&#8217;s Governments.</p><p>In my opening speech, I set out some of the important steps that are being taken at a UK level. They include a fundamental shift in the tax system that will result in 240,000 low-paid Scots being taken out of paying any income tax at all. That is a lasting, progressive and fair reform of our tax system. On pensions, too, I set out the effect of the so-called triple lock, which ensures that the state pension rises in line with inflation, with wages or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest, and which in 2012 delivered the highest ever cash increase in the state pension. That is a lasting, progressive and fair reform of our pensions.</p><p>On childcare and fuel costs, the coalition Government has also taken action to help hard-pressed families and individuals. Already in England, 20 per cent of two-year-olds from the poorest backgrounds are receiving free nursery provision. That will rise to 40 per cent by next year. From 2015, the UK Government will meet 20 per cent of childcare costs for working families, building up to &#163;1,200 per child under 12 per year&#8212;a scheme that is worth &#163;750 million. Meanwhile, in the face of rising fuel costs, the UK Government has confirmed a further freeze in the duty for the next two years.</p><p>The warm homes discount, which is worth more than &#163;1 billion, is also providing support to manage fuel bills, over and above the steps that are being taken forward through the green deal and the ECO.</p><p>Not surprisingly, most, if not all, members chose to focus much of their speeches on the impact of welfare reform. I can certainly understand that. Indeed, I probably should have addressed it in more detail in my own opening speech. From listening to the debate, however, one would assume that neither the SNP nor Labour accept the need for welfare reform, which is simply not true. We know that the previous Labour Government was preparing very similar proposals to those that are now being taken forward by the coalition. Last December, Ed Balls promised</p><p>&#8220;a tougher approach to conditionality&#8221;</p><p>for benefit claimants. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has talked previously about the need to &#8220;simplify&#8221; welfare, although without sharing with us the details of what that entailed. That lack of detail may be convenient for the SNP ahead of next September, but it leaves the SNP having to explain what, if any, reduction in the &#163;2.5 billion welfare bill it would expect to achieve.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Predictably, it has been a passionate debate&#8212;often with more heat than light, although I draw particular attention to the speeches of Kezia Dugdale, Drew Smith and John Mason, which were passionate but constructive.

Unlike Patrick Harvie, all of them appear to want Scandinavian levels of spending without committing to Scandinavian levels of taxation.</p><p>I entirely accept that implementing reforms to our welfare system has been hugely difficult for many of those who have been directly affected. I know that from my own casework. Where changes need to be made to mitigate the impacts, they have been made and that absolutely must continue. However, denying the need for reform, or insisting that it can somehow be achieved without controversy, is disingenuous. The notion that, as Nicola Sturgeon implies, we can simplify the system without creating winners and losers is simply ridiculous. The reality is that the current system too often provides the wrong incentives. For too many people, it acts as a real obstacle to work. As much as anything else, that is unfair to the claimants themselves.</p><p>Over a period when our economy experienced almost uninterrupted growth, the welfare budget ballooned by more than 40 per cent in real terms, so a strategy for job creation is essential, but it is not the whole answer. In the UK, we have 5 million people who are trapped on out-of-work benefits, one of the highest rates of workless households in Europe, and almost 2 million children who are living in homes where no one has a job. For Scotland, the picture is no less grim.</p><p>I agree with Kenny Gibson that tinkering around the edges will not cut it, but promising to maintain or even increase current levels of spend on welfare is neither honest nor affordable. Trapping people on benefits, rather than providing incentives and support into work, is also not desirable. It is right that we continue to press for appropriate changes and safeguards beyond those that have already been given, but claiming to be in favour of reform while holding the view that any benefit cuts or any tinkering of demands placed on recipients is automatically unfair is just not credible.</p><p>Let me conclude by making a more parochial point. Nowhere is the cost of living higher than in the islands, where fuel, food and travel&#8212;and childcare, too, where that is available&#8212;are all more expensive than on the mainland. Thanks to the Liberal Democrats, fuel duty on all our islands has been cut by 5p so, although fuel is still more expensive than on the mainland, the price differential is now less. By contrast, the SNP Government has chosen to increase costs to businesses in our island communities by cutting the air discount scheme and has excluded Orkney and Shetland from a cheap ferry fare scheme that is focused solely on the west coast routes.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I gave way in my opening speech&#8212;I will not give way this time.

That should be the Government&#8217;s priority. As Willie Rennie pointed out, the number of Scottish companies taking on apprentices is lower than the number elsewhere in the UK. Our two Governments should be working together closely to address that. The &#163;2,000 national insurance rebate from the UK Government from April could allow businesses here to increase apprenticeships in Scotland, and the enterprise capital fund and the Green Investment Bank offer further opportunities for collaborative action by both of Scotland&#8217;s Governments in the interest of Scotland&#8217;s economy.</p><p>However, Mr Salmond elevates his place in history above the needs of those whom he was elected&#8212;we were all elected&#8212;to serve. With no hint of self-irony, he treated us yesterday to devolution&#8217;s greatest hits. DJ Alex&#8212;who, let us not forget, was so impressed with the Scottish Parliament that he could not wait to return to Westminster not so long ago&#8212;offered up a mash-up of free personal care, free eye and dental checks, a ban on smoking in public places, concessionary travel and the abolition of tuition fees. Those are examples that, along with others, clearly demonstrate the success of devolution and show how this Parliament has reflected and responded to the needs and aspirations of the people of Scotland. However, the First Minister is not looking to strengthen devolution; he is looking to abandon it.</p><p>The logical response to the way in which this Parliament has used its powers over education, health, justice and transport to chart a different course where necessary is not to say that we no longer benefit from being part of the UK but to say, as the majority of people in Scotland do, that we need to strengthen this Parliament within a reformed UK. Indeed, the First Minister himself seems to agree with that. Why else would he be arguing against the advice of his Nobel-laureated advisers, yes Scotland comrades and most economic expects to keep the pound, a move that would see an independent Scotland hand over control of its fiscal and monetary policy to a foreign country?</p><p>On further devolution, Alison Johnstone was absolutely correct when she reminded the chamber that devolution should not stop in Edinburgh. Like her, I will be interested to see what emerges in the community empowerment and renewal bill, but the Government&#8217;s record in this area is not encouraging. Some 18 months ago, Tavish Scott and I responded to both Government consultations on constitutional reform, expressing our support for the right of our island communities to take more control over their own affairs, if they wish. We were denounced by the SNP as troublemakers. That vision did not fit with the nationalist narrative, particularly regarding the use of our oil and renewables resources. However, last month, Mr Salmond&#8217;s rather grand Lerwick declaration saw a working group set up to examine that specific issue. That is progress, perhaps, but the fact that much of the public appetite in our islands for more powers stems from anger at the SNP&#8217;s centralising agenda over recent years suggests that reversing some of that centralisation would be a useful place for the working group to start.</p><p>There are, of course, areas of agreement on the programme. Following the lead taken at Westminster, the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill will help to make Scotland a fairer and more progressive society. So, too, will the proposed increase in childcare and nursery provision although&#8212;sadly&#8212;it still risks leaving two-year-olds in Scotland behind their counterparts in England, where 130,000 will benefit from 15 hours of free provision as of this week.</p><p>I agree with the First Minister&#8217;s sentiment that this Parliament can, does and should adopt Scottish solutions to address Scottish problems, although I counsel caution on that. I suspect that, on airguns and taxi regulation&#8212;both of which Mr Salmond mentioned&#8212;he would find a difference in the perception of the problem and, therefore, the solution in our respective constituencies compared with that in the constituency represented by, for example, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p><p>Mr MacAskill&#8217;s plans to abandon corroboration despite serious concerns from the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates may play well with parts of the gallery but, as Ruth Davidson suggested, they also risk leaving Scotland with the lowest level of protection against wrongful conviction.</p><p>Ultimately, the legislative programme confirms one thing: the Government&#8217;s purpose is separation.

By working constructively through stages 2 and 3, we have made improvements in various areas and limited potential damage in others. However, once the Scottish Government had railroaded through the bill at stage 1&#8212;let us not forget that it secured the support of no party in the Parliament save the Scottish National Party&#8212;the die was cast. Even an avalanche of amendments&#8212;we have debated about 115 of them at stage 3&#8212;has been insufficient.</p><p>Despite what we have heard from the cabinet secretary and some of his colleagues, that does not mean that a vote against the bill constitutes disagreement on the broad policy objectives&#8212;it does not. I firmly believe that widening access to our universities is essential to ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to fulfil their potential. Likewise, improving the governance and accountability of our colleges and universities is an issue on which consensus reigns.</p><p>The ambition to deliver high-quality further and higher education to students of all ages in all parts of the country&#8212;and indeed beyond&#8212;is shared by members on all sides of the chamber. Although&#8212;as Stewart Maxwell said&#8212;we can point to excellence in our colleges and universities now, that does not mean that improvements are not necessary or not possible.</p><p>We appear to agree on the policy objectives, but we do not agree on the means by which to achieve them. As I said at stage 1, we as a Parliament should seek to legislate only when necessary, or when alternatives to legislation do not exist or would not deliver the outcomes that we seek to achieve.</p><p>All too often, we seem happier passing laws than checking subsequently to find out whether those laws are doing what they were intended to do. That is perhaps not surprising, as it is always comforting to point to a new piece of statute when we are asked what we, as politicians, have done to address a particular problem.</p><p>The SNP managed&#8212;by using its majority, against the wishes of every other party in the chamber&#8212;to push the bill through at stage 1, thereby ensuring that there would be legislation. However, the case for a legislative approach remains unconvincing, and the legislation seems to be more a comfort blanket for ministers than anything else.</p><p>College regionalisation, for example, is already well under way, accelerating a process that has been on-going for years. Indeed, the Education and Culture Committee approved the closure and transfer of another half-dozen colleges at its meeting yesterday.</p><p>I accept that improvements have been made to the bill since stage 1, but the case for using the legislation itself to deliver the changes has not been made. Similarly, the case for legislation on widening access seems&#8212;notwithstanding Marco Biagi&#8217;s thoughtful comments&#8212;to be more symbolic than anything else.</p><p>Progress in that area has been far too slow, and NUS Scotland has argued that</p><p>&#8220;it is important to create a defined link between the public funding universities receive, and the public benefit they provide.&#8221;</p><p>That may be the case, but it is not a justification for legislation. The minimum income guarantee will help, and fair access agreements are now in place. Such agreements can, along with the funding levers that ministers have at their disposal, help to ensure that access becomes core to the mission of our universities.</p><p>I welcome the recognition that a broader definition is needed for underrepresented groups, including those with learning difficulties, but I believe that fair access agreements that are linked to funding carrots and sticks could achieve the same ends.</p><p>I entirely accept that improvements are needed to governance. In areas such as staff and student representation and the need for greater diversity, transparency and accountability, the way in which our universities and colleges are run is ripe for reform. Again, however, I question whether that requires to be underpinned by legislation. Having robust codes of good governance&#8212;adherence to which would be mandatory for securing public funding&#8212;seems as effective an approach and would run less of a risk of compromising the responsible autonomy that is the hallmark of the world&#8217;s most successful universities.</p><p>Our colleges and universities are critical to our success as a nation&#8212;economically, socially and culturally. It is right that we focus on helping to ensure that they are well run, accountable and diverse in their make-up in every sense, and that they provide opportunities for all to fulfil their potential.

I also add my thanks to Chest Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland, to the British Heart Foundation for its briefing, and to the Scottish heart failure nurse forum for circulating its review to members.</p><p>The review&#8217;s findings confirm that the service delivery model varies across the country, reflecting different geographic considerations and resource availability. However, it underscores that, in too many instances, boards are failing to deliver what is expected and required of them. Unlike Jackie Baillie and Dave Thompson, I can take absolutely no satisfaction from the situation in my board area, as I note that I am the member for the only board area&#8212;Orkney&#8212;where there is no specialist heart failure nurse.</p><p>I commend Bill Braby and the local heart support group in Orkney for raising the issue with me over recent months, and for their efforts in prosecuting the case for the reinstatement of a heart failure nurse in Orkney. As others have said, Dave Thompson set out very well the explanation behind the differences between heart failure, heart attacks and other cardiac conditions, as well as the increase in the prevalence against the backdrop of a reduction in the whole-time equivalents of heart failure diseases. That is a cause of concern for all of us, irrespective of how our boards are performing.</p><p>Specialist heart failure nurses can help patients to develop self-management strategies, as Nanette Milne said, so it is not surprising that the nurses are popular with patients and their families. Dennis Robertson talked about the importance of improved patient care. Specialist nurses also enable patients to be more independent and less isolated. In Orkney, as in many rural areas, that is exceptionally important.</p><p>Specialist nurses reduce unplanned hospital admissions and the length of hospital stays. In Orkney, where many patients must travel off island, that reduces transport costs and limits the number of arduous journeys that patients must undertake. Therefore, I was hugely concerned to hear that the post in Orkney ceased to exist after British Heart Foundation funding ended in 2010.</p><p>I acknowledge the excellent work of the cardiac specialist nurse in Orkney&#8212;Amanda Manson does phenomenally good work. I also acknowledge the work of the heart failure liaison service. As a result of the efforts of Bill Braby and his colleagues, and as a result of discussions with NHS Orkney, progress of sorts has been made in recent months. More administrative support has been put in, to allow Amanda Manson and her colleagues to focus on front-line delivery, and I understand that there is recruitment of a consulting GP with expertise in cardiology, although the post will not come into effect until October.</p><p>However, questions remain. What procedures will be able to take place in Orkney as a result of the recruitment of the cardiology specialist? What is happening in relation to replacing the retired cardiology lead in Orkney? There remains a lack of resilience in the liaison and cardiology services in relation to covering illness and holidays. All that points to the continuing need for a specialist heart failure nurse in Orkney.</p><p>Dave Thompson talked about the findings of the Public Audit Committee. I was unaware of Derek Feeley&#8217;s remarks in December about the establishment of a heart failure short-life working group. Like Dave Thompson, I very much hope that the group has met&#8212;indeed, I expect that it will have done so, if the deadline was spring 2013. I encourage the minister to ensure that the group considers how the specific issues that relate to Orkney might be addressed.</p><p>I congratulate Dave Thompson on securing the debate, and I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694546", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Specialist Heart Failure Nurse Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Dave Thompson on his motion and on securing the debate.

It has powered homes, businesses and our economy, and has provided a welcome boon to the Highlands, as others have said. Like the minister, I hope that that will be improved on in the coming decades across the Highlands and Islands with the development of a wider range of renewables technologies, including wave and tidal energy technologies in my constituency.</p><p>What of the future for hydro power? As the most mature of the renewables technologies, there is perhaps a risk, or a public misconception, that hydro technology has run its course and that the opportunities for developing new projects have been exhausted. As we have already heard, that is far from being the case. Advances in technology are opening up new opportunities&#8212;from large to relatively small&#8212;but there is a range of challenges in taking forward those opportunities. I argue that it is not sensible to think that all the potential opportunities could or should be taken forward. I will come to some of the issues that the sector faces shortly.</p><p>Like Rob Gibson, I think that it is worth acknowledging that, if we are to have a balanced energy mix with a proper and healthy technology mix as part of the policy, we will need to go beyond 12 per cent of our electricity needs being met by hydro, as is currently the case. We must consider how we can capture more of our hydro potential, including the estimated 1.2GW of smaller-scale hydro power, much of which would be ideally suited to community owned and run initiatives. Claire Baker made a number of very helpful points about the benefits of such projects.</p><p>I turn to some of the obstacles that we face in trying to deliver our considerable potential in hydro energy. I am grateful to the various organisations that supplied briefings for the debate, including Scottish Renewables and RWE. Scottish Renewables might have reflected a little more on the issues for which we have responsibility in Parliament, but it set out the wider context, which is helpful.</p><p>The concerns about support mechanisms and delays in provision of grid infrastructure are clearly not new; they reflect similar anxieties that are felt across the renewables sector. However, as I have done in previous debates, I urge a little caution on those who seek to make the heroic leap in arguing that those concerns make the case for breaking up the United Kingdom. What Scottish Renewables and its members, including those in the hydro sector, are arguing is that delays in taking decisions must be minimised, support mechanisms need to be fully thought through, and the necessary infrastructure must be put in place in a timely fashion. Reform of the current market regime must properly reflect Scottish interests, of course, but nowhere is it suggested that segmenting the market is sensible, that tapping our hydro potential requires wholesale transfer of powers, or that stepping outside the electricity market reform process is either realistic or desirable.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693928", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hydro Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Margaret McDougall rightly said, we have already had a historical tour de force.

That is not unreasonable, although it must always be done in a managed and transparent fashion so that shocks to the system do not undermine public or investor confidence.

Although access to funding, grid constraints or other issues might undermine them, they could still be taken into account when degression levels are set. Degression has always been seen as part of the FIT process, but the way in which it interacts with hydro appears to be problematic. I would welcome some comment from the minister on the discussions that he has had with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, and I would be happy to help by supporting such representations, if I can.</p><p>No debate on renewables would be complete without a reference to the grid. Scottish Renewables is right to call for network operators to make the case for strategic investment, for spare grid capacity to be released where possible, and for more active network-management solutions to be explored. Over the years, the RPZ&#8212;the registered power zone&#8212;in Orkney has proved to be successful in allowing developments to connect, but we should be clear: those are temporary fixes, which should not be seen as a reason to put off indefinitely making the investment that is necessary to allow our hydro and other renewables potential to be fully realised.</p><p>As RWE makes clear, the Scottish Government must play its part, too. It confirms that business rate increases in 2013 could make some small-scale projects economically unviable. There also seems to be some confusion over the full implications of recent statements and policy with regard to wild land. It is essential that we have the right projects in the right places, but I understand that impacts on wild land already form part of environmental impact assessments.

Amid an array of what I understand will be more than 100 arts and cultural events in different parts of the country that will celebrate the contribution that refugees make to the communities that have welcomed them in, it is perhaps inevitable that our deliberations might seem a little drab by comparison.</p><p>Nevertheless, we should not be disheartened or deterred. We have a contribution to make, not least in raising public awareness of and broadening people&#8217;s horizons on the contribution that refugees make. As many members have mentioned, we, too, can highlight the challenges that refugees face, particularly those at the younger end of the age spectrum. In that regard, I welcome the debate and I am happy to confirm the Scottish Liberal Democrats&#8217; support for the minister&#8217;s motion. I thank Aberlour and the Scottish Refugee Council for their excellent briefings, the contribution that they and others make to the guardianship service and their wider support for refugees and asylum seekers.</p><p>We may wish that it were otherwise, but there is no getting away from the fact that forced migration is an unpleasant fact of life and, what is most distressing, that that is the case for many children and young people in different parts of the world. War and conflict are an all-too-frequent catalyst. One need only consider the appalling events unfolding in Syria to see the effect that they can have. That civil conflict has displaced more than any other, and no end is in sight.</p><p>People are forced to flee their homes and countries for many reasons, including famine, disease and persecution. Meanwhile, displacement because of human trafficking is on the increase. As Graeme Pearson articulated in an excellent speech, that growing threat entraps children and young people, as it does adults.</p><p>The UNHCR estimates that about half the 34.5&#160;million people who are of concern worldwide are children. Aberlour and the SRC explain that few of those children who arrive in the west are separated from their parents and that a small proportion of them end up in the UK. Those who arrive in this country have a right to be treated with humanity, dignity and compassion. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are often exceptionally vulnerable, as Malcolm Chisholm, Christina McKelvie and others have explained, and they need more tailored and specialised support. I therefore very much welcome the Scottish guardianship service pilot and the funding that Scottish ministers have made available to prolong the initiative for three more years.</p><p>Before I turn to the scheme&#8217;s details, it is important to acknowledge the decision that the UK coalition Government took to end child detention. The experience of the children who were incarcerated at Dungavel shamed us all. The campaign to end that practice rightly commanded support across the political parties in the Parliament and wider society. I share the relief at the ending of such detention, but it is a chapter in our history that we can only reflect on with deep regret. It is also worth recognising the moves that have been made to end deportations of people who could be threatened in their home countries because of their sexuality.</p><p>Like other members, I believe that further changes to immigration and asylum policy are necessary. I am alarmed at how the debate is conducted and heavily politicised. Some of that is reflected in the conclusions of the Joint Committee on Human Rights from earlier this week, to which other members have referred. However, I am pleased that progressive steps have at least been taken in the two areas that I mentioned.</p><p>I urge caution to members, such as John Mason, Christina McKelvie and Annabelle Ewing, who are tempted to argue that we should break up the UK so that we can establish our own approach to immigration and asylum. The greater the disparity between the regimes north and south of the border, the more onerous the border controls would inevitably be and the more rigorously they would be enforced across the board and not just for those seeking asylum.

The guardians have helped those vulnerable young people to navigate the often highly confusing and stressful complexities of the asylum and welfare processes and have improved their understanding of and engagement with those processes.</p><p>As important is the fact that communications and collaboration between all those involved appear to have improved. That has resulted in, among other things, Home Office case owners having better-quality information on which to base their decisions&#8212;Annabelle Ewing made that point.</p><p>The evaluation report into the pilot phase of the scheme suggests that guardianship has helped to lift the overall quality of the service, although it is acknowledged that increased success rates for asylum applications partly reflect the applicants&#8217; nationalities. The service has also allowed the young people involved to build a capacity to deal with the events, many of which are very traumatic, that are taking place in their lives. There are positives to take from the scheme, although Aberlour and the SRC point to areas where further work and improvement are necessary&#8212;they include dealing with trafficked children and supporting those whose case for protection has been refused.</p><p>There are lessons for other parts of the UK. A similar scheme is being considered for Northern Ireland. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has recommended that the UK Government should consider establishing pilots in England and Wales. I agree with Malcolm Chisholm that that seems sensible, although it might not be straightforward, as Professor Kohli&#8212;one of the evaluators of the Scottish scheme&#8212;has acknowledged.</p><p>Scotland receives relatively few unaccompanied asylum-seeking children; the average is three per month, in comparison with 46 in London. With smaller case loads, guardians can spend the additional time that is necessary to engage with the young people and deliver the welfare and support outcomes that we are seeing. Replicating that elsewhere would present bigger challenges.

However, the way in which the cabinet secretary has chosen to achieve it seems to be regressive and works against some of the objectives of widening access.

However, I observe that, when he introduced the air discount scheme as the Minister for Transport, he made it clear that it needed to be affordable and would apply across the network rather than have routes that he felt were expedient being cherry picked.</p><p>On the fallout from the problems that have been experienced by MV Hamnavoe, I note that the minister has been persuaded to downgrade his diagnosis from &#8220;catastrophic engine failure&#8221; to &#8220;mechanical failure&#8221; since I last raised the matter with him in Parliament.</p><p>As I said previously, lessons need to be learned.

The scale of the cut in sailings, which is sanctioned by the Government&#8217;s contract, is unacceptable, and it works against the efforts of people in the tourism sector in Orkney to extend the shoulders of the season. As Rhoda Grant pointed out, the Orkney folk festival is starting.

That does not necessarily mean stuff on a huge budget; it is about giving the right people the right opportunities to sell the message.</p><p>I accept the point about current science and the work that is done now, and I make a plea for us to give wider acknowledgement to some of our historic personalities and draw on some of the traditions that Scotland has. Remarkable people are doing remarkable things, and we have an excellent and captivating story to tell.</p><p>In that regard, I cite Dr John Rae, the greatest Arctic explorer of all and an Orcadian to boot. Amundsen&#8217;s exploration in Arctic Canada drew enormously on what he described as the incalculable value of the work that was done by Dr Rae. Any understanding of science, medicine or the earth sciences will draw on the work that was done by Dr John Rae. Orkney museum is heavily involved in promoting that, but in his bicentenary year, there does not seem to be any sign that Scotland as a whole is highlighting Dr Rae with any degree of pride.</p><p>I know that James Clerk Maxwell has been the subject of a debate in the Parliament. The 150th anniversary of his great paper on electromagnetism and light will be in 2015. There is a great focus on events that are coming up in 2014, but I rather suspect that they are likely to generate more heat than light. What better antidote than to look to 2015 and the work of James Clerk Maxwell? I think that the idea of designating that year the international year of light has already gained some support in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p><p>There are a number of things that we are doing reasonably well in our public engagement, but it is clear from the contributions that we have heard that there is a lot more that we can and should do.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electrical Safety in the Private Rented Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.

I should stress that it was not always thus, as I was present for both the EMR debates to which the minister referred, including the debate in January 2011 that took place at the start of the UK Government&#8217;s consultation.</p><p>Much has happened since then, but the minister is right to suggest that important questions remain unanswered. Given the scale of what the UK Government is seeking to achieve and the range of&#8212;often competing&#8212;interests that need to be balanced, that is perhaps not wholly surprising, but I understand and share the impatience for greater clarity in a number of key areas, not least of which is the shape and extent of future support for the technologies in which Scotland enjoys a natural advantage.</p><p>In that first debate on EMR, I stressed how vital it is that both Scotland&#8217;s Governments work collaboratively through the process, because that seems to me to be the only way of ensuring that the final reform package reflects our specific needs and interests. That was and remains very much the view of Scotland&#8217;s energy sector, which had no desire to see Scottish National Party ministers picking fights with their Westminster counterparts. I am pleased to say that Fergus Ewing heeded that message and has engaged methodically and constructively over the past two years, so he is to be congratulated on that. I am confident that such an approach will serve Scotland&#8217;s interests.</p><p>Nowhere has that approach been more in evidence than in the pursuit of a solution to the grid and charging issues that threaten to hold back development of renewables in our islands&#8212;including the Orkney islands, which I represent. I want to spend a little time on that subject, on which I believe reform is urgently needed and for which I expect the Energy Bill will now deliver a solution.</p><p>The independent analysis that was commissioned by the joint working group that was set up by both Governments underscores the opportunities and barriers to unlocking the renewables potential of our islands, and the importance of doing so if we are to meet our renewables and climate change targets. The report makes clear the case for reform and the need to change current policy. Of course, that policy was inherited from the previous Labour Government&#8212;which makes Rhoda Grant&#8217;s amendment a little hard to fathom&#8212;but I welcome the agreement that change is needed and the independent evidence base that now underpins that. With longer-term job-creating potential estimated at 4,500 jobs in Orkney and at almost 11,000 jobs across all three main island groups, we must grab that prize with both hands.</p><p>As I have said in previous debates, there are different options for bringing down costs for connecting isles-based developments. That could be done either through an amended section 185 order&#8212;under the Energy Act 2004&#8212;to cap the cost of charges, or through providing additional island support via the strike-price setting process. Both options have strengths and weaknesses and both seem to me to be workable, so the best one should now be pursued&#8212;although I note that the minister seems to prefer the latter.</p><p>Of course, transmission charges are only part of the mix; the need to address delays in installing and upgrading grid infrastructure must also be a priority. In that regard, I strongly support the call from Scottish Renewables for both Scotland&#8217;s Governments to look at drawing down European Investment Bank funding to help to promote grid investment at a lower cost. I acknowledge Mr Ewing&#8217;s role in maintaining momentum on that issue, which is of critical importance to all our islands&#8212;not just the Western Isles, as was unfortunately suggested in the Scottish Government&#8217;s press release back in February&#8212;but it is also right to recognise the enormous contribution of my Liberal Democrat colleague, Ed Davey. The case for reform is well understood and widely supported in Scotland, but we should not underestimate the institutional, political and industry opposition to making concessions to our islands. Ed Davey is to be commended for the tenacity with which he has pursued a solution in the face of that opposition.</p><p>I am not surprised to see collaboration&#8212;and, indeed, historic concordats&#8212;to the fore in the Government&#8217;s motion, which I am happy to support along with the amendment in Murdo Fraser&#8217;s name. I see that the motion has also been signed by Mr Swinney, who was doubtless keen to cast an eye over it in case Mr Ewing had slipped in a rogue personal view. However, I dare say that, when Mr Ewing read in the Business Bulletin this morning that Mr Swinney and Mr Mackay were apparently backing an effective nuclear deterrent for Scotland, he must have wondered whether the trend in ministers declaring personal views was spreading.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I start by reiterating my apology to you, to members and to the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism for my absence from general questions this morning.

Earlier in the debate, I was struck that some of the issues that we discussed in yesterday&#8217;s debate on early learning and childcare are relevant to what we are discussing today. That is not because such measures offer quick fixes but because the decisions that we take on that now will have an impact in due course on the contribution that young people can and will make in supporting Scotland&#8217;s economy in the longer term.</p><p>On the substance of today&#8217;s debate, it is right for the Government to highlight the drop in the youth unemployment figures in the most recent labour force study. Likewise, Mr Macintosh is right to enter a few caveats and health warnings, although I do not detect a great deal of complacency about the figures. There is also a need to acknowledge that the long-term unemployed figure is stubbornly going in the wrong direction. As Liz Smith said, all of us agree that the youth unemployment figures are still too high.</p><p>The reasons why progress is being made are many and various. Many of them relate to the targeted interventions that have been mentioned and which are in the motion but, as Ken Macintosh said, there are other wider factors. The approach absolutely must involve employers offering job training and work experience opportunities. The Scottish Government can take satisfaction from the way in which the modern apprenticeships programme is working, although it would be interesting to know the breakdown for modern apprenticeships in the private, public and third sectors.</p><p>The certificate of work readiness looks like a positive initiative and seems to offer the opportunity for individuals to demonstrate their potential while gaining experience. That chimes with something that the cross-party group on colleges and universities heard at lunch time about practice-based learning. Professor Stonehouse, the dean of Edinburgh Napier University business school, illustrated the point by asking us to imagine what it would be like if we went to college or university without being able to swim and were learning to swim through a class-based course that set out the key components that are necessary to swim.

However, in the current economic circumstances, we need to recognise that it is in nobody&#8217;s interests for employers to shed workers or not take on people in apprenticeship and training roles simply because finances are tight.</p><p>I take exception to the Government&#8217;s slightly churlish attempt in the motion to ignore the UK Government&#8217;s role. The motion rightly draws attention to the contribution of the Scottish Government, EU funding and local councils, but it makes no reference whatever to the UK Government&#8217;s youth contract. That is unfortunate, because there is &#163;1 billion of investment to help young unemployed people in the 18 to 24-year-old category to get a foot on the ladder.</p><p>That scheme, which is targeted at the longer-term unemployed, provides wage incentives to allow employers to claim up to &#163;2,275 to help to cover costs such as national insurance and to fund extra training and supervision. That dovetails well with many initiatives by the Scottish Government and others. As I said in an intervention earlier, the scheme has similarities to the approach in Germany, which, as various members have acknowledged, has a particularly good track record in the area.</p><p>I have touched on those who are furthest from the job market in previous debates. I appreciate that they include a wide number of different groups&#8212;Mark McDonald reflected on that well in his thoughtful speech&#8212;but the figures that we have are not encouraging.</p><p>I note that Barnardo&#8217;s, for example, says that 36 per cent of looked-after children are still looking for employment six months after leaving school. That is almost four times the average for school leavers as a whole. The figures for further education are similarly poor.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s argues strongly for third sector involvement at a local level in initiatives such as opportunities for all and youth action plans. It also points to</p><p>&#8220;a serious gap in long term, nurturing and supportive provision for care leavers&#8221;.</p><p>Clearly, work is under way and there are programmes that are working well, but we should not lose sight of the specific needs of care leavers and the more intensive engagement that they require.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I was also struck by the briefing from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which said:</p><p>&#8220;Young people are expected to work in new environments and sectors for new and changing organisations, and to do so with greater flexibility. The younger generation needs the skills relevant to a changing economy, and the Scottish Government can help to address this need by continuing to invest in youth enterprise and entrepreneurship as part of its skills strategy.&#8221;</p><p>Like Iain Gray, I was involved in earlier initiatives such as determined to succeed. They are now far better embedded in education, but the Carnegie UK Trust seemed to indicate that, although that effect is reflected well at primary and secondary levels, it is perhaps more dilute in colleges. That is surprising, given that much of the collaborative approach in energy and hospitality, about which we heard at the cross-party group at lunch time, seems to contradict the trust&#8217;s findings.</p><p>I will touch on the college cuts that Mr Macintosh&#8217;s amendment mentions. I and my party have taken a strong interest in that issue over the past couple of years. In its briefing for the debate, Colleges Scotland talks of</p><p>&#8220;a growing disparity of esteem&#8221;</p><p>that is leading to a reduction in funding. That chimes with something that Professor Stonehouse from Edinburgh Napier University talked about: the false divide between more vocational and academic streams of education. We must also recognise the impact that the cuts are having on outcomes for older learners.</p><p>The minister drew attention to the recent Economist article on the phenomenon of youth unemployment worldwide. She was right to point out that it concluded with some encouragement. The news of the recent downward trajectory of youth unemployment is part of the pattern and gives some cause for optimism, but there can be no let-up in targeted interventions, particularly practice-based learning and opportunities to develop skills in the workplace, which are delivering results.</p><p>Collaboration by both of Scotland&#8217;s Governments, our whole education sector, councils and the business community is an essential part of what the minister referred to as an all-Scotland approach. There are areas&#8212;such as college funding, support for those who are furthest from the labour market and even early learning&#8212;where more attention is needed, but I am happy to support the Government&#8217;s motion and Labour&#8217;s amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690668", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is a fair point.

Although there is also much in the Government&#8217;s amendment with which I whole-heartedly agree, the undertone there is that we should not worry our pretty little heads about anything because everything that needs to be done is somehow being done.</p><p>Mr Henry quite rightly spent some time focusing on the needs of older children and their parents, but I will focus, if I may, on the needs of two-year-olds&#8212;particularly those from more disadvantaged backgrounds&#8212;which is an issue on which the Scottish Liberal Democrats have been pretty consistent over the past couple of years. As part of the budget process, we produced costed proposals, which for his own reasons John Swinney rejected, but the mechanism that Hugh Henry has identified perhaps presents an opportunity to revisit the issue.</p><p>As every speaker has acknowledged, all the evidence shows that interventions in the very earliest years of a child&#8217;s life, even those that are made prior to birth, shape and determine the child&#8217;s development into adulthood. Let me be clear that I whole-heartedly welcome the planned extension to 600 hours of early education and childcare for three and four-year-olds. Urging the Scottish ministers to be more ambitious is not the same as condemning the action that they are taking. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have consistently argued that the proposals in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill fail to recognise that, by the age of three, any intervention is often too late.</p><p>I know that the First Minister is keen on his Nobel laureates&#8212;the more he can shake a stick at, the better&#8212;so I urge him and the Minister for Children and Young People to heed the advice of Professor James Heckman, who suggests that the highest rate of return in education is to be derived from investment in the pre-birth to three age group. That is particularly the case for children from poorer backgrounds who, by the age of three, often lag a full year behind their better-off peer group in terms of cognitive development, social skills and readiness for school. I think that the minister acknowledged that point.</p><p>The Government has pledged to extend additional support to looked-after two-year-olds and those in foster care, but as Bronwen Cohen of Children in Scotland pointed out:</p><p>&#8220;Valuable as this may be ... it is markedly less generous than what is being offered in England and Wales. England is investing in 260,000 childcare places for 40 per cent of two-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds&#8221;.</p><p>Aileen Campbell rose&#8212;</p><p>Whatever the minister says&#8212;sorry, I cannot take an intervention in a four-minute speech&#8212;that dwarfs what is planned in Scotland.</p><p>Family nurse partnerships are indeed helpful and welcome, but this is not a case of either/or. Such partnerships are also being delivered south of the border and can work very well and effectively alongside free nursery provision.</p><p>Obviously, the Scottish Government has already pushed through its budget, but I urge it to accept the need to look again at the issue and consider the mechanism that Mr Henry has identified. As others have mentioned, Mr Salmond&#8217;s willingness to meet other party leaders to discuss the issue may be a cause for optimism, but the proposed commission may be another way of delivering the cross-party working on childcare that Save the Children has advocated. The commission would also afford us the opportunity to look at the affordability, availability and flexibility of provision across Scotland&#8212;as Liz Smith, Mary Fee and others have pointed out&#8212;and reflect some of the concerns that emerged in the report, &#8220;Counting the Costs of Childcare&#8221;.</p><p>We all acknowledge that improving childcare provision is essential to improving outcomes for children, particularly for those living in poverty. There is also a direct impact on our attempts to build a strong diverse economy, which will benefit from parents being able to return to or remain in work; that point was made very well by Claire Telfer.

That would derail our efforts to meet our emissions reduction targets and undermine investor confidence in the sector as a whole.</p><p>It is a question of achieving an appropriate mix that obviously involves the oil and gas sector. We can have a debate about what that can or should be in the future, but it will undoubtedly make a significant contribution. It is a mix that has already seen the extension of the lifespan of existing nuclear plants and which involves a mix of renewable technologies, including CCS. I am delighted that we have had confirmation that Peterhead is the front runner in the CCS commercialisation funding process.</p><p>On that mix of renewables, I have a particular interest in wave and tidal technology because Orkney is at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s efforts to lead the way. Good progress has been made in the islands but things need to step up a gear. Unfortunately, delays in grid and related infrastructure and high transmission charges are holding back progress and affecting confidence. I commend Fergus Ewing for his efforts in collaborating with Ed Davey and local islands councils in seeking a resolution to that, and I hope that the consultants&#8217; report to the governmental working group can provide a key to unlocking the impasse.</p><p>We are not just talking about a mix of renewables technologies. We also need a mix of various sizes of renewables development and models of ownership, as Ken Macintosh highlighted. That can empower local communities and offer opportunities for tackling the scourge of fuel poverty in more innovative and effective ways.</p><p>I will conclude by talking about the issue of uncertainty that was highlighted by Mr Swinney and others.

Given the significance of those reforms, it is essential that we get them right, but it is also important that delays in coming to final decisions are minimised.</p><p>However, if Mr Swinney is asking us to accept that uncertainty is a bad thing&#8212;and it is&#8212;then he must accept that his plans to break up the UK are scarcely an answer to the maiden&#8217;s prayer.

There has been much talk of the prevalence of MS in Scotland. I take no pride in saying that the incidence of MS in my own constituency of Orkney is the highest anywhere in the world, at around 400 people per 100,000&#8212;a number that has doubled since the 1980s. I fully concede that in preparing for that debate, I went on a voyage of discovery about what the condition is, how individual it is&#8212;as George Adam has already indicated&#8212;and how generally misunderstood it is.</p><p>It is very timely that this evening&#8217;s debate coincides with MS week. The MS Society is to be warmly congratulated on its efforts to try to raise public awareness.</p><p>The report that has been published to coincide with MS week helps to extend our understanding of the condition and of the problems experienced by each individual with MS and their family and friends.

It is interesting to note the disparities in relation to access to medication between different parts of Scotland itself. There is a clear message that more needs to be done.</p><p>Obviously, the issue is not simply about medication; Malcolm Chisholm mentioned his imminent visit to the MS Therapy Centre in Leith. Shortly after being elected, I had the privilege of visiting the MS Therapy Centre in Kirkwall. I was struck by the commitment of the volunteer staff there who, led by Bruce Mainland, provide support for about 30 clients in Orkney.</p><p>Nanette Milne touched on the fact that the issue of isolation can often be overlooked. I would not say that isolation is an issue solely in rural areas, although perhaps the challenges in such areas are even greater. When I spoke to Bruce Mainland at the time of my visit I was struck by the problems that the centre experiences in encouraging people to engage with it in the first place.</p><p>I note from the briefing for the debate about MS therapy centres that the first centre, which was founded in Dundee in 1982, took the motto, &#8220;Self-help is our way of action&#8221;. The briefing explains that:</p><p>&#8220;Every person who uses a Centre has taken the decision to take personal charge of the management of their symptoms.&#8221;</p><p>That is a very important ethos, but it brings with it challenges in terms of getting people to engage in the first instance.</p><p>Once again, I warmly congratulate George Adam on his speech.

They highlighted many of the pitfalls, but also underscored the reasons why we are where we are.</p><p>Press regulation is an area that all of us enter with trepidation&#8212;we all attach a high regard to a free press. As elected representatives, we must recognise not only the challenge function that is provided by a free press at national level, but&#8212;as Patricia Ferguson and others have mentioned&#8212;the important role that the local and regional press and indeed, blogs and other media increasingly play in that regard. We may find those challenge functions uncomfortable, but they are crucial to a healthy democracy.</p><p>The free press has never been entirely unconstrained&#8212;it has always had constraints placed on it in order for it to act responsibly. The editors&#8217; code is a case in point; it has been amended to reflect changing demands in regard to what is needed.</p><p>Every member who has spoken so far has alluded to the fact that we cannot lose sight of the reasons why we are debating these issues. It is not just about the victims; we must also take cognisance of the issues that Lord Chief Justice Leveson and the expert panel wrestled with, and we must make proposals on how to introduce proportionate changes.</p><p>There was general agreement that the current situation is unsustainable; the editors who appeared before the Education and Culture Committee were of one voice in accepting that reform is needed. What kind of reform was the thorny issue with which we had to wrestle.</p><p>There were shrill voices on both sides of the argument, which sometimes masked a greater level of agreement than would perhaps be obvious to someone on the outside looking in. It occurred to me that it is ironic that some of the people who point to the democratic deficit of the royal charter are precisely those who argue most strenuously that MSPs and MPs should have nothing to do with regulating the press.</p><p>The Government, in conjunction with party leaders, was right&#8212;as was the committee&#8212;to ignore demands for, on the one hand, heavy-handed intervention and, on the other, a slightly revised status quo. Leveson was clear that despite his misgivings about the activity of elements of the press, the press merits one last chance&#8212;the committee soon found it necessary to ban all references to the &#8220;last-chance saloon&#8221;. What interested us, among other things, was the Irish experience, which the cabinet secretary mentioned. It appears that the threat of what might come should the new arrangements fail has led to a degree of consensus on a voluntary approach. From the evidence that we took, it appears that the voluntary approach is working.</p><p>As members said, it was not ideal that we had limited time&#8212;albeit that the circumstances that gave rise to our having limited time were understandable. As Liz Smith said, we will need to give further consideration to a number of issues. That is reflected in the motion, which sets out the right approach.</p><p>The royal charter struck the committee, as it did the Government and party leaders, as being a reasonable attempt to strike a balance that would allow self-regulation to continue, while providing incentives rather than compulsion; that would give the public and victims confidence that the approach will be enforced proportionately, fairly and, where necessary, speedily; and that would provide for statutory underpinning without political oversight.</p><p>Members have talked about checks and balances, and carrots and sticks. For the committee, as for the expert panel, it was not terribly clear where the carrots and sticks exist in Scots law. The matter requires further reflection. Whatever the value of the expert panel and Lord McCluskey&#8217;s recommendations, I do not think that any committee member was persuaded by the argument for going down the route of compulsion.</p><p>I welcome the collaborative way in which the Scottish Government has worked with the UK Government. The amendments to the royal charter to enable it to apply throughout the UK are the correct ones; that is the right approach.

Unfortunately, the entirely less digestible Advisory Audit Board meeting yesterday prevented my attending the lunch-time event, but I am delighted to participate in the debate. As Nigel Don explained, the motion was lodged in the midst of the horsemeat scandal and, as Alex Fergusson suggested, there was among all the seriousness a great deal of gallows humour. On that note, I look forward to putting a couple of quid on Findus Crispy Pancake in the Sands Hotel handicap chase during the Burray Football Club race night on Saturday.</p><p>If there is a silver lining to the scandal, it is the resultant strong demand that local butchers have seen in their businesses. In Orkney, that has been very much the case. Supermarkets will and must look again at their supply chains, which will present challenges. However, I take some comfort from the remarks of Patrick Wall, the former chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, who said:</p><p>&#8220;If there is a review of the supply chain management there is a huge opportunity for Orkney.&#8221;</p><p>He added that</p><p>&#8220;Orkney is the role model for the rest of Europe to aspire to&#8221;.</p><p>In the islands, we are fortunate to have a range of good local butchers such as E R &amp; T Craigie, W Lobban &amp; Son, Williamson&#8217;s, Flett Butchers, Donaldson&#8217;s of Orkney, D A Sinclair and the Dounby Butcher. Doubtless, I have missed one or two. However, they have had to cope not just with the consequences of the horsemeat scandal but, as the cabinet secretary will be aware, with the demise of Orkney Meat Ltd as well. The difficulties of Orkney Meat were fairly long lasting and resulted from the cost of disposing of waste off the island as well as from what was happening with the beef market generally and from the problems that were being experienced by independent butchers further south, many of which were customers of Orkney Meat. It is inconceivable that Orkney be left without a killing facility; therefore, I welcome the efforts that were made&#8212;which were helped by Richard Lochhead&#8212;to pull together a co-operative of local butchers who are maintaining the facility despite the competition between them. They recognise the need to safeguard the Orkney brand and to maintain supplies not just to the local market but beyond. I am delighted that that work has continued apace.</p><p>There are opportunities flowing from that, but there are issues to be faced in relation to capacity. Thorfinn Craigie from E R &amp; T Craigie has suggested:</p><p>&#8220;It would be impossible to kill the beasts and process them with the current capacity ... I wouldn&#8217;t like to say we could never do it, but it would need a fresh look at how we meet the capacity&#8221;.</p><p>So, with the opportunities come challenges.</p><p>In this place, we often rail against red tape and bureaucracy&#8212;not without good reason, on occasion&#8212;but the horsemeat scandal has offered a telling insight into the other side of the equation. We must always be balanced and proportionate in how we apply the rules, but no one can be in any doubt about the benefits of rigorous traceability. As Thorfinn Craigie testifies, the paperwork load may be massive but</p><p>&#8220;We have full traceability and that is crucial.&#8221;</p><p>As Alex Fergusson suggested, the problem arises in the lack of a level playing field. There is huge frustration among the local butchers in Orkney because they are under many requirements&#8212;and the implication for local farmers of even minor non-compliance can be the loss of the single farm payment&#8212;yet the horsemeat scandal has illustrated that the same rigour has not been applied at the cheaper end of the market. That must change. Professor Wall suggests that major retailers wanted the consumer recognition that comes with quality assurance schemes but were less prepared to pay suppliers the extra money to cover the costs of that. He hopes that they</p><p>&#8220;have learned a lesson that by forcing prices down, they only incentivise criminal activity.&#8221;</p><p>It is right that Parliament has had an opportunity to highlight the high-quality service that is provided by local butchers not just in Orkney or in Angus and the Mearns, but right across the country. I congratulate Nigel Don on securing the debate and commend him for his other activities this week. These have been difficult times, but I hope that there is cause for optimism looking ahead.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Butchers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Nigel Don.

However, we still seem to be happier to pass laws than we are to check, in due course, whether those laws are doing what was intended of them. It is not difficult to understand why that is: decreeing in law that something should or should not happen has its attractions. When we are challenged on what we have done to address a particular problem, it can feel reassuring to be able to point to new legislation.

The policy should be driven by a focus on delivering the best education for learners of all ages and for the communities in which they live. It is unclear why Mr Russell feels the need to give the college sector such a hefty statutory kick up the backside.</p><p>The fact that Mr Russell is seeking powers to review course content and provision across a region seems to undermine the argument for having strategic regional boards, and offers the prospect of ministerial meddling on an unprecedented scale. His seeking expanded hiring and firing powers reinforces that impression.</p><p>On access, progress is being made, albeit that it is being made from a low base and is not nearly fast enough. The minimum income guarantee will help, as I am sure Margo MacDonald acknowledges, and fair access agreements are in place. Such agreements, along with the funding levers that ministers have at their disposal, can help to ensure that access becomes core to the mission of our universities. Indeed, that seems to be explicit in NUS Scotland&#8217;s call for</p><p>&#8220;a defined link between the public funding universities receive, and the public benefit they provide.&#8221;</p><p>Given that the Government has made it clear that it does not envisage using the financial penalties that legislative provision would offer, it is difficult at this stage to see what such provision would add.</p><p>In passing, I pay tribute to the success of the Open University, which during the past 10 years has managed to double the number of students coming to it from poorer backgrounds. The OU, in which my mother was formerly a tutor, makes the fair point that using the Scottish index of multiple deprivation risks excluding many people on lower incomes who live in less densely populated or rural areas.</p><p>On a similar theme, the Scottish children&#8217;s services coalition argues that efforts to widen access should be broadened to include children with complex needs, including learning difficulties. The committee was sympathetic to that case, although again it is debatable whether that could not be achieved through fair access agreements and targeted funding.</p><p>I appreciate that there are other issues, but I will finish on governance and section 2 of the bill. In his report, Professor von Prondzynski accepted that there has been no &#8220;systemic governance problem&#8221; in our universities. Nevertheless, the committee heard sufficient evidence of areas in which improvement should be made&#8212;not least in making governing bodies more representative. Evidence also suggests that, internationally, the best-performing universities are those that have greatest autonomy. I accept that, in using their responsible autonomy, universities must now respond to the legitimate concerns that have been raised.</p><p>The difficulty is one of timing. A code of good governance is currently being developed and may yet address the concerns that have been raised. If it does not, there would still be time to act, notwithstanding that conditions of grant and outcome agreements also remain persuasive tools that are available to ministers and the funding council.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats fully support the objectives that the cabinet secretary is pursuing. Widening access, improving the accountability of our universities and colleges and delivering the highest quality of education are sensible goals that require that changes be made. The question is whether those changes can only be delivered, or are best delivered, through the legislative measures that the cabinet secretary has proposed. Serious doubts remain on that point. Mr Russell sees himself as a great reformer, of course&#8212;that has led him to a spot of bother in the past&#8212;but I hope that he recognises the challenge that he faces in convincing Parliament, and not only his party, that his approach to achieving entirely legitimate objectives is the right one.</p><p>Given the Government&#8217;s majority, the bill will be passed at stage 1, but the task that we face at stage 2 to ensure that we do good and avoid doing harm should not be underestimated by anyone.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will do so later, if I can.

However, in her motion and in her generally consensual opening remarks, Aileen Campbell has made it quite clear that that remains an aspiration, which I know is shared by members across the chamber. There may be disagreement both about how far we are from reaching nirvana and about the best way of getting there, but there is no disagreement at all that we should set that as a goal, nor that we need concerted collaborative action to achieve it, as the minister suggested.</p><p>I should also make it clear that we are working from a decent foundation. In highlighting areas in which we are falling short, we should not lose sight of the great strengths that we have. Indeed, I note with pride, though less surprise, that Orkney consistently comes top in quality of life assessments.</p><p>Making Scotland the best place to grow up is an aspiration&#8212;we all accept that it remains a work in progress. I want to focus my remarks on two issues on which we are falling short. The shortcomings need urgent attention but, most important, that can be done by this Government in this Parliament using the current powers that we have at our disposal.</p><p>I start by highlighting the issue of nursery provision and childcare, which is the focus of my amendment. A year ago, I led a Liberal Democrat debate on that issue, making the case for why the Government needed to be more ambitious. All the evidence shows that it is the earliest years of a child&#8217;s life&#8212;even the interventions made prior to birth&#8212;that shape and determine their development into adulthood. Get it wrong at that stage of a child&#8217;s life, and the consequences can be largely irreversible, and the costs&#8212;social and economic&#8212;exceptionally high. Get it right, on the other hand, and the benefits are locked in and long term.</p><p>I unequivocally welcome the steps that are being taken to extend to 600 hours pre-school nursery provision for all three and four-year-olds. However, as Scottish Liberal Democrats have consistently argued&#8212;indeed, we argued this throughout the recent budget process&#8212;that fails to recognise that, by the age of three, it is often too late. Nobel laureate Professor James Heckman argues that the highest return in education is derived from the investment in the pre-birth to age three group. By the age of three, children in poverty are lagging a full year behind their better-off peer group with regards to cognitive development, social skills and readiness for school.</p><p>The Government, of course, has pledged additional support to looked-after two year-olds and those in foster care. However, as Bronwen Cohen of Children in Scotland recently pointed out, although valuable</p><p>&#8220;it is markedly less generous than what is being offered in England and Wales.&#8221;</p><p>Thanks to Liberal Democrats, a &#163;380 million investment is being made in 260,000 childcare places for 40 per cent of two-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds south of the border.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scottish National Party ministers have a tendency to assert all manner of things, and there was a concern that a debate on &#8220;Scotland&#8212;the best place to grow up&#8221; would be just the latest such assertion.

The SNP has pushed through its budget, but I plan to return to that issue during the scrutiny of the children and young people&#8217;s bill.</p><p>The other issue that I want to touch on relates to those who find themselves looked after or in care. All of us acknowledge that, despite the efforts of successive Administrations and the collective and herculean efforts of those working in the field, the outcomes for far too many looked-after children and young people remain unacceptably poor. The reasons are complex; identifying solutions is not straightforward. However, I welcome the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s focus on that matter.</p><p>I want to reflect on one aspect of how we, as a country, discharge our corporate parenting responsibility. The consultation on the bill defined corporate parenting as</p><p>&#8220;the collective responsibility of all public bodies to provide the best possible care and protection for looked-after children and to act in the same way as a birth parent would.&#8221;</p><p>That is entirely reasonable. However, imagine the reaction if a birth parent were to present their child on their 16th birthday&#8212;on the eve of school exams, perhaps&#8212;with a bin liner full of their clothes and an instruction to get off to the local homeless shelter or bed and breakfast. I can think of few birth parents who would be unable to tell where all their children were within a year of them leaving home. It is inconceivable that, if one of their children were to die within a year of leaving home, any birth parent would not seek answers about why that tragedy had happened. However, that appears to be the plight for many care leavers in Scotland, who are often expected to leave care at 16&#8212;almost eight years earlier than the average age of a young person leaving the family home.</p><p>Aberlour insists that we need to guarantee that young care leavers receive after-care support into their mid-20s. Barnardo&#8217;s calls for a systematic process for investigating deaths of young care leavers, which is what would happen were they in care. Both can be achieved through the proposed children and young people bill; both would help to make Scotland at least a better place to grow up for young people.</p><p>There are many issues on which I have not touched, although I may have a chance to address them in my closing remarks. Meantime, I again welcome the debate. I support the call for partnership action to deliver our shared aspirations and I hope that we might be able to put aside our constitutional differences long enough to help to make that happen.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-05934.1, to leave out from &#8220;welcomes&#8221; to &#8220;change&#8221; and insert:</p><p>&#8220;; considers that the evidence shows that investment in the under-3s gives the biggest return and the best chance of reducing the attainment gap and believes that free early education should be extended to 40% of two-year-olds, focussing on children from deprived backgrounds, to give them the best start in life&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My response is that the minister has taken the mickey.

In my own remarks I touched on nursery provision and the support that we provide to those leaving the care system, and I will return to those issues shortly.</p><p>First, let me reflect on some of the points that have been made by members during the debate. Understandably, a key theme was poverty and the impact that it can have on the life chances and experiences of children and young people in Scotland. That is self-evidently the case. A number of members noted the decrease in the rate of child poverty in recent times and, although Bob Doris will take satisfaction from knowing that I did not agree with an awful lot of what he said, his observation on having a competitive race to see who can improve the situation the fastest is a salient one.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm and others referred to the parenting strategy, which is an important strategy that the Government is taking forward. It requires a delicate balance between focusing on early intervention and the support that we provide, and emphasising individual and collective responsibilities.</p><p>Liz Smith and a couple of other members referred to the voluntary sector&#8217;s importance. The minister intervened to make the point about a more joined-up policy approach there, which is fair. However, one of the themes that are coming through the evidence that the Education and Culture Committee is taking is that there is a need for the voluntary sector to be more involved in strategic commissioning. I hope that the Government will take that on board.</p><p>The Tory amendment makes a helpful point about the importance of health visitors. I might have a reservation that the amendment glosses over the importance of a joined-up approach from the social, education and health frameworks, but there are important points in it.</p><p>I do not think that it was fair of Jamie Hepburn to suggest that the Labour amendment implies that no advances have been made. Each of the Labour speakers has been prepared to acknowledge where progress has been made, while laying emphasis on where we all believe that further progress is needed.</p><p>In both those amendments and, indeed, the Liberal Democrat amendment, there is a focus and emphasis on early intervention. Adam Ingram, in absentia, has been given some credit for his efforts in developing a collaborative and integrated approach, although we should not treat 2007 as somehow being year zero.</p><p>On the Liberal Democrat amendment, as I pointed out earlier, all the evidence suggests that by the age of three children in poverty lag a full year behind their better-off peers. That gap is rarely closed, which is why Scottish Liberal Democrats&#8212;with the support of members across the chamber&#8212;have long argued that Scottish ministers should look to extend free nursery provision to two-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds in Scotland. I appreciate that the fact that the coalition Government is making that provision to 40 per cent of two-year-olds south of the border is inconvenient to the Scottish Government&#8217;s narrative, and I recognise that family nurse partnerships provide valuable support to many of those families, but it should not be a question of either/or. I hope that the Government will rethink its opposition and use the children and young people bill as an opportunity to extend such provision to two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>Another area in which I have already highlighted that the Government&#8217;s bill can make a difference is the support that is provided to care leavers. None of us would dare suggest that, as things stand, Scotland comes close to being the best place to grow up for many of our children and young people. The outcomes for that group remain desperately poor: only around 2.5 per cent of care leavers make it through tertiary education and 25 per cent of the prison population has been through the care system at one time or another. Tackling that scandalous situation will require many things, including improvements in the way in which children and young people come into the care system in the first instance, which the Education and Culture Committee is currently looking at.</p><p>At the other end, we need to provide better support for those who leave the care system. As Aberlour Child Care Trust and Barnardo&#8217;s point out, present arrangements fall significantly short of what would be expected of birth parents. That is not the fault of any individual or Government, but we all need to face up to it. It is not acceptable, in terms of our corporate parenting role.</p><p>There is agreement on the aspiration to make Scotland the best place to grow up. There is agreement, too, on many of the areas where we need improvement. I hope that the consensus that has just about survived this afternoon&#8217;s constitutional bickering will help us achieve it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry, but I am not going to give way.

I look forward to hearing the experiences of and contributions from colleagues across the chamber. I thank them in advance, as well as those who signed the motion and allowed the debate to take place.</p><p>Thirdly, I am keen to put on record my admiration of and gratitude for the work that is being done by a host of individuals and organisations in the field, from health professionals and researchers through to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, volunteers and support groups across the country. Without their efforts, the situation that MS sufferers in Scotland would face would be unimaginably bleaker.</p><p>It would be nice to think that, along the way, we might also be able to restore the tarnished reputation of the Vikings, whom certain tabloids have accused of being responsible for the high incidence of MS that is found in Orkney, my colleague Tavish Scott&#8217;s Shetland Islands constituency, and other parts of the north. That seems unfair, and more important, it is not supported by growing research evidence.</p><p>However, that same research, which was carried out by teams at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen, makes alarming reading for those in the northern isles. In a report that was published last year by Elizabeth Visser, Katie Wilde and James Wilson&#8212;who is an Orcadian&#8212;the incidence of MS in Orkney was found to have almost doubled since the 1980s, to 402 per 100,000. For women in Orkney, the rate of diagnosis is running at an astonishing one in 170. Being world leaders in neolithic archaeology, marine renewables or bird and sea-life populations is a source of great pride for many of my constituents, but knowing that the islands that I represent boast the highest rate of MS anywhere on the planet is simply depressing.</p><p>If it is not all the fault of our Viking ancestors, what are the reasons for the dramatic concentration of MS sufferers in Orkney, Shetland and other parts of the north of Scotland? At this stage, a combination of genetics and environment appears to be the most credible answer, although, as Dr Wilson explained:</p><p>&#8220;These findings may reflect improved diagnostic methods, improved survival or rising incidence.&#8221;</p><p>Despite the uncertainty and the need for further research, vitamin D deficiency appears to be a determining factor. It has long been acknowledged that MS is increasingly common among populations the further away from the equator they are. Indeed, although we have enjoyed some uncommonly sunny weather of late, visitors rarely head to the northern isles in search of a tan, although few who come to them leave disappointed or without a ruddier complexion than the one that they arrived with.</p><p>The disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, and interrupts signals between the brain and the body. It is incurable, although treatment can be effective in delaying symptoms.</p><p>Like the causes, the symptoms can be hard to pin down. They can include intense pain, mobility and co-ordination problems, severe depression, fatigue, incontinence and loss of vision. For some people, there are periods of relapse and remission. For others, the pattern is one of progressive deterioration. That variety in the form that the disease can take often makes life more complicated for sufferers and those around them. People often assume that sufferers will be wheelchair bound or very old, yet diagnosis invariably takes place between the ages of 20 and 40. Many of the symptoms are invisible, and they can come and go.</p><p>Supporting those with a diagnosis is not straightforward, either. Angela Monteith, a constituent who has been helping fellow sufferers for many years both directly and through her roles with the MS Society, has pointed out that people who have just been diagnosed want to know what to expect. That is difficult, because the disease is never the same for everyone and, post diagnosis, it is almost impossible to predict the future.</p><p>What is being done to help those who are affected? As the title of the debate suggests, the picture nationwide is patchy, and unacceptably so. In 2009, clinical standards were published, detailing the quality of services that someone with a neurological condition should receive. There is a standard for MS, but a peer review in 2012 demonstrated that, in many instances, the standards remain unmet.</p><p>Rather than focusing on where there are failings, it is perhaps more constructive and effective in promoting change to highlight instances of good practice. NHS Tayside, for example, has a multidisciplinary team, including an MS physio and social worker, who work closely with the Dundee branch of the MS Society in an excellent partnership between the public and voluntary sectors. NHS Ayrshire and Arran&#8217;s collaborative approach is also worthy of mention, in particular the excellent Douglas Grant rehabilitation centre.</p><p>I am pleased to say that NHS Orkney is meeting the MS standard for service provision. Two groups have been set up to ensure that that continues and to enhance partnership working further. Those groups involve physios, speech therapists, doctors and occupational therapists, as well as local groups and charities representing people with MS and other neurological conditions. That approach, in a small community with more than its fair share of sufferers, is absolutely the right one, and I congratulate all those involved. I know that plans are in hand for an awareness day next month, covering all aspects of living with a neurological condition, and I am sure that it will be well received and well attended.</p><p>As Angela Monteith explained to me recently, in an island community, MS sufferers and their families face some unique problems relating to geography. Although regular get-togethers are held, they can be hard to attend for people living on the smaller outer islands, and the sense of isolation can exacerbate other problems that they face. The costs of patients travelling to Aberdeen for neurological check-ups are extremely high, although it is encouraging to note the increased use of telehealth options. The local MS nurse in Orkney helps to support patients during teleconsultations with the Aberdeen-based neurologist. Not only does that save money but it reduces the physical strain that is caused to the patient by excessive travel. Their application in Orkney might be obvious, but I am sure that greater use could be made of telehealth options elsewhere in Scotland, too. Those examples of innovative solutions to meet the needs of MS sufferers in different parts of the country should give us all confidence that we can move away from the current postcode lottery of service provision.</p><p>Orkney may top the world&#8217;s league table for MS, but it is a disease that affects all parts of the country. As MSPs, we have a role to play in better understanding the needs of sufferers; in raising awareness of the disease and of the forms that it can take; and in pressing health boards in our constituencies and regions to ensure that standards are being met. Those are just a few things to be getting on with ahead of MS week, which starts on 29 April.</p><p>In the meantime, I again thank colleagues for their support and, in advance, for their speeches, and members of the MS Society&#8212;particularly Angela Monteith&#8212;for the advice and expertise that they have provided. Finally, thanks to me, the reputation of our Viking ancestors is a little less tarnished this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis (Availability of Treatment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that, over the next half an hour or so, we will achieve a number of things.

That disparity, with an up to 120 per cent increase in charges by 2020, potentially undermines the ability of our islands, including Orkney, to fulfil their potential. That, in turn, will compromise the ability of Scotland and the UK to deliver on their climate change and renewables targets.

Over the years, the Scottish Liberal Democrats have played their part in the abolition of tuition fees in the first Scottish Parliament and in the vote in the previous session of Parliament to remove the graduate endowment, and we successfully argued for the reversal of the cuts to college student support in last year&#8217;s budget. I am therefore more than happy to confirm that we will support the motion.</p><p>I am genuinely intrigued, however, by the timing of the debate. The choice of debate looked strange a fortnight ago, but the unfolding scandal of what has been happening in our food processing and supply chain makes the decision to spend half an hour this afternoon on the horsemeat crisis, with no debate, but over two hours on the tuition fees issue seem somewhat bizarre. That will not have gone unnoticed, particularly within Scotland&#8217;s vital agriculture and food and drink sectors.</p><p>To listen to Mr Russell speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that higher education was going to hell in a handcart everywhere in the UK, while in Scotland everything that he does is above reproach. However, I am sure that it is not his intention to scaremonger and that he would recoil at the notion that his dire warnings might risk deterring young Scots from choosing the university course that best suits their needs, wherever that might be in the UK or beyond.</p><p>I am sure that Mr Russell will curse the fact that time constraints prevented him from acknowledging that the most recent figures released by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed total applicant numbers for English universities rising by 3.5 per cent. Indeed, the latest figures show that the number of Scots applying to study at English universities has increased by 2.7 per cent, compared with an equivalent figure of 2.1 per cent for those choosing to remain in Scotland to study. Doubtless, he will take comfort from knowing that his apocalyptic warnings appear to be falling on deaf ears.</p><p>Mr Russell will be further relieved to hear that application rates from 18-year-olds from more disadvantaged backgrounds are increasing, albeit from an unacceptably low base. I will return shortly to the issue of widening access. However, there is also food for thought for the NUS, which is presumably still awaiting delivery of its twin portraits of Fiona Hyslop and Mike Russell for the dumped pledges outlined by Hugh Henry earlier.</p><p>Few organisations can lay greater claim to campaigning success over the years than the NUS and I value highly its input to debates such as this and to the wider policy agenda. However, in arguing its case for tuition fees in Scotland it needs to be careful about what it claims with respect to rest of the UK. In its briefing for today&#8217;s debate, it refers to comments by the Institute for Fiscal Studies about the impact of tuition fees south of the border. Unfortunately it ignored the IFS&#8217;s conclusion that</p><p>&#8220;the average student will be better off while at university, enjoying an increase in cash support of some 12 percent.&#8221;</p><p>That is something that Mr Russell and the NUS appear happy to endorse in Scotland with the move away from grants to loans.</p><p>Nor did the NUS make space for the IFS&#8217;s view that</p><p>&#8220;the poorest 27 percent of graduates will actually be better off under the new system&#8221;,</p><p>which is felt to be</p><p>&#8220;substantially more progressive than its predecessor&#8221;.</p><p>For the sake of balance, it is helpful to bear in mind those conclusions, which perhaps go some way to explaining the trends that we are seeing in applications across the UK.</p><p>NUS Scotland is absolutely correct, however, in highlighting the effect of the Scottish Government&#8217;s cap on fees for rest-of-UK students. By setting the cap per academic year rather than on the overall cost, Mr Russell ignores the impact that the four-year degree structure in Scotland could have. As NUS Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;we now have potentially the most expensive higher education system of all the UK countries; up to &#163;36k as opposed to &#163;27k elsewhere.&#8221;</p><p>The NUS also makes the point that there should be</p><p>&#8220;minimum standards to ensure protection for the poorest RUK students, as seen in England, combined with responsibility placed somewhere within the system for oversight of this aspect of the system&#8221;,</p><p>which would be akin to the Office for Fair Access in England. The education secretary has so far rejected that idea.</p><p>Mr Russell has shown a willingness to act&#8212;which I freely acknowledge&#8212;in relation to part-time students, and the extended fee grant is a welcome step in the right direction. Unfortunately, anomalies appear likely to arise from changes to the individual learning account 200 criteria that could see a group of higher education students on low incomes lose out. To avoid that happening, I urge the minister to agree to consider lowering the part-time funding grant threshold to 10 credits. The case for that is set out very clearly by the Open University in its submission to the Education and Culture Committee on the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>Of course, the OU has a good story to tell on widening access, which is core to its mission. It has doubled the number of students from poorer backgrounds over the past 10 years to 5,000. However, only 2,000 of those students are classed as living in SIMD 20 areas, which illustrates one of the central problems with the Government&#8217;s approach in its bill. Not only will the focus on SIMD 20 areas exclude poorer students from more affluent areas, but it will do nothing for those who are affected by disability or even rurality, who find access to university difficult.</p><p>Given its track record in the area, the OU could play an important role in taking on students from non-traditional backgrounds in first year and supporting their articulation to degree courses in more selective universities in second or third year. The idea seems worthy of further consideration by ministers.</p><p>As I said at the outset, notwithstanding the importance of universities and the issue of widening access, I find this subject an odd choice for debate today, given the urgency of competing issues such as the horsemeat scandal, hospital waiting lists and paediatric services, and even the implications of the EU budget agreement.</p><p>Scottish Liberal Democrats will support Mr Russell&#8217;s motion, which comes with the now-customary three ministerial signatures, and reject the amendments that were lodged by Hugh Henry and Liz Smith. However, there are serious questions to be answered by the education secretary. In his winding up speech, he might wish to focus on the implications of his tuition fees policy in the unlikely event of independence, at which point students from the rest of the UK would become eligible for the same fee support as their Scots-domiciled counterparts. If he can shed any light on how that &#163;220 million black hole might be filled, the debate might yet serve a useful purpose.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tuition Fees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I am grateful to follow the more thoughtful and measured remarks of Marco Biagi rather than those of his colleague Joan McAlpine.

Reversing that cut enjoys cross-party support. I suspect that, despite what we might hear again from SNP members this afternoon, in their more private moments many of them accept that a budget cut on this scale undermines claims by their ministers that they are protecting the range, availability and quality of course provision in colleges throughout Scotland. That is certainly the message that they will have heard from colleges in their constituencies and regions. It is the strong message from the National Union of Students in Scotland, whose excellent fund Scotland&#8217;s future campaign has already elicited 27,000 emails to MSPs in a matter of weeks. It is also the message from business, which might support sector reform, but whose representatives told the Education and Culture Committee during our scrutiny of the budget that cutting college course provision and quality could harm Scotland&#8217;s economic recovery.</p><p>That broad-based alliance in support of a rethink by the Government is not one that ministers can afford to ignore. Indeed, I very much hope that ministers will listen&#8212;although the self-congratulatory tone of the SNP amendment and the minister&#8217;s speech suggest that he is not in listening mode. That has unfortunate echoes of his assertion during the previous budget process that cuts to college budgets were</p><p>&#8220;a fair, full and final settlement&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 26 January 2012; c 5795.]</p><p>That claim was made to look ridiculous when John Swinney agreed to provide an additional &#163;40 million of support. It is of concern that the education secretary has chosen, once again, to adopt such a dismissive attitude and to reject any notion that aspects of what he is doing may not command support in the college sector or require to be changed. That is a feature of the hole that Mr Russell created for himself over funding at the end of last year, and it is characteristic of his behaviour in relation to what he is now dubbing &#8220;so-called waiting lists&#8221;.</p><p>Let us consider how that issue has developed. When Colleges Scotland first published its figures in October, Mr Russell was perfectly entitled to question the basis and to ask for details. It was accepted that multiple applications and other factors had to be taken into account in establishing the actual level of unmet demand for college courses. However, as Hugh Henry suggested, Mr Russell took his argument to an illogical extreme when speaking in the chamber on 24 October. Clearly annoyed at repeated requests from Opposition members simply to acknowledge that waiting lists exist and to put a figure on them, Mr Russell overstated his case.</p><p>Neil Findlay asked:</p><p>&#8220;How many people are on college waiting lists?&#8221;</p><p>Mr Russell thundered that they were</p><p>&#8220;a false concept and a false construct. There are no waiting lists of that nature.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 24 October 2012; c 12504.</p><p>In answer to Hugh Henry&#8217;s question, that probably falls into the context of the debate reference.</p><p>It is strange that a fortnight later Mr Russell should invite the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to carry out an audit of that &#8220;false concept.&#8221; Not surprisingly, the initial results of the audit confirm a much lower figure, but they also make uncomfortable reading for the education secretary. In his determination to deny the extent of the problem, Mr Russell went as far as to deny the existence of any problem. The funding council does not believe that; the chair of Colleges Scotland does not believe it; and students certainly do not believe it.</p><p>Once again, Mr Russell&#8217;s inability to resist dismissing any and every concern that is raised with him about what is happening in the college sector has landed him in hot water. On that basis, not only does he owe the Parliament an apology, he owes our colleges and their staff and students an apology.

However, it is disingenuous for Margaret Burgess to try to characterise the situation as one in which the Scottish Government is doing everything that it can but is being thwarted by its counterpart in Westminster. Such a distortion of the facts carries with it a number of risks.</p><p>First, there is a danger that Scottish National Party ministers will start to believe their own spin, which will make it all the more difficult to persuade them that there are areas in which the Scottish Government needs to do more. The briefings from Energy Action Scotland, Citizens Advice Scotland, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and others make it clear that such areas exist, not least in terms of the resources that are being committed. That point was acknowledged by the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee in its report on the Government&#8217;s budget, and I will return to it later.</p><p>The other danger, of course, is that such partisan misrepresentation does nothing to aid co-operation and collaboration between both Governments on this vital issue. It might be that, like many of her colleagues, Margaret Burgess is entirely relaxed about that prospect, but it illustrates the problem of having ministers who are so obsessed with the 2014 referendum and the powers that they do not have that, as Richard Baker suggested, they pass up the opportunities to use to full effect the ones that they do have.</p><p>Whatever the case, with Energy Action Scotland estimating that up to 40 per cent of households in Scotland might be living in fuel poverty, the challenge that faces all of us in meeting our shared objective of eradicating this scourge on our society is enormous and getting more urgent by the day. That is all the more reason to try to maintain the political consensus and joint commitment that has existed to date.</p><p>In that spirit, let me be clear that I accept that there are aspects of the UK Government policy that need more work. As my amendment suggests, I have no doubt that the green deal, the energy company obligation, the Energy Bill and so on all have the potential to deliver significant benefits, not just as part of a process of decarbonising our economy but specifically with regard to addressing fuel poverty. Nevertheless, I am also conscious that we need to learn lessons from the past and ensure that those initiatives offer opportunities to all our citizens and communities.</p><p>An example of that is ECO, which could see &#163;100 million invested in Scotland this year and an estimated &#163;120 million in future years. That investment is hugely welcome, but it is fair to say that, in rural and island areas such as the ones that I represent, there are questions about how effective that mechanism will be at channelling funds into those communities. That is a real concern.</p><p>As the minister knows, after the Western Isles, Orkney has the highest level of fuel poverty anywhere in the country. The reasons for that are obvious&#8212;the homes are harder to heat, the winters are longer and harsher, and we are off the gas grid. Yet, as Calor Gas points out,</p><p>&#8220;fuel poverty schemes often fail to address the fuel disadvantage of off-grid or rural homes.&#8221;</p><p>It is all the more essential, then, that programmes, whether they emanate from the UK Government or the Scottish Government or are taken forward by energy companies, are structured in ways that make them accessible to all. Those points were made to David Sigsworth, the chair of the minister&#8217;s advisory committee on fuel poverty, when he visited Orkney last summer. He saw at first hand some of the innovative work that is being done in Orkney in tailoring insulation and other energy-efficient solutions to meet the specific needs of islanders.

At present, much of that resource is being constrained, off the grid, or pumped straight into the ground. Surely there is an opportunity for some joined-up thinking to allow Orkney and communities elsewhere in Scotland to derive more benefits from our assets. In the past, ministers have been reluctant to promote the idea of local councils or other community bodies taking on more of a role in energy supply, but that issue is worthy of further consideration.</p><p>I firmly believe that the Scottish Government has taken the issue of fuel poverty seriously. The development of many schemes that were initiated under the previous Scottish Executive has been sensible and effective, and I welcome the retrofit programme. However, the challenges in continuing to make progress are all too evident. In a sense, we have dealt with the low-hanging fruit, and what follows will be more tricky and costly. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee puts the bill at around &#163;200 million a year; Energy Action Scotland insists that it is likely to be nearer &#163;300 million.

Since taking office, ministers have repeatedly refused to engage in discussions about how significant resources that are spent on Scottish Water might be better deployed while public control is retained over Scottish Water. That missed opportunity is directly affecting ministers&#8217; ability to fund measures to combat fuel poverty.</p><p>The minister is correct to say that the number of households in fuel poverty at the start of the 21st century in Scotland, which is an energy-rich country, is scandalous. Tackling that will require collective effort, innovative approaches and significant resources. It does not need ministers relegating the issue below its obsession with the referendum and their picking fights rather than working on solutions with Westminster.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving my somewhat lengthy amendment: I move amendment S4M-05424.1, to leave out from &#8220;the contrast&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;recognises the early indications from the National Retrofit Programme &#8216;go-early&#8217; pilots that energy companies view Scotland as an attractive place to invest; further welcomes UK Government schemes to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty that will help households in Scotland, in particular the innovative Green Deal, which will launch in January 2013, under which individuals and businesses will be able to implement energy efficiency improvements to their properties paid for through savings on their energy bills, and the &#163;1.3 billion Energy Company Obligation (ECO) that targets support at households in fuel poverty and those with hard-to-insulate homes; believes that as the ECO is taken forward, ministers should ensure that the obligation provides support for remote and rural communities with high rates of fuel poverty and higher costs; congratulates the UK coalition government on its decision to permanently increase the cold weather payment from &#163;8.50 per week to &#163;25 per week; recognises that action to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is required to tackle rising energy bills and welcomes the significant sums invested in the Scottish renewables industry in recent years, with around 11,000 jobs in Scotland now directly related to the renewables sector; further welcomes the UK Energy Bill, which is designed to ensure that there is a competitive market of diverse suppliers and energy sources in which consumers can obtain the best possible deal; supports the UK coalition government&#8217;s efforts to simplify tariffs to ensure that consumers are on the lowest tariff appropriate to their circumstances but, nevertheless, remains concerned that many customers find themselves subject to large increases in their energy bills, above the headline figure announced by energy companies; believes that, in order to meet the target to end fuel poverty by 2016, both governments must work together constructively in the best interests of Scotland&#8217;s people, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the Treasury in order to unlock funds from Scottish Water to increase significantly its home insulation programme, which will reduce Scotland&#8217;s carbon footprint, cut family heating bills and generate thousands of green jobs across the country.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I encourage the minister to look again at supporting efforts in Orkney to harness more of the excellent renewable resources that we have in the islands to provide lower-cost electricity to fuel-poor households.

UK ministers have a key role in making important judgments about how legislation, spending and overall policy are framed, and their decisions must be informed by the perspective that we can bring in representing a wide range of communities across Scotland and other key stakeholders.

I perfectly understand that difficult decisions will be made that will impact on households across country. Nevertheless, there is no information from the SNP about how it would simplify the reform package and deliver it in a way that would not impact on households. There is a risk that SNP ministers will send out such a jaundiced view of other initiatives that people in Scotland are discouraged from applying to schemes such as the ECO scheme and the green deal that could benefit them. Certainly, Scottish ministers regularly use a similar argument when they are faced with questions about their own schemes and programmes.</p><p>The minister must accept that it is right for Opposition members, and in fact their duty&#8212;not to mention that of her own back benchers&#8212;to highlight where they believe that the Scottish Government needs to up its game. That is not sneering or scaremongering, nor is it hypocrisy on the part of Opposition members. If anything, we are taking the First Minister at his word when he said that he did not have &#8220;a monopoly on wisdom&#8221;, even if the notion that his would be a majority Government with a minority ego stretched credibility rather too far.</p><p>I am not saying that Scottish ministers have been sitting on their hands. I do not believe for a second that Margaret Burgess takes the issue of fuel poverty anything other than extremely seriously, but she must recognise that there are areas where the Government can do more. I touched on a couple of examples of that in my earlier speech, although I was drowned out by the howls of outrage on the SNP benches at my suggestion that part of the SNP&#8217;s solution to fuel poverty is sky-high oil prices in an independent Scotland.</p><p>An example that I mentioned earlier is that of establishing how local communities can harness their renewable energy resources to provide lower-cost electricity to those in fuel poverty. Examples of such schemes already exist in Orkney, and I see no reason why communities in other parts of the country should not be helped to do likewise. Another example that I touched on earlier relates to the overall level of funding to support action to tackle fuel poverty. Energy Action Scotland estimates that the funding needs to be increased by around &#163;300 million a year. That will require ministers to be more open to the ways in which funding can be found&#8212;in that regard, I offered the example of Scottish Water.</p><p>However, I did not give sufficient attention earlier to the work being done on fuel poverty by Citizens Advice Scotland. Its recent energy report demonstrates just how active citizens advice bureau advisers have been in providing invaluable support to some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. It is estimated that CAB advisers dealt with almost 7,500 people, and their advice helped to secure well over &#163;200,000 of financial gain for clients by ensuring that people claimed support under the warm homes discount, received the best available tariff or accessed free insulation and discounted central heating. Such advice is exceptionally valuable and demonstrates the fact that more can be done to get maximum value from existing initiatives, whether those have been put in place by the UK Government, the Scottish Government or local authorities, or, indeed, are run by the energy companies themselves.</p><p>Of course, much more needs to be done, as members across the chamber have accepted. There is an issue of particular note in relation to tariffs and charges. I welcome moves to simplify the bewildering array of tariffs, which often offers customers a very false sense of choice. I can also see merit in requiring energy companies to put their customers on the best available tariff, although that will need to take account of the way in which people use energy, as the superficially cheapest tariff may not always best meet a person&#8217;s needs.</p><p>As Margaret McCulloch, Anne McTaggart, John Wilson and many others observed, energy companies have some way to go to rebuild trust among their customers. Many reasons for that have been cited, as members outlined. For my own part, over recent months I have been struck by the number of complaints from constituents in Orkney who have expressed real anger that their fuel bills have risen considerably higher than the headline rise that the energy companies announced last autumn. That does nothing for consumer confidence in how energy companies operate; it does even less for our efforts to combat fuel poverty.</p><p>The minister mentioned that she is due to meet Ed Davey and Michael Moore in the near future&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is interesting that Jamie Hepburn&#8217;s intervention reveals absolutely nothing about the SNP&#8217;s approach to welfare reform.

I am sure that she will serve the constituents of Mid Scotland and Fife exceptionally well.</p><p>Like others, I welcome today&#8217;s debate and the further opportunity that it provides to consider the vital issue of youth employment. Although the motion is right to acknowledge&#8212;I certainly add my welcome of the news&#8212;that there has recently been a fall in the number of young people out of work, we should obviously guard against any temptation to take our eye off the ball. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work remains unacceptably high at 87,000, while the number of young people in employment has fallen sharply over the past three years. Ken Macintosh is right to point to the health warning that Professor Bell has attached to the figures. Whether our performance is better or worse than that of the UK seems to change with each new set of figures, but what does not change is the need to do more to improve the situation, as I think all speakers today have accepted.</p><p>In particular, as the Barnardo&#8217;s briefing highlights, providing more effective support for those furthest from the labour market is essential. Of looked-after children, 36 per cent are still looking for employment six months after leaving school&#8212;almost four times the average for school leavers as a whole&#8212;and the figures for those securing a place in further education are scarcely any better. I will return shortly to possible options for improving provision, opportunities and outcomes for that group, but I hope that the minister will accept that further attention on that is required.</p><p>Other areas also need to be addressed&#8212;I will come to those in a minute&#8212;but at the outset let me reiterate my strong support for the appointment of Angela Constance to her role, welcome the publication and on-going development of a youth employment strategy, notably through the youth action plans, and endorse the continued all-Government, all-Scotland focus that has been given to the issue, including the additional funding from the European regional development fund. The minister will know that her efforts to provide job training and education opportunities for our young people in these difficult economic times enjoy the whole-hearted support of MSPs across the chamber. She is also right to point out the role that we all have, particularly at a local level in our constituencies and regions.</p><p>In that context, let me outline a number of areas where I think that, despite the encouraging figures, changes in the Government&#8217;s approach and thinking are needed. As I mentioned, Barnardo&#8217;s has once again made a compelling case for more targeted action to support some of the most vulnerable young people in Scotland. That will come as no surprise to colleagues on the Education and Culture Committee, whose recent inquiry on improving outcomes for looked-after children identified alarming evidence of how, despite a collective commitment and the efforts by successive Governments as well as those in the field, we are still well short of being able to claim any real success.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s argues strongly for the third sector to be more closely involved in the development of opportunities for all at a local level, including the youth action plans, and points to</p><p>&#8220;a serious gap in long term, nurturing and supportive provision for care leavers.&#8221;</p><p>With care leavers often facing additional barriers to entering the job market, whether through a lack of literacy and numeracy skills, self-confidence or motivation, addressing those obstacles is critically important. That often requires intensive input from specialists, but experience shows that such inputs can make a difference. Barnardo&#8217;s works programme is just one example, but there are others that demonstrate the value of fully engaging the skills and expertise available within the third sector in Scotland. That theme is also picked up by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, so I hope that Angela Constance will agree to bring some renewed focus to that over the course of 2013.</p><p>Likewise, I hope that Angela Constance will accept that there is now widespread agreement about the need for ministers to look again at the cuts to college funding that are proposed in the Government&#8217;s draft budget. As I said, care leavers continue to experience particular difficulties in accessing further education courses and it is becoming increasingly clear that the way in which colleges are trying to adapt to the FE funding cuts is having a more pronounced effect on those with specific support needs. Again, I am sure that Ms Constance will wish to take up that point with the co-sponsors of her motion, notably the education secretary.</p><p>The planned cut of around &#163;34 million to college budgets threatens to have a far wider impact that cannot but work against the Government&#8217;s objectives for youth employment. In evidence to the Education and Culture Committee recently, colleges, staff unions, student representatives and business groups all underscored the risk of reduced opportunities and quality of provision. NUS Scotland warned that, if the cuts go ahead, they will have</p><p>&#8220;a significant negative impact on the contribution our colleges would be able to make to improving employability in Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>I accept that planned reforms can deliver savings in due course through mergers and so on, but Audit Scotland has pointed out that the extent and timing of the savings remain questionable. In the meantime, the loss of staff, reductions in course and the concentration of provision are having an effect that is felt across all age groups, including those that fall within the minister&#8217;s portfolio. It is therefore important that Ms Constance lends her support to the widespread calls for the Government to reverse the cuts.</p><p>Over successive Government budgets we have seen that money continues to be found for pet projects and to grab headlines, even after the budget is agreed. The issue is ultimately about political choices and ministers must choose to attach a greater priority to our colleges and those whom they support.</p><p>I am delighted that the UK Government's youth contract scheme is to be extended beyond unemployment hotspots so that wage incentives of more than &#163;2,000 will be available to employers across Scotland when taking on a young person who has been out of work for some time. As the minister suggested, that helps cover the costs of additional training or supervision, while giving young people an opportunity to gain meaningful work experience. I am sure that the minister will agree that awareness of those opportunities needs to be properly highlighted in the local action plans that are being developed.</p><p>I am conscious that there are many areas that I have not covered, but I conclude by again welcoming the debate and reiterating my support for much of what the minister is doing in relation to an all-Government, all-Scotland approach to tackling the serious challenges facing our young people.

It would be remiss of me not to point out, particularly with Orkney Islands Council represented in the public gallery this evening, that the islands that I represent are at the heart of efforts to realise that ambition but stand to lose out on significant job and wealth-creation opportunities if the issues that the debate highlights are not addressed urgently.</p><p>It is perhaps just as well that we are not required to vote on the motion. There is a great deal of agreement between Rob Gibson and me on the issue, but the wording of the motion causes me some difficulty. However inadvertent it may be&#8212;although I do not believe that it is&#8212;creating the impression that the current regulatory regime governing transmission charging is somehow anti-Scottish is a little disingenuous. Whatever its failings, of which there are many, there is a logic behind the current system of charging. The problem is that that logic no longer holds for what we wish to achieve in decarbonising the economy and how we produce energy.</p><p>It is right to characterise the locational system of charging that seeks to incentivise large-scale energy production close to cities and areas of major demand as outdated and no longer fit for purpose. However, it is wrong to imply that it is somehow a ploy to deny Scotland a chance to fulfil its renewables potential. Indeed, as I am sure Paul Wheelhouse&#8217;s colleague Fergus Ewing would be the first to acknowledge, there is a recognition among his counterparts at Westminster of the problems that are created by the current charging regime and, more important, a willingness to make changes.</p><p>What those changes should be and how they are to be achieved are, inevitably, trickier issues to resolve. However, I think that the case that has been marshalled in Scotland, drawing together a wide range of interests and expertise, has increased substantially the likelihood of a successful outcome that reflects the realities of where our best renewable resources are allocated and which enables us to harness those resources in a competitive and cost-efficient manner.</p><p>I acknowledge the work that has been done on the issue by Fergus Ewing personally. We may not see eye to eye on many things, but I do not doubt Mr Ewing&#8217;s commitment to securing a better deal for the islands on this issue. His willingness to work constructively with my colleague Ed Davey at DECC and to use the broad coalition of support in Scotland to make the case for change has been impressive, and I am grateful to him for that. In addition, I am still optimistic that our collective efforts, including those of the three island councils, will prove successful. That optimism stems in part from the willingness of those in the UK coalition Government, particularly my colleagues Chris Huhne and Ed Davey, to make strides in the right direction. Nevertheless, I recognise, as Rob Gibson intimated, that there is resistance from many quarters, not least parts of Ofgem and generators who benefit quite well from the current set-up.</p><p>As well as reviewing Ofgem&#8217;s remit, UK ministers have taken forward project transmit, which may not have delivered the results for which many of us hoped but which has provided an opportunity to develop and articulate the argument on why charges for renewables development in the Pentland Firth and Orkney waters need to be brought more in line with those for equivalents on the mainland.</p><p>The Scottish Renewables report &#8220;Swimming Against the Tide: the impact of TN UoS charging on marine energy development in Scotland&#8221; vividly highlighted the cost comparisons in relation to grid charges and the dramatic effect that charging island-based developers for local works, including undersea cabling, will have. However efficient and productive wave and tidal devices become in the energetic waters around Rob Gibson&#8217;s constituency and mine, it is hard to see how they can be competitive if they are faced with an increase in charges of more than 120 per cent by 2020, as Scottish Renewables estimates they will be.</p><p>Such disparity places at serious risk the ability of our islands, including Orkney, to fulfil their potential, thereby undermining Scotland and the UK&#8217;s ability to deliver on climate change and renewables targets. Given the global lead in wave and tidal energy that we currently enjoy, there is a risk of scandalously wasting an opportunity to create thousands of jobs, attract millions of pounds of investment and develop a wide range of skills and expertise that would put us in the box seat in building the sector internationally.</p><p>The sector&#8217;s potential was evident last week when Orkney-based Scotrenewables Tidal Power announced a further &#163;7.6 million of private investment in its tidal energy device. It was particularly pleasing to see a company such as ABB Technology Ventures coming on board with Fred Olsen and Total, which demonstrates the confidence and commitment of some of the major industrial players in the future of wave and tidal energy.</p><p>The announcement reinforced the need to get the high cost of charging for island-based developments sorted, soon. As developments progress towards commercial deployment, investors will want to take decisions about where they can get the best return. The window of opportunity for taking action is closing.</p><p>What action should be taken? There seem to be various options. Like Rob Gibson, I hold out little hope of project transmit and the CUSC group delivering anything more than marginal improvement on the current position. Another option would be to use enhanced ROCs for the islands to compensate for the additional burden of charges. Such an approach has the benefit of being relatively simple, which is no mean feat in the area of policy that we are considering, and might enjoy support from Mr Ewing as well as from a number of developers. I have always felt that the transmission charging problem would be better dealt with through the charging regime but, given what is at stake and the timeframe in which we are operating, a solution that works is better than no solution at all.</p><p>I look forward to hearing about the work of the Scottish island renewables steering group, which Ed Davey has set up. I thank Rob Gibson and congratulate him again on securing what I hope will be a useful debate.

At first glance, the subject may strike some as esoteric, but as every member who has spoken so far has illustrated, it is fundamental. The way in which science informs public policy has been brought home to me over the past four or five years through my involvement in scrutinising legislation, such as the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill, the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill and the Marine (Scotland) Bill. There is any number of examples in which the scientific evidence that committees and the Parliament have received has been critical.</p><p>Beyond legislation, such scientific evidence is critical in policy areas, too, whether in energy production and efficiency, digital technology, disease management or food production. The areas in which scientific evidence has or should have a heavy bearing on the decisions that we as a Parliament and ministers in the Government take are brought home to us routinely. Our policy in helping science to deliver is therefore critical.</p><p>The Government motion is very worthy, although it may be somewhat lacking; perhaps the cabinet secretary conceded that in supporting Murdo Fraser&#8217;s amendment, which instils a degree of urgency and exhorts the Government to do more. Neil Findlay&#8217;s amendment identifies the challenges that exist, particularly with the lack of women in STEM subjects, and the potential threats&#8212;I do not think that they can be dismissed&#8212;from the potential break-up of the UK. They cannot be glossed over; they need to be taken seriously.</p><p>The thrust of the Government&#8217;s motion and argument is correct. The Government points to the scientific advice in policy making being essential to arriving at better decisions. However, Elaine Murray made an excellent point in pointing to the tendency towards policy-driven evidence as opposed to evidence-based policy making. The Government is also right in saying that we not only have a fine heritage in the area&#8212;a number of members have alluded to that&#8212;but Scotland has world-class scientists who are doing world-class things right now, and we should be using them.</p><p>The contribution that science can make to meeting a wide range of policy objectives has been set out, including to the creation of a highly skilled and high-value economy, and there is also the importance of public engagement. That is important for a wide range of reasons. I was struck by Richard Simpson&#8217;s allusion to MMR and the dangers that open up where there are gaps between public attitudes&#8212;and how they are picked up in the political arena&#8212;and scientific evidence. Politicians and ministers take decisions that are based on a wide variety of factors. The RSE made it clear in its briefing that</p><p>&#8220;The role of the wider science community is not to determine policy; that is for Government; their role is to develop and present the evidence for different policy options.&#8221;</p><p>It went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Science is concerned to understand the working of nature, it is for society to determine how that understanding should be used.&#8221;</p><p>Iain Gray was absolutely right to warn of the risks, absolutes and 100 per cent guarantees that we seek from the scientific community, whatever issue we are wrestling with. Science is often not an absolute; it can be provisional. It is almost always necessarily qualified, as Nigel Don and Elaine Murray pointed out, but the understanding of the scientific evidence is still vital to good policy making and good government. How ministers access it therefore is a critical question.</p><p>The cabinet secretary pointed to a number of examples of expertise and advice in government, whether in SEPA, SNH, Marine Scotland, Scottish Water, the enterprise agencies or other bodies, but it still remains the case that there is more expertise outside the Government than inside it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome Dr Allan to his seat and express sympathy for him.

She is not only an Orkneyphile but was very much the role model that we needed to see. In an excellent interview that was provided courtesy of the Society of Biology, Professor Glover set out her challenges in her new role as the EU adviser. Her appointment in 2006 was a step forward. At that time, she had a direct line to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and it is a concern that, from 2007, she appeared to report to the education secretary. Her successor, Professor Muffy Calder, appears to report directly to Dr Allan albeit with access to the education secretary.

I am pleased, however, that the minister has persevered and welcome, in the words of George Adam, the opporchancity to participate in this important debate on the modernisation of Scotland&#8217;s careers services.</p><p>The need for such modernisation is not hard to justify, given the way in which the world of work has changed and continues to change. As Scottish Chambers of Commerce observed, those who are leaving our schools, colleges and universities now and in the future will</p><p>&#8220;enter into careers which will cross multiple disciplines in several industries. The roles they perform and the industries in which they do so may not now yet even exist&#8221;.</p><p>That presents enormous challenges for those who are tasked with developing the skills of our young people and those who are returning to update their skills, but it also places a weighty burden on those who are responsible for providing careers information, advice and guidance.</p><p>In that sense, Angela Constance&#8212;in her motion and in her remarks this afternoon&#8212;is right to underline the rationale for the changes that are being made. She is right also to link the modernisation process with ensuring not simply that Scotland emerges strongly from the current economic difficulties but that we prepare people to manage their careers throughout their lives. She is right to highlight the importance of collaboration with a wide range of partners in achieving the most effective careers service possible.</p><p>Where I disagree&#8212;and, therefore, where I find difficulty in supporting the motion as it stands&#8212;is in the failure to acknowledge any of the concerns that exist in relation to the strategy and, in particular, the way in which it is being implemented. Those concerns are reflected well in Neil Findlay&#8217;s amendment, albeit that more of the original motion could have survived the cut, for the reasons that I have mentioned.</p><p>Nevertheless, having acknowledged the shared understanding of the need for change and how it might best be achieved, I will expand a bit on where I think the problems in approach and/or execution arise and how they might be addressed.</p><p>From a constituency perspective, I remain concerned about what appears to have been a centralisation of service provision. Certain senior roles have been removed from the islands and although attempts have been made to mitigate the impact of that, I believe that there has been a move in the wrong direction.</p><p>In its briefing, Unison reflects on the wider problem of office closures and staff cuts across the country. Quite reasonably, it contrasts that trend with the increasing demand that is being placed on the service at a time of high unemployment. In part, that leads Unison to claim that the changes that are being made are driven by a desire to cut budgets rather than by a desire to improve service. Whether that is fair or accurate is largely academic; it is clearly the perception of a large number of staff who are involved in the careers service, whose morale, by all accounts, is worryingly low.</p><p>Morale is also being affected by the approach that is being taken to use of the my world of work website. The problem is not the website itself. Scottish Chambers of Commerce is far from alone in recognising that my world of work is</p><p>&#8220;an excellent innovation ... bringing together advice and information ... in a single portal.&#8221;</p><p>When they appeared before the Education and Culture Committee last month, Unison representatives absolutely accepted that fact, but serious concerns remain that SDS management, if not the minister, still see the web tool as a replacement for one-to-one careers advice for too many of our young people, as well as for those who have left school.</p><p>The research by Howieson and Semple, to which a number of members have referred, demonstrates that although</p><p>&#8220;young people do indeed value self help services they also wish for personal contact and advice.&#8221;</p><p>They go on to point out that, although young people are comfortable in using the internet, many find it challenging to interpret the &#8220;volume and complexity&#8221; of the information that is available and, importantly, how it relates to their circumstances. That can affect even very able and confident young people, as well as those who have already been identified as needing more intensive support. Moreover, it seems a little premature for SDS and ministers to be making some of their more extravagant claims about what my world of work can deliver before more road testing&#8212;ideally, by young people themselves&#8212;has been done.</p><p>Despite reassurances that a flexible approach is being adopted, school-based careers resources are being focused according to the so-called risk matrix. Those in the red category are to receive six to eight face-to-face sessions, while those who are categorised as green are expected to sign up to the website, which&#8212;as Neil Bibby and others have pointed out&#8212;a relatively modest number have actually done.</p><p>In evidence to the Education and Culture Committee, Unison confirmed that advisers are still offering interviews to proposed green pupils, even when they have not registered on the website. In its submission to the committee, Unison insisted that advisers</p><p>&#8220;will not turn people away when they seek help just because they haven&#8217;t registered on a website.&#8221;</p><p>That is quite right, too.</p><p>Danny Logue of SDS agreed that no young person should be discouraged from seeking advice, yet guidance to advisers has not changed and the firm impression remains that registering on the website is a prerequisite for getting one-to-one advice. If that is wrong, as Ms Constance and others have argued, it is time for ministers to insist that SDS makes that more explicit within the organisation and that it be communicated through schools.</p><p>I have a couple of points to make on the critically important careers advice that is available in our colleges and universities. In the case of the latter, I welcome the steps that are being taken to build in careers advice from the outset of a student&#8217;s time at university. That may take time to bed down, but it is certainly a sensible approach, and it might avoid an overreliance on the final-year milk round.</p><p>As far as colleges are concerned, one of the many concerns about the significant cut in budgets has been about the reduction in the number of staff who are available to provide guidance and careers support. That is another reason why I believe that there must be a rethink by ministers before the budget is finally approved.</p><p>The minister opened by reminding us that the debate is about getting the right people with the right skills in the right jobs. I believe that that is achievable, but it will require change. I hope that the minister will reflect on the concerns that I and many others have raised to ensure that we make the right changes in the right way and for the right reasons.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For a while, it looked as though the debate might fall victim to the controversies surrounding the Scottish Government&#8217;s cuts to the colleges budget and the need to make time for that issue to be debated.

Most striking about this omnishambles is the extent to which it has been largely self-inflicted through an unwillingness to properly listen and an over-fondness to assert and lambast. In a remarkable show of chutzpah, Mr Russell chose this of all weeks to refer his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Veterans, to the ombudsman over the boorach that has been created over the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service. I dare say that Keith Brown is tempted to return the favour in relation to colleges.</p><p>No one disputes that there is complexity in college funding, not least given the differences between spending in academic and financial years. However, as the Education and Culture Committee has established, instead of making the situation better and clearer, Mr Russell has excelled at making it worse and more opaque.

During last week&#8217;s debate, Liz Smith rather helpfully intervened to suggest that there was confusion around college funding figures due to a lack of consistency in how the figures are measured. Did Mr Russell respond to that plea of mitigation on his behalf with grateful and humble thanks and a statement of his determination to make things better and clearer in the future? Not quite. He said:</p><p>&#8220;the figures are quite clear on where we are. Where we are is quite clear from the baseline figures, and the additional money that we have added in every single year is quite clear.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 14 November 2012; c 13428.]</p><p>No doubt he is a further candidate for the Alex Salmond award for</p><p>&#8220;about as exact an answer as anybody has given in any Parliament&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 15 November 2012; c 13513.]</p><p>What is quite clear is that there is a cut in college funding this year. Audit Scotland calculated it to be in the order of 24 per cent in real terms over the spending review period. In its briefing, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges pointed to a reduction in revenue funding of &#163;113 million between 2010-11 and 2014-15. In terms of the teaching grant and fee waiver, it estimated the drop to be around &#163;73 million by the end of the current financial year.</p><p>Against the backdrop of a 6 per cent real-terms cut in the Government&#8217;s overall budget, it is hard to square those figures from Audit Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s Colleges with the assertion from Mr Russell and Mr Salmond that colleges are a priority for the SNP.

Indeed, they command the support of the whole chamber. As I have stated before, and as is reflected in my amendment, they include recognising the benefits that are achievable through closer working on a regional basis by colleges, universities, local authorities and employers. Such collaboration must, however, always be driven by educational need, and the pace at which it happens can be critical to its success.</p><p>With reduced budgets and an expectation among ministers that college reserves are to be raided to pay for mergers, it is not hard to see why concerns exist among people, from Audit Scotland to the chair of Angus College. Mr Russell is simply wrong to assert that those who question what he is doing or the way in which he is doing it are opposed to change and do not have the interests of colleges at heart. Although that is the narrative that he may wish to create, it is entirely false.</p><p>Mr Russell&#8217;s performance during the debate last week exemplified that.

Prior to his arrival as education secretary, the college sector was&#8212;in his words&#8212;littered with</p><p>&#8220;duplication and ... inefficiency and waste&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 14 November 2012; c 13427.]</p><p>That year zero view of the world and blas&#233; denial of the significant contribution that our colleges have made over many decades is frankly ridiculous.

NUS Scotland makes the point that shifts in college participation away from part time to full time, from mature students to young students and from women to men have implications for participation and accessibility. As John Henderson of Scotland&#8217;s Colleges has said,</p><p>&#8220;One of the enormous strengths of the college system is its ability to cater for a diverse range of students at different times in their lives. Any narrowing of that risks limiting the opportunities available.&#8221;</p><p>Although the Government is right to reflect the specific challenges facing our young people&#8212;particularly with youth unemployment currently standing at around 100,000&#8212;it is wrong to downplay the importance of ensuring that colleges are able to continue to meet the needs of a wider group of learners.</p><p>The cabinet secretary and some of his back benchers have dismissed the reduction in course provision as simply the stripping away of &#8220;hobby&#8221; courses. That is palpably untrue and again betrays an unwillingness by Mr Russell to face up to the consequences of the decisions and choices that he and his Government have made. I suggest, for example, that the reduction by a quarter in the number of female students studying at colleges in Scotland since 2007 is a statistic that should have Mr Russell asking serious questions about the impact that his approach to college funding and reorganisation is having.</p><p>For those from less well-off backgrounds, there must also be concerns at what is happening with the reduced opportunities available. As Murdo Fraser reminded us last week, the proportion of those from the 20 per cent most deprived cohort has fallen from 83.3 per 1,000 in 2007-08 to 72.5 per 1,000 in 2010-11. Again, I see no useful purpose served by the cabinet secretary dismissing that alarming trend, not least given the commitment to extending access that is shared across the Parliament.</p><p>For the sake of the choice and quality of the provision on offer to students, the opportunities available to the wide range of individuals that colleges have been so good at supporting, the connections that local businesses have with colleges in their area and the morale of staff who work in this critical sector&#8212;for all those reasons&#8212;I believe that the education secretary must look again at the approach that he is taking to funding, to reform and to the relationship that he has with those in the sector. If that does not happen as a matter of urgency, confidence in the SNP Government and in this education secretary will continue to erode, potentially to the point of no return.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving amendment S4M-04914.1, to leave out from &#8220;their substantial commitment&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;that colleges are vital in providing educational opportunities for individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and circumstances; is concerned that the Scottish Government&#8217;s planned cut to college budgets in 2013-14 puts at risk efforts both to widen access and to ensure the quality of course provision; believes that, while regionalisation has the potential to increase collaboration and deliver benefits for colleges, students and employers, these outcomes will only be achieved if restructuring is driven by educational need and at an appropriate pace; further believes that confidence in the Scottish Government, not least within the sector, has been shaken by the failure of ministers to demonstrate a grasp of the allocated budget and their heavy-handed treatment of college staff and governors, and believes that confidence can only be restored if the Scottish Government takes urgent steps to change its approach to the sector, including giving an urgent indication that it will revise its 2013-14 draft budget to prevent a cut to college funding and agree that it will set out clearly the costs and benefits of reform to the college sector as recommended by Audit Scotland.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677831", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have got to make progress.

That demonstrates that there is no willingness to accept that many of the challenges that the college sector faces are a direct result of decisions by the SNP Government and the cabinet secretary. As Jeremy Peat of the David Hume Institute put it,</p><p>&#8220;This is a difficult time for the sector, facing the challenges of coping with constraints on funding, implementing rapid and substantial organisational change and of playing a key role in meeting the government&#8217;s challenge to provide an opportunity for all&#8221;.</p><p>It will simply not wash to blame Westminster, Opposition parties and forces of conservatism in the college sector. The issues are serious and have serious consequences for colleges, staff, students, businesses and our economy. Neil Findlay, Patricia Ferguson and Jenny Marra among others set out local impacts. Many have quoted Larry Flanagan. He is right to say that we need to focus on addressing the serious issues, but the cabinet secretary&#8217;s actions undermine efforts to do so.</p><p>That is not to say that Mr Russell is doing everything wrong or that he has not taken action that will be in the college sector&#8217;s long-term interests. However, it is demonstrable that he prefers to assert rather than genuinely listen, that he is intolerant of anyone who dares to express a contrary view or even question his decisions, and that he has been so obsessed with creating the impression that he is right and everyone else is wrong that he has ended up misleading Parliament and the people of Scotland over funding.</p><p>This is not a case of reading a table incorrectly or even a case of muddled thinking when faced with the undoubted complexity of college funding. If that had been the case, it would not have taken until 18 October for Mr Russell to put the record straight by writing to the Education and Culture Committee. I cannot believe that, with historic numbers of Government ministers and special advisers, no one spotted the error for more than four months.</p><p>I see that in a press release of 10 September, which is still happily carried on the Scottish Government&#8217;s website today, Mr Russell again cheerfully claimed that within the cumulative amount of funding that had been paid out to colleges since 2007</p><p>&#8220;lies an increase in funding for the coming academic year&#8221;.</p><p>Surely to goodness somebody in the Government would have spotted that. Surely someone realised that the figures are going down and not up.</p><p>Even if it took four months to wake up to the facts and identify the error, it beggars belief that Mr Russell allowed the First Minister to assert repeatedly that college funding is going up and not down. If someone cannot correctly identify the detail of the decisions that they are taking, it is difficult to see how they can be expected to deal with the consequences.</p><p>It is little wonder that we are witnessing a loss of confidence in the education secretary across the college sector. The situation is compounded by the fallout from Mr Russell&#8217;s histrionics over the so-called spy-pen-gate. As James Kelly highlighted, Mr Russell&#8217;s shameful overreaction to the former chair of Stow College recording a meeting that was attended by more than 80 people and whose details are freely available on the internet exposed a side of the education secretary that many had long suspected and of which a number had felt the full force in the past.</p><p>At a time of major reforms to the college sector, a wide range of Government commitments to be delivered and deep funding cuts, one would expect the education secretary to be in full listening mode. The fact that he is not has done great damage to him and the Government as a whole. Even when what he is doing is right, he has left himself weakened and compromised.</p><p>It is right that we have had the debate this afternoon, but it is regrettable that it was necessary. If it is to serve a useful purpose, it must deliver what is needed for students, staff and businesses across Scotland. If it is to safeguard and improve quality, choice and access in college provision, it must signal a change in funding arrangements for the college sector, a change in attitude and approach from the Scottish Government and&#8212;I believe, on the basis of today&#8217;s debate&#8212;a change in the education secretary.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677831", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to Rob Gibson and to you for that, Presiding Officer.

Over the past 24 hours, the Education and Culture Committee has met twice to hammer out an agreement on its report on the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. That does not in any way reflect disagreement among us about the importance of colleges, locally and nationally, in delivering, among other things, our shared ambition of sustainable economic growth in this country. It does, however, reflect the serious concerns that some of us have&#8212;concerns shared by colleges, the NUS and a range of other witnesses&#8212;that delivering such an ambition is potentially hamstrung by the Government&#8217;s approach to funding and reorganisation and other pressures on our colleges.</p><p>In addition, the way in which ministers are driving through the reform agenda and targeting spending in a sharply reducing budget risks a disproportionate impact on some of the groups to which colleges have been particularly adept at extending access and opportunities. That is one of the key themes picked up in the David Hume Institute report referred to by other members. As well as evidencing the economic value of colleges to the Scottish economy, the report underscores the success of our colleges in reaching, as the authors put it,</p><p>&#8220;parts of society that other elements of the education system find hard to reach.&#8221;</p><p>Yet, as the NUS points out, shifts in college participation away from part time to full time, from mature students to young students and from women to men have implications for participation and accessibility. That is particularly the case for older learners and women, who rely heavily on college courses to reskill and gain entry back into the labour market.</p><p>That role for colleges is vital. As the David Hume Institute report observes, by boosting skills, productivity and earnings, colleges contribute up to 1 per cent of GDP over an eight-year period. Despite that contribution, though, the Scottish Government has chosen significantly to reduce funding to the sector over the current spending review period. In evidence to the Education and Culture Committee, each of the college unions, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges and the NUS all warned of the potential impact that that could have on Scotland&#8217;s economic recovery. In its briefing for today&#8217;s debate, NUS Scotland draws attention to the planned &#163;34 million cut in the colleges budget, saying:</p><p>&#8220;given the importance of colleges to the future of Scotland&#8217;s economy, we would urge the Scottish Government to consider ways in which the funding settlement for colleges can be improved ... to prevent the damage the proposed cuts could cause&#8221;.</p><p>In dismissing those concerns, Mr Russell points to regionalisation and the savings that he expects to be generated. However, again there is a problem, not with regionalisation per se but with the scale of any future savings and the timeframe in which they can be realised. Audit Scotland zeroes in on that concern in its recent report, which also makes clear the scale of the challenges facing the sector.</p><p>That is not to deny the need or even the desire for change, but, as Jeremy Peat has observed,</p><p>&#8220;change must not be at the cost of the crucial role the colleges play in providing opportunities to many from diverse parts of society; nor must the critical close relationships with local businesses be placed at risk.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that I have not ensured that Mr Peat is the next to be invited in for a cosy fireside chat with the cabinet secretary, but I believe that Mr Peat is right when he says:</p><p>&#8220;This is a difficult time for the sector, facing the challenges of coping with constraints on funding, implementing rapid and substantial organisational change and of playing a key role in meeting the government&#8217;s challenge to provide an opportunity for all&#8221;.</p><p>Perhaps Mr Peat may not want to answer his phone for a wee while yet.</p><p>I have no difficulty with many of the objectives set by the Government, but I am alarmed that, as well as those missing individual college chairs, Mr Russell is determined to dismiss any and all concerns that are raised by the college sector. Last year, Mr Russell was the last man in Government left defending the initial budget settlement as &#8220;full, final and fair&#8221;. I hope that he will not make the same mistake twice, but recent events prove that he is not a man who ever finds it easy to say, &#8220;I am wrong.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome today&#8217;s debate, congratulate Liz Smith on securing it and confirm that the Liberal Democrats will support the motion and Hugh Henry&#8217;s amendment at decision time.

Not only is he the new kid on the ministerial block, but&#8212;as Stewart Stevenson has observed with wry resignation&#8212;he is doubtless, as noted by The Herald, &#8220;one to watch&#8221;. I am sure that Mr Yousaf is treating that nomination as a mixed blessing, given what has happened to previous winners of that dubious accolade. Nevertheless, I welcome his promotion, and his speech. From the meeting that I held with him almost immediately after his appointment, it is abundantly clear to me that, like many in the chamber across all parties, he believes passionately in the issues that we are discussing.</p><p>At that meeting, I was able to introduce the minister not just to Malawian pupils who have benefited from a good Orkney education, but to the remarkable Kester Chiwalo. Kester, who runs a tea plantation in Thyolo, is one of those individuals who humbles and inspires in equal measure. His inexhaustible drive and energy have helped to establish, sustain and extend all sorts of ties between schools, churches and communities in Thyolo and their counterparts in my constituency.</p><p>On that occasion, the message from Kester and his colleagues was about the tangible benefits that are delivered through the fair trade movement. Hearing first-hand about how that initiative is putting much-needed money into the pockets of small farmers in some of the poorest parts of Malawi had a real impact among the audiences in the islands. I hope that the lasting legacy of that will be Orkney and Scotland&#8217;s move to fair trade status in the very near future.</p><p>I very much support the Government&#8217;s motion and I welcome in particular the minister&#8217;s acknowledgement of the role that the myriad individuals and organisations across Scotland play in enriching the relationship that our country has enjoyed with the warm heart of Africa over the course of two centuries. There is perhaps no part of the country where that is more in evidence than in Orkney. Many of those bonds have grown organically and are often the result of a personal connection or chance encounter, but nevertheless the signals and support that Government and ministers provide have been, and continue to be, vital in allowing these relationships to flourish.</p><p>That is why I welcome the maintenance of the international development fund and the Government&#8217;s strategy of engagement with Malawi. Spread too thinly, there is a risk that we dilute the impact that we can have anywhere, but the historic, cultural and other links that we have with Malawi make a compelling case for focusing much of our effort on that particular country. In that regard, Humza Yousaf was absolutely right to acknowledge the roles played by not just the previous Labour-Lib Dem coalition but, in particular, the former First Minister, Jack McConnell. He developed a passion for deepening and strengthening our ties with Malawi that at times almost bordered on obsession.</p><p>Here I should declare an interest in that my former school, Sanday junior high, won a competition that was run to coincide with the launch of the co-operation agreement that was signed with Malawi back in 2005. As a result, there have been regular exchanges between staff and pupils from that small school in one of the most northerly parts in Orkney and their counterparts in Minga, which is a rural community on the outskirts of Lilongwe. Both sides have benefited immeasurably from the relationship.</p><p>One of my highlights since being elected as Orkney&#8217;s MSP was the chance to travel to Malawi three years ago and visit Minga school. To stand in front of a classroom that was packed to the rafters with enthusiastic young learners and see their reaction to my very modest attempt at speaking Chichewa was truly unforgettable. Who would have thought that just saying &#8220;muli bwanji&#8221; could bring the house down?</p><p>I also acknowledge the significant contribution made by our former colleague Karen Gillon not just in leading that particular trip, which Maureen Watt, Ted Brocklebank and I were on, but in the personal commitment that she showed over many years to improving the links between Scotland and Malawi in many ways. Karen managed to source a set of Rangers and Celtic football strips, which were handed out to the members of Minga school&#8217;s team. I only hope that she did not succeed in sowing the seeds of potential conflict in that part of Malawi; I also hope that at least half of Minga will be dancing in the streets at some point later this evening.</p><p>At that time, of course, Malawi was under the control of President Bingu, and there was undoubtedly unease among many of those we spoke to. As things transpired, and with the breakdown in diplomatic relations between the UK and Malawi, that unease appeared justified. Thankfully, that has given way to greater hope and optimism with Joyce Banda&#8217;s elevation to the presidency. However, the challenges that she faces are, as others have mentioned, truly enormous in a patriarchal society&#8212;Siobhan McMahon alluded to that&#8212;where religious and cultural norms still too often inhibit progress on health and other issues and where poverty is absolutely crushing.</p><p>However, as Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment rightly affirms, the initial signs are positive, and not just in relation to the rights of women in Malawi, important though they are. A moratorium on enforcing anti-gay laws is also welcome&#8212;Claudia Beamish alluded to that&#8212;and I hope that we will also see the media, which was unacceptably restricted during President Bingu&#8217;s latter years, freed up to do the job that any democracy requires it to perform.</p><p>That visit to Malawi brought home to me the challenges faced by that wonderful country and the marked improvements that can be made through often relatively modest interventions and support. Help in building schools and classrooms has undoubtedly expanded opportunities for many more Malawians to access education. There is so much more to do, but progress has been made.</p><p>Access to clean water has been provided through support to dig wells, including the one in Chitengu that was funded through the efforts of pupils at Westray junior high in my constituency. At a national level, the UK Government&#8217;s fertiliser programme has clearly made a difference in ensuring wider availability of food in Malawi, while the antiretroviral programme has made inroads in tackling Malawi&#8217;s all-too-grotesque record on HIV/AIDS. Of course more needs to be done, and, as Maureen Watt pointed out, a continued focus on education and health is essential.</p><p>However, it makes sense to look at opportunities in other areas, including renewables. Again in my constituency, an initiative led by Bobby Mathieson is exploring small-scale solar panel options for providing electricity in the remote community of Ntchisi in the north, for many of the reasons highlighted by Maureen Watt. That seems like just the sort of project that would benefit from the welcome small grants initiative that was announced by the Government. Incidentally, Kester Chiwalo still thinks that the minister announced that because I had set up a meeting with him.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, warmly welcome Humza Yousaf to a role for which he is clearly tailor made.

It is absolutely right that we join others in attempting to raise awareness of the benefits of adoption both for children and, as Neil Bibby suggested, for adoptive parents too. This year&#8217;s theme&#8212;rule yourself in&#8212;is very appropriate, given how often people simply do not see themselves in that role.</p><p>I welcome the chance to discuss further the complex issue of improving Scotland&#8217;s care and adoption services as, regrettably, too many of Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable young people are still being denied the best start in life. While the Government&#8217;s motion is perhaps a little light in acknowledging those difficulties, I am grateful to the minister for bringing forward this debate and I will be happy to support her motion later this afternoon.</p><p>As the minister acknowledged, the issue enjoys cross-party support and I think that the Parliament has had a reasonably good track record on covering it over recent times. Earlier this year, the Education and Culture Committee reported on its findings following an inquiry into the educational attainment of looked-after children. Unsurprisingly, the need to improve the process of fostering and adoption in Scotland came out strongly during that inquiry, not least as it is a critical factor in increasing permanency for some of our most vulnerable children and young people.</p><p>On the back of that inquiry, and given the concerns that were raised with us by a wide range of different organisations involved in the sector, the committee identified a clear need to look more specifically at the decision making around whether children should be taken into care. That inquiry is under way, and I think that it is absolutely right that our committee has made it a priority to ensure that the voices and views of those who are directly affected&#8212;looked-after children, who have been through, or are going through, these processes and those with experience of adoption&#8212;are heard loud and clear.</p><p>I am grateful for all the insightful contributions that have been made to the committee&#8217;s work so far, but what is clear from those&#8212;and, indeed, from all the evidence over recent years&#8212;is that we are collectively continuing to fail in our corporate parenting responsibilities. Attainment levels for looked-after children, particularly those who are looked after at home, remain far too low. It is clear that the problems start at the earliest age, often prior to birth, as Neil Bibby acknowledged. Children 1st points to the years zero to three as critical in terms of &#8220;good attachments&#8221; and child development. The NSPCC appears to agree:</p><p>&#8220;Attachment and permanence in the early years provides a secure and protective foundation from which a child can grow and develop&#8221;.</p><p>That demonstrates that poor outcomes are not inevitable.</p><p>Plenty of things can be, and are being, done across Scotland. I join the minister and Neil Bibby in putting on record my gratitude and admiration for all the good work that is being done by many individuals, agencies and organisations. Many of the issues and situations with which they are confronted day and daily are unimaginably difficult and sensitive, but those are made no easier&#8212;and too often are made worse&#8212;by the structures within which they are forced to operate.</p><p>My amendment, which I am happy to move, picks up on the points made by Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland in its briefing paper. Barnardo&#8217;s believes that</p><p>&#8220;Far too many looked after children are waiting too long ... enduring multiple short-term placements&#8221;</p><p>and developing complex needs as a result. All the evidence shows that permanence is critical to a child&#8217;s sense of wellbeing and security and, in turn, to their life chances.</p><p>Last year&#8217;s SCRA report highlighted the many delays that still occur in the system, from the process of identifying children at risk right through to the point of adoption or another permanent solution. That has an impact on the children, as I know from experience of cases in Orkney, but it also has an impact on the willingness of those who have come forward to foster or adopt to remain with the process in good faith.</p><p>I certainly do not suggest that decisions in the area are ever easy or straightforward. The decision to remove a child from their parents&#8217; care will never be taken lightly. However, when it is clear that delays in obtaining a permanent home are deeply damaging for a child, and when research suggests that delays actually reduce the chances of permanence ever being achieved, it seems that the correct balance is still not being struck.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s suggests a number of developments to improve decisions on permanency and adoption, including the establishment of a national risk assessment framework to aid decision making in all local authority areas and to increase consistency across Scotland. There is still a great deal of inconsistency regarding how and what evidence is gathered to aid decision making. Barnardo&#8217;s emphasises the need to ensure that decisions are clear and are based on objective evidence and that all evidence that is gathered is used to inform the process. I am certainly no fan of a one-size-fits-all approach, but I recognise that improved data collection on things such as the time taken to place children and the reasons for delay could help to identify areas of good or bad practice.</p><p>Sadly, it is felt that, all too often, a lack of resources plays a key part in decision making, which means that more expensive options are used only as a last resort. However, the minister was absolutely right to argue that the long-term costs to the individual child and to the wider community of leaving a child in a chaotic and damaging environment far outweigh the cost of that early intervention. That is another area in which the Government must ensure that the widespread consensus on the importance of early intervention translates into sufficient resources and action.</p><p>That said, I acknowledge that important developments have taken place recently. I welcome the new parenting strategy and the progress towards introducing the children and young people bill. In particular, I welcome the plans to recognise the role of kinship carers and the efforts to increase the use of Scotland&#8217;s adoption register, although there have been concerns about the confidentiality of information and about which body has responsibility for that at the various stages.</p><p>Scottish Liberal Democrats have welcomed the proposal that the bill will increase entitlement to pre-school education. I pay tribute to the minister for extending entitlement to looked-after two-year-olds, as I believe that early education has a vital role in tackling the attainment gap that persists in Scotland and which is responsible for the continuing cycle of poverty in too many communities. A child&#8217;s development at 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational outcomes at 26 years. Just last week, Save the Children published new research showing that children who grow up in poverty start primary school with development levels that are far behind those of their more affluent peers.</p><p>That is why Scottish Liberal Democrats wish to work with the Scottish ministers to extend the pre-school provision to more vulnerable two-year-olds. The UK Government is extending free early education to 40 per cent of two-year-olds, with a focus on children from poorer backgrounds. There is certainly cross-party consensus that the same approach should be taken in Scotland. I urge the minister to support those efforts so that two-year-olds in Scotland are not left behind their counterparts south of the border.</p><p>I congratulate the Government on introducing this debate on an issue on which it is widely acknowledged that we still need to up our game. I look forward to the Education and Culture Committee contributing to delivering those improvements, which I hope can be the lasting legacy of this adoption week.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-04682.2, to insert after &#8220;from care&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;, but recognises the damage that multiple placements can have and the need to secure permanency quickly and at an early age&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Neil Bibby, I, too, welcome this debate and this year&#8217;s national adoption week.

We heard about a variety of experiences. Richard Lyle&#8217;s experience was clearly a tortuous one at various points, and Gil Paterson clearly has no attachment problems whatsoever with his 12-year-old baby, but I offer the role of poster child for the rule yourself in campaign to Nanette Milne, who demonstrated that, when the process is done right, there are benefits for not only the children who are adopted, but those who do the adopting. Nanette Milne was also right to point to the bravery of the birth parents in that process.</p><p>The scale of the challenge is not to be underestimated. Kevin Stewart and others have drawn attention to the fact that there are almost 16,000 looked-after children in this country, yet adoption accounts for only around 300 or so cases. There are particular problems, such as for children with special needs. Hanzala Malik drew attention to the problems in relation to not only ethnic minorities, but the pressures in Glasgow. An island community such as Orkney, which I represent, is probably at the other end of the spectrum, but there are tensions there, nevertheless, not least because, if a placement cannot be found in Orkney, an out-of-island placement must be found, which can be a dramatic and traumatic experience.</p><p>Overall, there is an acceptance of the need to increase the number of potential foster carers and adopters. The register is a step in the right direction. It will provide more matching opportunities, which will bring an opportunity to speed up the process. As George Adam and others have said, support for families who get involved in this process is critical.</p><p>The importance of getting it right early on was reflected in every member&#8217;s speech. The child with attachment difficulties inevitably&#8212;or almost inevitably&#8212;becomes an adult with the same issues. The right to a loving, supportive, secure environment is one that we expect for our own children, as Angela Constance reminded the chamber in a previous debate, and it is one that we should expect for those who are looked after.</p><p>We cannot duck the fact that the costs of early intervention are high, but the costs of not acting are far higher. Graeme Pearson made a number of important points in that respect, not least on the percentages of those who find themselves in prison or in difficulty later in life. I again extend my plea for the Government to look at how we might extend early education to more two-year-olds in Scotland, as that appears to be one way to deliver a greater level of positive early intervention.</p><p>The impact of delays was a feature of most members&#8217; speeches. A point that was not made in this debate but has been made in previous debates is that timeframes for a child are very different from those for an adult. Six months or a year in the perspective of a child is a very different quantum from that for an adult.</p><p>As various members mentioned, it is more difficult to find adoptive parents for older children. Graeme Pearson&#8217;s example was at the extreme end, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that that is a problem. The NSPCC in its briefing suggested that:</p><p>&#8220;Poor attachment increases the likelihood that a child or young person will have low self-esteem; find it difficult to make and sustain close relationships with their peers ... be vulnerable to further abuse as they seek closeness in inappropriate relationships; and may deal with the anger by self-harm, offending behaviour or risk-taking behaviour.&#8221;</p><p>We all agree that the process needs to be speeded up, although there are tensions between the rights of parents and the rights of the child. Mark McDonald made a fair point; we cannot simply look to fast-track this and an early decision is not necessarily the best one. The issue needs to be dealt with on the basis of evidence and robust data, and decisions will inevitably be made on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, there is plenty more that we can do. Malcolm Chisholm pointed to some of the legal and court-based problems that exist, and resources are regularly cited as a drag factor.</p><p>Looking forward, I repeat that the Scottish Government has taken a number of important steps, not only through the parenting strategy but with the children and young people&#8217;s rights bill, which I expect to command support across the chamber. The Education and Culture committee has already done a fair amount of work in this area, as its convener Stewart Maxwell pointed out. The inquiry that it is undertaking could not be more timely; themes are already emerging on ways in which we can improve the situation. I look forward to participating in that.</p><p>As the minister acknowledged, this area has frustrated the efforts of successive Governments of all political hues. It will not be an easy process, but the best chance of achieving progress is if we maintain the consensus that has been much in evidence today. We have to challenge not just ministers, but those involved in the sector, and the tone in which we do that is important.</p><p>It is the least that we can do in our role as corporate parents and it is the least that we can do to support the many people who are doing such remarkable work in this area. Most of all, it is the least that we can do in the interests of the looked-after children and young people for whom we have responsibility.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with Clare Adamson, George Adam and others that this debate has shown the Parliament at its best.

I congratulate him on securing the debate.</p><p>The motion notes with regret</p><p>&#8220;the tragic death of 43 people in Scotland last year while awaiting an organ transplant&#8221;.</p><p>It is probably worth putting on record the gratitude of everybody in this chamber for the work done by medical professionals and others, most important those who make the difficult and selfless decision to donate organs and, indeed, their families. That has resulted in 266 organs being retrieved from 81 deceased donors in Scotland in the past year, and 59 living donors donating one of their kidneys.</p><p>I thank the BMA and the other organisations for a detailed and cogent briefing for the debate. Like Kenny Gibson, I thank Kim Karam, who not only is an authority on the issue but acts as a research assistant to my colleague Tavish Scott. I commend her book, &#8220;Donation: Transplantation: Conversation&#8221;, to all members, not least because its purchase secures a &#163;5 donation to my Movember campaign in aid of prostate cancer, but also because it is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative books on the issue.</p><p>Kim Karam refers to an emotionally complex journey. In this instance, she is talking about the journey that is made by somebody who is going through the process of deciding whether to offer their organs for transplant and those who are in receipt of those organs. However, I think that the phrase also alludes to the challenge that faces legislators. The issue is not just about a legal change. Many members have made that point and Jackson Carlaw made an interesting and persuasive counter-argument in that regard. This is not just about a change in the law; there is a great deal that we need to do around that, not least to stimulate the public debate that, hopefully, this debate forms a part of, but also to raise public awareness and ensure that people debate these difficult, complex and sensitive issues far more thoroughly.</p><p>In that sense, I agree with Malcolm Chisholm that the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde campaign addresses one aspect that is a shortcoming in the law as it currently stands, which involves people&#8217;s wishes not appearing to be respected as often as they should be. The use of social media recognises the need to stimulate the debate as widely as possible. Likewise, the Evening News is to be commended for its opt for life campaign.</p><p>However, aside from the petitions and articles that the campaigns have involved, the important element is the stimulation of the debate. Every member has referred to the widespread public support for organ donation in Scotland and the disconnect between that and the lesser number of people who sign up to the organ donor register. Roderick Campbell rightly pointed out that, in a UK context, Scotland is performing relatively well but, in an international context, we have a great deal to learn.</p><p>There are complexities and sensitivities around the issue, as others have said. Any system of presumed consent has to continue to involve the families. It is a leap too far to try to exclude them at this stage. Dennis Robertson, in yet another emotional and powerful speech, set out some of the reasons why that is the case. Children and vulnerable adults fall into the category that we are concerned about. However, we will still have an active decision that must be made.</p><p>As Kim Karam has pointed out, discussions about opt-out and opt-in systems should not distract us from discussing the complex issues of organ donation as a whole. The Spanish system works better not because it is an opt-out system but for a range of reasons, including media support, better education, public acceptance of donation as the normal expectation after brainstem death, better infrastructure and having co-ordinators spend longer with families to talk through the process and expectations.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675729", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Organ Donation (Presumed Consent)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is not often that it can be said, particularly at this time on a Thursday, that Parliament is showing itself at its best, but that has very much been the case in this debate.

Likewise, while Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s amendment is perhaps more strident in tone and certainly unduly critical of the modern apprenticeships scheme, she highlights a number of areas where the Government is not yet adequately walking the talk. For that reason, the Scottish Liberal Democrats will also support the Labour amendment this evening.</p><p>In general terms, this is an area of policy where genuine cross-party agreement exists. No one seriously disputes the challenge that we face, particularly though not exclusively in improving the skills and employability of our young people, not least given the stark statistics that Gavin Brown quoted. There is even little dispute among the parties over what the policy response to these challenges should be, which is perhaps reflected in the fact that none of the Opposition parties sought to amend the text of the minister&#8217;s motion&#8212;they seek merely to add to it.</p><p>In that vein, as I am sure that we will return to this and related issues many times in the months ahead, let me make a plea to the minister. Although she rightly highlighted the constructive partnerships that have emerged in all 32 council areas, she still seemed a little coy in acknowledging the role that the &#163;1 billion youth contract initiative announced by the UK Government last year can play in enhancing the employability of young people in Scotland. As she knows, under that programme UK ministers committed to fund incentives to companies that take on young people and to provide extra support through Jobcentre Plus for unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds, so that there is an offer of work experience or a sector-based work academy place for every 18 to 24-year-old who wants one. I acknowledge that that may be reflected in the wage subsidies to which Ms Constance referred, but I hope that she will agree that, in future debates and motions, the importance of those contract initiatives could be exemplified.</p><p>On the modern apprenticeships scheme, as I said, I think that Kezia Dugdale may be overly harsh in her criticism, but I accept that there are concerns around some of the detail of what the Government is doing. The promise to create 25,000 modern apprenticeships each year is undoubtedly ambitious, but the minister has been worryingly vague so far on how that is to be achieved. What proportion of the overall number of apprenticeships will be taken up in the public or, indeed, the third sector? What demand is there in different parts of the private sector and among businesses of different sizes? The impression is that ministers have arrived at an eye-catching target but are less sure of how that target is to be met and where the demand is to come from.

Understandably, much of the attention has been on meeting the needs of 16 to 19-year-olds, although it is disturbing to note that long-term youth unemployment appears to be four times greater than it was a year ago. Many young people are into their 20s before they decide that they want to undertake an apprenticeship, yet changes to the funding rules that took place earlier this year appear to have reduced the level of support for 20 to 24-year-olds to half that available for 16 to 19-year-olds. It has been pointed out to me by a number of major employers in Scotland that encouraging more of those in the older age group to take up apprenticeships&#8212;and so progress&#8212;will free up opportunities for 16 to 19-year-olds. The minister may wish to consider whether further refinement of the scheme is needed.</p><p>In the time remaining to me, I will focus on the situation faced by Scotland&#8217;s college sector. In evidence this week, the Education and Culture Committee heard from a range of business organisations, all of whom acknowledged the critical role that our colleges play in providing the skills that our country and its economy need to emerge stronger from the current downturn. The consensus around the vital contribution made by Scotland&#8217;s colleges is matched only by the general confusion about funding in this area, as I indicated earlier. Professor Jim Gallagher referred to the problem as &#8220;biscuit-tin funding&#8221;, whereby bits and pieces of money were found to plug gaps or to respond to specific issues. He said that as well as making it difficult to see where and how funding was being directed, and for what purpose, that approach risks impeding delivery of broader objectives.</p><p>So far, the more the committee has delved into the issue of college and related funding, the more opaque the situation has become. What is clear is that the pressure on colleges is significant. As Scottish Colleges confirmed this week,</p><p>&#8220;the strong downward trend for teaching funds is a concern in terms of retaining student numbers, breadth of curriculum and quality of teaching.&#8221;</p><p>I acknowledge and welcome the funding that John Swinney announced last month, and the funding that, by all accounts, Michael Russell announced in front of colleges earlier this week. Nevertheless, as with last year, I believe that further work needs to be done.</p><p>Let us not forget that this is all happening at a time when colleges are going through enormous upheaval, with mergers and so on, while also being required to deliver a range of commitments.</p><p>The minister, along with her colleagues, needs to pay particular attention to the discrepancy between funding of higher education courses in our colleges and in our universities. As well as leaving our colleges short-changed, it sends a message to potential employers that is not helpful. It suggests that ministers attach less value to college courses and that they are somehow inferior. That perception risks undermining attempts to improve articulation from college to university and compromises our collective commitment to widening access.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674359", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not accept that at all.

Like most MSPs, I imagine, I have played my part in interrupting the odd family mealtime over the years&#8212;and not just in the McArthur household.</p><p>However, the issues that underlie the campaign are serious and deserve proper recognition, so I warmly congratulate the Sunday Post on its leading role in highlighting nuisance calls and texts. My Liberal Democrat colleague, Mike Crockart, has spearheaded the campaign at Westminster, but I believed that it was important for this Parliament&#8217;s voice to be heard in saying no to nuisance calls. I am therefore grateful to the very many colleagues who signed my motion and to those who have stayed to participate in the debate. That show of support demonstrates the cross-party nature of the campaign and the nationwide extent of the problems created by nuisance calls and texts.</p><p>The aim of the campaign is to bring an end or at least to reduce significantly the number of nuisance calls and texts that are made. I am hopeful that that can be achieved. In a little more than a month, more than 11,000 people have signed up to the campaign, which is testimony to the strength of feeling about the issue. Many of my constituents in Orkney have been in touch to tell me how fed up they are of nuisance calls to their mobiles and home phones and to family members&#8217; phones&#8212;not to mention the deluge of unsolicited texts.</p><p>Cold calling has been raised in constituency surgeries for years. In the past, the energy companies were guilty of overstepping the mark in a bid to persuade customers to shift supplier. Thanks to many local campaigns, most of the big six energy companies have stopped doorstep selling, but progress elsewhere has been slow. I recently met a constituent whose elderly mother, a dementia sufferer, was repeatedly called by a company and badgered to take out a broadband package. She finally signed up for the expensive offer, despite not having a computer. It took months to rectify the situation and get the money reimbursed, but at least that case ended positively. Many thousands more cases do not end so positively.</p><p>The bottom line is that people should not have to put up with the menace of nuisance calls, which put many vulnerable and elderly people at risk of fraud. The calls and texts can seem threatening and intimidating. To many people, they are just as worrying as the appearance of someone unannounced and uninvited on their doorstep.</p><p>It is astonishing that 650&#160;million silent calls were made in the United Kingdom last year alone, which works out as around 50 nuisance calls a year to each Scot. Across the UK, 3&#160;million people will be scammed out of an average of &#163;800 this year, as a result of obtrusive calls.</p><p>Something must be done. It is clear that the measures that are in place to shield people from nuisance calls are not up to the job. Like many people, I know that I have not had a fall in the past five years&#8212;at least, not one that was not down to some calamitous defending on the football field&#8212;I am not entitled to payment protection insurance compensation, and I certainly do not want a payday loan. That does not stop the offers coming thick and fast.</p><p>There is no escape, even for people who have signed up to the Telephone Preference Service. According to the Office of Communications, complaints to the TPS about unwanted marketing calls jumped to almost 10,000 in July, compared with just over 3,200 in December last year. In an online poll of more than 4,000 individuals for Which magazine, 76 per cent of respondents said that despite signing up to the TPS they still received lots of nuisance calls. Only 1 per cent rated the service &#8220;excellent&#8221;; most said that it made no difference.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673843", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuisance Calls"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Presiding Officer for the bit of advertising that she did for this debate.

I congratulate Neil Bibby on delivering the speech in Hugh Henry&#8217;s absence.</p><p>The motion and Neil Bibby&#8217;s introduction set the scene well in setting out the breadth and quality of the NSPCC&#8217;s work on the exceptionally difficult issue of abuse and neglect. The timing of the debate is fortuitous, as it fits well with the work of the Education and Culture Committee. Following our inquiry into raising attainment among looked-after children, we are moving to an inquiry into the decision-making process in taking children into care. Much of the NSPCC briefing will prove to be invaluable to that inquiry. We have already received a high volume of submissions, for which I am personally grateful.</p><p>As members have said, neglect is a tricky area. It is the trigger for the greatest number of instances in which children are taken into care or put under protection orders, but it is not an easy area to navigate. I was struck by a quote from Matt Forde, head of services at NSPCC Scotland, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Neglect is unique in terms of child abuse because it often relies on proving inaction such as not feeding a child adequately and can require evidence of this over a long period of time.&#8221;</p><p>That exemplifies how difficult the area is.</p><p>I was also struck by the feedback from the child neglect survey. It illustrated four or five principal obstacles to action being taken on neglect, most of which revolved around considerations about the support being provided for parents. We must not lose sight of the need to provide that support, but we need to consider how, within that, we provide the protection that is required for some of our most vulnerable children.</p><p>Early intervention is critical. Liz Smith talked about the need for preventative measures to be prioritised, and Neil Bibby and Jamie Hepburn highlighted the innovative work that the NSPCC is undertaking in different parts of the country, which draws on lessons from elsewhere, including internationally.</p><p>I received a briefing on the minding the baby initiative, which is being piloted in South Lanarkshire and East Ayrshire. It builds on work that was developed in the United States, and the early signs are fairly promising. The initiative brings together health and social work support and the service is delivered in the home from the third trimester of pregnancy until the baby reaches the age of two. That demonstrates just how early in the process we need to be engaged. The initiative focuses on the most vulnerable. It is offered to first-time mothers under the age of 25 who are struggling with problems such as depression, homelessness, poverty and violent relationships. It provides intense support and visits.</p><p>Clearly, the initiative has a financial implication but, as the NSPCC points out, babies are most vulnerable in the first few months of life. Indeed, they are eight times more likely than older children to be killed. Such statistics bring home to me the initiative&#8217;s importance. Poor attachment also has negative implications throughout life in areas such as relationship stability, educational attainment, addiction, employment and mental health. We therefore need to look seriously at such investment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Hugh Henry on his motion, which deals with an issue on which he has a formidable track record, as Liz Smith said.

I welcome the opportunity to participate and thank those who have provided briefings.</p><p>As the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning never tires of reminding the chamber, one of the central principles of Scottish education is that academic ability should always be prized above the ability to pay. By removing all grants for law diploma students and preventing them from making use of affordable, accessible loans to cover living costs, the Scottish Government&#8212;despite Mr Biagi&#8217;s loyal assertions&#8212;is failing to honour that principle.</p><p>Not surprisingly, NUS Scotland has confirmed its support for the campaign for fair access to the legal profession and the wider aim of ensuring that access to any profession is based on talent, not financial circumstances. That reflects the growing support for the campaign, including that of the Scottish Young Lawyers Association, which has criticised not only the discrepancies in treatment between those entering the legal profession and those entering other professions, but the lack of consultation in advance of the changes&#8212;a point that was made by Graeme Pearson. Although I am inclined to agree with NUS Scotland that there should be an expectation that institutions will do more to support legal diploma students and that there is still an important role for potential employers, as in the rest of the UK, that does not absolve the Government of responsibility for those students.</p><p>The supply of law diploma students may remain adequate, but they will come from an increasingly narrow section of society&#8212;that runs contrary to the access agenda that ministers are pursuing more generally, which enjoys cross-party support. Sarah Boyack and Roderick Campbell, I think, made some interesting observations about disincentives to pursue less well-paying careers in rural practices.</p><p>A point that has particularly angered those heading up the campaign for fair access to the legal profession and others is&#8212;as David McLetchie suggested&#8212;the extent to which law graduates appear to be being singled out. For example, postgraduate architecture students already benefit from five years of loan support, as do those who are training for the medical, dental and veterinary professions. Although, as the Law Society of Scotland states,</p><p>&#8220;In order to qualify and practice as a solicitor you must complete the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice&#8221;,</p><p>similar support is simply not available to those students. The diploma is essential, as it acts as a vocational bridge between the academic degree and the practical experience of a traineeship and allows students to develop their practical skills in a real-life but controlled environment.</p><p>It is difficult to see ministers&#8217; objection to levelling the playing field and ensuring that the DPLP students who most need financial support receive it. Extending the provision of a means-tested student loan for an extra year for those students would be simple to administer and would adhere to the precedent set for other required professional postgraduate programmes. Such a proposal would result in just 0.75 per cent more student loans for SAAS to authorise, but it has the potential to widen markedly access to the legal profession.</p><p>I appreciate that the sector itself could and should do more. Indeed, that has been recognised in my discussions with the leaders of the campaign for fair access to the legal profession. Perhaps, therefore, a solution lies in ministers&#8217; agreeing to address the anomaly over the immediate term but tasking the profession to come up with a workable model that can be put in place for the medium to long term. A summit such as that which Sarah Boyack suggested may be a logical catalyst for those discussions. By making clear the time-limited nature of any support, ministers could send a strong message that they expect to see the issue resolved sooner rather than later. That would also send a welcome signal of the Government&#8217;s commitment to widening access across the board, including for those who seek to pursue legal careers.</p><p>In its briefing, the campaign for fair access to the legal profession states that</p><p>&#8220;a legal system cannot hope to fairly reflect the needs and interests of all elements of society if it is drawn solely from one section of that society&#8221;.</p><p>It is difficult to argue with that sentiment.

I am also happy to confirm the Liberal Democrats&#8217; support for the bill. As others do, we think that it is overdue, but it certainly represents an important step in giving adults and children, carers and young carers, more control over meeting their social care needs.</p><p>Although the idea of self-directed support is increasingly prevalent, there is still a lack of consistency in the options and where they are available. The headline figure comparing direct payments in England and in Scotland provides a stark illustration, and the Christie commission was right to highlight that further action was needed to increase uptake of self-directed support.</p><p>In that respect, I welcome the Government&#8217;s intentions behind the bill. Enshrining in law a requirement for all local authorities to offer people with support needs four distinct options&#8212;receiving direct payments, directing available resources, having the local authority arrange support, or a combination of the three&#8212;represents a significant step in the right direction and I hope that it will ensure that everyone is able to make the choice that best fits their circumstances.</p><p>I understand that questions have been raised in committee about implementation of the new duty. Local authorities and providers will certainly face challenges in adapting to what will inevitably be changing demands for certain services and&#8212;as we have heard from Siobhan McMahon, Duncan McNeil and others&#8212;providers will, no doubt, be wary of the cost implications. The Coalition of Care and Support Providers in Scotland highlighted, for example, that</p><p>&#8220;High demand for out-of-hours care and flexible care could mean a more expensive workforce.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 22 May 2012; c 2309.]</p><p>As I mentioned to the minister earlier, there are specific issues in Orkney. In our small rural island-based community, there is certainly demand for more self-directed support, but the scope for making savings in the provision of other services is limited. That has been our experience to date. I hope that the minister will reflect on the specific challenges that are faced in Orkney and, probably, in Shetland and the Western Isles.</p><p>We must ensure that providers can meet the demands that self-directed support might place on them. Key in this is maintenance of levels of funding and of transparency. A number of groups have raised concerns that implementation of self-directed support must not be used as a cost-cutting exercise, so I welcome the strong statement that the minister made on that in his opening remarks. Examples have been cited; Bob Doris and Duncan McNeil both mentioned the situation in Glasgow, which offers a cautionary tale. The Government must ensure that sufficient funding is in place for implementation of self-directed support and that it is clear where the money is going.</p><p>I also welcome the requirement on local authorities to ensure that individuals can make informed choices about the options that will best meet their needs. However, concerns have been raised with me about the omission from the bill of the right to access independent advocacy. I know from experience in Orkney that advocacy services are vital in helping people&#8212;particularly vulnerable people&#8212;to make informed choices, so I support the calls for a right to access to independent advocacy to be included in the bill.</p><p>I turn to the second aspect of the bill. It is equally important that, as well as putting in place better options for people with support needs, we ensure that their carers have full access to the help that they need. The bill gives local authorities the option of providing support services to carers as well. At stage 1, the committee heard a great deal about that provision&#8212;in particular about the fact that the bill will not impose a duty on local authorities in that regard. Carers Scotland argues that</p><p>&#8220;enacting the legislation simply as a power will result in inequity with significant variances in practice, and thus support for carers, across local authorities.&#8221;</p><p>There are readily identifiable benefits to having proper levels of support in place universally. Carers Scotland also stated that</p><p>&#8220;Providing support at the right time can also prevent carers from having to give up paid employment and activities that sustain their life outside caring, resulting in negative consequences for their finances, health and wellbeing.&#8221;</p><p>Although I acknowledge the concerns that placing a duty on local authorities could lead to strict eligibility criteria, I believe that the argument for such a duty has much to commend it. Many carers have worried that the bill as it stands would not deliver the necessary improvements for them. I invite the minister to reflect further on the evidence that was presented to the committee on that aspect before stage 2.</p><p>A further concern, which is particularly relevant for young carers, is about the impact that the need to manage self-directed support budgets might have on people. Carers might end up having to manage personal budgets for family members on top of their caring responsibilities, which could be an unwanted burden. Several members have highlighted the views of Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, which advocates the introduction of training and support for budget holders. That suggestion certainly warrants further consideration.</p><p>Finally, the bill opens up the possibility of unpaid carers being charged for services that help to support them in their caring role. Clearly, that would not be welcome, and the matter needs to be addressed. I ask the minister to clarify the situation.</p><p>As we have heard today, although the principles of the bill are sound, a number of details need to be dealt with. The minister touched on a number of them in his opening speech, but I hope that he will cover a few more in closing the debate so that we can be confident not only that the bill will be implemented successfully and smoothly to help people with support needs to manage their care, but will bring meaningful change for carers as well.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats will be only too happy to vote in support of the general principles of the bill at decision time. We look forward to working with the Government, other parties and people outwith Parliament to improve and strengthen it as it progresses through its various stages.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Duncan McNeil and his colleagues on the Health and Sport Committee on the production of a very thorough report.

Decarbonisation of transport and heat will lead to electricity demand rising significantly but, as some members have said, we should not lose sight of the importance of energy efficiency and conservation. WWF makes an interesting point about the need to have enabling powers for energy efficiency in the bill. That suggestion appears to have merit.</p><p>Contracts for difference have attracted most comment, perhaps. They are an attempt to make investment in clean energy more attractive by removing long-term exposure to price volatility, establishing a strike price for generators and insulating consumers from large fluctuations. That is key to addressing fuel poverty, which Rhoda Grant, John Wilson and a host of other members have rightly sought to emphasise.</p><p>There is recognition of the concern about how contracts for difference will operate. A single auction for contracts appears to favour more mature technologies, but it is vital that we secure a technology mix. For example, marine renewables are an essential part of that mix. The implications for that sector and others must be taken seriously. I am not sure whether the solution is an extension of ROCs, but I certainly want those concerns to be fully addressed as the bill progresses.</p><p>It is clear that the role of a counterparty is key in underwriting contracts.

Like Kenneth Macintosh, I acknowledge the contributions of Bruce Crawford, Brian Adam and Stewart Stevenson. I have always found each of them extremely approachable and willing to listen, even when we have agreed to disagree. I thank them for that and wish them well.</p><p>I also put on record my condolences to Astrid and the rest of the Gorrie family. As Willie Rennie reminded the chamber yesterday, Donald Gorrie was a parliamentarian who enjoyed the respect and friendship of members across the chamber for the work that he did. Although Government special advisers were never his favourite species, I am grateful to Donald for the courtesy that he showed me when I was in that role and for his advice and support upon my election in 2007. He will be greatly missed.</p><p>Of course, Donald Gorrie would have approved of the Government&#8217;s plans to introduce legislation on same-sex marriage&#8212;not, as Willie Rennie quite rightly observed, so that the state can dictate what happens, but so that we can provide the churches and celebrants with the freedom to conduct same-sex marriages, where they are currently prevented from doing so.</p><p>I know from my own mailbag the strength of feeling that exists on the issue. It has not been an easy decision. However, for the reasons that Marco Biagi powerfully set out this afternoon, it is the right decision, and I congratulate Nicola Sturgeon on the way in which she has handled it. It is a shame that she is to be denied the opportunity to pilot the bill through Parliament. I think that her removal from health to concentrate on the referendum will strike many people in Scotland as indicative of where the SNP&#8217;s priorities now lie. That is not to dispute the importance of the referendum or the debate leading up to it, but the decision illustrates the problems that have been created by the First Minister&#8217;s determination to delay until 2014 a decision that, as Margo MacDonald warned, has come to dominate every debate and every issue that we consider in the Parliament.</p><p>Some members have commented on the impact that the delay is having. Other members will dispute that and say that the on-going uncertainty is having no effect at all. However, I do not think that there can be any doubt about the extent to which the issue hangs over the work of the Government and, by extension, the Parliament in a way that ensures that other issues and other priorities struggle to get the attention that they deserve.</p><p>The SNP&#8217;s result in last year&#8217;s election was remarkable. However, one of the crowning achievements of last May was Mr Salmond&#8217;s success in persuading many Scots voters that they could safely vote SNP without the need to support independence. Although that helped to deliver a dramatic result for Mr Salmond last May, it has left him with a problem ever since. Despite the SNP&#8217;s success, support for independence has remained static and has even fallen back in recent months. As a consequence, the First Minister has spent more of the past 16 months arguing for a second question that he does not support than for the independence that he does.</p><p>Indeed, as Willie Rennie and others have said, over the past 16 months independence has been redefined at a rate of knots, with ever-larger swathes of the British state being clawed back into Mr Salmond&#8217;s vision of an independent Scotland. It has even got to the stage where a number of Mr Salmond&#8217;s back benchers have started to come out over the summer and publicly question the leadership&#8217;s actions. Retribution could be severe, and some of the NATO rebels may yet find themselves playing more of a supportive role in the construction of the new Forth crossing than they might wish.</p><p>Of course, following the reshuffle, Alex Neil will now have no hand in that project. I wish him well in his new role, and am grateful to him for the way in which he always engaged in the issues in his previous post. Procurement was key among them, and I welcome the Government&#8217;s intention to bring forward a bill on that issue. An urgent rebalancing of the procurement process is needed to enable more of our small and medium-sized businesses to bid competitively for public contracts. That need not result in higher costs, and achieving it will be good for jobs and wealth creation in communities across Scotland, including my own. Nevertheless, Mr Neil has raised expectations, particularly within the SME community, and Nicola Sturgeon must now deliver.</p><p>Expectations have similarly been raised in relation to the Government&#8217;s children and young people bill. I understand the reasons why ministers have chosen to combine the two pieces of legislation, but that will present problems, and not just in relation to the scrutiny of the proposals. From discussions that I have had with children&#8217;s charities, I believe that the enforcement of entitlements to free early years care and education and the requirements that are placed on councils to assess provision locally might be more difficult as a result of wider-ranging legislation. As Bob Doris noted, welcome though the commitment to additional free early years care and education is, there is a question about why that cannot be put in place immediately, given the SNP&#8217;s promise to deliver it by 2010.</p><p>The same attitude is also evident in the SNP&#8217;s reluctance to press ahead with changing Scottish Water into a public benefit corporation, which would ensure that its future would remain firmly within the public sector but would potentially release a windfall of &#163;1.5 billion. Up until the previous election, we were told by SNP ministers that they were opposed to such a move in principle. We were also reliably informed that, even if they were to act, the money could not be reinvested immediately. Now, John Swinney has confirmed that he has no principled objection in that regard. Indeed, he is entirely happy to see Scottish Water mutualised or become a public benefit corporation, but only if Scottish voters vote for independence.</p><p>That demonstrates that the dither and delay that we have seen on the issue has deprived Scotland of much-needed investment of precisely the sort that ministers and a series of back benchers now claim that they need for the shovel-ready projects. Instead of acting by using the powers that they have to deliver the investment and projects that Scotland needs, SNP ministers are content to delay, blame Westminster and insist that they will not act until they have more powers.</p><p>As I have said, there are elements of the legislative programme that I fully support, but there are others that raise serious issues. I agree with Margo MacDonald in that regard. Christine Grahame raised a number of important issues in relation to justice. However, the sense is&#8212;and it has been confirmed by our first Scolympian reshuffle today&#8212;that the primary focus of the Government over the next two years is on preparing the ground for the referendum. If everything is always someone else&#8217;s fault, if the solution to every question is always independence&#8212;however quickly that is being redefined&#8212;and if a parliamentary majority is wielded in such a way as to suggest that criticisms or concerns about what the Government is doing are somehow unpatriotic or talking Scotland down, we are in dangerous territory. The Government must not conflate the interests of Scotland with those of the SNP.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I congratulate those who have been promoted to ministerial office today.

Other members have touched on some of those concerns. For example, one of the key strands of the Government&#8217;s strategy for tackling youth unemployment is the promise to create 25,000 modern apprenticeships each year, which is undoubtedly an ambitious commitment. Rather more worryingly, earlier this year, the minister was unable to tell the Education and Culture Committee how that is to be achieved, what proportion of the overall number of apprenticeships will be taken up in the public sector, and what demand there is in different parts of the private sector and among businesses of different size and scale. The impression was that the Government has set an eye-catching target but is less than sure about how it is to be met or where the demand is to come from.

That has elicited a fierce response from the Government. The normally phlegmatic Mike Russell appeared at risk of doing himself a mischief over the weekend, so exercised was he about those claims. Indeed, it was a mischief that the First Minister was in danger of self-inflicting earlier this afternoon. For the record, I am in no doubt about the enormous advantages to young people of undertaking an apprenticeship while in work. However, ministers refer to the 25,000 apprenticeships as a key plank in their strategy to tackle youth unemployment but are unclear about how and where the target will be met. It is hardly surprising, then, that the public assume that the policy is targeted directly at reducing the 100,000 young people whom the Government&#8217;s strategy estimates to be unemployed.</p><p>That is not to say that good things are not happening. Just this week, I was lucky enough to attend the YouthLink Scotland forum session and meet those who are involved in the Rural and Urban Training Scheme out in Newtongrange. RUTS is a great example of an organisation that uses a youth-work approach&#8212;in this case, motorcycle maintenance&#8212;to equip young people with the confidence and skills required to achieve their potential and raise their aspirations. When I spoke to some of the young people on the programme, it was clear what a positive difference RUTS had made to their lives. Interestingly, the evidence shows that RUTS can also make a difference in the wider communities in which it operates.</p><p>Another programme that is making a significant difference is the &#163;1 billion youth contract initiative that was announced by the UK Government last year. Under that programme, UK ministers have given a commitment to fund incentives for companies to take on young people as well as to provide extra support, through Jobcentre Plus, for unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds and an offer of work experience or a sector-based work academy place for every 18 to 24-year-old who wants one. I recognise that there is an overlap with some of the commitments that the Scottish Government has made. However, as well as delivering significant consequentials to Scotland, the youth contract can and must be used to expand the capacity and range of options that are on offer to young people in this country.</p><p>Before closing, I will touch briefly on two other areas that have a bearing on the issue. NUS Scotland rightly highlights concerns about the ability of our colleges to meet the demands that are placed on them by ministers. Despite a reduction in the cuts to their budgets, colleges will be under enormous pressure over the next few years, yet they are key players in providing our young people&#8212;indeed, people of all ages&#8212;with the skills that they need to get up and get on in these challenging economic times. In particular, a continued and relentless focus on widening access, in both our colleges and our universities, is essential. A failure to have such a focus will see Scotland&#8217;s relatively unimpressive track record deteriorate further, and the consequences of that would be serious.</p><p>In relation to careers advice, I make a plea with regard to the Government&#8217;s my world of work initiative. Ministers insist that they are not seeking to replace front-line careers advisers with web-based services. I welcome that assurance but feel that it sits uncomfortably with planned changes to staffing arrangements in the northern isles. Removing key posts from the service in my constituency sends absolutely the wrong message to staff and, importantly, those whom they are there to support.</p><p>As ever, there are many issues that I have not covered, but I welcome the opportunity that Parliament has had to debate&#8212;I congratulate Iain Gray and Mark McDonald, in particular, on two excellent speeches&#8212;the crucial role that our young people have in building sustainable economic growth in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that I do not have time.

Too often, the ability to speak another language is seen as something that is nice to have rather than a key skill&#8212;one that matters and which has the potential to open up the widest range of opportunities. Linda Fabiani, who I do not think has ever been in black and white, was right: for too long, we have derived false comfort from the misguided assumption that the world speaks English. As the minister said, 75 per cent of the world&#8217;s population speak no English and only 6 per cent are fluent in it.</p><p>With figures for language provision in state schools showing the most dramatic drop-off in recent years, there is a real risk that an ability to speak languages will somehow become associated with privilege rather than being an entitlement. That point was made forcibly by Doreen Grove in her report &#8220;Talking the talk, so that Scotland can walk the walk: A rapid review of the evidence of impact on Scottish business of a monolingual workforce&#8221;. I am pleased that the Government&#8217;s languages working group recommends not only that children have access to an additional language from primary 1, but that language learning should be an entitlement for all young people at least to the end of S3.</p><p>Before going any further, I should probably declare a couple of interests. As the son of a former French teacher and as someone whose sister teaches modern languages at a Glasgow secondary while sending her children to the local Gaelic school, my support for the recommendations that the excellent languages working group has made should come as no surprise. Indeed, it is probably a filial duty.</p><p>As someone who has had opportunities not only to study multiple languages at school and university but to live, work and study in Spanish and French-speaking countries over recent years, I know how much I have benefited from the richness of those experiences. There are economic advantages to language learning, and I will touch on them shortly, but I absolutely agree with the British Council&#8217;s emphasis on the important role that proficiency in languages plays in creating an outward-looking mindset among our population.</p><p>Speaking a foreign language shows our willingness to engage with the wider world, and on an individual level it can do wonders in developing self-confidence and encouraging inquiry. During a recent family visit to Barcelona, I noticed that my youngest son seemed to be as thrilled at having been able to ask the porter in our hotel which bus would take us to the Nou Camp as he was at seeing Lionel Messi in the flesh.</p><p>However, there is a critical economic dimension to this debate, as Liz Smith indicated. In a week when the views of business leaders on the readiness of young Scots for the world of work have been the subject of much heated debate, it is fair to acknowledge the long-standing concerns about how prepared our young people are to operate in a globalised and multicultural economy. The economist James Foreman-Peck has suggested that language is a barrier to trade that is equivalent to that of a tax. Neil Findlay made that point. James Foreman-Peck explains that a common language causes trade, and trade causes economic growth, so a lack of language is effectively a barrier.</p><p>I know from my experience of working overseas in a multinational company that having people with the right mix of not just language skills but cultural understanding to do business in each country is critical. After all, it is generally accepted that people buy in their own language. As former German Chancellor Willy Brandt once observed, and I am sure that Stuart McMillan will back me up on this,</p><p>&#8220;If I am selling to you, I speak your language. If I am buying, dann m&#252;ssen Sie Deutsch sprechen.&#8221;</p><p>I suspect that, somewhere in Orkney, Mr Turner will be doing metaphoric cartwheels at receiving the news that the first foreign language that I have spoken in the Scottish Parliament is German.</p><p>The cost to the Scottish economy of that barrier to trade is significant. Neil Findlay put it at about &#163;500 million, but a figure nearer &#163;600 million has also been quoted. Doreen Grove cites an example in which a major petrochemical company decided against even inviting a bid from its Scottish headquarters for a new European sales office due to problems in recruiting language speakers. That meant not only a loss of jobs, but a loss of &#163;4 million a year in investment.</p><p>I well remember a visit to Wolfson Microelectronics, where management stressed how important it is for the company to recruit individuals who have not only the requisite design and technical skills but an ability to operate in a foreign language environment. At that stage, the company was experiencing serious difficulties in recruiting, not just in Scotland but in the wider UK market.</p><p>Language does matter. It improves young people&#8217;s opportunities and indeed opportunities for those of all ages. Neil Findlay made a good point about the point at which people look to expand their language horizons, a little like Kezia Dugdale. Even when someone has proficiency, if they do not have an opportunity to continue using the language, they quickly lose their fluency and confidence. Far more emphasis needs to be placed on that area in future.</p><p>I restate my support for what the Scottish Government is seeking to achieve. My concern is, as it was when we debated these issues last year, that I am not entirely clear how the minister expects to achieve the objectives that he has set. There is nothing in the motion that demonstrates that the laudable ambition is matched by a credible, costed plan. In that sense, both the Labour and Tory amendments make entirely legitimate points by highlighting the importance, but the inadequate provision, of suitably qualified teachers and language assistants. In the case of the latter, the British Council has quite rightly been shouting its concern from the rooftops for some time. Scotland has seen the number of language assistants plummet from 284 in 2005-06 to 70 this year. We have 3 per cent of the UK total, while Northern Ireland, with a third of our population, has 60 per cent more such assistants.</p><p>Orkney Islands Council is in the fortunate position of being one of the local authorities to have such provision. I know that the support to teachers has been invaluable. Assistants not only enhance linguistic fluency; they bring a cultural dimension that is otherwise almost impossible to create. The minister&#8217;s advisory group recognised that, and I hope that that will result in significant improvements over the parliamentary session.</p><p>The group has made sensible proposals on initial and on-going teacher training and development in languages. Graham Donaldson made the point in his report that that is vital in providing teachers with the confidence that they need. However, the curriculum for excellence and, indeed, developments in information technology already offer real opportunities to be imaginative about the way in which languages&#8212;whatever languages they are&#8212;are taught in our schools.</p><p>Finally, I acknowledge the working group&#8217;s focus on the role that the higher education and further education sectors play. As well as improving transitions from primary to secondary school, there is much more that our colleges and universities can and should do to support learning and underscore the value of languages through the demands that they place on their students and would-be students.</p><p>I again congratulate the Government on bringing forward the debate and I very much share the ambition that has been set out, but we must see a far clearer commitment from ministers on exactly how that ambition will be realised. The work of the language advisory group is comprehensive and can chart a path towards the outcomes that we all wish to see. As Linda Fabiani said, we can see those outcomes if we have the patience to stay the course, but we should be under no illusions. The distance that we need to travel is significant in many areas. Marco Biagi offered thoughtful observations on that and the reasons behind it&#8212;and lifted the veil on the UK&#8217;s plummeting fortunes at the Eurovision song contest. In some cases, we are actually moving in the wrong direction.</p><p>Back in 2010, Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education observed:</p><p>&#8220;Globalisation has transformed the way we live, learn and work. The pace of technological change, particularly the ease and speed of communication, has continued to accelerate. Scotland is increasingly enhanced by people from different countries, cultures and religions, and who speak languages other than English. Education must prepare young people to flourish in this new and changing world.&#8221;</p><p>I could not agree more.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the debate and I am pleased with the way in which it has been framed.

Nanette Milne&#8217;s amendment picks up a theme that emerged in the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s evidence session earlier this week on additional support for learning. I hope that ministers will take the issue seriously.</p><p>Neil Bibby is right to express the particular needs of kinship carers, which deserve specific attention. Indeed, as a number of us saw last night at the Children 1st reception, the existence of a dedicated kinship carer support line is testament to the fact that the group has distinct needs, which are best met by appropriately trained staff and volunteers. The First Minister&#8217;s promise in 2007 to deliver parity in care allowances was unambiguous. It raised expectations, falsely as it turns out. Rectifying that may not be straightforward but, as things stand, the issue is having a demoralising effect on many kinship carers.</p><p>In the brief time that is available, I will touch on a few of the many points that merit much more detailed consideration. A distinct component of the strategy must relate to the corporate parenting of looked-after children. The outcomes for that group&#8212;particularly for children who are looked after at home&#8212;remain unacceptably poor. A commitment to addressing that persistent problem is resolute across the parties, and action is taking place on the ground. That is exemplified by Barnardo&#8217;s, Aberlour and other organisations, which are also active in raising awareness about the need to better equip those who are responsible for corporate parenting.</p><p>Emphasising the importance of the early identification of problems, risks and, when necessary, intervention will be key. There is an interesting debate to be had about how long a corporate parent should remain responsible. After all, when a son or daughter leaves home, they do not cease to need their parents&#8217; support, encouragement and love.</p><p>Seeking advice and support as a parent is not always easy, of course. A perceived stigma is undoubtedly attached to that. In some cases, it might be felt that help with parenting is for those who are in crisis&#8212;Neil Bibby made that point. In other cases, people might be unwilling to engage with services that could provide help. Each situation requires a different solution, which illustrates the difficulty in developing a strategy that is seen as relevant across the board.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s talks about the three principles&#8212;to prepare, to advise and to support&#8212;with the focus on all aspects of parenting from pre-conception through to the transition to adulthood. That makes sense, and there is much good work to draw on, which must be properly harnessed. Partnership working and signposting across and between agencies must be embedded, and the Parliament must scrutinise progress rigorously and demand changes when they are necessary.</p><p>Improving the availability and affordability of childcare is key, as the minister acknowledged and highlighted in the childcare debate that I led in the chamber earlier this year.</p><p>We will return to such issues many times in the coming months and in the context of the upcoming children and young people bill. I look forward to that and to working with all who have an interest in the subject to ensure that we achieve what is a shared ambition across the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a father of two sons, I dedicate, if not my speech, at least the flourishing grey hairs on my head to the pair of them.

Leaving aside my fading hope of inspiring a rebellion on the Government&#8217;s back benches, I thought that it was important to allow members to consider the issues inherent in both amendments.</p><p>Amendments 4 and 5 deal with ministerial powers of direction, raise questions about the relationship that ministers have or should have with bodies such as the National Library of Scotland, and reflect wider concerns about the extent and nature of the powers that ministers are seeking more generally.</p><p>I acknowledge that, following the publication of the initial bill, Fiona Hyslop has sought to define the powers more tightly, but in resisting the amendments at stage 2, she argued that her objectives are to future proof the legislation, safeguard the efficient running of the NLS, and achieve balance and accountability. That position is not unreasonable, but we are passing a bill that sets out the statutory functions and duties of the National Library, which relies on central Government for 86 per cent of its funding and will operate under a new, streamlined board structure. We are also approving ministerial direction in relation to general powers that are set out in schedule 1. They will be significant in achieving the cabinet secretary&#8217;s objectives, and I simply do not accept that a persuasive case has been made for loading the dice further in favour of ministers, even as a last resort.</p><p>In its evidence, the NLS said that it regretted the principle of ministerial direction, but Ms Hyslop accepted that</p><p>&#8220;a power of direction has never been applied to cultural public bodies&#8221;.</p><p>Again at stage 2, the cabinet secretary struggled to identify circumstances in which it might be appropriate for such a power to be used or where that could safely be done without impinging on the curatorial, cultural or professional functions of the library, its board and its staff. Therefore, when we are being asked to put in a bill powers that have never been used and for which no compelling case can be mounted as to why, when and where they might be needed, other than for general future proofing, I have grave concerns.</p><p>That is all the more the case against the backdrop of a Government that seems all too eager to exercise control from the centre. Ms Hyslop&#8217;s colleagues the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice are perhaps most noteworthy as serial offenders in that respect. On each occasion that ministers seek more powers and control, we are told that that will increase efficiency, improve accountability in how public funds are spent and safeguard the public interest, but that rarely, if ever, stands up to scrutiny.</p><p>As I said at stage 2, there are many things that would make the lives of ministers easier or the functioning of Government smoother, but not all of them&#8212;possibly even very few of them&#8212;can be said to be desirable, and those reasons are certainly not reason enough to enshrine them in law.</p><p>Fiona Hyslop deserves considerable credit for the way in which she has handled the bill, and for her willingness to respond to almost all the concerns that have been raised with her.

I will not try to reopen the arguments, but on the points that our ferocious librarian made, if we look at the NLS&#8217;s other functions, ministers would want to be assured that the board was &#8220;encouraging education and research&#8221; and</p><p>&#8220;promoting understanding and enjoyment of the collections&#8221;.</p><p>Ministers would want to be assured that all those functions are being delivered, but they are not seeking powers of direction over them.

I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to meet delegations from each of the island groups later this afternoon, which I hope will facilitate a more detailed discussion on the next steps in pressing for change that is urgently needed, as the minister said.</p><p>As we move to a low-carbon economy and address the need to decarbonise our energy system, fundamental reform of our energy markets is needed. As part of that reform, we must devise a more appropriate method of charging for transmission. I support the Government&#8217;s motion, but it risks portraying the current arrangements as anti-Scottish. That might be politically expedient, but it is untrue and not a little dangerous. As Ken Macintosh rightly pointed out, the current arrangements reflect historic realities and requirements. However, it is certainly true that if Orkney and the other island groups are to play their full role in helping Scotland and the UK to achieve their renewables ambitions, a revised transmission charging regime is needed, among other reforms.</p><p>The minister&#8217;s motion perhaps also slightly overplays the influence of this Parliament&#8217;s vote in April 2010, while underplaying the significance of the arrival at Westminster of a coalition Government that is committed to the fundamental review that is being undertaken through project transmit. In particular, the efforts of my Liberal Democrat colleague, Chris Huhne, are worthy of recognition&#8212;to be fair, the minister and his predecessor have been happy to acknowledge that on the record.</p><p>The minister reasonably acknowledged the strengths of the project transmit process and the progress that is being made through the emerging proposals, which should make developments in the north and west Highlands, for example, more viable. However, Scottish Renewables is right to highlight the risk of a potential discrepancy between indicative and actual transmission network use-of-system tariffs. The issue seems to arise because there is a lack of high-load-factor plants in Scottish charging zones with which low-load-factor plants can be balanced. Scottish Renewables has sought assurances from Ofgem on the issue, on which we must all remain vigilant.</p><p>Ofgem also points to proposed changes to user commitment charges, which have been cited as a barrier to entry by some smaller developers. Again, there seems to be a move in the right direction in that regard, although I agree with Rob Gibson that there are heavy liabilities for developers who are looking to connect in remoter locations.</p><p>Whatever progress has been made to date, there is still much to do. The issue is critical for the economic future of the islands that I represent, as well as Shetland, which is represented by my colleague Tavish Scott, and the Western Isles.</p><p>It is ironic that as the situation has improved for mainland developers in the Highlands, the competitive position of counterparts in the islands has&#8212;arguably&#8212;deteriorated. Orkney is only 6 miles from the Scottish mainland, but our transmission charges would be six times higher than those of mainland developers. The recent example of Fairwind Statkraft Orkney demonstrates that the disparity in cost is having an effect on companies&#8217; preparedness to take forward potential developments in the islands.</p><p>The risk is that the issue diminishes our ability to play to our strengths. Andrew Scott of Pelamis Wave Power observed:</p><p>&#8220;The projects we now see under development off Orkney&#8217;s coast using Pelamis technology represent a route to commercialisation and the grounding of our supply chain here in the UK. Ensuring we can export electricity from these projects at sensible costs via stronger grid connections to the UK network is a fundamental pre-requisite to achieving this success.&#8221;</p><p>It has been suggested to me that the current lack of grid, securities and the charging issues that we are discussing all have the potential to dent our international reputation as the world&#8217;s leading location for marine renewables. Therefore, I applaud the work that is being led by Scottish Renewables and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which is supported by developers, local councils, the Scottish Government and others, in identifying possible solutions to the current impasse. Their proposals are reasonable, practical and avoid setting unhelpful precedents for the future. They recognise the need to resolve the outstanding issues that the isles face through the transmission charging regime rather than through ROCs.</p><p>I cannot support the Labour amendment or the Tory amendment, but I welcome the debate and hope that Ofgem heeds the clear message that is emerging from it.

In his motion and speech, Patrick Harvie set out very well some of the ways in which that could happen that are applicable across the country, but I will pick up the minister&#8217;s implicit invitation and use Orkney to illustrate some of what is already being achieved and the potential for realising more of the objectives that are set out in the motion.</p><p>Orkney is fiercely proud of our place at the centre of the global development of marine renewables. Likewise, we take nothing but satisfaction from the interest that is now being shown by the likes of Siemens, Voith, Kawasaki, Scottish and Southern Energy, Scottish Power, E.ON and others in the various wave and tidal projects that are being progressed in the waters around our islands. If we are to avoid those technologies and industries going the same way as onshore wind in the 1970s, it is vital that we are able to demonstrate at scale what the devices can achieve.

Like Sarah Boyack, I am a strong supporter of a more decentralised model of energy generation, and I think that the potential for using smart grids has been underplayed over recent years. In Orkney, the establishment of a regulated power zone has allowed far greater flexibility in how we use our grid capacity. As a result, we have been able to unlock and unblock a host of renewables projects in the islands, many of which are community owned, that otherwise would have struggled to gain access to the grid. In turn, that has encouraged increasing numbers of community bodies, development trusts and co-operatives to bring forward projects. Most of the smaller islands in Orkney now have turbine developments that they own and from which they derive invaluable sources of revenue.</p><p>The capacity of local and community-owned projects in Orkney totals over 14MW, and more projects are in the pipeline. Orkney Islands Council has taken a stake in one of them, which demonstrates the role that local authorities can and should play in the development of the sector.</p><p>Of course, flexibility in the models that might be adopted is key, but as last year&#8217;s report by COSLA and the Scottish Futures Trust highlights, there are plenty of examples of what works from across the country, including partnership and arm&#8217;s length options. As Patrick Harvie observed, most of the examples appear to be from south of the border, sadly, but whatever the model is, the benefits&#8212;from better utilising assets and hedging against future energy costs to generating much-needed revenue and addressing issues such as fuel poverty&#8212;can be considerable.</p><p>Orkney is showing itself to be particularly innovative in that respect. Care4Energy Ltd, which is a local co-operative venture that involves public, private and voluntary sector stakeholders, including the council, is being established, and fuel poverty reduction and the provision of access to affordable energy for all in the island community will be among its aims. I am happy to provide the minister with more details about Care4Energy and the objectives behind it.

The United Nations is quoting figures of around 9,000 deaths and around 50,000 incarcerations, and there is mass widespread torture that is directed particularly at women and children, which serves only to increase our sense of revulsion. The humanitarian disaster that we are witnessing is spreading further, through the displacement that Jim Eadie and others have talked about, and much of the population is suffering from a severe lack of food and water.</p><p>This is a humanitarian disaster and what is being done constitutes crimes against humanity. Whatever the current difficulty in accessing reliable information, there can be no let up in gathering evidence and making it clear to those responsible that they will be held to account.</p><p>Although the situation has developed over the past 12 months or so, the decision by Russia and China to veto the UN Security Council resolution on 4 February tragically gave an extra impetus to the behaviour of the Assad regime. It gave the regime breathing space and there has since been an acceleration and a worsening of the violence. The use of the veto was rightly condemned by the United Kingdom and US representatives on the Security Council, but the French representative probably spoke for most when he said that it was a</p><p>&#8220;a sad day for the Council, a sad day for Syrians, and a sad day for all friends of democracy&#8221;.</p><p>Like many, I welcome Kofi Annan&#8217;s appointment. Humza Yousaf made a valid point about the Arab League&#8217;s role and the weaknesses in the organisation that have been exposed by the crisis. Kofi Annan&#8217;s new plan to end violence is not as strong as the Security Council&#8217;s resolution in February but, nevertheless, it is an advance. Like others, I greeted the news of the diplomatic breakthrough as an all too belated glimmer of hope.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson and Jackson Carlaw rightly pointed out the potential weakness of a regime that has overpromised and underdelivered. There is no getting away from the fact that regime change, as soon as possible, is the only solution.</p><p>Jim Eadie&#8217;s motion refers to the need for a comprehensive arms trade treaty. That valid point is brought home even more strongly in the current circumstances.</p><p>Despite a perhaps less than glorious past, the UK can now lay claim to having a fully robust regime of export controls, in which issues such as regional instability, internal repression and human rights are taken into consideration. It is also flexible in response to circumstances. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that, no matter how much satisfaction we can take from how that is operating, it counts for nothing if the arms trade more widely is fuelling and fanning the flames of situations such as the one that is taking place in Syria. That is why it is important that we use the debate to redouble our efforts to press for an international arms trade treaty. The UK must continue to take the lead in the creation of such a treaty. The more we can do collectively to regulate the arms trade, the better we can ensure our national security, the safety of our service members and the promotion of human rights.</p><p>I congratulate Jim Eadie again, not only on bringing the debate to the chamber but on the way in which he led it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664532", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence in Syria"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join other members in congratulating Jim Eadie on bringing the debate to the chamber, and on the powerful and moving way in which he articulated the sickening situation in Syria.

However, that is an issue that I expect to be kept under review.</p><p>Since the debate in October, we have heard no alternative prospectus from the Scottish National Party, either on welfare reform generally or on housing benefit specifically. The closest that we have come is the remarkable claim by Nicola Sturgeon that with separation from the UK will come an end to poverty in Scotland. In light of the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s assertion, it is hard to understand why the SNP is so keen to delay the fateful day when it believes that the poor will no longer be with us.</p><p>Any traces of SNP attempts at Westminster to amend the housing benefit elements of the bill are hard to divine. Doubtless, the bold group of SNP exiles were busy supporting amendments that were lodged by others, but it hardly demonstrates a vision or ambition for housing benefit reform on their part. It seems that the SNP supports no reduction in the welfare or housing budgets and that it supports only reforms that would result in recipients being better off, or no worse off.</p><p>This is a thorny and controversial area of policy. I am only too well aware of that reality from my own constituency, though anyone doubting that fact need only consider the case studies that were presented at the end of the SFHA briefing. However, to argue, as the Government motion does, that the proposals have gone &#8220;largely unchanged&#8221; through the process of scrutiny at Westminster is simply not true and diminishes the role that many organisations, from Scotland and elsewhere, have played in arguing their case, backed in many instances, as the minister acknowledged, by my Liberal Democrat colleagues.</p><p>For example, serious concerns have been raised about the underoccupancy provisions. It is worth bearing in mind, of course, that pensioners are already exempt from those provisions. In addition, however, the &#163;470 million of discretionary housing payments can be used to assist people who are adversely affected and for whom no suitable accommodation is available. A further &#163;30 million in DHP has also been allocated directly to local councils to provide specific assistance to help foster carers and those in adapted accommodation. I know that attempts were made to secure an outright exemption for people with disabilities who are living in adapted accommodation. Although enshrining that in the legislation might have been problematic, I can entirely appreciate the rationale and hope that that funding will help to address those entirely legitimate concerns.</p><p>Other changes to aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill were also successfully achieved, but I think that it is wrong for the Government&#8217;s motion to belittle those relating to housing benefit.</p><p>The SFHA makes a fair point that a considerable body of secondary legislation will flow from the bill. I know from experience of dealing with bills in this Parliament that that approach is increasingly causing concern, not least as it involves a degree of uncertainty and can limit the extent to which provisions are scrutinised and amended.</p><p>I also accept, as I did in October, that there is an overlap with devolved areas of responsibility. However, the SNP&#8217;s claim that the changes to housing benefit rules are</p><p>&#8220;compromising the Scottish Government&#8217;s capacity to deliver on its housing ambitions for Scotland&#8221;</p><p>seems to be part of the all-too-familiar pattern of blaming everything on Westminster. Ministers have done a pretty good job all by themselves of compromising the SNP&#8217;s ambitions to build 6,000 new social rented houses each year. The SNP&#8217;s 2011 manifesto commitment was made in full knowledge of the current financial constraints. However, a month after the election, Mr Brown claimed that the Government was committed to building only 6,000 affordable homes and that no target had been set for homes for social rent. By September, the target for new social rented properties reappeared, although it was significantly lighter, at 4,000 a year.</p><p>The distinction between social rented properties and those that are affordable is not irrelevant. Many people on low incomes are unable to secure a mortgage and the willingness of the SNP to compromise its housing ambitions will have an impact.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed by those in the housing sector in Scotland about the changes that are being introduced. However, the SNP&#8217;s indignation would carry more weight were the party more forthcoming in setting out what it would do and how it would pay for it.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-2407.1, to leave out from &#8220;that will&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;; acknowledges the lobbying efforts of Scottish stakeholders that helped secure additional transitional support for households affected by the benefit cap and for foster families and disabled people living in adapted properties affected by changes to under-occupancy rules; further notes that, despite its support for welfare reform, the SNP administration has so far provided no clear view on the reforms that it wishes to see; recognises that SNP MPs did not feel the need to table amendments to the parts of the Welfare Reform Bill dealing with housing benefit reform; believes that Scottish tenants and prospective tenants have not been well served by the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to abandon the SNP manifesto promise to build 6,000 socially rented houses every year and, instead, adopt a plan that involves an element of private purchase, and considers that the Scottish Government should devote its effort to meeting its manifesto promise on building 6,000 houses for social rent each year.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that I can claim some of that time back, Presiding Officer.

That appears to have excited the wrath of many members on the Government&#8217;s back benches. I know that feeling, given my intervention in the constitutional debate this week. I think that the debate might, in part, have been an attempt by the Government to justify the army of officials who now find themselves deployed within the Scottish Government to deal with welfare reform.</p><p>I return to the question that I raised at the beginning of the debate about the reforms that the SNP and the Labour Party wish to see. It is clear from what we heard this afternoon that they do not like what is proposed by the coalition Government&#8212;perhaps with the exception of the establishment of a universal credit. Despite the talk of &#8220;horrors&#8221; and &#8220;devastation&#8221;, we have not heard what changes they would make.</p><p>At least in the case of Labour, we have had an acknowledgement that spending on housing benefit has gone beyond sustainable limits. In January, Liam Byrne expressed the view that Beveridge</p><p>&#8220;would scarcely have believed housing benefit alone is costing the UK over &#163;20&#160;billion a year.&#8221;</p><p>He said:</p><p>&#8220;That is simply too high.&#8221;</p><p>He was less revealing about where, and the extent to which, cuts to housing benefit are necessary, but at least there was acknowledgement of the problems that we are trying to address.</p><p>In contrast, the view from the SNP appears to be that welfare reform is needed, but that it should not result in any reduction in the overall budget, including for housing benefit. Its policy remedy is separation from the rest of the UK. Although that would certainly allow a future Scottish Government to take a different approach, it would not absolve it of the need to deal with budgetary realities or the need to make the best use of housing stock. To pretend otherwise is a con.</p><p>Even simplifying and streamlining the welfare system, which the Deputy First Minister insists she supports whole-heartedly, would not be without consequences, including for many people who are in receipt of housing benefit in Scotland. Mike Russell took exception last week to my observation that even simplifying and streamlining the welfare system would create winners and losers, but if that is not the case, the SNP needs to explain why and how it would pay for additional resources. Notwithstanding my contribution to the constitutional debate this week, I believe that demanding more powers and promising to set up an oil fund does not adequately answer those fundamental questions.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As was predicted, this has been an emotive debate.

The debates have been useful, productive and&#8212;in the main&#8212;consensual. However, I am conscious that we have not, as yet, brought the same attention to bear in scrutinising how childcare is provided. I am pleased that Scottish Liberal Democrats are this morning helping Parliament to atone for that sin of omission.</p><p>The debate could not be more timely. It follows the recent publication by Children in Scotland and the Daycare Trust of their report &#8220;The Scottish Childcare Lottery&#8221;. That detailed comparative assessment of provision of childcare across the United Kingdom provides plenty of food for thought. It also delivers a stark message&#8212;despite the First Minister&#8217;s pledge, which he gave again at the weekend&#8212;that we are some way short of being able to claim to be matching the best anywhere in Europe. The findings underline various issues that appear to be specific to Scotland and confirm that, in a number of respects, we lag behind the rest of the UK.</p><p>That is worrying. High-quality childcare&#8212;including nursery, childminding and out-of-school care&#8212;can play a key role in supporting our children&#8217;s learning and development. Especially in the early years, as Children 1st reminds us in its briefing for today&#8217;s debate, that can be pivotal in determining a child&#8217;s life chances. Meanwhile, for parents, access to affordable high-quality childcare is often crucial to enabling them to return to, or to remain in, work.</p><p>What are some of the key findings from the report? Children in Scotland and the Daycare Trust have established that there are significant gaps in the availability of childcare in Scotland. According to their report, only one fifth of Scottish local authorities indicate that they have enough childcare for working parents. The feedback also suggests that there are specific problems in relation to provision for older children&#8212;another point that Children 1st raised&#8212;as well as for families in rural areas and those with disabled children.</p><p>Where provision is available, childcare costs to parents are among the highest in the UK. Although average nursery costs are slightly lower in Scotland, the average cost for childminders and after-school childcare is higher. In England and Wales, childcare fees in local authority nurseries have largely converged with those in the private and non-profit sectors, but that is not true in Scotland: fees in private and non-profit sector nurseries have been found to be nearly &#163;25 per week more than in nurseries in the maintained sector. It is difficult to understand why that discrepancy exists or why it is so pronounced in Scotland.</p><p>There are also geographic variations in childcare costs across Scotland, which are far larger than the variations that are found elsewhere in the UK. For example, out-of-school clubs in the most expensive areas of Scotland charge almost twice as much as those in the lowest-cost areas, while for childminders the difference is more than 70 per cent.</p><p>In the light of those findings, I do not suppose that Children in Scotland and the Daycare Trust had to work terribly hard to come up with a title for their report&#8212;to all intents and purposes, there is a postcode lottery. The high cost of childcare in some areas, the big variations in costs between private or non-profit providers and local authority controlled ones, and the significant gaps in supply testify to failures in managing the childcare market.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Liberal Democrat education spokesman since last May, I have had the chance to participate in debates that have covered most aspects of how our education system is performing, and its strengths and weaknesses.

I fully accept the Government&#8217;s view that there will be places across Europe where such good or better practice can be identified, but Ms Campbell must not allow nationalistic myopia to blind her to what is on our doorstep. I have lost track of the number of times when I have urged Scottish ministers to look at the benefits that are being delivered through the pupil premium, which is targeting resources at the children who most need them and is enabling schools to put in the additional tailored support that is most appropriate in each instance. Save the Children, among others, points to what a similar system in Scotland might achieve. However, the mere fact that the pupil premium is being taken forward by the coalition Government south of the border means that it is dogmatically rejected by Scottish ministers.</p><p>Even when it admits to supporting a UK initiative&#8212;for example, the youth contract&#8212;the SNP Government seems to be reluctant to advertise the fact. In the case of the youth contract, which can make a real difference by creating meaningful opportunities for young people to access the work or training that they need, such muted support from the Scottish Government is totally counterproductive, but it is part of a pattern. The nationalist narrative simply cannot tolerate the suggestion that the approach that the UK coalition Government is taking might be more generous or more effective.</p><p>In England and Wales, duties are outlined in the Childcare Act 2006 that require local authorities to secure sufficient childcare for working parents and those who are studying with the intention of returning to work. In Scotland, no such legislative requirement exists. &#8220;The Scottish Childcare Lottery&#8221; reports that, while local authorities in England are undertaking three-yearly assessments of childcare supply and demand with annual updates, the picture in Scotland is mixed. Some councils are carrying out detailed studies, but in the case of at least eight, there appears to be no collection of data on childcare supply.</p><p>The minister states in her amendment that the Government will work with the early years task force, local authorities and others to deliver improvements. That is a sensible approach, but we need to acknowledge the extent to which there are still serious blind spots in our understanding of the problems that exist.

There is a mixed picture. I certainly hope that UK ministers will keep that under review.</p><p>At the weekend, perhaps in anticipation of this morning&#8217;s Liberal Democrat debate, we heard the First Minister promise</p><p>&#8220;the best package of free nursery education on offer anywhere in the UK&#8221;.</p><p>It is to be delivered through legislation that will entitle every three-year-old and four-year-old to 600 hours of pre-school nursery provision a year. Although that might be welcome, it follows a similar promise by Mr Swinney in 2007, that the SNP Government would deliver 570 hours of nursery provision to the same group by 2010. While those 570 hours are currently enjoyed by three-year-olds and four-year-olds in England, in all but two council areas in Scotland, the figure is 100 hours less than that.</p><p>Interestingly, Bronwen Cohen, the chief executive of Children in Scotland, has warned that even the new commitment from the First Minister might do little to help working parents who are trying to negotiate between childcare and pre-school providers. In The Scotsman yesterday, Ms Cohen stressed:</p><p>&#8220;In the early years, care and education are indivisible. Treating them separately has led to considerable inequality in accessing services, contributes to high costs to parents for childcare and means that some families cannot make use of their child&#8217;s entitlement to pre-school education.&#8221;</p><p>In essence, those are precisely the symptoms that are exposed in the Children in Scotland and Daycare Trust report.</p><p>The First Minister has also pledged additional support for looked-after two-year-olds and children who are in foster care. Again, Ms Cohen highlights that, although that is undoubtedly valuable,</p><p>&#8220;it is markedly less generous than what is being offered in England and Wales.&#8221;</p><p>In England, investment is being made in 260,000 childcare places for 40 per cent of two-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. That entitlement to 15 hours a week of free early education represents a &#163;380&#160;million commitment by the UK Government. In Wales, the flying start programme is making similar headway. Those programmes offer examples of where lessons could be learned and of approaches that could be adopted here. Sadly, when the SNP casts its eyes south, it is invariably to condemn, as its amendment does this morning.</p><p>I recognise that concerns have been expressed by Malcolm Chisholm, in Neil Bibby&#8217;s amendment and elsewhere about the impact that changes to the childcare element of working tax credit might have on low-income families. That should be kept under review, but it is clear that the changes that are being introduced under universal credits will see 80,000 families in the UK, including many in Scotland, receiving more support with childcare. The removal of the requirement that recipients work a minimum of 16 hours per week, as well as the &#163;300&#160;million investment, will be welcomed.</p><p>Children in Scotland and the Daycare Trust have provided invaluable insight into the challenges that we face in ensuring that access to affordable high-quality childcare in this country matches the best in Europe. In addition, their report identifies a number of areas in which we lag behind the rest of the UK. That may offend nationalist sensibilities to such an extent that the Scottish Government cannot bring itself to express concern about the report&#8217;s findings, but I hope that, in working through the early years task force, SNP ministers will be prepared to learn lessons from what is happening elsewhere in the UK, and that we will start to see the more joined-up approach to education and care that parents, children and those who are involved in the sectors wish to see.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that access to affordable, high-quality childcare supports children&#8217;s learning and development and enables parents to return to, or remain in, work; notes with concern the recent report, The Scottish Childcare Lottery, which found that there are very significant gaps in the availability of childcare in Scotland, childcare costs are among the highest in Britain and that there is greater geographic variation in childcare costs in Scotland than in any other part of the UK; believes that, while some local authorities have worked hard to ensure sufficient childcare in their areas, much more work is needed from the Scottish Government and local authorities to ensure that families have access to affordable, integrated pre-school and childcare services in every community matched to an assessment of local demand, as is required by the Early Years Framework; is also concerned that Scotland is lagging behind England on entitlement to free pre-school education, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond to the concerns about availability and costs raised in The Scottish Childcare Lottery report, to ensure that the objectives of the Early Years Framework are met and to set out the steps that it will take to increase childcare support in Scotland in order to match the best elsewhere in Europe.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am well aware of the concern that Mr Chisholm reiterates.

The debate has been useful in setting out the wider role that libraries play. Margaret McCulloch talked about her experience, I am indebted to Clare Adamson for her Carnegie quote, and Fiona McLeod was once again the redoubtable advocate for libraries and their role in our communities.</p><p>The legislation is much needed. Updating the library&#8217;s governance is perhaps long overdue and, as Marco Biagi says, the bill importantly clarifies the library&#8217;s functions. It was dubbed the getting-Biagi-off-the-board bill by some but, given the self-sacrifice that he has shown throughout, I was beginning to wonder why it was taking Government legislation to progress this change until he read out the list of other people who are about to lose their jobs, including the First Minister.</p><p>I thank the witnesses, the clerks and my committee colleagues for their efforts at stage 1. There is widespread agreement on the bill but, as I think every speaker has indicated, there are two or three areas of concern, which we will need to explore further at stage 2.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the National Library of Scotland and pay tribute to all those associated with its work. I was unfortunately unable to join committee colleagues when they visited the library but, like Marco Biagi, I had the pleasure of attending the banned books exhibition, which I found absolutely fascinating. However, I will perhaps disappoint Mark Griffin by suggesting that there was no &#8220;Oor Wullie&#8221; annual there, so they are clearly not edgy enough.</p><p>The visit provided confirmation for me of a statement in the Government&#8217;s policy memorandum about the importance of the NLS:</p><p>&#8220;NLS is a national resource which exists to advance universal access to knowledge about Scotland and in Scotland ... NLS brings Scotland&#8217;s history and culture to live in the modern context.&#8221;</p><p>That encapsulates what the NLS provides.</p><p>Marco Biagi also made a pertinent comment about the changes in the physical accessibility and the presentation of the NLS. I well remember scuttling by the front door as an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh. There was never a terribly welcoming atmosphere, but that has changed beyond all measure, which reflects the changing demands that we place on the library and our expectations of it.</p><p>In that context, the legislation is necessary and welcome. It sets out the library&#8217;s functions regarding how collections are maintained, developed and kept relevant, and regarding access&#8212;acknowledging the demands for physical and, importantly, online access. The bill deals with the research function, which is a vital component of the NLS&#8217;s work, and with collaboration, recognising its role in sharing expertise and knowledge with the wider library community.</p><p>Collaboration is one aspect on which the ministerial powers of direction are focused. I accept the minister&#8217;s points about it being a power of last resort, and I am grateful for the efforts that have been made to restrict it as much as possible in response to the committee&#8217;s early concern about the NLS&#8217;s charitable status, which now appears to have been dealt with.</p><p>Some other concerns have also been allayed. The NLS has stated:</p><p>&#8220;we feel comfortable that there are very strong and effective restraints on&#8221;</p><p>the power of direction. However, it has also stated:</p><p>&#8220;What we regret is making a principle of the ability to direct the National Library.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 7 February 2012; c 705.]</p><p>There are still misgivings, and I look forward to reading the cabinet secretary&#8217;s letter ahead of stage 2, which I and my colleagues will scrutinise.</p><p>Although I would not suggest that the cabinet secretary&#8217;s approach falls into this category, other aspects of what the Government is trying to do appear to be about gathering further control in the hands of ministers. That is the backdrop, notwithstanding the fact that Fiona McLeod has made it absolutely clear that she and many of her colleagues will be a force to be reckoned with if anyone seeks to mess with the independence&#8212;curatorial or otherwise&#8212;of librarians. Given the evidence that we have taken from the cabinet secretary and others, there are concerns that it is difficult to see how the power that we are putting in the text of the bill will be used. It is a dangerous road to go down.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has certainly allayed my fears about the size of the board. The range from nine to 14 seems entirely appropriate. Liz Smith made a sensible point about the smooth transition to the new board, and we will probably wish to look at the issue again at stage 2.</p><p>The National Library of Scotland is a national treasure. The demands that we place on it have changed over the years and undoubtedly will change in the future, probably in ways that we are unable to predict now. I hope that the bill can help to ensure that the NLS continues to meet the needs of the ever-growing number of people.

That illustrates the importance that everyone in the chamber attaches to the issue.</p><p>At Tuesday&#8217;s committee meeting, Michael Russell set the scene by highlighting, quite properly, the long-standing cross-party support for curriculum for excellence, which was initiated by the previous Executive and developed&#8212;for the reasons ably outlined by Clare Adamson&#8212;by the current Administration.</p><p>I have a quibble with Michael Russell&#8217;s selective memory of the political architects of curriculum for excellence, notably his omission of my colleague Nicol Stephen&#8217;s central role in the early days. I recognise, however, that, by quoting Messrs Peacock and Macintosh, Mr Russell was more interested in making a point to Labour members.</p><p>I agreed with a great deal of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s remarks on Tuesday and this morning, not least his views on the contribution that curriculum for excellence can make to enhancing the education of all our children and young people, and on the phenomenal amount of work put in by teachers in schools throughout Scotland, supported by Education Scotland, the SQA, councils and others.</p><p>However, one of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments stood out. It was not his remarkable assertion that, since becoming cabinet secretary,</p><p>&#8220;I have delivered on every commitment that I have made&#8221;,</p><p>which I am fairly certain would have prompted quite a bit of coffee to hit the walls of staff rooms throughout the country, not to mention walls in the homes of newly qualified teachers who would dearly love to be sitting in staff rooms somewhere in Scotland. Neither was it the education secretary&#8217;s commendable self-effacement in declaring that</p><p>&#8220;this is not about me&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 6 March 2012; c 823.]</p><p>Rather, it was his statement&#8212;and he was absolutely right about this&#8212;that this is about the young people in our schools. That is what motivated the Education and Culture Committee to take evidence on the issue, just as it is the absolute priority of everyone in the chamber for this debate. Whatever our view on whether a particular school or department should be allowed to delay proceeding with the new exams, it is entirely wrong for any of us to claim a monopoly on concern for the welfare of our young people.</p><p>In the limited time available, I want to signpost elements of what I have found to be informative evidence sessions in committee over the past two weeks. The evidence has reinforced my belief that a general wholesale delay in implementing the new exams is neither necessary nor desirable&#8212;a point which, as other members have noted, the National Parent Forum has also made. The evidence has also confirmed my sense that problems remain that cannot be ignored.</p><p>I am not suggesting that Mr Russell is ignoring the problems. I welcome the audit that was announced earlier this week and the additional support being made available through Education Scotland to teachers and schools that feel that they are struggling, which mirrors a similar exercise earlier in the process. However, the fact remains that with each passing week we are getting closer to the point when individual schools will need to decide whether they are sufficiently confident in their ability to deliver the new exams to proceed.</p><p>There are risks in delay, as the SQA and the cabinet secretary have emphasised, but I do not believe that any school or department would go down that route without extensive discussions with pupils, parents, local authorities and Education Scotland. Such a decision must be based only on sound and demonstrable reasons.</p><p>I am not suggesting anything that Mr Russell himself has not already accepted. On Tuesday, despite earlier pronouncements about the need for all schools to press ahead regardless, he finally conceded that, if there is any need to delay,</p><p>&#8220;the decision will ultimately be one that schools will want to make in the best interests of their pupils and their entire school community.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 6 March 2012; c 825.]</p><p>Precisely.</p><p>Although I welcome that belated acknowledgement&#8212;as I welcome the extra support that is being provided for those who need it&#8212;I am concerned about Mr Russell&#8217;s view that any final decision on a school&#8217;s preparedness to present pupils for the new exams can be taken only in the summer. That may be appropriate for some schools, but it could be too late for others that feel that they need to start making alternative arrangements sooner, not least to allow course choices to be made.</p><p>When Scotland&#8217;s best-performing education authority makes it plain that every one of its secondary headteachers lacks confidence in proceeding with the new exams and that a decision to delay must be made in good time to allow alternatives to be put in place, it is unsurprising that teachers with concerns elsewhere in the country have taken note. The circumstances are different in East Renfrewshire, but it is not credible to argue that the concerns that are being expressed by headteachers there are unique, nor that a decision to delay needs to be taken early in East Renfrewshire but can be postponed until the summer in every other part of the country.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats remain entirely committed to curriculum for excellence. We believe that its roll-out in our secondary schools can have and is having a hugely positive impact in enriching the education that we provide to our young people. However, different schools and departments are at different stages of preparedness for the new exams. It would be a mistake to force teachers to proceed this year against their better judgment, as it would be to prevent people from taking sufficient time to make alternative plans.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662543", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Stewart Maxwell has said, this debate follows on from two detailed Education and Culture Committee meetings in the past fortnight with the cabinet secretary and a wide range of expert witnesses.

The minister and all other members who have spoken during the debate have been right to highlight the enduring cross-party, cross-sectoral and widespread civic support throughout Scotland for the campaign. Gavin Brown was also right to pinpoint the role that Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce has played in the process. I do not think that it would be unduly partisan of me to pay tribute to the role played from the outset by my colleagues, Michael Moore, Mike Crockart and Margaret Smith.</p><p>All those who have submitted bids in recent weeks will have been able to point to undoubted strengths. However, I firmly believe, as I have from the start, that Edinburgh&#8217;s credentials as a location for the green investment bank are compelling. It meets the criteria that have been set. Indeed, as Gavin Brown and Marco Biagi have suggested, the criteria almost seem to have been designed with Edinburgh in mind&#8212;but it also has much more to offer. The debate is welcome, because it allows Parliament once again to express its strong and, I am sure, unanimous support for Edinburgh&#8217;s case.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the bank&#8217;s purpose and function, which will be of central importance to Scotland&#8217;s ability to achieve our renewables and climate change ambitions. Ken Macintosh, Sarah Boyack and Rob Gibson drew on the RSPB briefing, which addressed a number of the issues. It is telling that, in its excellent briefing, which Kevin Stewart mentioned, Scottish Renewables began by asking</p><p>&#8220;What will the green investment bank do?&#8221;</p><p>Helpfully, it goes on to provide an answer, pointing to the &#163;3&#160;billion of capital that will allow the bank to play a vital role in addressing market failures that affect green infrastructure projects throughout the UK.</p><p>In particular, the bank will be critical to stimulating a significant increase in private investment, which will be essential in meeting the costs of the UK&#8217;s move to a low-carbon economy. For that to happen, it is essential that the Government acts in a way that is seen as credible by private investors and markets.</p><p>That is why I am pleased that the decision has been taken not to set up just another fund&#8212;Ken Macintosh suggested that that was a risk at one stage&#8212;but to ensure that the green investment bank does what it says on the tin. It will be an investment bank and will be at arm&#8217;s length from ministers, making loans and investments in the expectation of earning a return and reinvesting the proceeds.</p><p>The distinction with other investment banks is that there will be a clear political steer in relation to the public policy objectives that must be achieved, as well as the market failures that need to be addressed. The future success of the bank will be measured against meeting those policy objectives, as well as delivering positive financial returns.</p><p>I take issue somewhat with Ken Macintosh&#8217;s observations on the timescale. It is not necessarily surprising that the establishment of the bank will take place in phases. However, I do not dispute the need for it to be established as quickly as possible. That is why, as well as setting aside &#163;3&#160;billion to capitalise the bank up to 2015, it is right that the UK Government takes steps to enable early interventions to be made from this April.</p><p>Those interventions will be delivered through the green investments team, which will have &#163;775&#160;million to spend on commercial terms and which will operate under the guidance of an investments committee. That will not only allow time for the necessary state aid clearance and legislation to establish the bank, but ensure that no time is wasted in developing our green infrastructure.</p><p>In due course, around 2015, the bank will be able to borrow. The decision on how that will be done can only be reasonably made nearer the time. Nevertheless, the approach of creating not simply a fund, but an enduring financial institution, with early investment potential ahead of the phased introduction of the bank itself, very much reflects the needs and aspirations of the key stakeholders.</p><p>Even so, there will be a challenge, particularly in the early stages, in determining the priority areas for investment. The range of potential areas that need to be tackled if we are to move to a low-carbon economy is extensive. In each case, the levels of investment required, as Graeme Pearson indicated, are eye-watering. The identification of offshore wind, commercial and industrial waste processing and recycling, non-domestic energy efficiency, energy from waste, and the green deal all have a certain logic. However, I welcome the commitment from ministers that the strategic priorities will be reviewed regularly. That is essential if we are to take advantage of technological advances and respond to things that are, or are not, working well.</p><p>As well as emphasising the importance of the role that the UK green investment bank can play, Scottish Renewables rightly sets out the benefits of basing the institution in Edinburgh. Indeed, the urgent need that the sector sees for having the bank up and running lends further weight to Edinburgh&#8217;s case. Given its highly advanced network of financiers, developers, investors, asset managers, researchers, academics, think tanks and public agencies&#8212;all helpfully mentioned in the motion&#8212;Edinburgh appears to be ideally placed to ensure that the bank hits the ground running.</p><p>Earlier today, along with the minister and colleagues from across the parties, I had the pleasure of meeting Owen Kelly and some his colleagues, who have been involved in marshalling the arguments in support of locating the bank in Edinburgh&#8212;we enjoyed some fairly windswept, panoramic views of the Athens of the north. Owen Kelly and the Edinburgh green investment bank group deserve high praise for their work over the final weeks of the process, building on the excellent foundations that I referred to earlier.</p><p>The case that Edinburgh has been able to put forward is a powerful one. Edinburgh is the fourth largest financial centre in Europe, and its financial services expertise has both depth and breadth, which enhances the scope for recruiting and retaining staff, including key posts that may require to be filled following an international recruitment process. We have seen over a number of years how successful Scotland has been in attracting new and expanding businesses in the financial services sector, drawn by the skills on offer, the cluster effect and, no doubt, wider quality-of-life considerations.</p><p>The bid team also highlights Edinburgh&#8217;s experienced pool of world-class engineering professionals, its green infrastructure and its university campuses. Those are all areas in which the green investment bank will be active and where Edinburgh appears to have a distinct advantage over competitors. More generally, Scotland is showing progress and ambition in moving towards a low-carbon economy, particularly in relation to renewables investment. In that context&#8212;and so as not to disappoint Kevin Stewart&#8212;I am happy to namecheck the European Marine Energy Centre in my constituency. That all chimes well with the role that the bank is to play and underlines the impact that its location in Scotland could have. Add to that Edinburgh&#8217;s transport network, digital connectivity and cost-competitiveness as a location, and the overall package is remarkably strong.</p><p>The creation of a green investment bank will be a critical tool in helping to deliver a low-carbon economy. The bid demonstrates the profound benefits of partnerships across political parties and the public, private and third sectors, and across borders within the UK. The contributions to the debate and the vote this evening can only help to reinforce the powerful case for Edinburgh to be chosen as the location for the bank. I am happy to support the minister&#8217;s motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "With due respect to Paisley and Angus, both of which I understand to have expressed an interest in hosting the UK green investment bank, few would dispute that Edinburgh represents Scotland&#8217;s best hope of landing this prestigious prize.

The reasons for that are obvious and have been well articulated throughout what has been a productive debate.</p><p>I welcome Angela Constance&#8217;s appointment as the Minister for Youth Employment, and I welcome the development of a youth employment strategy and the commitment of specific extra funding to address a challenge that is serious and complex and which has&#8212;as the minister acknowledged&#8212;a pernicious effect throughout the country. The minister&#8217;s contribution was measured and constructive, although it may have been helpful if the motion had been a bit more revealing on the Government&#8217;s proposed approach. Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s amendment makes a fair attempt at addressing that deficiency.</p><p>I want, in the limited time that is available to me this afternoon, to touch on a few specific points. First, it is important to acknowledge the scale of the challenge, which is massive. As the Government&#8217;s strategy makes clear, more than 100,000 people aged from 16 to 24 are currently unemployed. As Liz Smith indicated, unemployment is rising faster in Scotland than it is in the rest of the United Kingdom. The number of 18 to 24-year-olds on jobseekers allowance has risen alarmingly over the past six months</p><p>As others do, I appreciate that those figures cover a wide range of circumstances, but that serves only to underscore a point that Barnardo&#8217;s made in its briefing for today&#8217;s debate. It highlights what it considers to be an inadequate focus by the minister in the strategy on the needs of those who find themselves furthest from the labour market&#8212;those who, as we have agreed in previous debates and in the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s deliberations, have the most complex and challenging needs, and for whom educational and wider attainment outcomes continue to be a source of genuine concern.</p><p>This should not be seen as a counsel of despair, however. There are initiatives in place that seem to be delivering promising results. Barnardo&#8217;s points to the success across Scotland of its Barnardo&#8217;s works projects, which provide specialised training and work placements for many young people who are furthest from the labour market. Effective partnership with local employers is the key and seems to be reaping rewards&#8212;202 of the 284 trainees found employment, and 65 per cent of them are still in employment after 26 weeks. Importantly, for those who are not, Barnardo&#8217;s works is on hand to help again.</p><p>That partnership approach is critical; indeed, it is recognised in the Government&#8217;s strategy document. It also underpins the &#163;1 billion youth contract initiative that was announced by the UK Government at the end of last year. Under the programme, UK ministers have given a commitment to fund incentives to companies for taking on young people, as well as to providing extra support through Jobcentre Plus for unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds and an offer of work experience or a sector-based work academy place for every 18 to 24-year-old who wants one. I recognise that there is an overlap with commitments that have already been made by Scottish ministers, but the youth contract, as well as delivering significant consequentials to Scotland, can and should be used to expand the capacity and range of what is on offer in this country for all our young people.</p><p>The initiative also fits well with a number of the key recommendations that the oft-quoted Smith group made in its report last November in relation to skills development. Scottish ministers have indicated their willingness to support take-up of the initiative in Scotland. Although I welcome that commitment, mention of it was, again, absent from Angela Constance&#8217;s speech. That begs the question why, if we are to use all the levers at our disposal, Scottish ministers seem to be a little reluctant to highlight the contribution that the youth contract can and must play.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Due to an aggressive bout of man flu, I was unable to attend the national employment forum in Edinburgh last week, so I am delighted that we are having this debate and that I have the opportunity to participate.

Like members on the Opposition&#8217;s seats, I have been flagging up the inherent inconsistency in the Government&#8217;s approach to youth employment, given the deep cuts that are proposed to budgets for Scotland&#8217;s colleges and student support. Thanks principally to the campaign that the National Union of Students Scotland has orchestrated, which I and my Labour and Conservative counterparts have consistently and repeatedly backed in the chamber, the finance secretary has accepted the need to put more of the Government&#8217;s money where its mouth is.</p><p>If I may be excused, I will make a party-political point, as Jamie Hepburn did earlier. Given their failure to articulate those concerns during last week&#8217;s debate on college funding and, indeed, in earlier debates on colleges and the budget, I do not see how either the education secretary or SNP back benchers can claim much credit in the area.</p><p>Uncertainty remains about individual allocations and the potential impact of cuts in teaching support. I also share the concerns that a number of college principals have expressed to me about the effect that a more centralised approach to distribution of further education funding might have, but I acknowledge and welcome the progress that has been made this week.</p><p>As John Park, Chic Brodie and others acknowledged, another critical player is the third sector, which is responsible for a wide range of employment services. Barnardo&#8217;s makes a valid point about the need to ensure that the third sector is integral to shaping our approach and is not simply left with a delivery function. I see that approach in my constituency. It is not easy to achieve as it often relies on relationships almost as much as on structures, but it is the right approach and it can deliver real benefits.</p><p>The cross-party group on children and young people has identified problems that are created by the relatively short timeframes for funding allocations combined with the rigid eligibility criteria and rules.

In response, the consistent message to Mr Swinney was that housing and colleges should be the principal beneficiaries of the substantial additional resources that the UK Government had made available since the publication of the budget but, despite Mr Swinney&#8217;s offer and cross-party support for the needs of his portfolio, 24 hours later, Mr Russell told the chamber that he thought that the &#163;40 million cut to college budgets over the next three years was</p><p>&#8220;a fair, full and final settlement&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 26 January 2012; c 5795.]</p><p>That seemed to be a remarkable admission of defeat.</p><p>As well as the evidence from Scotland&#8217;s Colleges about the effect that the cuts will have on the quality, accessibility and affordability of college provision across Scotland, and the warning from NUS Scotland that</p><p>&#8220;colleges may be forced to close their doors to new students ... and cut support to existing students&#8221;,</p><p>Mr Russell could pray in aid the support of the Parliament&#8217;s Education and Culture Committee in making the case to Mr Swinney for a rethink, yet the more he is pressed, the more Mr Russell digs in his heels.</p><p>Of course, Mr Russell chooses to blame Westminster, but ignores the fact that, according to the Scottish Parliament information centre, the Scottish ministers have an additional &#163;850 million at their disposal since the 20 per cent real-terms cut to college budgets was first announced. In addition, Mr Russell represents those who challenge him as being anti-reform. That is untrue&#8212;the need for reform is accepted, and colleges have stressed their willingness to work constructively to that end.</p><p>However, as Scotland&#8217;s Colleges points out, that</p><p>&#8220;should not come at the expense of the quality or breadth of provision for college students.&#8221;</p><p>In return, colleges require a fair deal, which recognises that cost savings take time to realise, that success in reforming the sector depends on the way in which reform is introduced and that the array of commitments that ministers have made cannot be achieved on the cheap. It is wholly unreasonable for ministers to make commitments and set priorities without willing the means to achieve those ends.</p><p>On the proposed cuts, which follow last year&#8217;s 10 per cent cut, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges has warned that</p><p>&#8220;The impact on the quality of provision, the availability of student support services, and the loss to expertise, capacity and morale present in the sector through losing staff cannot be overstated.&#8221;</p><p>It is not hard to see why, given that evidence is emerging that the value of weighted student units of measurement is likely to fall dramatically between 2009-10 and 2012-13. While Mr Russell emphasises a commitment to maintain college places, colleges question how on earth quality can be maintained under such circumstances.</p><p>Meanwhile, NUS Scotland expresses similar concerns about what amounts to an &#163;11 million cut in student support budgets. Mr Russell disputes those figures but, as NUS Scotland points out, the SNP manifesto pledge was unequivocal and Angela Constance confirmed that the SNP would</p><p>&#8220;guarantee the additional funding for bursaries, not just for next year, but for the full four-year parliament.&#8221;</p><p>To make matters worse, uncertainty over individual allocations makes planning difficult, if not impossible, for colleges and students alike. Mr Russell must clarify when colleges will be told their final budgets, including any strategic allocation from the funding council and how the additional funds from SDS will be allocated.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s colleges are critical to addressing the issues that were highlighted at yesterday&#8217;s timely summit on youth unemployment. They improve the life chances of thousands of people of all ages in all parts of the country.

I dare say that it will do Mr Swinney&#8217;s career prospects no harm at all if, in wielding his buckets, he avoids stealing any of the limelight from his boss this afternoon. Perhaps that is the reason why his Budget (Scotland) Bill is devoid of any reference to how the additional resources that he has at his disposal are to be deployed. According to SPICe, they total more than &#163;850&#160;million over the next three years. One suspects that even half that amount would be enough for at least a few rabbits to be pulled kicking and biting from Mr Swinney&#8217;s hat. There is still time for that to happen&#8212;I will address some of the rabbits that Scottish Liberal Democrats would wish to see emerge. Nevertheless, it is clear that Mr Swinney has room to manoeuvre.</p><p>Indeed, were Mr Swinney to heed the advice of the independent budget review, the Scottish Futures Trust and possibly now Maureen Watt, he could avoid having to increase loans to Scottish Water by &#163;100&#160;million&#8212;and recoup &#163;1.5&#160;billion besides&#8212;while keeping Scottish Water as a public benefit corporation. Moreover, his demands again this year that Opposition parties match spending requests with cuts ignores last year&#8217;s stage 3 assertion that munificence was possible thanks to</p><p>&#8220;updated forecasts of estimated income from non-domestic rates&#8221;,</p><p>&#8220;carry-over provision&#8221; agreed with the Treasury and being</p><p>&#8220;able to reprofile other spending programmes&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 9 February 2011; c 33059, 33060.]</p><p>I do not pretend that the task facing Mr Swinney is easy. I am sure that he would welcome being able to call on the prodigious talent assembled in Mr Salmond&#8217;s team of economic advisers. It is sad, then, that the advisers met for the first time in more than a year on the day that the Budget (Scotland) Bill was published. With the news last week that Scottish unemployment is increasing at double the rate in the rest of the UK, meaningful engagement with that group of experts would surely have been helpful. I feel sure that their view, if asked, would be that of most observers: that this is a budget that must be focused firmly on creating jobs and opportunities.</p><p>In that context, it is crucial that Mr Swinney takes urgent steps to reverse the deep cuts that he and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning are proposing to Scotland&#8217;s colleges. Although colleges have made clear their willingness to embrace change, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges points out that that</p><p>&#8220;should not come at the expense of the quality or breadth of provision for college students.&#8221;</p><p>I note that the City of Glasgow College assures us this week that we are all in a state of &#8220;shock&#8221;, which will turn to &#8220;denial&#8221; and &#8220;blame&#8221; before we &#8220;let go&#8221;. At that point, though, we can look forward to accelerating towards the sunlit uplands of &#8220;integration and focus&#8221;. I detect the invisible hand of Mr Russell there.</p><p>However, in return for that commitment from colleges, they require a fair deal, and one that recognises that cost savings take time to realise, that success in reforming the sector depends on the way in which the reform is introduced, and that the array of commitments made by ministers cannot be delivered on the cheap. On the cuts proposed, following last year&#8217;s 10 per cent cut, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges has warned:</p><p>&#8220;The impact on the quality of provision, the availability of student support services, and the loss to expertise, capacity and morale present in the sector through losing staff cannot be overstated.&#8221;</p><p>NUS Scotland expresses similar concerns, not least over what amounts to an &#163;11&#160;million cut in student support budgets. Rightly, it highlights the damage that that could cause to efforts to reduce drop-out rates.</p><p>The damage that is caused by the threat of the cuts is compounded by uncertainty over individual allocations, making planning difficult, if not impossible, for colleges and students alike. Colleges provide students with the skills they need to get up and get on and they improve the life chances of thousands of people of all ages in all parts of Scotland. That is supported by colleagues of all parties on the Education and Culture Committee. I hope that that encourages Mr Swinney to think again on these cuts.</p><p>The extra money that is now available to the Scottish Government means that the SNP can also now stick to its manifesto promise of delivering 6,000 new social rented homes each year. Having cut the budget by around &#163;100&#160;million, ministers have been forced to backtrack on clear commitments, with an element of purchase now required. All too often, that option is beyond the means and not in the interests of those most in need. Again, I hope that Mr Swinney will reconsider the investment that is being made in that area.</p><p>I briefly mention an issue of significance to a great many of my constituents, although college funding and housing certainly fall into that category as well. I know that the cabinet secretary will be well aware of the importance to the islands of lifeline transport links, including our air services, which remain costly to access, despite the introduction of the air discount scheme by my colleague Tavish Scott, when he was Minister for Transport and Telecommunications. The scheme was initially supported by the SNP, but last year the decision was taken to remove all work-related travel from it. At a time of economic difficulty, when travel budgets are already being stretched, that decision by SNP ministers has had a serious impact not only on local businesses but on voluntary groups, charities and the public sector. It has also resulted in services between my constituency and Inverness being reduced. Ministers blame Brussels, but their reasons do not stack up. It is a cost-cutting measure and one that is damaging island communities. Again, I urge Mr Swinney to think again.</p><p>The Scottish Government has significant additional resources to tackle the challenging economic times we face, thanks to announcements made by the UK Government since Mr Swinney published his draft bill in September. The lack of any detail on how the resources are to be spent is unfortunate and makes Parliament&#8217;s scrutiny of the bill all the more difficult. For our colleges, our housing sector and the many others across Scotland who are seeking answers, I hope that the details will emerge soon.</p><p>In the meantime, we will take up Mr Swinney&#8217;s offer to discuss the issues in more detail but, for the time being, we cannot give the budget our support.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659407", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "After the elephants, it is said, comes the man with the buckets.

Katie McKenna&#8217;s disbelief at how ordinary people could stand by while such atrocities were visited on European Jews and other minorities during the state-sponsored terror of the Holocaust was a reaction that is doubtless familiar to us all. Katie asked:</p><p>&#8220;Why did no one speak up?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 18 January 2012; c 5351.]</p><p>She may still be no closer to an answer, but her determination to speak up and speak out was plain.</p><p>&#8220;Speak up, speak out&#8220; is the central theme for Holocaust memorial day 2012, and it is absolutely fundamental. Any complacent assumption that anti-semitism, racism or bigotry are scars of the past demands the most robust and full-throated rebuttal; so, too, does any suggestion that they are problems that are only found somewhere else. The Parliament can be proud of its record on speaking up and speaking out, and on taking action against crimes of hate. I expect that to continue, and this evening&#8217;s debate is an important part of that process. I may disagree with the Scottish Government&#8217;s recent approach to legislating against sectarianism, but the renewed focus that that gave to the debate about how we tackle a long-standing scourge on too much of Scottish society was very welcome indeed.</p><p>As a Liberal and a staunch defender of free speech, I have always felt that we tread a difficult line when we place curbs on that freedom.

Today we turn our attention to a broader canvas. Yesterday&#8217;s debate was characterised by an unshakeable consensus, which has sadly failed so far to deliver the sort of progress that we all wish for looked-after children in this country.</p><p>Today&#8217;s exchanges&#8212;perhaps predictably&#8212;have been a little different in tone. It would be entirely unfair to put that down to the involvement of the cabinet secretary, who was the embodiment of conciliation&#8212;that is a new year&#8217;s resolution that I hope that he keeps&#8212;nor does it suggest any disagreement on my part with what is in Mr Russell&#8217;s motion, as I agree with every aspect of it. Again, however, the Parliament is being asked to debate a motion that fails even to acknowledge that concerns exist. Yes, we should celebrate the many successes and strengths of our education system, but to highlight where problems exist is not to talk down our schools, pupils, staff or indeed anyone else who is connected with education in Scotland. It is precisely what is required to ensure that we deliver on the ambition that we all have for our young people.</p><p>As I said, I agree entirely with the sentiments that are expressed in the Government&#8217;s motion, and I commend staff and pupils in Scotland&#8217;s schools for their hard work and dedication. Curriculum for excellence is absolutely the right approach to improving teaching and learning. Investment in early years&#8212;including the pre-birth phase&#8212;is, while not a silver bullet, the single most important tool for improving the life chances of all our young people, particularly those from more challenging backgrounds. That is a perfectly acceptable prospectus; however, both amendments highlight areas where, in fairness, ministers should have cause to reflect on how they are delivering that vision.</p><p>I will start with the early years. As I said yesterday, the evidence supporting the need for an ever-greater focus on the pre-birth and early-years phase is now incontrovertible. Children in Scotland is just one of the organisations that have been highlighting the dramatic impact on cognitive behaviour and learning outcomes of the interventions that are made or not made in that period. Stewart Maxwell yesterday and Liz Smith today rightly pointed to the rock-solid political consensus that exists on that, and I believe that the Government is building on&#8212;indeed, accelerating, in some instances&#8212;the work that was done by the previous Executive. Nowhere is the notion of preventative spend better illustrated, and that has been the focus of the Finance Committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the current budget. During that process, questions have been asked about the early years change fund&#8212;an initiative that I fully support&#8212;and the extent to which it is all new money. The committee is seeking clarification of a number of issues, including the level of funding that ministers expect to be contributed by local authorities.</p><p>As I said in the debate in October, although I support ministers&#8217; intentions in that area and the national parenting strategy, I am concerned that the Government risks funding being spread too thinly across too many initiatives. That could be addressed were ministers to heed the advice of Jeremy Peat and their own economic advisers about, for example, the future of Scottish Water. Without compromising public accountability, around &#163;1.5 billion in savings could be achieved by moving Scottish Water to a public trust. I ask members to think what a proportion of that money could help to achieve in making the progress that we all want in the early years.</p><p>I turn to pre-school education, in which there is growing evidence that Scotland is lagging behind England. Whereas all three to four-year-olds in Scotland are entitled to 12.5 hours of free pre-school education a week, the figure in England is 15 hours. With the announcement that that provision is to be extended to 250,000 two-year-olds from deprived backgrounds in England, the Scottish ministers must urgently consider how we can avoid falling behind in that critical phase of a child&#8217;s development.</p><p>Ministers should also think again about the pupil premium, even if only on a pilot basis. The pupil premium tackles educational disadvantage caused by poverty&#8212;disadvantage that starts very young and widens later. By the age of seven, children in poverty are, on average, two years behind their counterparts from better-off backgrounds, and they never catch up. In support of the pupil premium, Douglas Hamilton of Children 1st states:</p><p>&#8220;to break this cycle of underachievement, children from the poorest homes must be given high-quality additional support&#8221;.</p><p>Of more general significance for school education is the marked reduction in overall teacher numbers in our schools. The latest statistics published last month were the usual mixed bag, but they showed some worrying trends in relation to increased pupil-teacher ratios, increased average class sizes in P1 to P3, and a significant reduction in the percentage of pupils in classes of 18 or fewer. Those are not figures that the cabinet secretary can brush aside. They are not the fault of previous Administrations or factors beyond his ken or control. They also fly in the face of solemn promises that he has given in this chamber time and again since taking office.</p><p>Finally, let me say a word about post-16 education&#8212;specifically, the needs of the college sector. During the last budget, Liberal Democrats worked with ministers to secure additional funding for Scottish colleges and students, and I hope that a similar outcome can still be achieved this time round. As Kezia Dugdale and Liz Smith emphasised, it is difficult to square the ambition of improving learning outcomes for all young people with the deep cuts the Government proposes to make to college budgets. Colleges warn of the effects on available places and courses&#8212;including those relating to Mr Russell&#8217;s guarantee for all 16 to 19-year-olds&#8212;in terms of the quality of provision, staffing levels, and so on. Those effects will fall disproportionately on young people from more deprived backgrounds.</p><p>There is no dispute about the need and scope for reform of the sector, but the Government has misjudged this issue, and I detect that such misgivings are shared across the chamber. With additional funds available, ministers still have a chance to right this wrong, despite last night&#8217;s announcement. At the very least, as John Spencer made clear yesterday, individual colleges need certainty to allow them to plan for the exceptionally challenging period ahead.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658693", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Improving Learning Outcomes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We education spokespeople are on a roll, fresh from yesterday&#8217;s debate on how, as corporate parents, we must raise the unacceptably low attainment levels of far too many looked-after children and young people in Scotland.

The convener has set out the background to the inquiry well and, given this afternoon&#8217;s time constraints, I do not intend to repeat much of what he and other members have said. However, a few points bear re-emphasising.</p><p>This area of policy has proved to be stubbornly resistant to the well-intentioned interventions of successive Governments. Joan McAlpine&#8217;s mantra of &#8220;less is more&#8221; has its attractions at this stage.</p><p>Improvements have been achieved for certain groups of looked-after children, but the outcomes for too many, particularly those who are looked after at home, fall frighteningly short of what is acceptable. Ninety per cent of looked-after children leave school aged 16 or under, and only 1 per cent go on to higher education. Far fewer than half find themselves in employment, education or training six months after leaving school.</p><p>As Children in Scotland and other organisations argue, there is no inherent inevitability to those alarming disparities of outcome. For example, Barnardo&#8217;s points to evidence that shows the benefits to children of being in stable foster homes rather than being subjected to multiple placements, often over a short period of time. As we all know, permanence is critical to a child&#8217;s sense of wellbeing and self-confidence and, in turn, to their life chances. I welcome the minister&#8217;s assurances this afternoon, but a recent SCRA report confirmed that there are still too many delays in the process, from the identification of risk to the point of adoption or other form of permanence. As the committee heard, timeframes appear much longer to the children themselves, and research shows that every year of delay in the system reduces by 20 per cent the chances of a child being adopted.</p><p>Addressing that has to be a priority not just for the Government, but for local authorities. Greater focus is also needed on recruiting and supporting more foster and adoptive parents, particularly those who are capable of taking on such roles with children who display more complex needs.</p><p>Such complexity of needs is not unusual, of course. Barnardo&#8217;s has highlighted the point that there are very often multiple barriers to learning. Many looked-after children have chaotic lifestyles and are forced to cope with a range of issues, including domestic violence, alcohol or substance misuse and physical or even sexual abuse. It has been estimated that 50 per cent of looked-after children have mental health problems, which is five times the average for all children. That can be a cause or even a consequence of becoming looked after, but it illustrates the complexity involved in tackling the issues and the need, as Barnardo&#8217;s has said, for a holistic approach to improving educational outcomes.</p><p>That was reinforced for me by the committee&#8217;s visit to Glasgow and discussion with teaching and social work staff at Oakwood primary school. The profile of one class of eight-year-olds provided heart-wrenching evidence of the chaotic lifestyles that most had to contend with, the range of complex needs that exists, and the different types of support that are in place. However, that and the level of vulnerability were not an accurate guide to whether a child was looked after, although that status varies over time, which in turn presents further problems for measuring attainment. During our visit to Oakwood primary school the benefits of a joined-up approach between education and social work staff were demonstrated. That approach is a theme of the committee&#8217;s inquiry and in colleagues&#8217; comments, and most witnesses have suggested that it can and must be improved.</p><p>I must mention the Place2B initiative that we witnessed in St Benedict&#8217;s primary school, which is a neighbouring Easterhouse primary school. The scheme, which is staffed by trained volunteers who operate in the school, gives children the chance to explore their problems through talking and creative work and play. In more serious cases, parents and carers are encouraged to become involved. By helping all pupils to deal with feelings of sadness, fear and anger, the initiative leaves them more able to learn and less inclined to be disruptive in class. That integrated approach is delivering clear benefits not just for the children, but for parents, carers and staff&#8212;and, indeed, the wider community. Our two young tour guides for the day at St Benedict&#8217;s primary school were staunch advocates of the initiative, and staff at Oakwood could not disguise their impatience for it to be rolled out more widely. I hope that that will happen.</p><p>In the time that I have left, I want to touch on two issues: the early years and aspirations. On the former, Children in Scotland has provided an excellent briefing that reinforces the importance of the pre-birth to three-year-old period in determining educational and wider attainment. What we do or do not do in that period can have a dramatic influence on a child&#8217;s life chances, and Children in Scotland is absolutely right to urge us to continue to focus on that area. That will require funding. I repeat my welcome for the additional resources that are being made available, but I was struck by Children in Scotland&#8217;s claim in its briefing that</p><p>&#8220;most of the effort and investment intended to improve educational outcomes ... continues to be ... focused on the secondary school age group.&#8221;</p><p>Ministers may want to investigate that.</p><p>It is about more than funding, of course. A considerable onus rests on, for example, the planned parenting strategy helping to deliver effective support as well as the removal of existing barriers to the collaborative working to which I referred earlier.</p><p>I want to make a final brief point that relates to the aspirations and ambitions of looked-after children and young people. Looking at attainment in its broadest sense is essential, but part of the key to improving educational outcomes is surely raising aspiration levels. Numerous witnesses have highlighted the problems of self-doubt and stigmatisation and the lack of encouragement that too many looked-after children face, but despite that, 33 per cent go on to further education. As the NUS has rightly suggested, that shows the vital role that colleges play in widening access to education and offering a second chance to those who need it. In that context, the deep cuts proposed for college budgets are a serious concern. I hope that what has been said will add further force to the calls for a rethink before the budget is finally approved.</p><p>The answers that we seek to the long-standing problem of the educational attainment of looked-after children are, as Joan McAlpine said, unlikely to be found in further legislation. Less patchy implementation, better collaboration, earlier intervention and more effective use of resources appear to be the key. However, as the convener of the committee observed during a fraught evidence session and again today, we have been saying that for years, so why have those things not happened? Why indeed.</p><p>I hope that the inquiry helps as part of a process of finally getting things right for every looked-after child in the way that we all wish to see. In the meantime, I support the motion and look forward to further contributions from colleagues.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by congratulating the minister and Labour&#8217;s front-bench team on their new responsibilities.

It makes for interesting reading, although I note that it stops short of making any firm recommendation on the key issue of whether consent should be withheld from the LCM. I firmly believe that to refuse such consent, even partially, would be self-defeating and will harm the interests of many people whom those who advocate such a course profess to be defending. At best it seems to be a gesture, but it is one with potentially serious consequences. As Citizens Advice Scotland makes clear,</p><p>&#8220;Rejection of the LCM may delay universal credit and passported benefits for people in Scotland&#8221;</p><p>with the potential that</p><p>&#8220;Some vulnerable people could be plunged into further poverty&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 15 November 2011; c 548.]</p><p>The issue of passported benefits is crucial. It seems fair to assume that moving to a new regime will, in any event, take a number of years, but in the meantime the immediate concern is to ensure that a range of benefits, from legal aid and blue badges to energy assistance and healthy start vouchers, continue to be available to Scots who need them. That is certainly the view of CAS, Children 1st and others.</p><p>Interestingly, the committee felt that, by going our separate ways, a review of passported benefits could be undertaken so as to &#8220;target support appropriately&#8221;. The cabinet secretary has also suggested that she is keen to look &#8220;innovatively&#8221; at those benefits. Is that perhaps code for cuts, or does innovative and appropriate targeting mean something different in this context? Either way, the need for primary and secondary legislation will be unavoidable, which will add further delay and uncertainty.</p><p>I presume that there would also be consequences for the timing of the proposed victims rights bill&#8212;which is a conspicuous absentee from the current legislative programme&#8212;and delays to the new bill to integrate health and social care, which is a reform that Ms Sturgeon has described as &#8220;badly needed&#8221; to improve care for older people.</p><p>As I observed during the debate in October, the emotive nature of exchanges on the Welfare Reform Bill is understandable&#8212;irrespective of what Jackson Carlaw said&#8212;because of the potential impact on the most vulnerable people in our society. As, perhaps, all members do, I have concerns&#8212;for example, in relation to proposals to remove disability benefits from people who live in residential care. Like Jackie Baillie, I welcome the rethink on that and commend those who did so much to achieve it.</p><p>Similarly, Macmillan Cancer Support makes a compelling case when it highlights serious concerns about the impact that parts of the bill might have on people who are facing cancer treatment. Again, I understand that UK ministers have agreed to review the proposals, so I hope that a more sensible and proportionate solution can be found.</p><p>Other members will have other issues, I have no doubt. In a bill with the reach and significance of the one to which the LCM applies, and which seeks to introduce the most radical reform and overhaul of benefits in a generation, that is inevitable. However, if we start from the premise that radical reform is needed, it is incumbent on all of us not only to highlight where we have concerns, but to set out clearly the shape and extent of the reform that we want. In that respect, neither the Government motion nor the Labour amendment takes us forward from where we were in October.</p><p>The need for simplicity and fairness is self-evident, and the welfare system is one of bewildering complexity, which is precisely why proposals have been introduced to simplify and streamline the main welfare benefits under a universal credit&#8212;a measure that now commands widespread support. However, the notion that we can simplify without creating winners and losers is ridiculous. Anyone who believes that reform must ensure that work always pays, by removing barriers to getting people off benefits and into employment, must accept that that effect will simply become more pronounced.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the second occasion since the autumn on which I have had the opportunity to move an amendment on welfare reform.

That is unfair to claimants, but&#8212;to answer Mike MacKenzie&#8217;s point&#8212;it is also unfair to working families on low incomes who have to pay for a system that is patently not working. Over the period during which our economy enjoyed almost uninterrupted growth, the welfare budget increased by 40 per cent in real terms. That makes no sense and shows that, although a strategy for job creation is certainly essential, it is not the whole answer.</p><p>In the UK, 5&#160;million people are trapped on out-of-work benefits. We have one of the highest rates of workless households in Europe, and almost 2&#160;million children live in homes in which no one has a job. The picture in Scotland is equally grim. In those circumstances, we simply cannot keep tinkering at the edges.</p><p>What are the alternative proposals that are being put forward? This week, Labour&#8217;s shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ed Balls, promised to get tough on spending, including taking a tough approach to welfare reform. He said:</p><p>&#8220;We will be taking a tougher approach to conditionality.

However, if reducing the welfare budget in Scotland by an estimated &#163;2.5&#160;billion is anathema to the SNP, can we assume that that is, in due course, to be added to the cost of independence?

Duncan McNeil set a very good tone at the outset, and I acknowledge the commitment that he has shown over many years to the issues that we have discussed, not least in his current role as the convener of the Health and Sport Committee. However, he recognises that work is the best way out of poverty; it is not just about making the system simpler.</p><p>Bob Doris started his speech with a number of demands of any reform programme. I certainly could not take exception to any of those demands. A similar sentiment was expressed by Annabelle Ewing, Richard Lyle and other members, who emphasised the need for greater simplicity. However, there seemed to be an underlying assumption that the process of simplification is pain free, or that making work pay can be brought about through reform that will not result in the removal or reduction of benefits that many people receive. I fully accept that reform needs to happen against the backdrop of proper safety nets, but it is nonsensical to suggest that the option is somehow pain free.</p><p>I appreciate that serious and detailed concerns remain in the debate and as a result of the work of the three committees that have been involved in the process, and I would argue that more changes are needed. Mary Scanlon, Siobhan McMahon and the cabinet secretary at the outset have pointed to welcome changes that have already been made, whether in relation to mobility allowances, housing benefits or the Harrington recommendations. To respond to a point that Siobhan McMahon made, perhaps it is unrealistic to think that amendments will not be tabled to a bill of such a size. I cannot think of any such bill in respect of which that has been the case.</p><p>Passions will run high on the issue. Jamie Hepburn is absolutely right&#8212;I have said that twice in one speech; perhaps that is a record, or it may be something to do with Christmas. The volume of briefings and correspondence on the issue is testimony to the extent to which people feel passionately about it. However, Jamie Hepburn may need to explain why he believes that Citizens Advice Scotland, Children 1st and the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland are all wrong on the approach that they advocate to this evening&#8217;s vote.</p><p>It is not good enough for someone to say that they are in favour of reform without setting out its details.

The issue was largely ducked in the good times while the welfare budget ballooned.</p><p>I do not agree with Jackson Carlaw that the Scottish Government has no right to meddle&#8212;he used words to that effect. Engagement is needed. That is not to say that every point on every issue will be conceded, but the Government has an unavoidable responsibility to set out the details of the reform that it wishes to see, particularly for those who are demanding more or absolute control over the issues.</p><p>We need to create a welfare system that is simple to understand, lifts people out of poverty, makes work pay and always includes a proper and effective safety net for those who need it, but we need to be realistic about all that that entails.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not have time.

The UK Government has made clear its commitment to funding incentives to companies that take on young people as well as to providing extra support through Jobcentre Plus for unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds and an offer of work experience or a sector-based work academy place for every 18 to 24-year-old who wants one.</p><p>I recognise that there is a considerable overlap with commitments that Scottish ministers have already made, but we need to know whether the significant consequentials that arise from the establishment of the youth contract will be used to expand those commitments along the lines proposed south of the border, which fit well with a number of the key recommendations on skills development that the Smith group proposed last week.</p><p>Indeed, I was struck by the entirely valid points that NUS Scotland made earlier this week on the need to ensure that the Scottish Government&#8217;s focus on 16 to 19-year-olds</p><p>&#8220;does not come at the expense of those returning to study later in life, whether this is those aged 18-24 or older.&#8221;</p><p>It appears that the UK Government&#8217;s youth contract initiative provides an opportunity to address a key point of legitimate concern that I know is shared by colleges.</p><p>Finally, I will touch on another concern that is shared by students and colleges and in relation to which clarity and a change of tack from the Scottish Government are urgently needed. It is not just NUS Scotland that sees an inherent inconsistency between Scottish ministers&#8217; statements about the priority that they attach to tackling the high levels of youth unemployment and their decision in the current budget to slash college spending by &#163;74 million over the next three years. As NUS Scotland makes clear, the proposed funding settlement is</p><p>&#8220;jeopardising the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to maintain college places&#8221;.</p><p>Scottish colleges insist that the level of savings that ministers are seeking, given that the pain is being front-loaded at a point when the costs of restructuring are likely to be highest, is impossible to achieve</p><p>&#8220;without seriously compromising quality and the number of students that can be taught.&#8221;</p><p>That makes no sense, whatever ministers assert.

Before I turn to my specific concerns about the decision to cut any and all work-related travel from the air discount scheme, I want to acknowledge the cross-party support my motion has received and I thank all those who have signed the motion and joined me in calling for ministers to review the decision. I look forward to hearing colleagues&#8217; contributions as well as the response from the minister.</p><p>I shall set out why I think the decision must be not only reviewed but overturned. In making that case, I shall highlight the damage the cut is already causing and is likely to cause as well as the entirely spurious basis on which the decision was made.</p><p>It might be helpful if I start with a little historical context. The air discount scheme was introduced in 2006 by my colleague, Tavish Scott. It followed years of debate about how to address the real social and economic disadvantage suffered by communities across the Highlands and Islands as a result of the high cost of accessing lifeline air services. Providing a 40 per cent reduction on air fares for all those mainly resident in the islands and the north and west Highlands was a very deliberate attempt to level the playing field. As someone born and brought up in Shetland, Tavish Scott understood fully the inextricable link between economic development on the one hand and social cohesion and population retention on the other.</p><p>It is that link, presumably, that convinced the European Commission that the scheme was indeed a genuine aid of social character. The same link, however, was completely ignored by the Scottish Government in choosing back in April arbitrarily to remove work-related travel from the scheme. In seeking to justify their decision to cut the ADS, Scottish ministers made three claims. The first was that it was never the intention of the scheme to cover work-related travel. The second was that the scheme risks contravening European Union state-aid rules, raising the possibility of fines and potential clawback. Finally, Mr Brown told me that</p><p>&#8220;we do not believe that a publicly funded scheme should be used to subsidise public and private sector travel budgets.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 23 December 2010; c 31968.]</p><p>Let me take each of the arguments in turn. First, it is ludicrous for Scottish National Party ministers to argue that they know better the intentions of Tavish Scott, Jim Wallace and those responsible for putting in place the ADS. Indeed, presumably Mr Brown&#8217;s predecessor, Stewart Stevenson, had the same intentions when he rolled forward the ADS unamended in 2008, or is the Government now saying that Mr Stevenson did not know what he was doing?</p><p>The second argument&#8212;that the scheme somehow contravenes EU state-aid rules&#8212;is equally specious, or suggests that the Government believes the Commission does not know what it is doing. The truth is that similar schemes are in operation across the EU, in the Balearics, Madeira, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Corsica and, most recently, the German islands. When the Corsican scheme was approved in 2005, the announcement specifically stated that</p><p>&#8220;the Commission considers that living on an island can be a disadvantage which justifies transport aid&#8221;.</p><p>So, it is clear that the Commission had no concerns about the scheme operating in the Highlands and Islands and would have been content to sanction a further extension from April 2011. Scottish ministers, who admit to carrying out no assessment of other schemes operating in the EU, have used state-aid rules as a smokescreen to press ahead with cuts to the scheme that were both unnecessary and potentially hugely damaging.</p><p>Having applied for the removal of work-related travel from the ADS, ministers have succeeded in building those new conditions into the scheme approved by the Commission. At a meeting in June with Tavish Scott and me, the minister and cabinet secretary agreed to seek further guidance on the Commission&#8217;s position. That seemed like a half-hearted attempt to close the door after having pushed the horse into bolting. The fact that the same undertaking was then made to the leaders of the three islands councils three months later confirmed a total lack of urgency or a total lack of appetite by ministers to deal with the issue seriously.</p><p>The final argument used to support the cut to the ADS is that public funding should not be used to subsidise business travel. Again, that is nonsense. When tolls were removed from bridges across Scotland, businesses were not asked to keep coughing up. In announcing plans in January to extend the scheme to Colonsay residents, Mr Brown said the Government recognises</p><p>&#8220;the social and economic benefits that an extension to this scheme will ... bring&#8221;.</p><p>Ministers boast of the benefit to businesses in the Western Isles of the road equivalent tariff, or RET, the record-breaking pilot scheme targeted solely at that community for reasons best explained by SNP strategists. In that case, the subsidy to business comes at a cost not just to the public purse but to many businesses in Orkney and Shetland that have seen the displacement of tourism traffic and a competitive advantage handed to counterparts in the Western Isles.</p><p>The reasons offered by ministers for cutting the ADS simply do not stack up. Perhaps that explains why there was no prior consultation on the proposal, which was slipped out in budget documents last December. In a recent survey of businesses, charities, voluntary groups and the public sector in Orkney, almost 60 per cent of respondents said that they were unaware of the cut before its introduction in April. Even now, 73 per cent say that they do not know how the cut would be enforced. Indeed, the advice from the Government and some of its back benchers seems to be, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell.&#8221; That is a ridiculous situation that is giving rise to confusion, inconsistency and, increasingly, anger.</p><p>Likewise, assessing the impact of the decision&#8212;in the islands at least&#8212;has been left to Tavish Scott and me. The feedback over the summer shows that damage is already is being done to business competitiveness, skills training and the ability of charities, voluntary organisations and public bodies to participate in events and networking opportunities on the Scottish mainland. Some 77 per cent of respondents to the survey that I carried out on Orkney insisted that they will have to cut back on the flights that they make, over and above the decisions that they had already taken as a result of the economic climate. Even so, almost half confirmed that their travel costs will still increase. One firm said:</p><p>&#8220;Air transport is a vital link for us, allowing us to forge new links with suppliers/contractors, negotiate becoming involved with public/private funding opportunities and bringing new money into Orkney. To attend conferences raises our profile and the profile of the county, especially in terms of marine renewables&#8221;.</p><p>Another firm said:</p><p>&#8220;the ability to travel and participate in relevant events is essential, not just to our business, but to ensure Orkney has properly skilled people locally and to keep them in our economy&#8221;.</p><p>Another firm talked about the risk that the cut to the ADS and an inability to travel could</p><p>&#8220;result in housing in the isles becoming marginalised&#8221;.</p><p>The evidence therefore shows that the cut to the ADS has increased costs, eroded business competitiveness and undermined efforts to improve skill levels. Over a period, the risk is that businesses, voluntary groups and the public sector in Orkney will become more isolated from wider networks and the places where decisions that affect them are taken.</p><p>There is also a clear threat to the lifeline routes themselves. The service between Kirkwall and Inverness has already been reduced following a sharp decline in passenger numbers that was directly prompted by the ADS cut. The figures for September are not yet out, but from anecdotal evidence and from speaking to staff at Kirkwall airport, I believe that there is a real danger that we will see passenger numbers continuing to fall dramatically.</p><p>The situation is not sustainable. Asking ever-smaller numbers of passengers to pay ever-higher prices to fly is a recipe for disaster, particularly for a lifeline air service.</p><p>The basis for the decision to cut the ADS is untenable, the impact is unsustainable, and the case for a rethink is now unanswerable. I hope that the minister recognises the strength of feeling and the breadth of support that the campaign enjoys, and that he will confirm his intention to reverse the unnecessary, ill-founded and damaging cut.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654743", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Discount Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead a debate on an issue that I have been pursuing over many months, as I know the minister will testify.

It is not surprising that much of that debate focused on the challenges of achieving that for looked-after children, and I welcome the further opportunity for more detailed consideration of the serious and complex issues in that area of public policy. As other members have suggested, the debate helpfully coincides with the start of the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s inquiry into improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. It is therefore safe to assume that we will not fail through a lack of focus those whose interests we all wish to see better served. I have been struck by the number of insightful contributions that have been made so far.</p><p>The warning from Barnardo&#8217;s is stark: as a corporate parent, Scotland is failing looked-after and accommodated children. That is not to say, as others have suggested, that important improvements have not been made for some looked-after children, but the overall picture is not encouraging, particularly the outcomes for those who are looked after at home. Liz Smith and Stewart Maxwell highlighted some galling statistics in that respect. That said, Stewart Maxwell, Anne McTaggart and other members have put on record Parliament&#8217;s gratitude and respect for the work that is done by many people in the area. I associate myself with those remarks.</p><p>There is no grim inevitability to all this. Things can be done. There are interventions that have been shown to improve significantly the outcomes for and attainment&#8212;in its widest possible sense&#8212;of those who are looked after. However, as Claire Burns of the centre for excellence for looked-after children in Scotland testified yesterday, that is too often not happening. All the evidence shows that permanence is critical to a child&#8217;s sense of wellbeing, self-confidence and, in turn, life chances. Sadly, the SCRA&#8217;s report vividly highlights the fact that there are still far too many delays in the process from identification of risk to the point of adoption or other form of permanence. It is clear that the decision to remove a child from the parental home should never be taken lightly and that proper safeguards need to be in place to protect the interests of parents as well as children, but delays in decision making and in obtaining a permanent home can undermine a child&#8217;s long-term life chances. The minister echoed a point that was made by Bryan Evans of Children 1st in the Education and Culture Committee yesterday: the timeframes appear considerably longer to the children themselves. Research shows that every year of delay in the system reduces the chances of a child being adopted by 20 per cent.</p><p>I listened with interest to Gil Paterson&#8217;s insights, but I know from experience in my constituency that frustration with the speed with which and the way in which the system works&#8212;social workers, the courts and hearings system are involved&#8212;has dissuaded potential adopters from putting themselves forward. That is extremely worrying. Barnardo&#8217;s and others are right to call for a more effective and joined-up approach and ownership among those who are involved in the process, but they are also right in pressing the Government to take urgent action to help to recruit and support more foster and adoptive parents, particularly people who are capable of taking on such roles with children who display more complex needs.</p><p>One point that ministers might wish to reflect on further is an issue that Sara Lurie from the Fostering Network Scotland raised. She said that the lack of foster limits in Scotland means that foster parents can have up to six unrelated children in their care, which seems far from ideal and must surely run the risk of turning people away from fostering altogether. That concern was expressed by my former colleague Robert Brown, who did a great deal of excellent work on the issue in the Parliament and the Government.</p><p>Robert Brown was also concerned about the apparent lack of feel in the Government for the overall numbers of foster carers; for where the greatest pressures exist; and for how numbers could be increased. I hope that we can look forward to progress on that during the current parliamentary session, perhaps alongside the work on the new national adoption register. It is disappointing that there appears to have been a lack of urgency in that regard, although I very much welcome the tone and content of Angela Constance&#8217;s opening remarks.</p><p>One specific question that Barnardo&#8217;s has raised and which is mentioned in Claire Baker&#8217;s amendment is about the timescales that ministers have set to achieve the actions that are laid out in the response to the SCRA report. Delivery on that is key. As the Education and Culture Committee heard again this week, there is a general consensus that the regulatory framework is in place but delivery is patchy and inconsistent. The policy priorities seem to shift around&#8212;whether it be education, mental health or leaving care&#8212;with the result that a whole-system approach is too rarely adopted.</p><p>Notwithstanding the widespread support that GIRFEC enjoys, it is at this stage failing to deliver a system that consistently puts the child and their needs at the very centre; secures joint ownership and understanding of whatever plan is put in place for each child; and helps to speed up the process of taking decisions and actioning them. I agree entirely with those such as Barnardo&#8217;s who argue that ministers should use the proposed children&#8217;s services bill as an opportunity to review the system of looked-after and accommodated children and to ensure that delays in achieving permanence are minimised across Scotland and that the complex needs of more challenging children are adequately met.</p><p>For that to happen, early intervention is essential. Again, that issue was touched on in last week&#8217;s debate and in the committee yesterday. Witnesses reiterated the importance of the earliest possible intervention&#8212;even pre-birth&#8212;to securing better outcomes. They also confirmed the potential savings to the public purse. Bryan Evans even suggested that, often, the more difficult and complex the case, the quicker the payback. In times of more restricted budgets, resources are tight, but that makes it all the more imperative that the funding that is provided works as hard and effectively as possible.</p><p>Collaboration is key to achieving that. It was interesting to hear the views expressed by CELCIS, Children 1st and others this week that more can be achieved through better pooling of budgets. I hope that Angela Constance will reflect on what she can do along with her ministerial colleagues to ensure that existing budgets incentivise collaboration and certainly do not impede it.</p><p>The debate has been a useful one on an issue that has proved stubbornly resistant to the best efforts of successive Administrations to make the changes that we all want. I had great sympathy with my committee convener, Stewart Maxwell, when he asked at yesterday&#8217;s meeting, with just a hint of desperation, why we are still talking about improved collaboration and early intervention when we have known for years, and the evidence has shown, what impact that can have in improving outcomes for looked-after children.

Although the amendment that I lodged was not selected for debate, I hope that members will understand if I focus my remarks on the aspects that I sought to highlight through that amendment.</p><p>The potential for the debate to roam far and wide has been amply demonstrated. Derek Mackay was absolutely right to commend Kezia Dugdale and Liz Smith for their speeches, and I think Joan McAlpine should be commended, too. I will concentrate on early years intervention, where a step change in priority, collaboration and support is urgently required; on the potential for the pupil premium to make a contribution to targeting resources where they are needed most; and on the concerns that arise from the budget settlement for Scotland&#8217;s colleges, given the responsibility that rests on their shoulders for helping to raise attainment and ambition among Scotland&#8217;s young people.</p><p>On the first of those areas, as I have said in previous debates, I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to an early years change fund, which is an approach that the Liberal Democrats proposed in our manifesto. All the evidence shows that we achieve the greatest value from the investment that we make in the earliest years of a child&#8217;s life and even prior to birth. That does not come cheaply, and it certainly does not provide a guarantee&#8212;such things do not exist&#8212;but it is the closest that we will get to a guarantee of securing the best possible outcomes for each child later in life.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland&#8217;s briefing for the debate makes the valid point that no intervention is more critical than that in relation to looked-after and accommodated children, which, as the minister alluded to, the Education and Culture Committee will turn its attention to shortly. The warning from Barnardo&#8217;s is stark: Scotland, as a corporate parent, is failing looked-after children. The minister was right to acknowledge that, although improvements have been made for some looked-after children in certain circumstances, the overall statistics are frightening. The problems are complex and the costs to society and public sector budgets are considerable. Nowhere is the notion of preventative spend better illustrated.</p><p>Although I support the ministers&#8217; intentions in the area and agree that the national parenting strategy can play a key role, I am concerned that, notwithstanding Derek Mackay&#8217;s comments, the scale of the resources that ministers are bringing to bear will prove to be inadequate. Perhaps more accurately, I am concerned that there is a risk that the available funding will be spread too thinly across too many initiatives.</p><p>More could be done. Simply pointing the finger at Westminster might play to the gallery in Inverness, but it is rapidly running out of credibility elsewhere. As Jeremy Peat of the Royal Society of Edinburgh made clear to Paul Wheelhouse and his colleagues on the Finance Committee yesterday, it is time for the SNP to stop protecting every sacred cow in the herd. For example, Jeremy Peat added his voice to that of the Government&#8217;s advisers in advocating a rethink over the status of Scottish Water. Without compromising public accountability or even staff conditions, an estimated &#163;1.5 billion in savings could be achieved by moving Scottish Water to a public trust. Just think what a proportion of that money, over and above the amount that has already been committed&#8212;which I acknowledge&#8212;could achieve in the interests of making the progress that we all want in improving early intervention. However, that requires political will.</p><p>So, too, would implementing, even on a pilot basis, a pupil premium in Scotland.

Schools will then have the freedom to spend the money as they see fit, but they will be held to account for how it is used to support deprived pupils.</p><p>In answer to a recent parliamentary question, Dr Allan dismissed any suggestion that a pupil premium could play any useful role in Scotland and pointed instead to the EMA. However, the EMA is designed to encourage 16 to 19-year-olds to stay in education, whereas the pupil premium tackles educational disadvantage that is caused by poverty, which starts at a young age and widens later. On average, by the age of seven, children in poverty are two years behind their counterparts from better-off backgrounds. They never catch up.</p><p>As Douglas Hamilton of Save the Children Scotland has stated:</p><p>&#8220;To break this cycle of underachievement, children from the poorest homes must be given high-quality additional support&#8221;.</p><p>To that end, he highlights that the pupil premium can be used for one-to-one tuition, varied curriculum choices and extra support for parents to get involved. Rather than treat us to more of the pointless and somewhat puerile narrative that all Scotland&#8217;s ills derive from Westminster, it is time for ministers to give proper consideration to the calls from Save the Children and others for a pupil premium at least to be trialled in Scotland.</p><p>In relation to raising attainment and ambition for all Scotland&#8217;s young people, it is difficult to square the minister&#8217;s remarks with the 20 per cent real-terms cut that the Government proposes to make to college budgets in the next year. The &#163;37.8 million cut next year is particularly swingeing and colleges are already warning about the effect that it will have on the number of places and courses that are available, the quality of provision, staffing levels and so on.</p><p>The effect will almost certainly be felt disproportionately by those from more deprived backgrounds. The NUS rightly points out the need to redouble efforts on widening access to further and higher education, but that and other Government commitments are seriously compromised by the political choices that ministers have made about college budgets.</p><p>There is still time to rectify the situation, even by reprofiling the cuts over the next three years. Savings can be made and restructuring is needed, but the cabinet secretary cannot simply ignore the concerns of the college sector, as he did at the Education and Culture Committee on Tuesday, by rubbishing the evidence from Scottish colleges and blaming everything on Westminster. The choices are his. Having been let out to play by the cabinet secretary, I hope that Ms Constance and Dr Allan will help him to make the case to the finance secretary that some of the Barnett consequentials arising from the council tax freeze south of the border should be used to soften the blow.</p><p>I entirely support the aspirations that are set out in the Government&#8217;s motion, but if we are to achieve them in the interests of all our young people, particularly those from poorer and more vulnerable backgrounds, the Government needs to match the resources to the rhetoric.

The delivery of a system that incentivises work for all and which addresses the shameful numbers of people who are trapped on out-of-work benefits; of a system that is simpler, fairer and more transparent; and of a system that maintains a genuine safety net for the most vulnerable people in our society, is a prize that is worth pursuing. Far from representing a dismantling of the welfare state, I think that that is an approach that is in keeping with Beveridge&#8217;s original reforms.</p><p>The reality is that the current system too often provides the wrong incentives and acts for too many people as an obstacle to work. That is unfair to claimants, but is also unfair to working families on low incomes, who have to pay for a system that is not working.</p><p>Over the past decade, for most of which time there was relentless growth in our economy, the welfare budget rose by more than 40 per cent in real terms. That makes no sense and shows that although a strategy for job creation is essential, it is simply not the whole answer.</p><p>In the UK, we have five million people trapped on out-of-work benefits, one of the highest rates of workless households in Europe and almost two million children living in homes in which no one has a job. In those circumstances, I cannot see how another exercise in tinkering around the edges would suffice.</p><p>I appreciate that there are concerns about the impacts on specific groups, about the way in which the reforms might play out alongside areas of devolved policy responsibility, such as health and housing, and about the roles of local government and the voluntary sector. I certainly do not underestimate the potential complexity of trying to address those concerns, but does that not simply make the case for direct, detailed and sustained engagement between governments and others north and south of the border? As I understand it, the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are members of the senior stakeholder board that is overseeing the universal credit programme. There is also on-going dialogue between the UCP and the Scottish Government-led welfare reform scrutiny group. Other for a exist and one imagines that part of the purpose of today&#8217;s debate is to give members an opportunity to put on the record concerns that they wish to be addressed.</p><p>Already changes have been made to initially poorly thought out proposals in relation to the treatment of people who have disabilities. I am pleased that the recommendations by Professor Harrington have been accepted. Likewise, as COSLA has pointed out, amendments are being proposed in relation to the housing provisions, including some that have been suggested by my colleague Lord Kirkwood, and those seem to make considerable sense.</p><p>However, I struggle with the notion that has been posited by some witnesses to the Scotland Bill Committee this week and by the Labour amendment today, that we should somehow remove ourselves from the debate, as if the need for welfare reform does not exist in Scotland. That cannot be what the SNP or Labour is arguing, but we have seen little detail of changes that either would propose in order to manage a budget that, as I pointed out, ballooned during what have largely been good times, and which quite demonstrably provides perverse disincentives to encourage and support people into work. To say, &#8220;We are in favour of reforms&#8212;just not these reforms&#8221;, is an unsatisfactory defence, and is as vacuous as the slogan, &#8220;Too deep and too fast&#8221;.</p><p>We were told this week that any reform of the welfare system would need to await the outcome of the SNP&#8217;s referendum on independence, but that that does not mean that the First Minister is under any obligation to consider holding his referendum before 2014. We cannot simply go on talking about the need for creating a welfare system that is simple to understand, that lifts people out of poverty, that makes work pay and that provides a proper and effective safety net for those who need it. We need to take action.</p><p>It is right that we continue to press for appropriate safeguards and assurances, beyond those that have already been given.

There are particular issues relating alcohol abuse to mental ill health.

That is why, although much of the debate over the next few months will inevitably focus on price issues, we should not lose sight of the fact that the interventions that we can make through early detection of depression, stress, bullying, anger, relationship breakdown and so on need to be the focus of our attention. We cannot rein back on the efforts that we have made through the various counselling services throughout the country, which give us a better insight into the causes of alcohol abuse.</p><p>I welcome James Dornan&#8217;s motion and the debate, and I look forward to participating in future debates on this and related issues over the months ahead.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651953", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as the patron of the Orkney Alcohol Counselling and Advisory Service, and as I am off to the Scottish Beer and Pub Association challenge 25 reception after the debate.

Given the levels of fuel poverty in my constituency, that will certainly be a welcome development, although Lewis Macdonald made an interesting and pertinent point about the ability of local installers to access such programmes and how that affects the development of wider benefits from such investment.</p><p>I would not suggest for a minute that the Government has not placed low-carbon issues at the forefront of its agenda. As Lewis Macdonald indicated, it is following a pattern that was established by the Executive that preceded it. On many occasions during the previous session of Parliament, John Swinney put on record his recognition of the fact that he was building on a fairly solid platform.</p><p>Maureen Watt was right to identify the useful role that targets can play. It is true that we have set ambitious targets that will not be achieved by assertion alone but, over the past eight to 10 years, we have seen evidence that targets play an important role in stretching industry and setting a clear pathway.</p><p>I welcome the debate and the motion, whose range and breadth Jackson Carlaw was a little ungenerous in criticising. The fact that it is wider ranging than the motion that we debated in June, particularly as regards energy efficiency, is to be welcomed. During that debate, a number of us were rather critical of the Government for downplaying the role of energy efficiency. The Association for the Conservation of Energy rightly expressed the view that, although the target of generating 100 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s energy from renewables by 2020 is achievable, improvements in demand reduction would inevitably make our renewables target easier to achieve. That is self-evident. As the lowest cost of energy is for the energy unit that is not used, there are multiple benefits to focusing a little more attention on energy efficiency as part of our move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p>In its briefing for the debate, Friends of the Earth makes a relevant point about the job-creation opportunities that exist in energy efficiency as opposed to the sexier end of renewables development. It points to the fact that energy conservation is estimated to generate 370 jobs per terawatt hour. That is quite a striking figure in the context of the job and wealth-creation opportunities that the Government says the transition to the low-carbon economy presents.</p><p>The job and wealth creation that comes from energy efficiency and renewables, as well as from transport and waste, which others have referred to, is very evident. I see that day and daily in my constituency in Orkney. David Torrance mentioned Aquamarine Power&#8217;s procurement of its device at BiFab in his constituency. The amount of money that Aquamarine Power and other developers have invested in Orkney as part of the deployment and testing of their devices has been nothing short of incredible. Leask Marine has been able to invest in a vessel to support not just Aquamarine Power but other developers in due course. The benefits stretch through the supply chain to those with no apparent immediate or real connection to the renewables industry. Whether in the accommodation sector or the restaurant sector, for example, the spill-out benefit&#8212;the multiplier effect&#8212;should not be underestimated.</p><p>Challenges exist. I have referred to individual developers who are taking forward individual devices, but it is not difficult to imagine the pressure on the supply chain to deliver as we scale up, not only in my constituency but across the board.</p><p>The points that have been made on transmission were well made and I have every sympathy with them. However, I take issue a little with the First Minister&#8217;s criticism earlier of the extension of project transmit, not least because the industry expressed concerns about truncating the process. Not allowing the issues to be fully developed would have been likely to lead to the wrong decision, albeit one made by the deadline. The grid issues are central. The sums that would need to be invested are, in many respects, eye watering. However, when we look at what happened with the gas grid development in Europe over the past decade and more, it becomes clear what we need to do and how achievable it is.</p><p>Although the point about economic growth is salient, not least for selling some of the hard decisions and behavioural changes that we need to make, there is another point that goes beyond that. The efficient use of resources, energy security and the contribution to a healthier environment get downplayed a little too much. The Royal Society of Edinburgh makes that point in its briefing.</p><p>My concern with the motion is that it does not address some of the concerns with the renewable heat target, which has been set at 11 per cent. There is a growing view that 14 per cent may be a more realistic target.</p><p>The motion also downplays skills, which are close to the heart of many who have been involved in such debates over the years. Some of us attended a recent event in the Parliament on the future of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics&#8212;STEM&#8212;subjects, and there are challenges with bringing the pipeline of skilled professionals through to populate all parts of the low-carbon economy.</p><p>David Torrance made some good points about the importance of transport and that, too, is rather downplayed in the Government&#8217;s motion.</p><p>However, I am attracted to Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s amendment particularly because of the prominence that it gives to the stake for local communities, which is close to my heart. Neil Findlay touched on finance initiatives in relation to that, and Friends of the Earth makes similar suggestions. Although I recognise that the Scottish Government has gone some way in that regard, it is not only about job and wealth creation as a whole but about the way in which local communities gain a sense of ownership over the issues.</p><p>The motion talks about</p><p>&#8220;providing long-term certainty for business and investors&#8221;.</p><p>We all agree with that. There is enough technical risk in the low-carbon economy without layering political risk over the top of it. However, I observe that the constitutional uncertainty to which a number of SNP back benchers referred is unlikely to give that business certainty. Therefore, I encourage SNP members to downplay that, talk up what we can do in collaboration more and talk less about what we do in separation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651783", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I welcome the debate, which follows on from a helpful debate on energy that we had shortly before the summer recess.

I also congratulate Rob Gibson on securing not only the debate but what appeared to be, certainly at the outset, a rather generous selection of members from across the chamber, which is no mean achievement for a members&#8217; business debate, as veterans of these debates will testify.</p><p>Rob Gibson&#8217;s motion echoes one that I lodged about two years ago to coincide with the unveiling at Lyness, in my constituency, of a memorial honouring the bravery of all those involved in the Arctic convoys and the sacrifices that were made, not least the ultimate sacrifice that was made by the 3,000 men who perished on those journeys. Rob Gibson was present at that unveiling and I am sure that he will agree that it was an emotional and evocative occasion. It took place on the site of the naval base at Lyness, overlooking Scapa Flow, where, as Mary Scanlon said, the home fleet, which provided the naval protection for those convoys, was based during the war. The memorial, which is a lasting record of that bravery, consists of two standing stones, shaped as the bow of a ship. It is a fitting and very Orcadian reflection of the bravery of those who were involved in the convoys.</p><p>Rob Gibson has talked about a couple of his constituents, and I think that the unveiling of the memorial was given an extra significance by the presence of two of the three surviving Orkney convoy veterans, Francis Cusiter and Derek Johnstone, who received medals that day. I agree with many of the comments that Mr Gibson made&#8212;which were perhaps more measured than other people&#8217;s comments&#8212;about the need of the United Kingdom Government to conclude its review and come to a quick and sensible decision, which would command support across the chamber.</p><p>For me, what made that day particularly memorable were the tales of what was endured by those in the convoy. As Annabelle Ewing said, much of what those men went through is unimaginable to us these days. As well as having to endure the horrendous weather, the shifting pack ice and the cold seas, they had to face threats not only from in front, behind and either side, but from above and below as well, because of the presence of aircraft and U-boats. It must have been a horrific experience&#8212;as many have said, the worst journey in the world.</p><p>Another point that has been made in this debate, which I would echo from an Orkney perspective, is the pride in the local community about the connection with the convoys and the strong ties that remain to this day. That is felt particularly strongly in Lyness and Hoy, and was very much reflected in the memorial ceremony two years ago.</p><p>I was also struck by quite how pivotal the convoys were to the eventual outcome of the war. Some who were present that day suggested that the journeys were almost unbearable but that veterans look back on the role that they played and take enormous pride, justifiably, in the fact that they not only opened up vital supply lines but tied up the German naval and air force during that period and ultimately helped to secure allied victory over fascism.</p><p>A number of Churchillian quotes have been heard this evening&#8212;even if there has not been much Churchillian rhetoric&#8212;and I will add another, as I remind the chamber that Churchill referred to those who were involved in the convoy as the &#8220;bravest souls afloat&#8221;. As someone who recognises his own nautical limitations, I have additional admiration for everything that they did on our behalf.</p><p>We will deal with the budget next week and all MSPs are aware of pressing and immediate concerns that fill our mailbags and e-mail inboxes, but I think that it is right that the Parliament should take this opportunity to highlight and restate our gratitude to those who demonstrated such bravery and made such sacrifices on behalf of this country in facing down fascism.</p><p>I congratulate Rob Gibson. I look forward to progress being made on the further lasting memorial at Aultbea in Wester Ross and on the issue of the proper decoration of these veterans.

The lack of a late call-up for the cherished referendum on separating Scotland from the rest of the UK must surely have caused a dull sense of anticlimax to wash over at least some of the former idealists and firebrands on the SNP back benches, including Mr Stewart.</p><p>However, the wanton discarding of the rash promise to deliver a bill on high hedges seemed to arouse most excitement in the chamber late yesterday. Members will not be surprised that, as I am the MSP for Orkney, that issue does not cause my mailbag to overflow. Indeed, any hedge in my constituency that does not have the sense to keep its head below the garden wall deserves everything that is coming to it.</p><p>I could not help but notice that Fergus Ewing was happy to promise members that his successor as minister with responsibility for community safety, Roseanna Cunningham, would be delighted to honour his earlier commitment to legislate on the issue. Crofting, anti-sectarianism and now high hedges&#8212;one is left wondering what Ms Cunningham did to offend the leadership of her party.</p><p>As Marco Biagi did, I will to focus my remarks on some aspects of the Government&#8217;s programme that relate to education and which will affect our children and young people.</p><p>As I said back in June during a debate that I thought was genuinely useful, the challenges that the Government&#8212;indeed, the Parliament&#8212;faces in education are considerable. However, if we are to restore excellence to our education system, provide the skills that our economy needs and secure the wider social benefits that education delivers, those challenges must be addressed. I accept that a number of the measures that the First Minister set out yesterday offer hope that we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>I applaud the Government&#8217;s commitment to a futures fund to invest in early intervention measures, which mirrors a similar commitment in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. If it is properly resourced and targeted, the proposed early years change fund will be able to make a real difference, although it will also require effective co-ordination and even integration of services.</p><p>I look forward to seeing the details of that in due course, as well as those on improving the speed and quality of decision making for looked-after children. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning can be assured of my support in seeking to ensure that those initiatives are as effective as possible.</p><p>I was interested to note the proposal to establish a task force to ensure that the whole public sector prioritises spending on early years. I am sure that my colleagues on the Education and Culture Committee will be keen to explore that measure further with ministers in the months ahead.</p><p>Likewise, the Government will have my support, and that of my party, in taking forward proposals for a rights of children and young people bill. It is an opportunity to deliver real and meaningful improvements in the lives of children and young people in Scotland, as well as to send a strong signal about their importance to the society that we want to create. Again, I look forward to seeing the detail of what is envisaged and to working constructively with ministers to achieve objectives that, I think, command unanimous support in the Parliament.</p><p>In their attempts to develop a better learner journey to equip people with the right skills to enter and stay in work, ministers can count on the Liberal Democrats&#8217; support. I welcome the commitment to publish a pre-legislative paper on post-16 education as a necessary first step towards getting that right.</p><p>However, the Government&#8217;s programme goes on to state that ministers</p><p>&#8220;will guarantee all 16-19 year olds a place in post-16 learning&#8221;.</p><p>It is hard to find fault with the sentiment, but it is also hard not to feel that it is the sort of guarantee that has got the Government and, indeed, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning into difficulties in the past.</p><p>Alongside that particular guarantee in the programme for government appears a restatement of the commitment to free higher education. Leaving aside the fact that in recent days that promise will have rung a little bit hollow, particularly for any students at the University of Edinburgh, we still await more detail on how ministers will achieve the objective. As the Government does, we believe that the quality and international competitiveness of our universities can be enhanced while we also improve access, without the need to go down the route of charging tuition fees. However, there is a debate to be had about the level of funding that that will require, and it is not a debate without real and tangible consequences&#8212;as we see from the news of cuts to staff and courses across our universities.</p><p>In the consultation that was held earlier this year, we were promised in May a Scottish solution with implementation due for the academic year 2012-13. Although I appreciate that there are still a number of variables and unknowns, if the timetable has now shifted, it would be helpful to know when we might expect that solution to emerge.</p><p>On the Government&#8217;s approach to schools, we will continue to support the roll-out of curriculum for excellence, but ministers must acknowledge that genuine concerns remain. There is uncertainty about what is to happen and by when, which is prompting fears that many of those who are going through the secondary system at the moment might suffer as a consequence. That cannot be allowed to happen. The education secretary will be aware of that possibility and he needs to address it. It is also an area in which the Education and Culture Committee is likely to maintain a keen interest.</p><p>On the question of teacher employment, I note the bold statement in the Government&#8217;s document that it claims to have</p><p>&#8220;delivered record low class sizes across Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>Having inherited falling school rolls and record numbers of teachers, ministers still managed to lose around 3,000 teachers during their previous term of office. I suggest that that is nothing to shout about. Indeed, Mr Russell even confessed to having sleepless nights over that particular failure. The latest General Teaching Council for Scotland figures show that a mere one in five probationer teachers has secured reliable full-time employment, but the education secretary has promised that young teachers who are coming through will be guaranteed not just probation but a job. That is a characteristically bold pledge, to which he will be held to account, not least in terms of the impact on others within the teaching profession.</p><p>As I said during the debate in June, there is considerable scope for the Government to work constructively with the other parties to deliver the improvements in our education system that we all want, and in the way in which we meet the demands of our children and young people. At the same time, during the past four years, we saw too many promises being either discarded or redefined. There can be no excuse for similar failures this time round.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650216", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As others have done, I am tempted to dwell on some of the measures that were glaringly absent from the programme for government that the First Minister announced yesterday.

It would also appear to suggest that SNP ministers are equally happy to support demands from their Northern Irish and Welsh counterparts to have exactly the same statutory right.

Looking ahead, further bold promises have been made, in the full knowledge of the budget constraints that exist and with all the powers at ministers&#8217; disposal. Time will tell whether those promises have sown the seeds for future problems.</p><p>In the limited time that is available to me, I want to touch on some of the areas that will be of key importance over the next five years. It is not surprising that, as Marco Biagi said, there are areas on which there is significant agreement. I particularly welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on looked-after children. The Government has committed itself to a futures fund to invest in early intervention measures&#8212;that commitment mirrors a similar one that was made by the Liberal Democrats. All the evidence shows that we achieve the greatest value from the investment that we make in the earliest stages of a child&#8217;s life, and even prior to birth. That does not come cheap, and it certainly does not provide a guarantee&#8212;such guarantees do not exist&#8212;but it is probably the closest that we will get to a guarantee of securing the best possible outcomes for every child later in life.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, like the Government we believe that the objectives of enhancing the quality and international competitiveness of our universities while improving access can be secured without the need to go down the tuition fees route, but there is a live debate over the level of funding that that will require. That debate has real and tangible consequences, as we see from the almost weekly news of cuts to staffing and courses at many universities. It would be helpful if the cabinet secretary were able to set out more detail on how he plans to safeguard the quality and breadth of teaching and research while making progress on widening access.</p><p>It would also be helpful to get some idea of where the Government sees reform of the higher education sector going, including the structure of courses, the interrelationship with schools and colleges, and links with business and the wider community.</p><p>We were happy to work with the Government during the last budget process to secure an expansion in the number of college places and protection of bursary support. However, anyone who attended the Scotland&#8217;s Colleges briefing last night knows that the sector has an obvious capacity to deliver so much more, not least in helping deliver the skills that will enable Scotland to emerge with strength and confidence from the current difficult economic circumstances.</p><p>On schools, like Liz Smith I welcome both the Donaldson review and the establishment of the McCormac review. The reviews cover sensitive issues, of course, so any recommendations will need to be taken forward with care and proper consultation. It will not serve anyone&#8217;s interests&#8212;least of all those of current and future pupils&#8212;if we help to hasten a return to the low morale and divisive industrial relations that gave rise to McCrone in the first place.</p><p>Mr Russell is right to point to the political unity around the curriculum for excellence reforms. The aims and values are the right ones and we support the roll-out from primary to secondary. However, as Stewart Maxwell alluded to, legitimate concerns have been raised about the way that that is happening.</p><p>I was particularly struck by some of the comments made by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, including concern about the</p><p>&#8220;lack of attention to knowledge ... the inadequacies in the way assessment has been addressed&#8221;</p><p>and the</p><p>&#8220;insufficient ... resources that are being made available to support this innovation&#8221;.</p><p>Those and other issues need to be addressed in the interests of a process that we all support.</p><p>There are many areas of agreement but, as I said, the Government has come unstuck in the past in matching its promises to delivery. During the election campaign, Mike Russell promised that</p><p>&#8220;young teachers coming through will be guaranteed not just probation but a job.&#8221;</p><p>The figures released this week are not encouraging. Nevertheless, I hope that there will be a commitment to that pledge and that what constitutes a job will not be redefined.</p><p>It would also be helpful to know Mr Russell&#8217;s views on the relationship between national and local government in respect of education. At the beginning of this session of Parliament, there are signs that the cabinet secretary is all too happy to micromanage Scotland&#8217;s schools from his office in Edinburgh. We want to see more powers for headteachers so that they can plan the development of their school, play to their strengths and meet the needs of their community.

I do not expect the new minister to treat us to the same level of mind mapping that we became used to in the past four years, but in keeping with tradition, and as he gets to grips with his new brief, I hope that he will keep the chamber updated on his extensive reading list.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, notwithstanding Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s legitimate criticism, the Government has taken the early opportunity of bringing these issues and this debate to Parliament. As well as its new-found claim of being the most southerly bastion of liberal democracy in Scotland, the constituency that I am proud to have been re-elected to represent enjoys a long-standing reputation as the centre for the development of marine renewables in this country and worldwide. If Scotland is to achieve its ambitions, it will rely heavily on Orkney being able to deliver its full potential during the coming years.</p><p>There is every reason for confidence. As Scottish and Southern Energy makes clear in its briefing, Scotland is</p><p>&#8220;blessed with an abundance of clean energy, and it is technically feasible to harness it, not only to meet the equivalent of Scotland&#8217;s entire electricity needs, but as part of a wider electricity system, to export significant volumes to other countries.&#8221;</p><p>That view is backed by the Garrad Hassan report, &#8220;The Power of Scotland Renewed&#8221; so, as the motion states, we are right to be looking to move faster and further in delivering our green energy ambitions for Scotland.</p><p>The minister will recall that our parties shared the 100 per cent target at the election. The act of setting targets has attracted criticism in the past, as I am sure Sarah Boyack will testify, but the track record in this area and in energy efficiency demonstrates the value of such targets in providing a clear focus and a signal of political intent.</p><p>As ACE points out, while the 100 per cent by 2020 target is achievable, improved demand reduction will inevitably make our renewables target easier to achieve. As the lowest cost of energy is the unit not used, it also brings benefits for tackling the scourge of fuel poverty. It is unfortunate that, unlike Sarah Boyack&#8217;s amendment, the motion does not reflect the importance of demand reduction, although the minister did reflect it in his opening remarks. As Sarah Boyack and Rob Gibson said, we cannot underestimate the need for ambition in that particular sphere.</p><p>The motion is absolutely correct in recognising the significant wealth and job creation opportunities that will come from a move to a low-carbon economy, including in the decarbonisation of our heat and transport sectors. While that process is a necessary response to climate change and the need to manage our finite resources more sustainably, we should be bold in declaring our ambitions for mobilising the low-carbon army in Scotland. That will need further investment in skills, with Government and its agencies working hand in glove with industry and the further and higher education sectors. Again, it would be helpful to hear details from the minister about what is planned in that respect.</p><p>Likewise, while much attention is focused on technology development, the lion&#8217;s share of the jobs and wealth is likely to be generated through the supply chain. That is patchy and we need to find ways of supporting the provision and maintenance of, for example, vessels to the sector from the North Sea, and of incentivising local investment in vessels. That is one way of capturing for Scotland as much as possible of the value of this fledgling industry.</p><p>At a more local level, capturing and retaining job and economic opportunities are equally important. I welcome the motion&#8217;s recognition of the benefits that can be secured through maximising scope for local ownership, for example. That might not be appropriate in every case, but I know from experience in Orkney that many communities have the skills and the appetite to take on more responsibility and control over developments in their communities. It is right that we support that, given the wider benefits that it delivers in enhancing self-sufficiency, promoting economic development and maintaining population in some of our more remote areas.</p><p>That brings me on to the motion&#8217;s reference to the Crown estate. Like many others, I believe that the current arrangements are not sustainable and that change is desirable and inevitable. For example, there is potential conflict inherent in the Crown Estate&#8217;s regulatory and licensing roles and that needs to be addressed. However, it is also right that we should look at how the benefits from the development of the renewables industry can be harnessed to support our island and coastal communities. That is where the Government&#8217;s demand for the devolution of the Crown estate is unsatisfactorily vague. Andy Wightman argues that the SNP&#8217;s game plan is hard to determine and that it needs a plan B or C.</p><p>Greater accountability for what the Crown Estate does in Scotland is absolutely necessary, but locking up revenues in Edinburgh is little better than the present arrangement. In that regard, I would be interested to know whether the minister is inclined to support the idea of an islands and coastal communities fund.</p><p>There is undoubtedly a large degree of political consensus on the issues that we are debating. In the past, John Swinney has generously acknowledged the extent to which, over the past four years, he has been able to build on the solid platform that was laid by Jim Wallace and, later, Nicol Stephen. More recently, thanks to the leadership that Chris Huhne has shown, we have had a series of announcements that have demonstrated a real commitment to making the transition to the low-carbon economy. Ofgem&#8217;s remit is being reviewed, while project transmit offers genuine hope that a charging regime will be put in place that reflects the needs and realities of our energy system in the future rather than those of the past.</p><p>Chris Huhne has also taken the lead on the massive investment in the grid, ports and other infrastructure that is needed to make the transition possible. Not only have his plans for a green investment bank been widely supported, but they have given rise to a broad-based campaign to have it located in Scotland, which I very much welcome.</p><p>On the fossil fuel levy surplus, after years of inaction, progress has finally been made to unlock those vital funds. I understand the industry&#8217;s impatience for that investment to be deployed as quickly as possible, and I hope that progress can be made in the near future. Such progress is certainly more likely now that some of the First Minister&#8217;s more hysterical rhetoric has been replaced by more measured and conciliatory tones.</p><p>Although the Government&#8217;s motion expresses much that I entirely agree with, I do not feel able to give it my support, for the reasons that I have outlined. That said, I remain committed to working with the minister and the Government to realise the overall and shared objective of moving faster and further to secure our future as a green energy powerhouse. In the meantime, I look forward to the remainder of the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by adding my welcome to Fergus Ewing in his new post and by recording my thanks to his predecessor, Jim Mather, for the role that he played during the past four years in taking forward the vision&#8212;one that we shared&#8212;of realising Scotland&#8217;s potential as a global green energy powerhouse.

I am sure that I speak for Karen Gillon and Maureen Watt when I say that one of the first things we did on returning from Lilongwe was scrutinise the Official Report.</p><p>As other members have suggested, the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill may have suffered a little from living under the shadow of the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill, which was progressing through its various stages in committee and the chamber almost simultaneously. However, as Elaine Murray said, that is no reflection on the bill&#8217;s importance. As all speakers have indicated, this afternoon we are deliberating on a sensible, proportionate and important piece of legislation. Its general approach, which is based on risk and, as John Scott suggested, on consequences, is absolutely right. That is the direction of travel that we would like to see for all aspects of regulation. The cabinet secretary was right not simply to illustrate that fact with reference to the incident that occurred in Hungary around the time that the bill was introduced but to bring the issue rather closer to home by referring to the near miss, as it were, at the Maich fishery in Renfrewshire.</p><p>There was no equivalent in the bill to the contentious issues around snaring and wildlife crime with which we had to wrestle during consideration of the WANE bill. That said, a couple of issues that struck me as being potentially quite knotty were dealt with by amendments at stage 2.</p><p>The first of those issues related to the respective roles and responsibilities of construction engineers, inspection engineers and supervising engineers. At one stage&#8212;certainly after the bill was first presented to us&#8212;there was a risk that the Government might inadvertently have closed off the potential to access some of the expertise that is available in that cohort of engineers. Fortunately, due to evidence that was given to us at stage 1 and through the consultation with the Institution of Civil Engineers that was on-going throughout the process, those concerns were adequately addressed at stage 2.</p><p>Similarly, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the provision disqualifying an engineer who had previously acted as the construction engineer for a particular reservoir. I welcome the changes that the Government proposed at stage 2.</p><p>The other issue that stood out for me was support for small businesses, individuals or angling clubs that are owners of reservoirs. Some of the evidence that we took from one individual at stage 1 demonstrated that the ways in which individuals come into possession of reservoirs are not always straightforward. The potential impact of the liability on individuals and small businesses was almost the dominant concern of the committee at the conclusion of stage 1.</p><p>I welcomed the approach that ministers took at stage 2. As I said during stage 2 proceedings, the grant scheme that they have suggested makes sense. The whole committee struggled to find a magic bullet to deal with the problem, but the proposition that the Government has brought forward is a fair and considered stab at addressing it. I recognise that coming up with a ballpark figure for the liability on the Government from such a grant scheme is difficult until risk assessments have been carried out, but I am sure that the measures that have been taken in that regard will be welcome.</p><p>I thank fellow members of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, the committee clerks and, in particular, those who gave evidence, especially the representatives of ICE, on whose expertise we had cause to rely on a regular and on-going basis. Thanks, too, to the minister and his officials.</p><p>There were no huge areas of disagreement, although it was striking that, in those areas where concerns arose, ministers acted swiftly to address them. However, the lack of controversy and profile should fool no one into underestimating the importance of the bill that we will put on to the statute this evening.

We saw that in relation to the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill and the availability of hydrologists. Future workforce planning is a difficult thing to get absolutely right. As John Scott said, we were assured that enough qualified engineers would be available&#8212;indeed, I think that Scotland is better blessed in that respect than other parts of the UK&#8212;but it is something that we probably need to keep a weather eye on.</p><p>Maureen Watt was absolutely right to say that there needs to be transparency when it comes to full cost recovery. It should not be full cost recovery at any cost. Any sense that external costs are being loaded on to reservoir owners needs to be avoided at all stages.</p><p>Peter Peacock made his usual thoughtful contribution. He started by referring, quite rightly, to the complex and technical nature of the bill. It is absolutely right that it weaves in issues around climate change. For those of us who are not blessed with the engineering background of Mr Scott, we can conceptualise such matters a little more readily. Like Peter Peacock, the rest of us are looking forward to receiving our signed copy of the minister&#8217;s book, &#8220;Richard&#8212;the reservoir months&#8221;, in due course.</p><p>Peter Peacock was also right to talk about the change in the usage and ownership of reservoirs, given that the bill places potential new burdens on individuals and smaller businesses who, at the point at which they found themselves in ownership of a reservoir, never anticipated taking on such responsibilities and burdens. I made that point in my opening speech and I reiterate that the Government&#8217;s response appears to be fairly pragmatic.</p><p>As well as bravely taking an intervention from John Scott and doing an awful lot to ingratiate himself with the Presiding Officer, Stewart Stevenson made some interesting points about the way in which issues around water are ones that we are all wrestling with. Despite the fact that those that we are forced to deal with in a Scottish context are in marked contrast to those that our counterparts in Malawi are forced to deal with, there is an international dimension to such issues.</p><p>It boils down to the fact that the bill that we will pass today is about public safety. I think that Stewart Stevenson caused a degree of alarm in identifying a concern about dams collapsing backwards in the event that water is removed from behind them. That was certainly new to me but, as every speaker has identified, recent events in Hungary and Renfrewshire have brought home to us the potential risks that are inherent in the use of dams.</p><p>The approach that the bill takes, which is based on the assessment of risk and possible consequences, is absolutely the right one and I reiterate that, on that basis, we will be happy to support it this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was going to go on to comment that I thought that it was very brave of Stewart Stevenson to accept an intervention from John Scott.

Despite claims to the contrary in some quarters, far from improving, the situation for certain species in certain parts of Scotland is actually getting worse. Responsibility for this deplorable trend rests firmly with a small number of estates and land managers who persist in defying the law. That is why the vicarious liability provisions introduced at stage 2 must be made to work effectively through the targeted efforts of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the police. Indeed, I would welcome the minister&#8217;s assurance that she is willing to look at how the penalties and sanctions for those who are found guilty under the vicarious liability provisions might be toughened up, perhaps through further consideration by the partnership for action against wildlife crime in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, in expressing our abhorrence of these wildlife crimes, we must also acknowledge the fact that the majority of estates and land managers do not engage in such activity. Indeed, many share our frustration at the unwillingness of recalcitrants to desist, which is why we have supported the wildlife estates initiative, which can and must help to define and embed best practice.

Circumstances in which there is no such risk&#8212;or, indeed, where additional numbers of deer are seen as desirable&#8212;can still be reflected in the code, but it should nevertheless be able to provide clear guidance on how cull levels are determined and, where necessary, on how they should be implemented.</p><p>Amendment 34 again seeks to deal with a matter discussed at stage 2 and, in lodging it, I have sought to deal with some concerns that the minister expressed in her response at that stage. A failure by the authorities, in this case SNH, to act where there has been a breach of the code would, I suspect, strike most people as a flaw in the system that we are putting in place. Given the extent of the powers that are available to SNH to act, that could and should not be on the basis of a technical or administrative breach. However, any failure to carry out management work required by the code or a management plan agreed in accordance with the code would seem to merit a response.</p><p>If amendment 34 is not acceptable to the minister, I would welcome at least clarification that the powers which SNH has at its disposal under sections 7 and 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are not limited to use in relation to sites of special scientific interest. That suggestion has been made by some stakeholders and any assurance that that is not the case and that those powers will be more widely applicable will go some way to allaying fears in that respect.</p><p>Finally&#8212;and self-evidently&#8212;for any code of practice to remain credible it will require to be updated. Amendment 8 is a modest affair that seeks to ensure that the code keeps pace with best practice and developing technologies.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Throughout our consideration of the bill, I, like other committee members, was made aware of the divergence of views over the need for a general duty on sustainable deer management.

I start by again putting on the record my thanks to the committee clerks, Scottish Parliament information centre staff and other staff who helped us to get to this point, and my thanks to the wide range of individuals, businesses and organisations who gave evidence and provided briefings. It was not always easy to navigate a sensible and workable way through evidence that was often conflicting, but our work would have been immeasurably more difficult if we had been unable to draw on the advice and expertise of stakeholders.</p><p>The bill is worth while. It tidies up anomalies and anachronisms and it confronts serious and substantive policy issues. Its importance is a reflection of the value that we attach to the activity that helps to create and sustain our biodiversity and that shapes the landscape and our typically Scottish natural environment. Of course, biodiversity is under threat and more needs to be done to protect it, but for now I am pleased that we have agreed a new reporting requirement, which is linked to existing biodiversity duties.</p><p>Whatever satisfaction we take from the bill that we are about to enact, we must pay heed to the advice of Sheriff Drummond, who said that the law in the area is complex, fragmented and difficult to find and that it is difficult to see the direction in which the law is going. That is not good for public understanding or, by extension, for compliance. I repeat the committee&#8217;s view that consolidation will be needed before further amendments are made.</p><p>Let us consider the changes that we are introducing. Many people might think that we have not gone far enough on snaring, but I think that we have struck an appropriate balance and left the way open for further action, should it prove necessary. Despite steps that have been taken in recent times to improve the design and placement of snares, abuses still occur, sometimes with disturbing consequences. However, on the balance of the evidence that the committee took, I am persuaded&#8212;as were all three Labour members of the committee&#8212;that the case was made for allowing snaring to continue, as one tool in the predator management box.</p><p>Further safeguards are being introduced, including better record keeping and improvements in training on animal welfare. There are also improvements in snare design and use, which must continue. The prospect of a review by the end of 2016 and subsequent rolling reviews will help to ensure that such improvements happen and will keep a focus on an area that will continue to arouse strong emotions. It is sad that the posturing and historical revisionism of Sarah Boyack and Elaine Murray this afternoon leave an unpleasant taste at the end of the process.</p><p>I repeat my condemnation of acts of wildlife crime. Despite efforts in recent years to tighten the law and increase resources, the problem persists and in some places it is getting worse. I am delighted that we have added to the armoury of the people who are tasked with combating wildlife crime. The introduction of vicarious liability is welcome, as are the changes to cause-or-permit provisions. Of course, obtaining sufficient proof will be a challenge. Nobody thinks that vicarious liability will be a silver bullet, but we have taken an important step.</p><p>All holiday leave for members of partnership for action against wildlife crime is likely to be cancelled as PAWS considers a range of issues. Some people will be frustrated, notably by the Parliament&#8217;s unwillingness to adopt the amendments in Peter Peacock&#8217;s name that would have introduced an approach of three strikes and you&#8217;re out. However, we have sent a strong signal about the need for change. I suspect that if the Parliament has cause to return to the issue in future, such provisions will be the starting point for members and ministers.</p><p>We have struck an appropriate balance on deer management. I hope that some of the minister&#8217;s comments today will reassure people who were concerned that back-stop powers would be used effectively where necessary in delivering the sustainable deer management that we all want.</p><p>I have enjoyed working on the bill, which rightly enjoys and is the product of a great deal of cross-party consensus. I am grateful to committee colleagues for the way in which they approached our collective task. We have worked together to produce a bill that is greatly improved and strikes a good balance between competing claims and demands. It will serve well our natural environment and the people who do so much to help to sustain it.

High fuel prices affect all parts of the country. However, as a number of members have said, the effects are particularly acute in rural areas. As Dave Thompson said, the high cost of supplying and distributing fuel to our island communities has a major impact on families and businesses in those areas. There is a triple whammy there: long distances, high costs and little or no alternative transport.

At a time when budgets are tight and set to remain so for some time, an innovative financing mechanism that will allow domestic consumers and businesses to pay back the cost of energy efficiency improvements through their energy bills, thereby reducing or removing up-front costs, is surely worthy of welcome.</p><p>UK ministers have made clear that there will be additional help for lower-income and vulnerable households and hard-to-treat-properties, following on from the refocusing of the carbon emissions reduction target and the smaller and more targeted warm front programme.

That is why the consultation on electricity market reform is so important, although today's debate may have come a little early in the process. From my discussions with the sector in Scotland, it is clear that views on how to respond are still being formed, making it difficult for companies to brief MSPs, although thoughts are clearly already emerging.</p><p>What has been firmly established is that there is a specific Scottish dimension to the debate. That has been recognised by my colleague Chris Huhne, who has taken early steps to engage with the Scottish Government and other Scottish stakeholders to ensure that final proposals properly reflect Scottish needs and circumstances. That is a characteristically constructive approach, as the minister and others have acknowledged. It is the right approach and increases the likelihood that this once-in-a-generation opportunity for reform will be grasped in a way that benefits both energy consumers and the environment.</p><p>The prize is colossal: the potential to secure &#163;110 billion of investment in low-carbon electricity generation, including grid; reducing emissions while keeping bills as low as possible and more stable over the long term; investor confidence through more certain returns in low-carbon generation; special payments for back-up power and new demand reduction technologies; and a firm price for carbon and an emission performance standard to drive down carbon from the system. That is an ambitious but achievable agenda that commands widespread support; the complex task is to get the detail of its implementation right.</p><p>In the brief time remaining I will, like others, touch on a few of the specifically Scottish aspects of the debate. I agree with those such as Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"32224\"/> and Southern Energy who argue that carbon price support is essential if we are to rebalance the market and incentivise the move to low-carbon generation. I agree also with those who are making the case for a tough EPS, and I could see an argument for devolved control over its scope and level.</p><p>The second element of the package is feed-in tariffs&#8212;which formed much of Lewis Macdonald's and Gavin Brown's remarks&#8212;where it is accepted that long-term contracts are essential to provide certainty to investors in low-carbon generation. A contract for difference is proposed to control costs for consumers, provide stable returns and maintain market incentives, but I welcome the fact that the UK Government has acknowledged the difficulties here and is seeking views on a premium feed-in tariff alternative.</p><p>The issue is particularly difficult to get right and the potential pitfalls are deep and numerous. That is why it is right and essential to make any reform gradually and with proper transition arrangements. I appreciate very much Lewis Macdonald's and Jim Mather's points about that.</p><p>Gavin Brown quoted some of Scottish Power's early thinking, but I was interested that SSE welcomed the clarity on ROCs and the commitment to existing contracts through grandfathering and in the medium term. That said, I acknowledge the need to continue to allow Scottish discretion, to capitalise on Scottish strengths.</p><p>It will surprise no one to hear me stress again the longer-term importance of wave and tidal stream power to our energy mix. Achieving that through the reform process, not least through enhanced incentives, must be a priority. We also expect tougher requirements to be put in place for nuclear operators to put aside significant contingencies to cover the costs of eventual decommissioning. I welcome the proposals for capacity payments, which are aimed at encouraging the construction of flexible reserve plants and demand reduction measures, to help to address security of supply.</p><p>Of course, all those policies interact with each other and will take time to be digested and analysed in the months that are ahead. The outcome of Ofgem's review of charging and of the review of Ofgem's role as well as questions on grid access, planning&#8212;including community benefit&#8212;and financing and construction risk are all key factors in determining our success in moving to a low-carbon economy. Let us not forget that electricity is only one part of the decarbonisation challenge&#8212;heat and transport also require major attention.<place-holder colnum=\"32225\"/></p><p>For the moment, I welcome the publication of the EMR document and the process that it has set in train. Greater clarity is needed about how many policies will interact and I am sure that that will be the focus of attention for the industry and other stakeholders in Scotland in the weeks and months ahead. Despite the impending election, I hope that the Scottish ministers will continue to engage in the process constructively and with an eye to the long term.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving amendment S3M-7693.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and supports Longannet to become the UK's first demonstration facility for CCS with up to &#163;1 billion of UK Government funding.\"</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178165", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome Stewart Stevenson's comments, which anticipated my very next comment.

I offer that olive branch at the outset in recognition of the fact that she is almost certainly sick of the sight of me, Elaine Murray and John Scott, having spent an uncomfortable amount of quality time this morning with the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee.</p><p>I also congratulate the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on its report and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for its contribution. Given the limited time available, with the draft report's publication coinciding with the publication of the Government's draft budget, the report is an impressively thorough piece of work.</p><p>As my colleague Alison McInnes has rightly pointed out, this is in effect stage 3 of a process that began with the strong framework established under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. In that respect, Patrick Harvie made some interesting points about the cross-party determination to strengthen that bill's provisions. That was followed, eventually, by the setting of stretching targets plotting the course towards the achievement of our emissions reduction obligations.</p><p>Finally, we reach the point at which we must decide how we intend to make these changes happen in our homes, our communities, our businesses, our towns, our countryside and the way we live our lives. Despite the faults that have been identified by the committee, the report sets all that out in some detail, although, as Rob Gibson conceded, what it contains are still perhaps more proposals than policies. However, as the committee and many who gave evidence rightly observed, the supporting documentation gives some confidence about not only how we might achieve our ambitions, but the real benefits that are to be gained economically, socially&#8212;for example, through better health&#8212;and, of course, environmentally.</p><p>That point is important. The many difficult decisions and choices that lie ahead cannot be ducked, and Jackson Carlaw and other members were right to highlight the importance of the public engagement strategy in that regard. All the more reason, therefore, for us to take care to accentuate <place-holder colnum=\"32062\"/> the positives where we can and to not simply allow ourselves to be lured into a bidding war to see whose hairshirt is the hairiest. There are numerous examples of the health benefits to be gained from more energy-efficient homes, improved air quality and access to green spaces. Like Rob Gibson, I took part in the eco-driving test and was appalled to find that I had been outdriven by my colleague Tavish Scott, who I had always considered to be a bit of a boy racer. In these times of rising fuel costs, the benefits arising from reduced household expenditure really have to be accentuated.</p><p>As a number of members have noted, the committee has criticised the Government's apparent reliance on voluntary measures to achieve the emission abatement objectives that have been set. I entirely recognise that a delicate balance has to be struck here; we will need carrots as well as sticks, and regulation should certainly not be the first resort. Indeed, in many cases, such a move could prove counterproductive. However, given the backdrop of the challenging targets that have been set and the changes that the Government has conceded will need to be made, there are serious questions about how achievable these objectives are through a predominantly voluntary approach.</p><p>Although care needs to be taken, many businesses will confirm that there are opportunities to be had from sensible and properly signposted regulation that also benefits and protects customers and the wider public. The minister accepted that principle in her opening remarks, perhaps in a vain attempt to persuade Jackson Carlaw, who might challenge my colleague Tavish Scott as Holyrood's boy racer. One example is the particulate trap regulations that applied to diesel vehicles a number of years ago.</p><p>Linked to that is the concern that, to meet our 2020 target, every existing policy that is outlined would require to reach its maximum abatement potential. The Government has not allowed itself much&#8212;if any&#8212;margin for error. That might reflect a desire to set the most stretching targets possible, but that is credible only if it is backed by a commitment from ministers to work with the Parliament and wider stakeholders to develop new proposals. As the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee noted, the Government should as a feature of the final RPP make a clear statement on its intended course of action if the EU does not agree to strengthen the EU ETS to 30 per cent.</p><p>In the brief time that is left, I will touch on a few specific issues in the report. On energy, I note the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's view about an overreliance on UK policies and funding. Joint working will of course be necessary and desirable in many instances, but <place-holder colnum=\"32063\"/> it cannot be used as an excuse for delay and inaction. My colleague Iain Smith gave several useful examples on energy efficiency, on which timely warnings have been given. Likewise, Charlie Gordon made interesting points about the need to lever in other sources of investment. The warm deal is perhaps an example of that.</p><p>RSPB Scotland pointed up in its briefing for the debate the importance of the land use strategy, on which the Government is consulting. The minister will be aware of the criticisms of the draft strategy. Much work must be done on it before it is laid before the Parliament in March if it is to guide effectively the implementation of the policies in the RPP. However, I share Rob Gibson's confidence that that can be done in the time that is left. In relation to the briefing, like Jackson Carlaw, I acknowledge Rob Gibson's work on peatlands restoration. The benefits from that in return for the investment that is made are worth while pursuing.</p><p>It is generally agreed that the report has provided a useful starting point. The debate has raised a range of improvements that could be made for the future in a constructive and well-informed tone. I congratulate both committees again on their thorough work in somewhat challenging circumstances. I look forward to the minister's response in winding up the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Alison McInnes, I welcome the minister to her extended portfolio and wish her well in this and the many other important issues for which she is now responsible.

The fact that, at times, the evidence has been contradictory does not detract from its value to the committee in reaching conclusions on a wide range of often contentious issues. The visits to Langholm, Alvie and Abernethy proved particularly informative, and I thank those who hosted us, not least Jamie Williamson of Alvie estate, whose dramatic retractable window is surely worthy of a mention on the public record.</p><p>I also commend the minister for the way in which she has engaged with the committee. The <place-holder colnum=\"31231\"/> initial consultation process was clearly thorough, but we have welcomed her attempts to anticipate and respond to the concerns of committee members, be they unanimous or held by a majority. We have seen further evidence of that today. It has been helpful and I hope that it will continue through stages 2 and 3.</p><p>Although further improvements are undoubtedly necessary, and I will try to touch on some of those, the bill has generally received a broad welcome. Concerns that the reference to the natural environment in the bill's title underplay the extent to which much of what we are talking about is actively managed are understandable, but I am not sure what would be achieved by a name change at this stage. It is imperative to stress, however, the value that we attach to that activity. As the committee's report acknowledges up front, management of land plays a significant role in creating and sustaining the types of biodiversity and landscape that have come to be valued as typically Scottish. The economic, social and cultural importance of that activity is also recognised and highly valued, as the convener suggested.</p><p>Similar to the issues surrounding the title of the bill are the concerns that have been raised about the supposed lack of an overarching narrative. Although I am happy for the Government to give more consideration to how a coherent approach to safeguarding Scotland's biodiversity can be achieved, perhaps through a beefed-up land use strategy, I accept that the bill is essentially intended to tidy up the law in a range of areas. As such, retrofitting a narrative seems fraught with dangers. Indeed, I do not believe that providing a narrative is necessarily an integral part of legislation. However, it is an entirely necessary function of legislation to set out clearly what the law is. As Sheriff Drummond said, it is getting difficult for legal experts to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"find and see the direction in which\"</p><p>the law</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is going.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 15 September 2010; c 3078.]</p><p>Professor Reid said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"having clearer legislation is so important to ensuring public access and understanding. It helps you ... ensure that it is understood and enforced.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 6 October 2010; c 3222-3.]</p><p>In that regard, it is incumbent on any future Administration to embark on a consolidation of the law before, or at least at the same time as, proposing any further amendments to it.</p><p>That brings me to the changes that are being proposed at present. I do not want to diminish the importance of other issues in the bill, but I hope <place-holder colnum=\"31232\"/> that members will understand why I choose to concentrate my remarks on snaring, wildlife crime and deer management, in that order. Initially, snaring was widely considered the most contentious aspect of the bill. Those who advocate an outright ban on the practice have argued their case powerfully and, in most cases, constructively. There is little doubt that, despite the steps that have been taken in recent times to improve the design and placement of snares, abuses still occur, sometimes with deeply disturbing consequences.</p><p>However, on the balance of the evidence that the committee has taken, I am persuaded that the case for allowing snaring to continue as one tool in pest and predator management has been persuasively made. I believe that further safeguards are needed, as well as improved training in relation to animal welfare and better record keeping. It is also imperative that innovation in snare design and use continues to take place. That is why, in part, I accept the need for a reserve power in the bill. It will allow time for the changes to bed in, provide an incentive to make them work, and look to further improvements. I am also conscious that any outright ban would be unlikely to deter many of those who are guilty of malpractice.</p><p>I acknowledge the consensus that exists in condemning acts of wildlife crime. Sadly, despite efforts in recent years to tighten up laws and increase resources, the signs are that the problem persists and is getting worse, as the minister has confirmed. Raptor persecution in particular drew much of the committee's attention during stage 1 and I offer the following thoughts as we look ahead to stage 2. We need greater clarity on what constitutes a recordable wildlife crime if we are to achieve greater consistency between police forces, but we must also add to the potential armoury of those who are tasked with combating such crimes, which are not imaginary, as John Scott asserted, although I associate myself with his comments on geese.</p><p>The Government's willingness to introduce a vicarious liability is therefore welcome, although it is not straightforward, nor is it a silver bullet. Concerns about the potential for the power to be abused must be addressed in amendments, although due diligence will remain a defence and obtaining evidence will be essential to any successful prosecution. However, along with changes to offences relating to the possession of illegal poisons and \"concerned in the use of\" provisions, the change can help to shift the balance and provide a real deterrent.</p><p>On evidence, I have reservations about extending the SSPCA's powers, but I await with interest the outcome of further work on the <place-holder colnum=\"31233\"/> subject. In the meantime, I am coming to the view that single-witness evidence has illusory value and could safely be dispensed with, although current inconsistencies need to be addressed one way or the other.</p><p>On licensing, I note the concerns of the SRPBA and others about reserved powers. I sympathise with some of those misgivings and I welcome the wildlife estates initiative, but there could be value in keeping pressure in the pipe while we see how events unfold.</p><p>I share the Government's view that a pragmatic approach to deer management structures must be taken. The approach should be one in which firm and effective back-stop powers can and will be exercised if plans are not produced or implemented.

She complained about the workload of the Health and Sport Committee. I do not want to alarm her unduly but, given the tenor of the exchange between the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee convener and Stewart Stevenson earlier, it is not impossible that she may yet have the forthcoming water bill to deal with, should it ever see the light of day.</p><p>I congratulate the Health and Sport Committee on its excellent and timely report. It goes into detail on the significant changes that have taken place in out-of-hours care prior to and subsequent to the introduction of NHS 24 in 2001. Richard Simpson spoke insightfully about the history of the service and, at one stage, almost seemed to regret his decision to change careers. However, that was as nothing to young Jamie Stone, who appeared to regret or have forgotten his decision to retire.</p><p>I commend the report for stating, in the first paragraph:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Out-of-hours services in our remotest areas constitute a critical lifeline in the most testing and diverse geographical situations. Each location presents a unique set of challenges, for which there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\"</p><p>That is a theme that a number of members quite rightly picked up on. It is as much the case in general practice as in out-of-hours care, and&#8212;as the minister rightly said&#8212;we need an integrated service.</p><p>The debate has been interesting and largely consensual, and members have drawn on their experiences of how these vital services are being delivered and how various agencies are performing in different parts of the country. Jamie Stone, Murdo Fraser and Mike Rumbles have all contributed well in that regard, and Ian McKee drew on his personal experience.</p><p>We all need to recognise the improvements that have been made. Members will recall the all-too-frequent and graphic illustrations of how NHS 24 struggled in its early days to meet the expectations not only of patients, but of health professionals. There were sometimes calamitous repercussions and Richard Simpson, in drawing on the flu pandemic experience last year, provided an illustrative contrast.</p><p>Concerns remain, and further improvements must be made, but we are in a better position to respond to those challenges if we acknowledge the progress that has been made and learn the <place-holder colnum=\"30420\"/> lessons to date. The improvements so far have been achieved in large part due to the work of NHS 24, which has worked closely with health boards, GP practices, the ambulance service and patients.</p><p>I commend the creation of the regional call centres, and closer working between NHS 24 and local health boards. That journey is not yet complete&#8212;I will come to that in due course&#8212;but I recognise that significant strides have been taken.</p><p>It is essential that we now build on the recent improvements. Members have pointed to the continued evidence of a residual lack of public trust in NHS 24, but they have also noted the rise in demand for those services. Despite that rise, as the committee report makes clear, one of the principal problems that NHS 24 faces is the on-going confusion among the public about accessing out-of-hours services.</p><p>That theme is taken up by the BMA, which points to the role of Government and NHS Scotland in raising awareness and increasing public understanding. Through that work, we may help to address the issue&#8212;which many members picked up&#8212;of the marked increase in the emergency workload of the ambulance service. The report identified a 41 per cent increase in emergency call-outs since 2004, and noted that that indicates</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that a proportion of out-of-hours service, properly the responsibility of NHS boards, is now being picked up by the Scottish Ambulance Service\".</p><p>The risk, as other members have pointed out, is that in some cases that diverts the ambulance fleet away from emergency situations. I agree with the comments of many members about the need for a more joined-up and collaborative approach. Richard Simpson and Ian McKee were right to point out not only that integration is needed, but that it must be based on a listening exercise and the involvement of communities.</p><p>The investment in building up capacity and training first responders in communities around the country may help to take some of the pressure off, but I am aware from my own constituency that that can often be viewed as an attempt to scale back the role of the NHS and emergency services. It should be about complementing and enhancing what is currently provided, rather than achieving it on the cheap.</p><p>Murdo Fraser rightly drew on the experience of those in Kinloch Rannoch.

I congratulate Karen Whitefield and her colleagues on the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee on their work.</p><p>It is fair to say that, despite Karen Whitefield's legitimate comments about conflict between people who own or seek to protect listed buildings and people who seek access to them, there is a high degree of consensus on the bill. That is in no small part due to a rigorous approach to the consultation. As members know, the process that was initiated by the previous Scottish Executive culminated in the former Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland's 2006 report, the recommendations of which were taken forward pragmatically by the current Administration.</p><p>I commend that general approach. The experience of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, of which I am a member, on the bills that led to the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 and the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 showed what can be derived from a consensual approach that is achieved through early engagement and rigorous consultation.</p><p>The bill's benefits are well recognised. It is a technical bill and people might want to do something far more wide reaching in future, but it will introduce improvements that will help in the sustainable management of our historic environment, which is something that I think that all members can support. The policy memorandum says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland's historic environment is intrinsic to our sense of place and our strong cultural identity and plays a large role in helping to attract visitors to Scotland. It makes a significant contribution to the economy, for example through tourism and the support of indigenous craft skills, and provides the people of Scotland with a rich environment in which to live and work.\"</p><p>That is all true. As Margaret Smith said, the Built Environment Forum Scotland suggested that the sector contributes in excess of &#163;2.3 billion to Scotland's GVA, directly supports 41,000 full-time-equivalent employees and indirectly involves many more thousands of people.</p><p>Impressive though those figures are, testifying to the scale of the importance of the sector, they rather underplay the significance of its local impact. My constituency provides a perfect illustration of that. So as not to disappoint Bill Wilson, given what he had to say, I will focus <place-holder colnum=\"30083\"/> much of the rest of my remarks on that impact, which highlights the importance of ensuring that the legislative framework is modernised and remains fit for purpose.</p><p>The heart of Neolithic Orkney world heritage site is one of four such sites in Scotland, although other sites harbour aspirations and I wish them well. It acts as a magnet for the many thousands of tourists who come to Orkney each year. This week, there has been much talk, certainly among my northerly neighbours, including my party leader, about Shetland's inclusion in the Lonely Planet's top 10 destinations. I warmly congratulate Shetland on that but note that the Lonely Planet continues to highlight the richness of what Orkney has to offer, describing it as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A glittering centrepiece in Scotland's treasure chest of attractions.\"</p><p>Historic Scotland's stewardship of Skara Brae, Maeshowe and other sites in Orkney is a critical factor in helping the islands to maintain and develop the essential quality of the tourism experience. I echo Ted Brocklebank's observations about the approach of Historic Scotland. The sites are also at the heart of Orkney's unrivalled archaeological heritage. They not only attract tourists to the islands, but provide archaeologists from the United Kingdom and across the world with invaluable hands-on experience and a unique opportunity to gain an insight into what life was like 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.</p><p>The discovery was made last year of a 5,000-year-old figurine&#8212;the only Neolithic carving of a human face to be found in Scotland so far. I am well aware of the impact of the tour of the Westray wife around Orkney in spurring interest in Orkney and what is happening there. Real interest has also been generated by the Ness of Brodgar dig, which took place earlier this year. I had the pleasure of visiting it over the summer. At one stage, it appeared that Neil Oliver and his colleagues from BBC Scotland had taken up permanent residence there. I recall one particularly uncomfortable moment when he asked what I thought had motivated Neolithic man to paint some of the stonework at the site, which was part of an exciting discovery back in July. It is never comfortable to have the limits of one's knowledge so cruelly and publicly exposed. Under pressure, I mumbled something about it acting as a warning to people not to bump their heads on the low ceilings. I am not sure that my less-than-insightful remarks will make it into the programme.</p><p>The abundant local resource has enabled Orkney College to develop an archaeological course framework, including PhDs, which has been recognised as truly world class and which will serve the university of the Highlands and <place-holder colnum=\"30084\"/> Islands well in the future. I was interested in the comments that Ted Brocklebank and Margaret Smith made about the abundance of that resource. It has often been said by farmers in my constituency, with a degree of frustration at times, that they can barely stick a spade in the ground without bumping up against some archaeological artefact or other. I have taken up the issue with Fiona Hyslop's colleague, Richard Lochhead, in the past, and I am somewhat reassured by the comments that she was able to make in her opening remarks.</p><p>I note the observations of the Built Environment Forum Scotland, which highlight the need for expert advice in helping communities to protect, manage and appreciate local heritage. It is certainly true that Orkney is well served in that regard, although I realise that that is not necessarily the case nationwide. It is not just advice for those who are involved in the planning process that we need. For our archaeological sites and our historic built environment to be accessible and enjoyed as widely as possible, good interpretation and services such as rangers can be necessary. They help to develop understanding and appreciation not just among tourists, but among locals, who are often guilty of taking for granted what is on their own doorstep.</p><p>As the bill makes clear, the key is to ensure the sustainable management of our historic environment. It is an enormously valuable resource, but one whose overexploitation can cause damage that may be long lasting and irretrievable, as Pauline McNeill observed. That can be physical damage or damage to the quality of the tourist experience. I know that that is a concern in Orkney, given the allure of Skara Brae and the other parts of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization site. We need to take care, and I hope that the bill will help in that regard.</p><p>I hope that the bill will also play a part in helping to manage successfully the interrelationship between the particular needs of our historic environment and wider economic considerations and imperatives. It may be unavoidable, at times, that the planning process becomes confrontational. However, better communication, with proactive and pragmatic engagement by Historic Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and others with&#8212;in the case of Orkney&#8212;the renewable energy industry, would help to take some of the heat out of those issues. I accept the fact that this is a technical bill; nevertheless, it is an important one.

I am sure that the minister will join me in welcoming the announcement when it is made.<place-holder colnum=\"28925\"/></p><p>It cannot make sense for a gas and coal plant in the south to be subsidised while renewable generators that operate in Orkney and elsewhere in the north sometimes face prohibitive costs to connect to the grid. The potential costs have derailed projects in my constituency in recent years and it appears that they threaten a development in the Western Isles. I assume that that case cannot await the outcome of Ofgem's review, and I hope that urgent action can and will be taken.</p><p>Of course, connection to the grid presupposes the existence of the infrastructure in the first place. Like other members, I welcome the new connect and manage regime, which I hope will remove another potential barrier to the development of renewables. As Scottish Renewables made clear in its briefing, the new regime should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"provide greater certainty for generators about the rules for access to the grid over the long term.\"</p><p>That is extremely important.</p><p>The cost of putting in place the new infrastructure that we need will likely be eye-watering: some &#163;50 billion on top of the &#163;200 billion that Ofgem has identified as the cost of securing low-carbon energy supplies in the UK. As industry representatives and others who attended a dinner in Glasgow last night made clear, the funding is available, but competition for the investment is fierce and getting ever fiercer as countries world wide wrestle with the challenges with which we are wrestling. Public finances are likely to be under severe pressure in the coming years, so it is all the more essential that our regulatory environment delivers our public policy objectives in a way that can attract the investment that we need.</p><p>Public investment will continue to be essential, so I am delighted that the UK Government has agreed to look again at the release of the fossil fuel levy. I also welcome the UK Government's plans to create a green investment bank, to bring forward private investment in clean energy and green technologies. That has the potential to unlock project finance, by lowering risk to potential investors and addressing market failures and barriers to investment. Sarah Boyack and other members will have views on how such a bank should most effectively intervene and where it should be located, but I think that the proposal enjoys widespread support.</p><p>There has been a similarly positive response to UK plans for a green deal, as a means of accelerating the roll-out of vital energy efficiency measures and creating up to 250,000 jobs. Companies will pay up-front to insulate homes and recover their spending from the resulting energy savings. The approach presents an opportunity to <place-holder colnum=\"28926\"/> make headway on the issue during the next two decades.</p><p>In the years ahead we must do far more to emphasise the potential for job creation across all aspects of the low-carbon economy, whether we are talking about renewables, energy efficiency, waste management, transport, housing or other areas. As Sarah Boyack said, the opportunities are highly significant. The creation of a carbon army, as Dave Watson of Unison continues to call it, will require a focus on supporting skills development. The demand for jobs will be there; we must ensure that the skills are also there if we are to maximise the wealth-creating opportunities of the new economy.</p><p>The delivery of green jobs is one of the benefits of the renewable heat initiative, which will help to reduce our dependence on imported fuels, deliver emissions reductions and tackle fuel poverty. I have been making that case to the UK Government, as I expect many members have been doing, and I hope that there will be a positive announcement in that regard on 20 October.</p><p>I echo Jackson Carlaw's cautionary remarks about carbon capture and storage, but I will not repeat comments that I made in the members' business debate that Ross Finnie brought earlier this month on Ayrshire Power's plans for Hunterston. However, suggestions that Scottish Power's CCS pilot at Longannet is under threat appear to have been overplayed, perhaps mischievously.</p><p>The creation of a low-carbon economy is a question not of if or whether but of how and when. As WWF Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A transition towards a low carbon economy must become a central pillar of Scotland's overall economic strategy.\"</p><p>If we back ambitious objectives with concerted and radical action, the rewards are potentially significant. Failure to take such action will mean that we are faced with the same costs while being short-changed on the jobs and wealth-creation opportunities.</p><p>I am pleased to move amendment S3M-7047.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; welcomes the announcement by Ofgem of a review of the charging arrangements for gas and electricity transmission networks and hopes that this will pave the way to removing barriers to the development of Scotland's renewable energy industry, and believes that the UK Government's plans for a Green Investment Bank to fund low-carbon transport and energy schemes and a Green Deal to overhaul the energy efficiency of homes and small businesses will benefit Scotland's efforts to build a low-carbon economy.\"<place-holder colnum=\"28927\"/><place-holder time=\"15:30:00\"/></p><p><a id=\"TOC_SPKR_6b312c48-5240-4a6b-ad05-e1c25f\" name=\"TOC_SPKR_6b312c48-5240-4a6b-ad05-e1c25f\"><strong>Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green): </strong></a>>Before I begin speaking from my prepared notes, I want to welcome what I think was a note of honesty in Sarah Boyack's language about consensus. I have been concerned for some time that we should not descend into self-congratulation simply because we all voted for a piece of legislation when there are clearly fundamental differences among us on some of the important questions of delivery. I think we need to burst the bubble somewhat on our self-congratulatory consensus.</p><p>I want to reflect on the long-term development of the agenda. It is not something from the past few years or the past couple of Governments. Some people are beginning to think that climate change and renewable energy are new things, but it is more than 150 years since the basic science was identified, and for most of the time since then there have been people who have called for an urgent political response to the scientific message.</p><p>For a long time, those of us calling for that urgent political response were regarded as being on the fringes of politics&#8212;perhaps Mr Carlaw would like to think that we are still there&#8212;but the agenda is now global. It is at the forefront of the agenda of every Government and major company, and the scientific consensus is far more robust than the political consensus that we have in this chamber. It has taken generations of work, research and activism to get here, but the climate change agenda is now a global priority.</p><p>The danger is that, from this point, the agenda turns into just another commercial venture. Scotland has missed out on some of the economic opportunities that the earlier generation of renewable power could have offered us. When I came into Parliament in 2003, the talk of a green jobs strategy&#8212;that was the language being used&#8212;struggled, and it is still struggling, towards a recognition that the agenda is not just a strategy for X or Y number of green jobs as part of the economy but a jobs strategy for the entire economy that is green.</p><p>Even today, the minister Jim Mather talked about how people in low-carbon jobs could represent 5 per cent of the Scottish workforce. That is the wrong approach to a low-carbon economy. That is saying not that we will have a low-carbon economy but that low-carbon industries will be a small part of the economy.

I congratulate the members of the Health and Sport Committee on what their convener celebrated as a dull but worthy report, but one that I found to be a thorough piece of work with some sensible recommendations.</p><p>The committee acknowledges not only that the issues addressed in the report have a bearing on the delivery of health care throughout Scotland, but that they are of particular relevance to rural and island areas such as the one that I represent. Jamie Stone, Nanette Milne and others also made that point.</p><p>A number of the points that I will make this afternoon will echo similar comments that I made in a useful debate that we had in the chamber in April last year, on a motion that was lodged by Dr Richard Simpson. As I did in that debate, I intend to concentrate on telehealth and telemedicine. First I will touch briefly on clinical portals&#8212;without offering any definition.</p><p>The benefit of providing clinicians with timely access to relevant information on patients is self-evident, but the committee is absolutely right to flag up concerns about transparency and data security. Probably all of us can cite examples of where IT systems have been promoted as some sort of panacea when in fact issues to do with cost, reliability and the way in which they are used are held up to insufficient scrutiny from the outset. From my postbag I know of the problems that can and do arise within the health service as a result of poor communication with patients on how their medical information is to be used and shared. As a number of members have said, it is vital that effective steps are taken to increase public understanding and thereby confidence, while still enabling the benefits of such clinical portals to be secured. I am pleased that that point is made strongly by the committee in its report.</p><p>That public confidence is unlikely to be safeguarded by the creation of an uber database of personal information. The minister is correct in her response on that point. The committee highlighted that there are potential concerns about the decision to proceed with developing multiple-portal systems. Although I am not intuitively a fan of a one-size-fits-all approach, it strikes me that the committee is right to flag up issues that arise from the promotion of different systems across the <place-holder colnum=\"28777\"/> NHS that might impede access to clinical information. Ian McKee offered some insightful comments on that.</p><p>In Orkney's case, although most patients who require to be transferred will head to either Aberdeen or Inverness for treatment, a not insignificant number can find themselves sent to Glasgow or Edinburgh. That involves interaction with three separate regional consortia, and I would welcome the minister's assurance that appropriate access to relevant clinical information will not present difficulties as a result.</p><p>As I made clear previously, I represent and was brought up in a part of the country where the development of telehealth and telemedicine can have and is having an impact. Until recently, patients in Orkney who were suspected of having suffered a stroke would have been referred to Aberdeen for a consultation with a stroke physician. That would have involved cost, inconvenience and probably no little discomfort, as Rhoda Grant said. Invariably, however, it would also have involved time&#8212;the thing that suspected stroke patients can least afford after the onset of symptoms. Current evidence suggests that the first 24 hours are critical and that appropriate secondary prevention treatment ought to start immediately. For logistical reasons, that has simply not been possible for Orkney patients in the past. However, since July 2008, telemedicine has enabled some of those problems to begin to be addressed. Dr Macleod, the clinical leader in Aberdeen, and Bob Hazelhurst, the GP lead in Orkney, have been instrumental in developing the stroke telemedicine service in Orkney.</p><p>Through video consultations, access to specialists is now possible for my constituents without their needing immediately to leave the islands. The technology that allows that to happen is now in place in GP practices across the islands and at the remote consulting site at Aberdeen royal infirmary, which I have had the privilege to visit. The results to date have been hugely impressive&#8212;so much so that the team has already picked up the innovation and improvement award at the Scottish health awards.</p><p>There is undoubtedly potential to do more&#8212;we are already seeing that in the management of long-term conditions. In that regard, clinical reviews have been carried out in the past 18 months of cases involving diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, neurology and rheumatology.</p><p>Unfortunately, as Mary Scanlon rightly said in her speech, which was echoed by Rhoda Grant, and as I have made clear on numerous occasions in the chamber, the continued absence of a CT scanner in Orkney is now a source of serious concern. That prevents thrombolysis following a stroke and undermines the scope for undertaking <place-holder colnum=\"28778\"/> locally many other procedures within the timeframe that is set out in strict guidance. My concern remains that when any cost-benefit analysis of a CT scanner in Orkney is carried out, no account can be taken by the board of the resulting cost savings to NHS Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service. The reduced costs in relation to transport, admissions, overnight stays and emergency transfers are all savings that would accrue outside NHS Orkney's budget. However, I understand that the board would still bear the full capital and on-going costs of a locally based scanner. The minister was right to acknowledge that using telehealth technology to access CT scan information is helpful, but the scans cannot be performed remotely. Access to a scanner would deliver far more.</p><p>Telemedicine can deliver and is delivering more in supporting access to professional advice and development for health professionals who operate in some of the smaller islands in Orkney and throughout the remoter parts of the country that Jamie Stone and I represent. The benefits for staff and patients are obvious and significant. However, I urge caution again about ensuring that the public are fully engaged at every stage. If the technology is seen as a means to centralise services, it will meet understandable resistance. The population is ageing and is dispersed across many smaller islands, so the use of such technology is fundamental.</p><p>Orkney health and care&#8212;the model that brings together social care and NHS services in my constituency&#8212;is developing a variety of telehealth and telecare solutions. The model will help in dealing with dementia and falls monitoring and will provide call alarms and more sophisticated equipment that can monitor a patient's blood pressure and oxygen levels. I welcome those pilots, but I was interested to note Ian McKee's observations about what might be called pilotitis. I echo him and Michael Matheson in saying that we might need to look again at how that situation can be improved, perhaps by accepting the committee's call for HEAT targets on mainstreaming the use of telehealth in health boards.</p><p>I support the committee's observation, which Jamie Stone reinforced strongly, that without the availability of high-speed broadband access, the development of telemedicine and telehealth will inevitably be inhibited. In the areas in which such innovation could lead to the most dramatic improvements in care, the quality and reliability of broadband are often at their poorest. NHS Orkney, the local council and their partners are seeking to address that, but I hope that the minister will accept that different boards' needs vary and must be taken account of when funding is allocated.<place-holder colnum=\"28779\"/></p><p>I congratulate the committee on its report.

I, too, congratulate the Scottish Countryside Alliance on the role that it has played. Both initiatives draw valuable and much-needed focus on to the extraordinary range of Scottish produce and&#8212;most important&#8212;its quality. Its quality is critical. The debate has exposed, possibly through Gavin Brown's questioning, a degree of uncertainty about the true value of our food and drink sector, but there has been no disagreement about the economic importance of its wealth and job creation, or about the range of companies in the sector, from the biggest companies to cottage industries. Providing quality is the only way of ensuring that that key industry remains globally competitive. It is also the only way in which justice can be done to the natural advantages that we enjoy.</p><p>Of course, the Scottish food and drink fortnight, like similar events that are arranged to draw attention to other sectors and issues, relies implicitly on the support of a wider strategy. The contribution that such a focus on Scotland's food and drink industry can and does make should not be underestimated, but it is essential that it is rooted in a coherent and comprehensive strategy to support the development of the sector and the need for constant innovation in particular.</p><p>In that context, I welcome the approach that is taken in the national food and drink policy, if not all the photographs in the policy document. As well as emphasising the significance of what is rightly identified as a key sector in our economy, it is entirely appropriate that policies that support the sector should emphasise the health, environmental and educational benefits to be derived from it. Joe FitzPatrick mentioned the educational benefits. The overlap of those themes is now well recognised. However, I hope that the minister accepts that there is still some way to go to achieve many of the multiple benefits that are available from more extensive procurement of a wider range of healthy, locally sourced produce. My colleague Jim Hume referred a great deal to local sourcing. Members will recognise his efforts in that regard in the Parliament and prior to 2007&#8212;he mentioned those efforts. Despite the expressed good intentions of ministers in the current Administration and previously, the figures suggest, as Jim Hume made clear, that local authorities' procurement practices are at best patchy. In some cases, they fall woefully short of where we would want them to be at this stage, given the efforts to date.</p><p>Like John Scott and Jim Hume, I welcome the close involvement that Robin Gourlay will have, but I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge that he faces. It is clear that local <place-holder colnum=\"28714\"/> authorities, the NHS and others in the public sector have legal requirements to secure best value, but the discrepancy between the performance of some councils in the area&#8212;Mr Lochhead rightly mentioned East Ayrshire Council&#8212;and the performance of others suggests that best practice is not being properly shared. Perhaps the cabinet secretary could set out a little more clearly how he plans to address that over the remainder of the year of Scottish food and drink.</p><p>As well as offering economic benefits from supporting local farm and other food and drink businesses, the strategy's success offers the simultaneous opportunity to improve Scotland's appalling health record through promoting better diets. Elaine Murray rightly highlighted the social justice dimension and the unhelpful image that Scotland's appalling health record portrays internationally, and Irene Oldfather rightly drew attention to the explosion of cookery programmes, of which Peter Peacock is but one avid viewer. Despite the increased awareness that exists, our health record remains stubbornly appalling.</p><p>Reducing average food miles by sourcing more food locally can help to curb the harmful emissions that arise from unnecessary transport. Given the stretching targets that we have set ourselves in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and the need for early action to get us on the right trajectory to achieving those targets, I hope that the cabinet secretary recognises the need for urgent action.</p><p>Despite not having been invited to Holyrood this morning or Bellahouston park this afternoon, it is clear that most of us have derived consolation from the welcome opportunity that this debate has provided to wax lyrical about the tremendous contribution that our constituencies and regions make to Scotland's world-class food and drink industry. That is entirely right and proper and, in that spirit, please allow me to serve up an offering from the islands that I represent.</p><p>Orkney's quality food and drink industry does tremendous work in supporting the range of award-winning products that emanate from my constituency. Many are household names and now supply many of the most reputable supermarkets, independent retailers and high-class restaurants. On the menu of those restaurants, one may find shellfish landed fresh from the seas around Orkney, the finest beef and lamb, the best cheese in Scotland, milk and butter, oatcakes, bread and bannocks baked from the ancient bere barley, all washed down with a pint of Dark Island, Red McGregor or Scapa ale, or Highland Park or Scapa whisky, according to taste.</p><p>As well as the quality of the produce, it is important to recognise the part played by effective <place-holder colnum=\"28715\"/> marketing. As the cabinet secretary suggested, it is not just a question of slapping a saltire on the pack. The story behind the product is integral to helping distinguish it in a marketplace where an emphasis on quality can be taken as almost a given. That has certainly been key to Orkney's success, not just in food and drink, but across a wide range of sectors under the Orkney the brand initiative. Scotland as a whole is doing the same thing, but it is clear that it could do better.</p><p>A number of members highlighted the inextricable link between the food and drink sector and Scotland's critical tourism industry. The effect can be dramatic where the crossover is managed effectively, but all too often tourists looking to sample good local produce across many parts of Scotland find it incredibly difficult to do so. Peter Peacock, Ian McKee and Rob Gibson all drew attention to the fact that dining out on some of Scotland's best produce is possible only when one heads furth of Scotland.</p><p>This has been a useful debate that has celebrated our world-class food and drink sector and will help to support its future success. We should not, however, lose sight of some of the serious challenges that face us, such as food security, the pressures on our pelagic and demersal sectors, and procurement, about which David Whitton's comments were well made, not least in avoiding a repeat of the sort of experiences that Ian McKee has had to endure on holidays in the past.</p><p>There is much to celebrate and it is good that we do so.

I commend the efforts of Patrick Corbett and his team at Heriot-<place-holder colnum=\"28580\"/></p><p>Watt University, who perhaps deserve special mention, although I am aware that it has been very much a collaborative effort. All the members who have spoken in the debate have referenced Scottish Power's proposals in relation to demonstration at Longannet. That is something to which the Liberal Democrats have given strong support, not least through the efforts of the previous constituency MP, Willie Rennie. It is something that I want to see being taken forward as part of that pilot, and we will make suitable representations to the UK Government.</p><p>In passing, I mention that my Liberal Democrat colleague in the European Parliament, Chris Davies, deserves credit for his endeavours in securing significant funding for the rolling out of CCS across Europe at the sort of scale that we all want to see. Although the benefits will accrue in Scotland, it is the wider application of CCS internationally in the global fight against harmful emissions, combating the effects of climate change, that shows the true potential of what we are seeking to develop here.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still uncertainties surrounding the scalability of the technology and the timeframe within which it can be achieved.

Most recently, the threat of a &#163;1 million budget cut that has been hanging over the north isles was lifted only amid the outrage that was caused by the simultaneous decision to spend &#163;6.5 million on extending the cheap ferry fare scheme on the Western Isles routes for a further 12 months.</p><p>While each U-turn is welcome, does not the First Minister recognise the damage that is caused by such needless confusion and uncertainty?

Perhaps the only surprise is that Roseanna Cunningham has forever cast herself in the role of the girl who cannot say no.</p><p>I offer the minister my genuine congratulations on steering the bill through Parliament. As she acknowledged, it has not always been an easy process to manage. When I referred earlier to the toxic legacy left to Ms Cunningham by her predecessor, Mike Russell, my remarks were met with a loud bellow of disapproval. On turning round, I realised that the loud bellow had been emitted by said Mr Russell, whose rough wooing of the crofting counties led to a draft bill that was roundly condemned by crofters in all parts.</p><p>To be fair, Roseanna Cunningham has adopted a far more pragmatic approach and agreed to jettison many of the most unworkable provisions&#8212;with one glaring exception, to which I will come shortly. First, like others, I acknowledge the contribution made by those who provided evidence during our scrutiny of the bill, particularly those whom we met during our visits, and I thank them for their invaluable insights and peerless hospitality. Thanks also go to the clerks and SPICe for their support, our adviser Derek Flyn, and my committee colleagues.<place-holder colnum=\"28189\"/></p><p>I suggested at stage 1 that we were all perhaps a little guilty of referring to crofters, crofting and the crofting counties in a way that did not reflect fully the differences between different crofters and the different crofting counties. The minister was absolutely right to acknowledge that regulation alone will not secure the future of crofting. In Caithness, for example, what happens after Dounreay is critical to whether many existing crofts can be sustained. Add to that the on-going debate about the future of the common agricultural policy and how support schemes are to be funded and directed in future, and one will find many crofters arguing strongly that those issues are more fundamental to the future viability of crofting. Nevertheless, regulation has a role to play and we must ensure that it is a positive one. As an amendment agreed to this morning made clear, crofting has been and remains a critical means of retaining and sustaining populations in some of our most remote communities.</p><p>I turn to some of the specifics of the bill. Although it was not difficult to find those critical of the commission, there was a general sense that the commission was key to safeguarding crofting in the future. A more democratically accountable commission is essential and I am pleased that that has been secured, with a greater likelihood that the commissioners will be left free to select their own chair. Anyone will be able to stand for election as long as they are nominated by a registered crofter and elections will sensibly be fought under a proportional system&#8212;all welcome provisions. By contrast, this morning saw a shoddy betrayal of an earlier commitment to extend the franchise for those elections. I can do no better than echo the outrage expressed by Karen Gillon about John Scott's decision to backtrack on his earlier support for such an extension.</p><p>The task facing whoever is elected or appointed to the commission by whatever means is not inconsiderable. Tackling issues of neglect and/or absenteeism will be key. Today, Parliament agreed to three amendments that will assist in ensuring not only that evidence and information are brought to the commission's attention but that the commission will be under a duty to act on that information.</p><p>The Government's insistence on pressing ahead with a map-based register is highly regrettable. Crofters think that that costly and burdensome exercise offers them no value. The Government has estimated the register's capital cost to be about &#163;1.5 million, the set-up costs to be &#163;250,000 and the on-going costs, which crofters will bear, to be about &#163;100,000 a year.</p><p>The case for the proposal was never particularly strong. As I said this morning, in the current climate&#8212;in which the Government will be <place-holder colnum=\"28190\"/> expected to make savings across the board&#8212;the pursuit of such a register verges on reckless. Many objectives that the Government seeks to achieve through its costly register would be secured by extending and expanding the scope of community-based mapping, which has the benefit of being less confrontational, more inclusive and more comprehensive. If disputes remained, the Scottish Land Court would continue to be an arbiter of last resort.</p><p>I again offer the minister my sincere congratulations on piloting the bill through Parliament, but I make it clear that my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I cannot support a bill that establishes the proposed register.</p>", "hdate": "2010-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20876951", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the minister wryly acknowledged, today has provided further evidence that even in the most innocuous of circumstances, crofting can throw up controversy.

I know that some members may have reservations about the terms of the motion, which is on the way in which penalties are levied on farmers, though I hope that the debate will provide reassurance about the intentions that lie behind it.</p><p>Of course, no disagreement exists over the need to ensure that those who are guilty of defrauding, or attempting to defraud, the public purse are brought fully to book. The level of public funding that goes to support our farmers and crofters through the single farm payment, the less favoured area support scheme and other schemes is in the region of &#163;600 million. Those who are in receipt of that funding must rightly be held accountable for how it is used. That is not simply a reflection of the challenging economic times in which we find ourselves. As I am sure the Minister for Environment will be quick to point out, the <place-holder colnum=\"27631\"/> threat of serious fines and disallowance of subsidy by the European Commission is also very real.</p><p>I accept that entirely, as I do the suggestion that, given the outcome of the recent audit inspections elsewhere in the United Kingdom, it was inevitable that the rules and how they are applied in Scotland would come under scrutiny. Like Scotland's farming industry leaders and those they represent, I find it less easy to accept how that has been done and the impact that it is having on farmers and crofters who, in many cases, have done absolutely nothing wrong.</p><p>Before considering the specific issues surrounding livestock paperwork and eligible land, I am happy to acknowledge the steps that the Government has taken on penalties and appeals. The Kinnaird review, which reported to ministers in late 2008, made a series of sensible recommendations, almost all of which the Government was happy to accept. The claim then was that the changes would make inspections simpler and fairer, while ensuring that penalties in the case of any failures were more proportionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, the experience of farmers and crofters of the way in which the rules that apply to eligible land are being interpreted flies in the face of that bold claim. As former NFU Scotland president Jim Walker made clear in a recent <em>Scottish Farmer </em>article, the Kinnaird report</p><p class=\"indent\">\"was announced in a fanfare of excitement about cutting red tape, but it now appears it wasn't worth the paper it was written on as the same minister who accepted the recommendations promptly ignored them.\"</p><p>To paraphrase the First Minister, the red tape agenda, like the respect agenda, is not just about words. It needs to be backed up by action and deeds.</p><p>Indeed, talking of respect, I have learned in my short parliamentary career to date to be wary of ministerial answers, in either debates or correspondence, that begin, \"With the greatest respect\".

Mr Lochhead&#8212;not Roseanna Cunningham&#8212;went on to claim that arguments against the approach that the Scottish Government has taken are founded on a series of misunderstandings, a claim itself that is riddled with inaccuracies. I am not arguing, and never have, that land eligibility criteria have changed; rather, I am arguing that the approach that is taken <place-holder colnum=\"27632\"/> by the Scottish Government to enforcing the rules demonstrably has.</p><p>Audit concerns and the threat of European Union penalties are real, but that is an argument for setting out clearly what the new approach will be and how it will be enforced. However, it now appears that changes in the approach by the Scottish ministers and their officials happened after inspections were carried out and applications made in 2009. In a letter to my colleague George Lyon back in April, Commissioner Ciolo&#351; confirmed that the issue of land eligibility was discussed by the relevant management committee only at the end of 2009. That means that, for those who made applications in May 2009, penalties incurred through the inclusion of areas of bracken or gorse have been applied retrospectively. Such an approach is simply unfair.</p><p>The predicament that faces farmers and crofters who look to make applications under the SFP or LFASS is perhaps best summed up by a Campbeltown farmer who contacted the NFUS recently. She pointed out that the integrated administration and control system guidance documents, up to and including those issued in 2009, made no reference at all to bracken or gorse. Scottish Government officials, she said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"have accepted all our claims, bracken and all, without deductions or comment from 2005 to 2009, thereby proving that they have previously interpreted the regulations in the same way as we have\".</p><p>As it is clear that the goalposts for the 2009 scheme shifted after inspections had been carried out and applications submitted, one would have reasonably assumed that the Government would have been geared up to prevent similar problems arising in 2010. However, although in his letter to me last week Mr Lochhead disputes that farmers and crofters lacked clear guidance, it is well documented that guidance notes were issued only a couple of days ahead of the 17 May deadline for applications to be submitted this year. Not surprisingly, in many cases the notes arrived after that deadline had passed. Perhaps unfortunately for ministers, one place where the post could not cope with the Government's just-in-time delivery strategy was the residence of one Mr James Walker. However, he was far from alone in being affected, and there remains a great deal of anger among farmers and crofters who have been left exposed to the possibility of penalties for completing their single application form and IACS forms incorrectly as a result of confusion over the stricter enforcement of eligibility rules.</p><p>I agree that such penalties are not inevitable, but the threat for many is very real indeed. There is also a risk, identified by RSPB Scotland, that action may be taken by some farmers to remove gorse or scrub at times in ways that run counter to <place-holder colnum=\"27633\"/> wider environmental objectives. I therefore urge the minister to look again at the possibility of an amnesty for those affected by penalties in 2009 and to consider a more measured response to any problems that arise this year.</p><p>Likewise, I firmly believe that a more proportionate approach is needed to the way in which penalties are applied for errors in livestock paperwork. Again, changes to the way in which the rules are applied were inevitable following a critical EU audit of the penalty system back in 2008. However, figures released by the Scottish Government suggest that the total value of penalties has increased more than fivefold between 2008 and 2009, a rise which cannot possibly reflect accurately the extent of the problems of fraud or misreporting.</p><p>NFU Scotland cites the example of cattle passports. Although failure to return the passport of an animal that has died can result in a penalty being incurred, the same is not true for passports that are returned in error for animals that are still present on a farm. The logical conclusion of that is that, to avoid the risk of losing 3 per cent of their single farm payment, farmers might be best advised to return all their cattle passports and seek to recall only the passports for the animals that are subsequently identified as being part of their herd. That position is simply ludicrous. So, too, is the fact that under the current rules, having three failures in a herd of 1,000 or more animals is treated in exactly the same way as having three failures in a herd of 10. Those shortcomings must surely now be addressed.</p><p>We must achieve value for the public funds that are invested in our farming and rural communities. However, the disproportionate and punitive way in which some penalties are being applied is a cause for concern. I am pleased that the Parliament has the chance this evening to debate this issue and I hope that, on the eve of what looks set to be a sun-kissed Highland show at Ingliston, the minister will see her way to radiating common sense and compromise in her response.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20861237", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Farm Payments (Penalties)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "So began a recent letter to me from the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment on the subject of eligibility of land, and my low expectations were not disappointed by what followed.

I harbour a degree of scepticism about the ever-more-frequent practice of designating specific days for different, albeit worthy, causes, often in a fairly arbitrary fashion. I note, for example, that we failed to do justice to world information society day in the middle of last month, distracted as we no doubt were by the aftermath of the recent general election. However, I am confident that we will redeem ourselves by bringing out the bunting when it comes to international day for natural disaster reduction. I presume that because predicting when natural disasters might strike&#8212;and, therefore, predicting when we might prevent them&#8212;is tricky, the UN has simply set aside the second Wednesday in October for that one. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that when such occasions work by providing a useful trigger for collective action locally, nationally and internationally, they can be effective in highlighting important messages and delivering worthwhile <place-holder colnum=\"26865\"/> action. For that reason, I was happy to sign Stuart McMillan's motion, so I congratulate him on securing the debate, which is all the more relevant in the light of the appalling disaster that is unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico. I only hope that my sons do not find out that 10 March is international day of awesomeness or that, scarier still, 21 November is world television day.</p><p>To raise public awareness of what our marine environment has to offer&#8212;the rich biodiversity that it sustains as well as the wide range of demands that we put upon it&#8212;Stuart McMillan's motion quite rightly points to the importance of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, which Parliament passed earlier this year. Like Elaine Murray, I feel privileged to have been part of a process that, by common consent, showed the Parliament at its best. It required collaboration between Governments north and south of the border, as Stuart McMillan indicated, as well as a consistent approach by successive Administrations of different political persuasions in Scotland. The expertise of a wide variety of stakeholders was harnessed effectively throughout the scrutiny of that bill.</p><p>However, important and encouraging though the wording of the legislation may be, deeds and actions are what matter, as the First Minister has been quick to point out in recent weeks. As Scottish Environment LINK makes clear in its briefing for this debate,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Marine (Scotland) Act can play a major role in improving the health of the seas around Scotland if the Act is well implemented\".</p><p>Now that the dust has settled on adoption of the act, it would helpful to get the minister's view on the general duty on the Scottish ministers and public authorities to enhance, where appropriate, the health of the seas around Scotland.</p><p>Of course, the central tension that ran through the development and consideration of the act was between the need to protect and, where appropriate, to improve the health of our seas while at the same time acknowledging the interests and rights of the many users of that environment. Those objectives will not necessarily always be in conflict, but we&#8212;particularly those in Government and in Marine Scotland who are responsible for implementing and enforcing the legislation&#8212;need to remain alive to that tension. However, I am hopeful that, through regional marine partnerships, any competing interests that exist now and will inevitably arise in the future will be able to be managed sensitively and in a way that those who are affected consider to be credible and legitimate.</p><p>It is not difficult to see how those pressures will develop in Orkney, for example. We are immensely proud of the role that our islands are <place-holder colnum=\"26866\"/> playing at the forefront of efforts that will, we hope, result in Scotland's spearheading a global renewables revolution, which Alasdair Allan touched on. However, that must not be done by sacrificing the interests of all other users of the seas around our shores, whether they be in fishing, diving, sailing, tourism or even the demands of our lifeline ferry services. It is critical that we find a way to plan effectively so that best and widest possible use is made of our exceptional marine resources.</p><p>I am grateful to Stuart McMillan for securing today's debate.

What is a routine feature of the <place-holder colnum=\"26651\"/> political process in most western democracies prompted even some of our more level-headed journalists and commentators to dissolve into babbling hyperbole. We were reliably informed that our political system is such a delicate flower, and that the so-called mother of all Parliaments is so neurotic that an election result requiring two or more parties to work together is a recipe for political stasis, not to mention a trigger for a run on the pound and a meltdown of the financial markets.</p><p>What utter nonsense. Not only does such a view ignore the experience of many, if not most, of our European neighbours, it inexplicably turns a Nelsonian eye to what has been happening north of the border since the Scottish Parliament was established. As for the markets, they were and are quite rightly more concerned with goings-on in the birthplace of democracy and the issue of sovereign debt. Nevertheless, they&#8212;and, indeed, the governor of the Bank of England&#8212;have responded to the signal that the new UK Government is prepared to take early and decisive action to tackle our serious debt problem.</p><p>The unpalatable consequences of the situation in which we find ourselves also seem to have been accepted across the political spectrum.

Andrew's characteristic modesty would lead him to struggle with Mary Scanlon's implication that he may be the inheritor of John Rae's legacy, but we will leave it at that.</p><p>Andrew Banks has been involved since 1997 in the enterprise that we are debating. However, as the motion indicates, the Pentland Firth service got up and running only in 2001, since when it has steadily built up an impressive and loyal customer base. On a personal level, the debate provides me with the chance to put on record my gratitude to the staff and crew of Pentland Ferries for the work that they do and the way in which they go about providing a service to my constituents and those visiting Orkney.</p><p>As a regular user of the service, I recall one recent occasion when I had cause to rely heavily on the willingness of Pentland Ferries staff to meet the needs of their customers. Along with Peter Peacock and other members of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, I had been attending an evidence session, in Thurso, on the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill. So engrossing was the evidence of Drew Ratter and his fellow witnesses that I left Thurso a little later than intended and arrived at Gills Bay as the bow doors were closing. Such is the fair-minded and egalitarian nature of Orcadians that I am confident that I was allowed to board the Pentalina despite being the local MSP, rather than because of it. In any event, I am pleased to be able formally to put on record my thanks and apologies to the crew for their help that day.</p><p>Over the years, Pentland Ferries has built up a loyal customer base&#8212;in part, no doubt, due to the approach of its staff. A key factor has been a timetable that often proves more convenient for some travellers and freight operators. Although Pentland Ferries has received no public subsidy over the years, Andrew Banks has been successful in keeping his pricing structure competitive and has been rewarded in the business that he has been able to attract. Moreover, as other members have mentioned, he has invested in a new vessel that, as the motion indicates, has provided a real boost to the service. It is only fair to acknowledge the serious difficulties <place-holder colnum=\"26612\"/> that Andrew Banks experienced in securing the catamaran, difficulties that placed enormous strains on the business. It is to his credit&#8212;and to the relief of many people in my constituency&#8212;that Andrew and his colleagues were able to emerge from that period still in a position to build on the success of the business.</p><p>Mary Scanlon reminded us that in 2002 she secured a members' business debate on wider issues to do with ferry services to the north isles, including the lifeline service that NorthLink Ferries provides. During that debate, my predecessor as member for Orkney, Jim Wallace, highlighted the significant improvements that had been made to ferry services to and from as well as within the north isles during his time representing the islands. Since then, despite Mary Scanlon's assertion, further improvements have been made, not least through the inclusion of freight in the NorthLink contract, the roll-out of customised cassettes for livestock transport and the provision of additional cabin capacity on the popular Aberdeen route.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20811012", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pentland Ferries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like David Stewart, I congratulate Mary Scanlon both on her motion and on securing this evening's useful debate.

If it does not offend, I also offer the observation that the bill's conception was more than somewhat ill advised. However, so infatuated was the minister's predecessor, Mr Russell, with his own sense of empathy for crofters and the crofting way of life that nothing could dissuade him from seeking to consummate that unrequited love. Here, before us, crouches the progeny of Mr Russell's rough wooing of our crofting counties.</p><p>I willingly acknowledge the efforts of the current minister to breathe life back into the bill. Although it has already undergone major and, at times, life-threatening surgery in order to reach this stage, it is clear to many of us on the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee that the patient will be required to go back to theatre quite often over the coming weeks. It is for that reason that the Liberal Democrats will support the reasoned amendment this afternoon.</p><p>The minister will point to the legacy that she inherited not only from her predecessor but from the previous Scottish Executive, which set up the committee of inquiry into crofting. However, the current Government was free to take whatever approach it wished in relation to the Shucksmith report, and at times it has been difficult to understand why this particular project was spared the fate that all too quickly befell a number of presumably more cherished Scottish National Party manifesto promises.</p><p>That said, like the convener, I have found fascinating the process of gathering evidence as part of our stage 1 inquiry. I join with her and other colleagues in putting on record my gratitude to all those who provided written and oral evidence, particularly the crofters and those with an interest in crofting whom we met during our visits. Their insights and perspectives were invaluable. As Maureen Watt said, we owe a special debt to the volunteer guides whom we relied on during those visits. I can say with some confidence that, in my short parliamentary career, no inquiry has come <place-holder colnum=\"26147\"/> remotely as close to offering the same access to a bewildering array of delicious home bakes as this one. Thanks, as ever, go to the clerks and SPICe for their detailed work and patience, which I am sure will be tested even more fully in the weeks ahead, and to our adviser, Derek Flyn, who proved to be an expert and affable guide through a hugely complex area of policy and law, not to mention custom and tradition.</p><p>No one should underestimate the complexity of the issues involved or the difficulty in achieving consensus on what is to be done. Part of that stems from what seems to be a misconception about crofting. We are, perhaps, all guilty of referring to crofters, crofting and the crofting counties in a way that does not fully reflect the differences within crofting and between the crofting counties. What became abundantly clear early in the committee's consideration of the bill was that the views, needs and aspirations of crofters vary enormously. Although, to an extent, that reflects different traditions, it increasingly reflects the specific circumstances, challenges and opportunities that crofters and their communities face. For that reason, we must resist making sweeping generalisations or adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. It is also why the committee is right to remind us that regulation alone will not secure the future of crofting. While the minister has accepted that in her remarks and in the Government's response, which pointed to the importance of market forces, public subsidy and investment in development, the issue goes still wider. In Caithness, for example, what will happen in the aftermath of the run-down of Dounreay is seen as critical to whether many existing crofts could or would be sustained. In Shetland, the importance of the oil and aquaculture sectors, in particular, to maintaining incomes in crofting households was highlighted. Again, the picture differs from community to community, and it is a further reminder that we should not overstate what the bill can or should seek to achieve.</p><p>While there was disagreement within the committee on a number of issues&#8212;I will touch on some of them shortly&#8212;there was general agreement that crofting has been and remains a critical means of retaining and sustaining populations in some of our most remote and fragile communities. The minister, as well as Sarah Boyack, John Scott and others have pointed out the wider public benefits achieved as a result of a vibrant crofting sector. That is why what we do in this area of policy is so important. It is also why we should adhere to the maxim that the first rule of government is to do no harm.</p><p>With that in mind, I turn to some of the specifics of the bill. It is not difficult to find people who are critical of the Crofters Commission, but there was widespread agreement that the commission was <place-holder colnum=\"26148\"/> key to safeguarding crofting in future. The prospect of a more democratically accountable commission was welcomed by most; it will help to improve the way in which the commission functions and relates to individual crofters. I welcome the minister's acceptance that anyone should be able to stand for election so long as they are nominated by a registered crofter, but encourage her to rethink her refusal to allow commissioners to elect their chair. It is right that the Government should consult further on how the constituencies will be made up, and further attention also needs to be given to who will be allowed to vote in the elections. The provisions appear to be too restrictive. The minister must also resist demands by some of my colleagues for those elections to be fought under a first-past-the-post system. In this of all weeks, Karen Gillon and John Scott proved what remarkable political alliances are possible.</p><p>Most important, however, is that we must ensure that the tasks that we set the commission are clear and that it has the resources to carry them out. Although the adoption of strategic plans will help in identifying priorities, a number of us are concerned about the vagueness of much of what ministers expect and by when. It is also of concern that, without the necessary resources, the commission may simply be set up to fail. Of course, the key priority for the commission will be to tackle neglect and/or absenteeism. The minister was right not to seek to elevate one over the other. While the picture is varied throughout the crofting counties, few disputed the need for the commission to take a more proactive approach on neglect and absenteeism.</p><p>Under part 3 of the bill, it is expected that the commission will be able and indeed required to investigate and, where necessary, take tough action on absenteeism and neglect. However, there seems to be a mismatch between aspiration and resource. All the more reason, therefore, for the Government to dispense with the need for a map-based register and avoid, as the minister has pointed out, wasting millions of pounds. This costly and burdensome exercise is seen by crofters as offering them no value beyond what is already available through the commission's existing register of crofts. Marina Dennis of the Scottish Crofting Federation has observed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is clear that creating a register of crofts under the\"</p><p>Registers of Scotland</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is for just about anyone else's benefit except the crofters, who are being asked to pay for it.\"</p><p>Moreover, the potential for creating disputes between crofters and within communities was raised with us time and again. Drew Ratter said:<place-holder colnum=\"26149\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"A crofting tenancy is not really a territorial unit; it is, essentially, a bundle of rights and duties.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 23 February 2010; c 2452.]</p><p>By contrast, the SCF and others have made a positive case for encouraging and supporting community mapping. Although the minister has come some way down the road of accepting that and acknowledging the widespread criticisms of the trigger mechanisms proposed in the bill, I believe that she must go further.</p><p>The minister has rightly pointed to the large number of concessions that, since taking up her post, she has already made on the bill and I, too, welcome her acceptance this morning of a presumption against development on inby land and her intention to right a historical wrong by closing the Cunningham-Whitbread loophole. However, I hope that she recognises that many of us in the chamber feel that the bill needs further major surgery if it is to command support at subsequent stages.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766264", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It would not be uncharitable to suggest that the bill has endured a somewhat traumatic birth.

Under my colleague Ross <place-holder colnum=\"26076\"/> Finnie's stewardship, recycling rates in Scotland increased from an anaemic 7 per cent in 2001-02 to 25 per cent in 2005-06. Impressive though that rate of growth might be&#8212;further progress continues to be made&#8212;there is no escaping the fact that we started from an appallingly low base and that tougher, more complex and more costly challenges lie ahead, as the cabinet secretary acknowledged.</p><p>That is also reflected in Elaine Murray's amendment, which rightly highlights the warnings set out in the recent Audit Scotland report, \"Protecting and improving Scotland's environment\", which drew attention to the potential difficulties in incentivising and supporting collaborative action between local authorities as a result of reductions in the overall waste budgets. I know that ministers have rejected that argument in the past. Nevertheless, fears remain that to meet the challenges ahead, not only will additional waste management facilities be necessary but councils will increasingly require to act in a collaborative fashion, which, in turn, has resource implications.</p><p>John Scott's amendment identifies specific issues in relation to waste in the commercial and industrial sectors, which the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee discussed during its consideration of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. There was clear evidence that much more attention needs to be focused on improving rates of recycling and reuse in those sectors&#8212;some options were set out this afternoon. The evidence sessions that the committee held at that time also flagged up the risks in adopting different and potentially conflicting approaches to reducing and managing waste. The Scottish Environmental Services Association expressed its concern about proposals for deposit and return schemes, which its members felt might undermine progress that had already been made on kerbside recycling initiatives. The fear seemed to be that, given the cost of putting in the necessary infrastructure and the difficulties in terms of messaging for the public and businesses, it is essential that the Government and the public sector more generally take decisions and stick to them.</p><p>The Government motion points to the need for clear, long-term stability for the necessary investment to deliver a zero waste Scotland. That very much speaks to the point that SESA and others made during our evidence sessions. Whatever is adopted this afternoon as a statement from the Parliament must reflect the urgency of the situation. That is why I hope that colleagues, including Elaine Murray, will be able to agree to back the amendment in my name.</p><p>I understand that the cabinet secretary disagrees but, as a zero waste strategy was <place-holder colnum=\"26077\"/> identified as an early priority in the SNP's 2007 manifesto, it is reasonable to have expected quicker progress&#8212;all the more so when the strategy appeared in the list of achievements of the Administration's first 100 days.</p><p>The urgency is brought home by the risks of not achieving the targets that have been set. The risks are that we will not meet our climate change objectives and that financial penalties will be imposed. COSLA's briefing estimates that fines for non-compliance with our EU obligations could be about &#8364;500 million per day. The briefing also says that the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"costs associated with underachievement in the medium to long term would be high and highly divisive ... the likelihood is that councils who have been successful in reaching their intended targets would not share the financial responsibility for any failure, although this can not be guaranteed.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, time does not allow me to go into great detail about the potential benefits of waste-to-energy projects, on which the cabinet secretary touched. That means not just district heating systems, but innovative anaerobic digestion, such as the facility in Westray in my constituency. Such projects have developed successfully in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Through feed-in tariffs, we might be able to replicate that in Scotland. As the cabinet secretary conceded, sensitivities exist, but I trust that the Government's zero waste plan will address the issue, along with the other matters that have been mentioned in this brief debate.</p><p>I look forward finally to seeing the long-awaited plan and I encourage members to support not just the motion but each amendment at decision time.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-6275.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; regrets the delay in the publication of the Zero Waste Plan, and recognises the necessity of meeting EU landfill diversion targets in order to avoid potentially punitive fines.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766193", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Zero Waste Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Back in March in this chamber, I had the opportunity to take a four-minute canter through the fundamentals of how we might deliver on our climate change objectives.

That was a central theme in last week's excellent debate on transmission charging. I reiterate the need for the charging structure to underpin the renewables revolution that we all want and certainly not to work against it, as at present.</p><p>I do not dispute that all that comes at a significant up-front cost, but the benefits in the longer term for emissions reductions and security of supply and for more managed and affordable energy costs more than justify the investment. When we add the opportunities for job and wealth creation&#8212;not just in Dundee but in remoter parts of the country, such as the islands that I represent&#8212;it is self-evident that we should strain every sinew to deliver those aspirations.</p><p>The risk is that new nuclear build diverts investment&#8212;including vital research and development funding&#8212;from genuine renewables. It is worth reflecting on the Scottish Government's record. The importance of the saltire prize&#8212;Mr Salmond's vanity project that will pay out nothing until 2017 at the earliest and might pay out later&#8212;has constantly been elevated above the need for more immediate and targeted R and D funding for the marine sector. The point about R and D in Mr FitzPatrick's motion is well made. Another risk is that the picture is distorted for decisions about grid, other infrastructure and supply-chain development.</p><p>New nuclear is touted as a cheaper solution in the short to medium term, but such an approach to policy making has landed us with the problems that we now face. Given that we still have no acceptable solution for waste disposal&#8212;perhaps the minister will say whether his Government is considering disposal options for nuclear waste&#8212;and given the longer-term issues with sourcing uranium and the serious concerns about the impact on the development of genuine renewables, the case for new nuclear is at best superficial.</p><p>I congratulate Joe FitzPatrick again on securing the debate, although I fear that his hope that it will allow the Parliament to speak with a clear voice on the issue was a little overoptimistic.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It strikes me that the theme and the motion for the debate stray somewhat from the approach that is generally taken to members' business.

However, as the minister made clear earlier, we must not overlook the fact that the discussion will have to take place with Ofgem, the UK Government and others. Indeed, that has been happening.</p><p>Today's debate has been useful. It has ranged rather broadly. It started off with some optimistic remarks from the minister about some of the changes that have been made and the limitations and problems of the current charging regime, which are accepted to a greater or lesser extent across the chamber.</p><p>Lewis Macdonald focused on setting out the background to the current regime, but he helpfully put that in the context of the benefits that we receive from having an integrated system across the UK.

That consensus has already been reflected in the speeches that have been made and in the motion and amendments that have been lodged by the minister, and by Lewis Macdonald and Gavin Brown. Although I have a great deal of sympathy with what both Mr Macdonald and Mr Brown said, I think that the Government's motion, with the addition of my amendment&#8212;which I have pleasure in moving now and will move again at the end of my speech&#8212;best reflects my party's position in the debate.</p><p>The combination also best reflects the united view of the influential group of individuals whose interest in our future energy policy prompted them earlier this week to write to each of the party leaders in advance of this debate. Scottish Power, SSE and a range of leading business and union representatives have joined together to put forward what most of us will agree is a pretty clear and compelling case, although we might agree with the various arguments to greater or lesser extents. In essence, the group seeks an urgent review of the UK transmission regime for four main <place-holder colnum=\"25490\"/> reasons and, although the language in which each of the amendments is couched might differ slightly, it is evident from them that that is something that we all readily sign up to.</p><p>Of course, that should not come as a surprise, given that in February the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee made a similar recommendation, calling for a full and proper independent review to inform</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a fair and open transmission access and charging regime\".</p><p>Although Gavin Brown quite rightly identified some of the problems that are inherent in achieving consensus in that debate, we are nevertheless right to embark urgently on this process.</p><p>Scotland suffers from a transmission pricing structure that requires electricity generators that are seeking to connect to the grid to pay increased charges the further away they are from the market. That is the rationale behind the locational regime. Given that the most potent renewable energy sources are located in the most remote areas, the charging system penalises green energy suppliers and hampers the realisation of Scotland's renewable energy potential.</p><p>I deeply regret, and am very worried by, evidence that developers are being actively discouraged from investing in renewable energy projects in Scotland because of the way in which these charges affect their deliverability. Lewis Macdonald pointed to the limited evidence on that, but there is evidence and it bears scrutiny. In my constituency, which the minister referred to, we are extremely proud of the world lead that we are taking in development of marine renewables, but there has already been a decision by Fairwind Statkraft Orkney Ltd essentially to shelve plans to progress its onshore wind proposals. It has been made abundantly clear that that is due largely, although not exclusively, to the prohibitive costs that result from the current charging regime.</p><p>Given Scotland's massive renewables potential, it seems to be absurd that it has been estimated that a project on Orkney faces paying as much as &#163;42.13 per kilowatt for the privilege of connecting to the grid, while projects in the south-west of England could find themselves eligible for subsidies of up to &#163;7 per kilowatt. At this point, it would be appropriate for me to acknowledge the point that Gavin Brown made about the dangers of seeing the debate in stark black-and-white terms&#8212;in terms of Scotland versus England. I also acknowledge that the minister steered a diplomatic course around that.</p><p>Amidst all the optimism and no little hyperbole surrounding the Crown Estate's recent announcement of the first round of wave and tidal licences in Orkney waters and the Pentland Firth, we should not lose sight of the potential threat that <place-holder colnum=\"25491\"/> is posed by the uncertainty and costs that are inherent in the current transmission regime. If the fears are realised, that would be a pretty shameful indictment of us as policy makers. As Martin McAdam of Aquamarine Power Ltd made clear, the charging structure \"fundamentally makes no sense\".</p><p>I accept Gavin Brown's suggestion that the regime was devised and set up prior to the public policy objectives that we now have, particularly those relating to climate change and security of supply. I could make the point that some of the current problems have arisen from overestimates&#8212;certainly in the case of the northern isles&#8212;of the capacity of future wind arrays combined with what appears to be significant underestimation of the likely capital costs. Nevertheless, the point that Mr Brown made in his argument and in his amendment makes the case well for why the review that we all appear to support is much needed, as a matter of urgency.</p><p>If the UK as a whole is to get anywhere close to the renewables production targets that it has to achieve by 2020, Scotland will be required to shoulder much of the responsibility. The Scottish Liberal Democrats are only too happy for the Parliament, the Government and all of us to embrace that responsibility, but we will be required to will the means as well as the ends. The process should include an overhaul of the charging regime. Failure to achieve that in a timescale that recognises the urgency of the challenges that we face could well result in jobs and wealth creation opportunities being captured elsewhere. We are already seeing risks in that regard. Again, we could leave ourselves open to accusations of negligence on a grand scale. With natural resources, research, engineering skills and a company base at our disposal&#8212;notably in our world-leading oil and gas sector&#8212;we must surely not allow the competitive advantage that we enjoy to be squandered.</p><p>It is not only renewables developers who risk losing out; Scotland is well placed to take advantage of the developing carbon capture and storage technology by dint of being sited close to the viable storage features of the North Sea. However, it appears that prospective facilities that hope to utilise CCS technologies could also be penalised by the current transmission charging regime. Scottish Power has made clear the risks that it sees in that regard. The charging regime could have an impact on its investment decisions. Given that the proposed pilot project at the company's Longannet plant is surely in pole position to secure funding and there is an opportunity to demonstrate that CCS can be delivered and is viable on a large scale, we would do well to heed that warning. That is why my amendment seeks to draw out that point <place-holder colnum=\"25492\"/> specifically. Lewis Macdonald alluded to that. There may be more limited opportunities for CCS deployment in Scotland, but they could still have an important role to play in helping us to decarbonise our energy production and our overall economy. The potential for that technology to help to deliver real and lasting benefits globally is what is most exciting. With the likes of China and India likely to be reliant on abundant coal deposits for some time to come, the opportunities in that field are not difficult to imagine.</p><p>The remarks that have been made so far have set a fairly downbeat tone. There have been improvements, some of which the minister alluded to, and progress has been made. There appears to be an acceptance in Ofgem that the TNUOS regime can be improved. The debate that we might still have to have is about the scale of improvements that are required. There have been improvements. Having the charging for wind generation not pegged to peak demand has been welcomed by the renewables industry. In my constituency, the registered power zone initiative has been broadly welcomed and has allowed for much more active management of the grid locally. That has provided additional headroom, in the absence of longer-term solutions, in the grid infrastructure that supports the islands.</p><p>The reasons that I have set out underscore the Scottish Liberal Democrats' belief that the rules that govern use of the network should be reformed to provide equality throughout the grid and investor confidence in renewables developments in Scotland. Without such reform, there is a real risk that we will discourage investment in renewable energy, jeopardise security of supply and undermine economic and employment opportunities, while putting in doubt our ability to achieve our climate change targets.

I will come to the Tories' voting record in just a minute.</p><p>When one considers that the average wage and household income in many remote rural and island areas is lower than it is elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the claim for a fairer deal on fuel duty becomes compelling. It is that claim that demands a response from this Parliament and a collective commitment from us to make the case and continue making the case at UK and European Union level&#8212;wherever&#8212;until a satisfactory outcome is achieved. I recognise that the SNP's favoured option is for a fuel regulator. As I said in last year's debate, my concern about that option is that it fails to address the premium that is paid by people who live and work in remote rural communities. That was acknowledged by the minister's colleague, Stewart Hosie, who has also accepted that the regulator would keep prices artificially high at times, such as we witnessed last <place-holder colnum=\"25329\"/> year, when the price of oil falls back. I know that that concerns my constituents and I dare say that it concerns many who are represented by others.</p><p>I do not oppose the minister's amendment as it asks merely that the option of a fuel regulator be looked at. It would be strange if, having urged Parliament to unite to make progress on the issue as a matter of urgency, I insisted on ruling out consideration of any potential solution, albeit in the context of the need to introduce measures as quickly as possible. That could even extend to the fuel price stabiliser, wheeled out proudly, if not entirely convincingly, by the Tories. Their proposal seems to suffer from the same shortcomings that I identified in relation to the SNP's regulator, with the added complication that it asks us to pin our hopes on George Osborne's being able to guesstimate an appropriate base rate for fuel&#8212;an heroic assumption, most would agree.</p><p>In last April's debate, Alex Johnstone admitted that there were \"significant similarities\" between his party's approach and that of the SNP.

Rather unadvisedly, former Labour Treasury minister John Healey tried that approach several years ago in response to a Liberal Democrat amendment to the Finance Bill that sought to introduce a rural fuel discount scheme. Not satisfied with joining forces with Labour MPs to defeat that amendment, not just in that year but on each occasion it has been tabled, Tory MPs now appear intent on deploying some of the worst possible arguments used by Labour ministers to resist such a scheme.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763231", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Prices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I understand it, Liberal Democrat MPs voted against that latest announcement by Alistair Darling.

No doubt Mr Johnstone is thinking what I am thinking and will wish to offer Mr Gauke some suggestions as to where he might like to deposit his London discount.</p><p>The fact remains that the Tories did not support our motion last year that called for a rural fuel derogation. They went on to vote against our proposal for a transitional relief scheme that would have assisted many small rural petrol stations clobbered by the eye-watering rises that they now face in their rates bills. Now, Tory candidates claim that they want fairer fuel prices and a better deal for struggling fuel providers. That simply will not wash.</p><p>Despite the Tories' indifference, last April, the Parliament supported our motion that committed the Scottish Government to working with its UK counterparts</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to construct a derogation under the EU energy products directive\".</p><p>Petition PE1181, which <em>Am P&#224;ipear</em> in Benbecula promoted, made a similar call. However, since last year's vote, in which they supported our motion, the vigour with which the Scottish ministers have pursued the case has been somewhat underwhelming.</p><p>When the Scottish Parliament information centre contacted Scottish Government officials last Thursday, it was told that a letter from John Swinney to the UK Government on 14 November 2008 was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the most recent action taken by Ministers on this issue.\"</p><p>I acknowledge that it has since emerged that Mr Swinney wrote again to the chancellor last month and that he received a reply on 9 April. Perhaps that is further evidence of Government officials withholding information from SPICe&#8212;after the revelation in the debate on rates. Whatever is the case, that level of activity does not convey the urgency that one might expect from the Scottish Government. That is disappointing, not least because the Scottish Government has a strong case to make. The arguments that Mr Swinney marshalled in his letter of 19 March to Alistair Darling were excellently put. As Mr Swinney said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"securing a rural fuel derogation\"&#8212;</p><p>not a fuel regulator, of course&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"could go some way to offsetting the significantly higher fuel costs in rural Scotland and put consumers and businesses <place-holder colnum=\"25331\"/> in such areas on a more equal footing with those in urban regions.\"</p><p>Mr Swinney cited the example of France, which has been granted permission to apply a reduced duty rate in the region of Corsica, to argue that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a similar arrangement in Scotland could help alleviate the price pressures faced by those communities most affected by high fuel costs.\"</p><p>Indeed. Likewise, Greece and Portugal have used such a derogation under EU law. Despite supporting that approach in other EU member states, UK Labour ministers believe it to be too \"administratively burdensome\" to implement here. I am surely not alone in being puzzled&#8212;if not a little alarmed&#8212;by the notion that the Greek civil service and tax authorities are capable of managing such administrative complexity but those in the UK are not.</p><p>Lib Dems have led the campaign for a rural fuel duty derogation for several years. At Westminster, my colleagues have developed and sought to introduce a rural fuel discount scheme, which has precedent elsewhere in Europe. The case for such a derogation is compelling and based on the principle of fairness. Unlike the proposals that other parties have made, our approach&#8212;which NFU Scotland has this week supported&#8212;addresses the overall cost and the premium that those in remote rural and island areas pay.</p><p>The costs of such a scheme are modest, but not so the potential benefits to people who live and work in rural Scotland. Less than 3 per cent of the UK's population lives in remote rural areas, but that figure is 10 per cent in Scotland. If we do not make the case for a fuel duty derogation consistently, persistently and with renewed urgency, we cannot expect others to do so for us.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving the motion. I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the AA report of 8 April 2010 that indicates that the average price of petrol in the United Kingdom has reached an all-time high and is likely to rise still further; recognises the high premium over the national average paid for fuel at filling stations in remote rural and, particularly, island communities; regrets the damaging financial and social impact that this has on individuals and businesses in these areas; further regrets the lack of progress that has been made on efforts to find a mechanism to reduce the price of fuel in specified remote rural and island areas of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold urgent discussions with the UK Government and the European Commission to construct a mechanism, under the EU energy products directive or otherwise, to reduce the fuel price differential between remote rural and island communities and urban areas of the UK.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763231", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Prices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The case for our proposal is recognised across the board and was even recognised by some of Charlie Gordon's colleagues when we last debated the subject.

I acknowledge that the process of getting there will not be easy or straightforward, but progress will not be made any easier if ministers and their officials fail to engage fully and in early course with those who are expected to contribute. The attempt to put NorthLink Ferries sailings to the northern isles on reduced power is a case in point. I trust that the minister has learned lessons from the way in which that consultation was handled.</p><p>Although ferry sailings might be lower down the list of priorities for other members, common cause can surely be found&#8212;this was demonstrated during the debate&#8212;on the development and roll-out of low and zero-carbon vehicles. As Alison McInnes rightly pointed out, the Government has as yet failed to grasp the opportunity to lead by example. If we are to see the widespread take-up of electric vehicles that was part of the transformational change called for in the climate change delivery plan, ministers must make early efforts to remove obstacles by making a commitment to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Alex Johnstone made some excellent points about the link between Government commitment and public confidence. At this stage, that might go no further than ensuring that such infrastructure is being properly planned for, but we certainly need to see evidence <place-holder colnum=\"24713\"/> that the issue is being taken seriously by ministers.</p><p>As Alison McInnes pointed out, in contrast to south of the border where charging infrastructure has been introduced under the plugged-in places project, nothing appears to be happening so far in Scotland. Ministers must work with local authorities, businesses and others to explore options for submitting a bid later in the year. I know that there is certainly an appetite for that in my constituency. Notwithstanding Sarah Boyack's and Patrick Harvie's comments about Glasgow and Edinburgh, Orkney seems, on the face of it, ideally suited to developing electric car infrastructure, given the limited mileages that are travelled. Likewise, given the on-going restrictions of grid capacity&#8212;an issue that I hope can and will be resolved in the near future&#8212;piloting an electric vehicle roll-out in Orkney would help to mop up excess local electricity generation that cannot be exported at present. The offer is there, if the minister chooses to take it up. In return, I can confirm that the Liberal Democrats will support the minister's amendment at decision time.</p><p>We will also support Patrick Harvie's amendment. I entirely agree with what has been said about the impact that the addition of 1,200MW of unabated emissions from a new coal-fired power station at Hunterston would have on our climate change objectives. CCS has an important role to play in the abatement of existing emissions. That is why we support the proposals for Longannet. By contrast, the proposal for Hunterston would in effect drive a coach and horses through the Government's stated ambitions.</p><p>The Tory amendment could be interpreted as a wish that efforts to tackle climate change be put on the back burner. Like others, I welcomed the emergence of Alex Johnstone's late-blossoming green side during the passage of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. While not entirely convincing, his performance was undoubtedly touching to watch. However, I was reassured by his opening speech in the debate, so we will support his amendment.</p><p>The time constraints, as others have observed, have prevented any real, substantive discussion of the range of issues on which detail is crucially needed, but the message from today's parliamentary debate has been clear. I hope that the minister will now heed that message and, in the words of Alison McInnes, act early and act often.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20701619", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a brief but useful debate, not least in confirming that George Foulkes is stalking the First Minister's every carbon footprint.

We do not appear to have suffered from overexposure to the issue. By and large, members have succeeded in being consistent without being repetitive. That may be due in no small part to the contributions of aquaculture virgins such as Ian McKee. I particularly appreciated his comments on the health benefits of the fish, to which he was one of the few speakers to allude. I am not entirely sure that those benefits would be the same if we were force fed the entire output of Scotland's aquaculture sector, as Robin Harper seemed to suggest before he clarified the point.</p><p>Robin Harper highlighted a number of the risks that the sector faces. No member doubts the seriousness of those risks, but any response to them needs to be proportionate. What Robin Harper suggests may be slightly disproportionate; <place-holder colnum=\"24413\"/> rather than simply urging the Government to introduce closed containment systems, his amendment calls for the phasing out of open net-pens. I am sure that the issue will remain live, but the amendment goes further than the chamber is comfortable with at the moment.</p><p>Like other members, Maureen Watt drew the chamber's attention to the sector's success, including the attainment of the acclaimed label rouge mark of quality. The figures that she quoted for the sector's growth were impressive, and she highlighted the market opportunities worldwide that remain strong, despite the current economic difficulties. I was, therefore, not sure why we were then treated to the stump speech about the seating plan at the top table. None of the messages that have come through from the industry in the briefings that I have received for any of the aquaculture debates in which I have participated suggest that independence would convey any benefits to it. I am sure that the Scottish ministers will and should take a leading role in discussions on issues such as the minimum import price and, possibly, PGI status.</p><p>When Peter Peacock got to his feet, John Scott and I observed that the blinds were raised and the sunlight was allowed to cascade into the chamber. I am not entirely sure whether that was in some way symbolic, but I have observed that ministers have been keen to f&#234;te Peter Peacock for his thoughtful and considered contributions; today offered a further example of that genre. As the member pointed out, in light of the collapse of the industry in Chile following the ISA outbreak there, investment has been directed largely towards the industry in Norway. There are implications for output, but Peter Peacock was right to point to some of the serious concerns relating to research and development, especially in the longer term.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor focused his remarks on the quality of the Scottish product and on the economic and, more particularly, social contributions that the aquaculture sector makes in the parts of the country that he and I represent. I am confident that he has secured himself a place in the executive box at the Camanachd cup final this year. However, I acknowledge Jim Hume's point that the industry is not confined to the Highlands and Islands; the south of Scotland also has an important part to play.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor raised the issue of escapes. All members acknowledge that there have been improvements in recent years, but escapes are clearly a risk that can never be taken lightly. Every proportionate precaution should be taken to bear down on that risk.</p><p>Alasdair Allan, who is normally such a cheery chap, was right to sound a more sombre note. He acknowledged, as we all should, the challenging <place-holder colnum=\"24414\"/> environment in which the industry operates. It has not been a story of rise and rise. Job losses in communities such as those that he represents can have a significant impact.</p><p>Richard Simpson noted that 40 per cent of our food exports derive from the aquaculture sector. The reason for that is the quality of the product, which depends on addressing a range of issues in future, including escapes and lice. Richard Simpson mentioned bacterial kidney disease and its impact on our ability to export eggs and smolts in future. That appeared to be a hospital pass for the minister and I will leave her to deal with it in her winding-up speech.</p><p>In the spirit of hospital passes, I encourage the minister to make representations in the strongest possible terms to Stewart Stevenson to ensure that the views of the aquaculture industry in Shetland and Orkney&#8212;as well as of other stakeholders in the northern isles&#8212;are taken fully into account before any decisions are made regarding changes to the lifeline ferry services to those communities.</p><p>David Whitton spoke with authority about skills and training needs, which are mentioned in my amendment. As he said, the debate dates back to the first framework that was developed by the previous Executive. The evidence from Lantra is interesting, and not simply in an academic sense&#8212;some of the issues around escapes and so on can be addressed through better skills. Mr Whitton made that point very well.</p><p>Scottish farmed salmon is an iconic brand. That high-quality product commands a premium in the marketplace of somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent. We cannot compete on the basis of high volume and low price, but must target a niche market. Consumers expect transparency about the origin and provenance of salmon and that must be guaranteed so that authenticity and quality are in no way diluted. Consumers have that confidence at present, but care must be taken in attempting to support the continued sustainable growth of our world-class aquaculture industry. We must recognise that the first rule of Government is to do no harm. I believe that the minister is alive to the risk, and I encourage her to continue to work with the industry, with MSPs from across the chamber and with all those who share a real ambition for the future of the sector.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20679574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Robin Harper, I believe that this has been a useful and interesting debate.

Like other members, I find myself the veteran of three exchanges on aquaculture in the past 18 months. Notwithstanding the importance of the sector, all of us might find more variety in our future parliamentary diet beneficial. Having spent a morning together going over the issue of crofting, we might also achieve consensus on the less-than-ideal timing of the debate, to which Elaine Murray referred.</p><p>I welcome and accept the minister's apology for the delay in publishing \"Delivering Planning Reform for Aquaculture\", although lodging a motion that fails to mention the document is perhaps a little forgetful. Nevertheless, we have no difficulty supporting the motion. Elaine Murray's amendment makes a number of good points that I would support, but not at the expense of allowing Parliament to put on record the issue of affordable <place-holder colnum=\"24386\"/> housing, to which John Scott's amendment refers. Clarification on the issue of pre-emption would be helpful. I am disinclined to support Robin Harper's amendment, largely for the reasons that Elaine Murray and the minister set out.</p><p>I echo the comments of the minister and others on the quality, breadth and value of the sector. The importance of aquaculture to Scotland is without question and goes beyond pounds and pence. In its various forms, it has helped to sustain economies and communities in some of the most remote parts of the country, including the islands that I represent.</p><p>The timing of the debate is perhaps even more unfortunate because it comes the day after the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change unilaterally decided to change the timetabling arrangements for ferry services to the northern isles. Without any consultation with key users, including aquaculture businesses in Orkney and Shetland, decisions appear to have been taken to bring forward departures and to lengthen travel times. The week-round shipping of farmed fish and shellfish from the isles is time critical. In Shetland, such shipping amounts to more than 47,000 tonnes per annum; in Orkney, the figure is almost 7,000 tonnes. Apart from the potential impact on other sectors of our island economy, taking such a risk with the profitability&#8212;perhaps even the viability&#8212;of such a large part of Scotland's overall aquaculture production without consultation seems utter madness.</p><p>After all, Scotland's industry has developed an impressive foothold and an enviable reputation in the global marketplace. Our fin fish and shellfish command a premium price, and demand from existing as well as new markets appears to be strong. In the debate in May last year, I highlighted the formidable presence of the Scottish sector at the European seafood exposition in Brussels. At that stage, opportunities in the middle east had been identified, as well as in the US, due to the effects of ISA on the Chilean industry. It would be helpful if the minister could update Parliament on whether that demand remains strong and, if so, on what is being done by officials in Scottish Development International to identify and develop those and other market opportunities.</p><p>An important part of the exercise involves brand and marketing. I noted with interest comments that were recently attributed to the cabinet secretary, suggesting that his appetite is growing for mandatory country-of-origin labelling through European food information regulations. As he pointed out, country-of-origin labelling</p><p class=\"indent\">\"can help provide ... consumers with greater clarity and guidance about the food they buy and strengthen Scotland's reputation as a land of food and drink.\"<place-holder colnum=\"24387\"/></p><p>The message from Mr Lochhead seems to be \"European legislation the sooner the better\". However, as the minister will not need reminding, it is not as simple as slapping a saltire on a pack of salmon and demanding that the Scottish shopper do their patriotic duty&#8212;I note that Aileen Campbell's saltire points scheme appears to have been quietly dumped in cold storage. For any such labelling to be meaningful, it needs to rest on demonstrable quality standards. Any dilution of that risks undermining the reputation and value of the brand.</p><p>It is all the more strange that SNP ministers appear to be reluctant&#8212;to date&#8212;to offer a view on any proposed change to protected geographical indication status for Scottish farmed salmon. Quick to denounce their UK counterparts over their negotiating position with Europe on country-of-origin labelling, Scottish ministers appear very reluctant to make clear their position on possible modifications to PGI status whereby smolts could be brought into Scotland to be sold later as Scottish salmon.</p><p>I fully appreciate that that is an issue on which people in the industry have different views. Given the economics of the industry, I can well understand why the case is being made for altering PGI regulations. All the arguments require to be weighed up before decisions are taken, and ministers cannot and must not pretend that the Scottish Government is merely a mailbox for onward communication to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#8212;and then to the European Commission.</p><p>Underlying all that is the fact that the value of the Scottish product in the marketplace relies implicitly on the highest welfare and environmental standards being maintained. As in other parts of the food and drink sector, although the quality of our natural environment gives us a competitive advantage, the quality of our product depends on industry doing the right things with and in that environment.</p><p>In that regard, the industry's code of good practice is very welcome. Also welcome is the Government's renewed strategic framework, which builds on what Mike Russell described as the \"strong foundations\" that were laid by the previous Executive.</p><p>With Parliament's passing of the Marine (Scotland) Bill earlier this year, we have an opportunity to develop this vital industry in the context of marine spatial planning. Despite Tory and Labour reservations, I remain convinced that Parliament was right to reject attempts to centralise the planning function for aquaculture and to leave in charge local councils, many of which had invested heavily in building up a wealth of local knowledge and technical expertise. That <place-holder colnum=\"24388\"/> issue having been settled by the Parliament&#8212;not just Scottish Liberal Democrats&#8212;it would be helpful, even at this early stage, if the minister could indicate what impact she expects the legislation to have on the siting of existing and, perhaps more important, future fish farms.</p><p>As for the practical implications of the proposals that were announced in the document that was published yesterday, it would be helpful if the minister could outline how she will ensure that they can be implemented without in any way eroding the safeguards that fundamentally protect the reputation and long-term profitability of the industry.</p><p>I turn now to a theme that I have raised in each of the previous debates on aquaculture: skills and training. It is self-evident that, given the standards to which we want the industry to aspire, we must retain and attract skilled workers. Small to medium-sized enterprises must be supported in creating genuine career opportunities and structures. Qualifications are critically important for both those aims.</p><p>In the Highlands and Islands, where the workforce is generally older, training providers and aquaculture companies are worried about the impact that removing skills funding for over-20s might have on efforts to improve and extend the skills base. Often, distance learning and work-based courses deliver real value. I therefore urge the minister to reconsider that specific matter, as well as the wider issue of skills and training, as reflected in my amendment.</p><p>The quality of our natural environment, the skills of our workforce and the reputation of the product that the workforce produces give cause for real optimism that Scotland's success in the sector can be maintained and enhanced in the future. I have pleasure in moving the amendment in my name and I encourage Parliament to support it.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5908.3, after \"particular\" to insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; calls on the Scottish Government to clarify what action it is taking to develop and retain a skilled and qualified workforce in the sector; supports industry calls for greater clarity about the food consumers buy through country of origin labelling, and invites ministers to make clear their intentions regarding any moves to amend protected geographical status for Scottish farmed salmon;\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20679574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Whatever challenges Scottish aquaculture faces, a lack of exposure to the gentle probing of largely consensual parliamentary debate is surely not one of them.

It is to be hoped that he has his thinking head on.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has suggested that the debate is intended to give Parliament an opportunity to respond to the interim findings in the Pack report and offer views. Although I feel that his offer is somewhat hamstrung by the lack of detail in some key areas, I will attempt to enter into the spirit of the minister's invitation.</p><p>I have no difficulty with the Government motion and Liberal Democrats will also be able to support each of the amendments that have been lodged this afternoon, all of which acknowledge in different ways the wide contribution that agriculture can and must continue to make into the future. My amendment, however, seeks to make a broader point. I will try to reassure the cabinet secretary, who I know has reservations. We are busy deliberating how the cake should be divided up without assessing what size the cake should be in the first place. I am under no illusion about the pressure on agricultural budgets and indeed, on all budgets now and for the foreseeable future. The serious problems facing numerous economies in the EU at present give cause for concern and only help to reinforce the sense that cuts might be inevitable.</p><p>Notwithstanding that grim reality, we must accept that the UK as a whole, and perhaps Scotland in particular, has never been well served <place-holder colnum=\"24067\"/> by the way in which funding is allocated under the CAP. That is particularly true for pillar 2 funding, on which we lag far behind most of our European partners. I am not saying that mounting a case for sustaining the CAP budget overall and direct payments in particular would be easy&#8212;there are good reasons for believing that finding allies elsewhere in Europe might be difficult&#8212;but there is a case to be made. By making that case, we would at least encourage some debate about the size of the cake that we are left trying to distribute, whether by the methods set out by Brian Pack or in some other way.</p><p>It would be helpful if the cabinet secretary would say when he winds up what work he and his officials have done or are doing to develop alternative models of how resources might be allocated at EU level. There is no doubt that such work is taking place in other national capitals throughout Europe. We need reassurance from the Scottish Government that it is undertaking a similar exercise. If it is not, we risk being left needlessly disadvantaged in the difficult negotiations ahead.</p><p>My amendment acknowledges the strong case that Brian Pack has made for on-going direct support for agriculture and food production. However, there is a general concern among the farming community, much in evidence at the excellent event in St Andrews last week, that there appears to be a serious risk of funding leaking out, potentially in significant amounts, from regions across the country. Without further detail on how the top-up fund might work, or indeed on the SRDP and LFASS, it is impossible to corroborate or accurately quantify that risk, but that does not invalidate the concerns.</p><p>Other fears have been raised, as is borne out by the briefings that we received from a wide range of stakeholders. I do not argue that moving from an historical basis for payments to one based more on area is not inevitable or even desirable. However, the NFUS is right to point out that such a system would bring with it a unique set of problems in Scotland, given our geography and reliance on livestock. I echo that sentiment, representing as I do a constituency that is heavily dependent on farming that has an excellent reputation for high-quality beef and lamb. It is hard to see how a flatter, area-based system would address Orkney's needs, despite the fact that the local industry has responded at every turn to some of the issues that Sarah Boyack raised, such as consumer demands for higher quality and environmental and animal welfare standards. The harsh reality is that we have good-quality land, but it is a scarce resource. More pertinent, producers find themselves some distance from markets, accessible only by ferry and sometimes by more than one.<place-holder colnum=\"24068\"/></p><p>As I said in my intervention on the cabinet secretary, I am keen to see what conclusions are drawn about how LFASS rules might accommodate island status, not simply mountain regions and land types. Again, that is a case that only Scotland has an interest in building and only Scotland can be expected to build.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary highlighted, one of the most potent criticisms of the historical basis of payment is that it gives rise to so-called armchair farmers, which should be addressed. I note the argument from the NFUS and the STFA for a rebasing exercise to take place. As John Scott said, that should be considered, although I expect that, at this stage, the chances of success are limited. Certainly, any rebasing would have to be tied to strict time limits and a clear understanding of what more fundamental reforms were to follow in due course. It should not be overlooked that paying landowners for doing little or nothing is a risk that would not disappear simply by moving to an area-based system. Again, that is acknowledged by Brian Pack and his team and must be reflected in any future negotiating position.</p><p>I will touch on the short-term options identified by Brian Pack in his interim report. There have been calls by some, including RSPB Scotland, for a change to an area-based system immediately, and certainly before 2013. Although I respect its reasons for arguing that case, it is not one that I support. Nor would I support using article 68 in the ways suggested in the interim report; although the causes to which it could be put are worthy of support, I do not believe that the pain that would need to be caused would be justified by any consequent gain.</p><p>I appreciate that Brian Pack has long-held concerns about the beef calf scheme, but I urge the Government to hold fire. I think, perhaps in contrast to Sarah Boyack, that&#8212;as I said at the outset&#8212;there is a risk of Scottish ministers rushing to show their hand. This is an occasion on which the benefits of being the prime mover are not immediately obvious. Nevertheless, a balance must be struck. Ministers must ensure that the detailed preparatory work is done without boxing themselves into positions too early. In that context, I hope that I have reassured the cabinet secretary and other members, so that they will now be able to support the amendment in my name.</p><p>I again congratulate Brian Pack and wish him well in his further deliberations. Likewise, I look forward to continuing to participate in the debate on this crucial issue over the coming months.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5807.3, to insert at end:<place-holder colnum=\"24069\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"; notes concerns over the possible removal of funding from active farmers and crofters; recognises, however, that the report makes a strong case for the ongoing direct support of agriculture and food production and therefore believes that the overall level of Single Farm Payment funding should be maintained, and opposes any reduction in agricultural spending through the CAP.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice and Law Officers: \"Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I acknowledge the efforts of Brian Pack and his team, and I welcome him to the public gallery this afternoon.

Either way, I will be interested to hear what Mary Scanlon has to say in due course.</p><p>Likewise, I hope that the minister can be persuaded to change his mind on this issue. I acknowledge his efforts to help to persuade HIAL&#8212;well after the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, I might add&#8212;to suspend the introduction of car parking charges at Kirkwall airport to allow consultation to take place. Nevertheless, he previously sanctioned those charges and, as I understand it, he still supports them.</p><p>The case for resisting the charges is compelling. I will start by addressing the point that some have made that car parking charges exist at other airports, including Inverness and Dundee, which are also operated by HIAL, and that there is therefore no reason why they should not exist at Kirkwall, Sumburgh and Stornoway. Frankly, that view betrays a complete misunderstanding of the function of those airports. It fails to recognise the lifeline nature of the air services that operate in and out of the islands and it conveniently turns a Nelsonian eye to the already high costs of accessing those lifeline services. For example, I could book a return flight this week with Flybe from Edinburgh to Kirkwall for &#163;346. Return fares from London to New York over the same period start at &#163;225, and many cost less than &#163;300. Even from Dundee and Inverness, the cost of flights is generally far lower. Dundee to Birmingham with Flybe this week costs &#163;263 and Inverness to Manchester, with the same carrier, costs an even more competitive &#163;170.<place-holder colnum=\"23949\"/></p><p>Comparing island and mainland airports appears even more fatuous when one considers the alternative options to flying. Catching a bus or train from Dundee or even Inverness is certainly more realistic than doing so from Kirkwall, Stornoway or Sumburgh, whose nearest train station is, allegedly, in Bergen.</p><p>Of course, I recognise the benefits that the air discount scheme&#8212;which was introduced by Tavish Scott when he was the minister with responsibility for transport&#8212;has brought to my constituents and many others in the Highlands and Islands. Even so, the cost of flying in and out of the main island airports remains relatively high. As HIAL board member Dr Alistair Goodlad observed at a meeting in August 2008, the car parking charge proposal \"would work against\" the air discount scheme, which was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"established to reduce the cost of air travel\".</p><p>Dr Goodlad also concluded that the scheme</p><p class=\"indent\">\"could adversely affect those living in outlying areas who have no other means of travelling to the airport\".</p><p>I could not agree more. Sadly, Dr Goodlad's concerns seem to have been dismissed by his board colleagues.</p><p>I must say&#8212;and I suspect that the minister might privately agree&#8212;that HIAL's approach to this issue has been remarkably high-handed. The fact that there has been a complete failure, until recently, to consult the local population in Orkney beggars belief. HIAL's assertion that that was somehow the responsibility of Orkney Islands Council is simply staggering. The proposals were HIAL's. The detail on how they would operate was known only to HIAL. Responsibility for ensuring that effective consultation with key local stakeholders took place was indisputably HIAL's and HIAL's alone. It is difficult to comprehend why it took HIAL so long to recognise that fact.</p><p>To compound that failure, HIAL also kept its own statutory consultative committee in the dark and then ignored, at least initially, the committee's unanimous call for the introduction of the charges to be suspended pending proper consultation. Even now, the feeling is that HIAL's consultation is a cosmetic exercise and that the organisation is simply going through the motions. That is why there is increasingly a sense in Orkney and the other island groups that the minister must step in.</p><p>The omens are not good, however. When I sought information on how the decision was reached initially, every effort was made by HIAL and the Scottish Government to frustrate and delay. There even appears to be evidence of collusion in the rejection of my requests under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, notably in an e-mail from Inglis Lyon, dated 10 December 2009, which suggested that \"a more <place-holder colnum=\"23950\"/> robust approach\" be taken and talked about the need for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"five minutes with government colleagues to agree a suitable response\".</p><p>With the assistance of the Scottish Information Commissioner, details of the discussions that took place were forthcoming, and they demonstrate a complete absence of any understanding in Government of the impact that the charges would have locally. In an e-mail of 27 November 2009, a Government official requested information on what arrangements there were for national health service patients and those islanders without easy access to the bus service from the centre of Kirkwall. That serves to highlight that decisions were taken not only without proper consultation by HIAL but with wholly inadequate scrutiny of the likely impacts by the Government. For example, the impact on Orkney patients travelling to and from hospital appointments in Aberdeen and Inverness had been completely ignored until I highlighted the issue in November.</p><p>Even now, HIAL's failure to respond to NHS Orkney's request earlier this month for details of its consultation means that NHS Orkney's board will not now have a chance to consider any possible submission until the end of April. I presume that the minister would not agree to allow any decisions to be taken in advance of NHS Orkney's views being formally submitted. That would indeed be unacceptable.</p><p>The impact on other groups was also never considered. Those who travel in from outlying islands or rural mainland parishes, the local tourism sector, renewables operators, Orkney disability forum and others all failed to register on HIAL's radar screen.</p><p>I am pleased, at least, that the collective efforts of those groups, the Kirkwall airport consultative committee and members of the public in Orkney have resulted in the charges being suspended in order to allow consultation to take place.</p><p>It is clear that Orkney's efforts have ensured that Shetland and the Western Isles will be treated with rather more respect from the outset. However, HIAL's intentions are clear. The minutes of a board meeting in August 2008 quote Mr Lyon as stating:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"at this point, I have avoided charges at both Sumburgh and Stornoway, the former because of the distance between the airport and the main centre of population and the latter because we have available space. The Board will be aware that we have recently increased the size of the car park at Kirkwall ... which gives us the ideal platform to take this project forward\".</p><p>In other words, as my motion indicates, the risk is that charges will be introduced in Orkney, thereby <place-holder colnum=\"23951\"/> clearing the way for HIAL to introduce them in Shetland and the Western Isles.</p><p>The minister appears to take a different view. In his letter to the consultative committee earlier this month, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I fully appreciate your desire for consistency, but I equally recognise that each island has different characteristics and that those have to be taken into account\".</p><p>Indeed, but HIAL has made it clear that its rationale for introducing car parking charges is simply to recoup the &#163;1 million that the Scottish ministers cut from its budget. As such, the discussion is not about the merits of car park charging but about the contribution that each community should pay to make good the Government's cuts.</p><p>Members should rest assured that any attempt to introduce airport car parking charges in Orkney before, or instead of, introducing them in the other island areas will be meet with the strongest possible resistance in my constituency. I welcome the opportunity to highlight the issue and the serious concerns that my constituents feel. I hope that, given the cross-party consensus&#8212;possibly even with the late arrival of the Tories&#8212;the minister will agree to reconsider his approval of the case for introducing the charges.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20647057", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Highlands and Islands Airports (Car Parking Charges)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have this opportunity to bring to Parliament a debate that is of major significance to my constituents and to the constituents of my colleague Tavish Scott and Dr Alasdair Allan, whose support for my motion is greatly appreciated&#8212;as indeed is the support of other members from across the chamber.

Our bill has enjoyed a lengthy gestation, but it is important that it has throughout that period enjoyed widespread support in the Parliament and beyond. Like Elaine Murray, I pay tribute to a colleague&#8212;Ross Finnie&#8212;who did much to establish the platform and principles that underpin the bill that we are about to pass. I also acknowledge the considerable efforts of the cabinet secretary and his officials in building successfully on that work.</p><p>We offer our sincere thanks to all those who gave evidence on the bill. Their expertise, patience and&#8212;as Elaine Murray said&#8212;willingness to compromise when necessary have been enormously helpful. I acknowledge the efforts of Scottish Environment LINK, Scottish Renewables, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and Advocates for Animals. I am indebted to the committee clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre, which rose to the challenge of turning our policy intentions into workable changes to this historic bill. I am also grateful for the good-natured collaboration of committee colleagues.</p><p>As I said at stage 1, my interest in the bill is more than academic.

For Scotland and the UK, our seas help to define us as nations.</p><p>The economic benefits that traditionally derive from sea fisheries, aquaculture and oil and gas; the potential of our renewable energy sector; the growth of wildlife tourism; and submerged archaeology highlight the extent of the resource on our doorstep and the pressures in managing the sometimes competing demands for access to that resource.</p><p>The bill will help us to balance those demands when necessary. I very much welcome the duties that ministers and public authorities will have to protect and enhance Scotland's marine environment. In relation to that, I acknowledge the role of Peter Peacock and Elaine Murray in lodging amendments. We have achieved a sensible compromise about the relative importance that is attached to economic, social and climate mitigation considerations.</p><p>In the limited time that remains, I will touch on a few issues that emerged in the debate today. I am delighted that attempts to bring responsibility for fish-farm licensing under the control of Marine Scotland were resisted and that my foreboding was misplaced. As I have said throughout the process, the proposed changes were unnecessary and would have introduced a presumption in <place-holder colnum=\"23601\"/> favour of centralisation, in the interests of administrative neatness. COSLA and a number of people in the industry&#8212;notably in Shetland&#8212;highlighted the risks of a loss of efficiency, of local accountability and of financial certainty in business planning. Parliament has listened to the evidence and sent a clear signal about our confidence in councils, several of which have invested time and resources in developing expertise in the subject.</p><p>I am pleased that members agreed to support moves to establish a framework for what local plans might look like. The provisions do not go as far as I would like, but they will give useful guidance about what is expected to those who are charged with developing marine plans, particularly at the regional level. That will be done in a way that does not compromise the necessary flexibility.</p><p>I thank the Government and the other parties for their support for several of my amendments to remove uncertainties and increased risks for our developing renewables industry. Marine renewables could deliver more than 30GW of power from offshore wind, wave and tidal sources in the next decade, so the contribution that they can make to cutting harmful emissions and meeting our energy needs deserves our full support. The sector can also play a major role in conserving our seas and helping to address issues such as acidification.</p><p>Likewise, I am grateful to those who supported my calls for attention to be paid to the impact of displacement effects as a result of marine spatial planning. That might not be an exact science, but we now have a framework in which such issues can at least be assessed.</p><p>Like others, I think that we have made progress on seal protection, today and at earlier stages, on which I pay tribute to Elaine Murray for her efforts. I acknowledge that some will be disappointed that we did not go further, but I hope that they, like Robin Harper, at least concede that progress has been made. The bill puts in place a licensing regime that makes it clear that taking or shooting a seal is a last resort. The bill will require all non-lethal deterrents to be exhausted and will place strict limits on the conditions in which any seal can be killed. The important reporting requirements will ensure more transparency and&#8212;I hope&#8212;public confidence.</p><p>Through our collective efforts, we have arrived at a bill that meets the aspirations of the many thousands of people who contributed to the various consultations and calls for evidence. The bill demonstrates the benefits of a consistent approach from successive Governments in Scotland and of collaboration between the Governments north and south of the border.<place-holder colnum=\"23602\"/></p><p>I congratulate the cabinet secretary and his team again and confirm that Scottish Liberal Democrats will of course support the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20545844", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This day has been a long time coming.

That seems neither sensible nor desirable, although I accept that it is in no one's interest to allow vexatious or frivolous appeals to clog up the system.

Committee colleagues will also recall my concern about the apparent uncertainty over the potential for the bill's provisions to encroach beyond stacks, crags and so on to include inhabited islands. I should perhaps declare an interest by making plain my opposition to, for example, Burray in Orkney being designated a marine protected area <place-holder colnum=\"23495\"/> under the bill, no matter what historical artefacts my kids might in future disinter at the bottom of our garden.

I believe that the retention by SNH of a register of candidate sites would provide a degree of transparency about the likely extent of future designations and the reasons for those.

Perhaps in his closing speech he can sketch out other timeframes.</p><p>In addition to Paddy Tomkins and his team, I acknowledge the efforts of my Liberal Democrat colleague Alan Reid. As the MP for Argyll and Bute, he has done more than most in recent times to highlight problems and deficiencies in the arrangements for inland water rescue. He was rightly responding to the tragic events on Loch Awe, in his constituency, in March last year, which have been referred to by others, when four men lost their lives attempting to cross the loch late at night.</p><p>No one can tell for certain whether their lives might have been saved had circumstances been different, but it was abundantly clear in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy that there were serious shortcomings in the way that those responsible were able to respond. Although there was undoubtedly close co-operation between the police, fire and rescue and RAF personnel, under the control of Strathclyde Police, the failure on that occasion&#8212;to which my colleague John Farquhar Munro alluded&#8212;to involve Glencoe Mountain Rescue and, in particular, its rescue vessel, attracted valid criticism at the time. Although closer at hand, the mountain rescue team had the misfortune to be based in the Highland region rather than Strathclyde region. It is to be hoped that the Tomkins report, in particular the recommendations on the need for a national register of water rescue capability, will ensure that collaboration is not in any way inhibited by artificial or administrative boundaries. After all, as we would all expect, and as is set out in the Tomkins report, co-ordination of all agencies, as well as the many voluntary and private sector organisations that make such a valuable contribution in this area, is essential.</p><p>I am aware that at the time of the Loch Awe tragedy there was also criticism of the decision to remove the rescue boat that was previously based at Oban fire station, as it could have been at the scene within 20 minutes. Some of those criticisms were levelled by members of the minister's party. We must be careful here. Although every effort needs to be made to ensure that, as James Kelly's amendment suggests, we have the proper infrastructure in place&#8212;including suitable vessels and properly trained and supported personnel, as well as systems and procedures&#8212;we must be realistic.</p><p>Given the extent of our open waters&#8212;I share Bill Aitken's amazement at some of the figures that have been deployed in the debate with reference to the number of lochs, rivers, canals and other open waters&#8212;and the increasing prevalence and intensity of flooding activity, not to mention, as the minister did, the finite resources that we have to <place-holder colnum=\"23053\"/> work with, it is inevitable, as Paddy Tomkins made clear, that we will not always be able to cover for every eventuality as we would like.

The first part of my Eskimo roll was completed almost perfectly, but the second part was less textbook and my attempts to wriggle out from my upturned kayak were impeded by a combination of the McArthur family hips and my mounting sense of panic. Fortunately, help was at hand and no lasting damage was done, although I retain a healthy scepticism&#8212;indeed, a rational fear&#8212;of being upside down in deep water with a kayak on top of me.</p><p>The enduring and growing popularity of Loch Lomond is well documented, as are the problems that that creates in managing the competing and sometimes conflicting interests of those who go there. The popularity places additional demands on rescue services, as the Tomkins report makes clear. There are implications for training, supporting and equipping service personnel and attention must be paid to the need for public awareness-raising. John Farquhar Munro and Angela Constance made useful and considered points on that. I acknowledge that the process is not straightforward and I echo some of Nigel Don's reservations. I can well imagine the response of communities that are located in some of our more picturesque landscapes to suggestions that lochsides and riverbanks be cluttered with public information signage. Government-sponsored statements of the blitheringly obvious that tick a <place-holder colnum=\"23054\"/> box but serve no purpose other than to despoil the countryside are to be resisted at all costs. However, good practice is already in place and it can and should be rolled out as widely as possible.</p><p>Personal responsibility remains critical and is perhaps all the more important in parts of the country that are unlike Loch Lomond and which are considerably more remote. In such areas, the challenges for any rescue effort are greater, as will be the response times.</p><p>I will conclude with a few comments about flood rescue. As Peter Peacock said, the issue arose during the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's consideration of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill last year. It was prompted by concerns that were raised by people in Elgin, who have suffered as much as anyone, and perhaps more than most, as a result of flooding in recent years. As well as voicing criticisms that more was not done to alert people to the risk of flooding, it was felt that no one was responsible for taking a lead role in the effort. It was argued that, once the waters are up to folks' waists, roles and responsibilities appear to be well established but, prior to that, there appears to be something of a vacuum. I accept that it was more appropriate to deal with those issues in the context of the Tomkins review and ministers' response to it, but the committee's endeavours served a useful purpose in focusing attention on the issue.</p><p>During a flooding incident or any water rescue, it is essential that certain procedures are followed in the interests of public safety and the safety of those who undertake the rescue. In that context, I fully accept the good reasons that were highlighted by Bill Aitken and John Farquhar Munro for restricting occasions on which emergency service personnel enter water. Nevertheless, in my constituency, where coastal rather than flood rescue is perhaps more common, those rules can present problems. A requirement to use a boat even in very shallow water can be more than inconvenient if the nearest rescue boat happens to be based in Inverness. Perhaps it was felt that a rescue vessel in Orkney was akin to bringing coals to Newcastle. However, I hope that some scope is left open for the expertise and judgment of trained staff on the ground to be fully deployed.</p><p>The Tomkins report and its recommendations serve a useful and important function. I urge ministers, as do the motion and amendment, to respond positively and swiftly. That is the very least that we owe to our emergency services as well as the volunteers and other professionals who do so much so well to underpin public safety.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20514570", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Affairs and the Environment: \"Independent Review of Open Water and Flood Rescue in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate the minister's point, as will every other member in the chamber.

There is consensus on the seriousness of the challenges that we face with climate change and on the scale of the response that is needed. As Patrick Harvie said, the chamber is blessed in harbouring no so-called flat-earthers, knuckle dragging or otherwise. My colleague Alison McInnes and other members have stated and demonstrated that that consensus does not reflect a lack of willingness to debate and disagree on the actions that we need to take and the timeframe in which they must be taken.</p><p>As all eyes focus on Copenhagen, it is right that members take pride in our achievements to date while they recognise and restate that the hard work is still very much ahead of us. In that context, I hope that ministers accept that the concerns that Sarah Boyack, Alex Johnstone and other members have expressed about slower than expected progress in certain areas since the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill was passed were expressed in the hope that the issues can be addressed. Given the timeframes within which we now operate and the targets that we have set ourselves, particularly in the interim, we simply do not have the luxury of allowing progress to stall. Indeed, it is increasingly apparent that we stand little chance of achieving our longer-term ambitions without early, radical action.</p><p>We should not be under the illusion that significant behavioural changes will not be needed, particularly by those of us who are fortunate to have been brought up in the developed world. There are certainly some quick wins that will require relatively little effort or resources from us, but, even in the case of energy efficiency, the need to scale up what we do is becoming ever more pressing. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee identified that recently. There are significant opportunities for developing and exploiting the technologies that will drive our low-carbon and zero-carbon economies, but it would be wrong to delude ourselves into thinking that technological development will offset <place-holder colnum=\"22158\"/> the need for major behavioural change on our part. I accept that those concerns lay behind Patrick Harvie's decision to lodge his amendment to the motion, but a competition to see who has the hairiest hair shirt serves limited purpose. We made our statement of intent in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Like Patrick Harvie and others, I fully intend to ensure that the Government and those who are responsible for delivering its objectives&#8212;I include myself in that, as Pauline McNeill included herself&#8212;are held to account regularly and robustly.</p><p>Of course, however much we are invited to pat ourselves on the back for adopting our legislation, we need to be realistic about the direct impact that it will have on global emissions levels. As Alison McInnes said, Scotland's achievement of emissions reductions of 42 per cent, 80 per cent or even 100 per cent will register only a blip on the global scale. Equally, it would be wrong to underestimate the influence that we can still have in Copenhagen and beyond. I have little doubt that the provisions of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 will be cast up in the faces of legislators and regulators from around the world as evidence of what could be adopted elsewhere. I am sure that that will be Richard Dixon's mission for the rest of the week when his train finally arrives in Copenhagen, assuming that a free bike is still available to get him to the conference centre.</p><p>I agree entirely with the point that Des McNulty made about delivery. However, it is regrettable and was somewhat petty that UK ministers excluded Scottish ministers from being part of the formal delegation, although I remind Bill Wilson that loving the saltire does not require people to dress up in it every day of the week.</p><p>Of course, Scotland's influence ought to be felt in a more direct and practical sense. With its competitive lead in the development of marine energy technology&#8212;principally wave and tidal technology&#8212;Scotland is ideally placed to play its full part in leading a global renewables revolution and harnessing and exporting technological and supply chain expertise in the years ahead. In that regard, I make my now customary plea to the Government to introduce a dedicated marine research and development scheme to build on the success of the wave and tidal energy support&#8212;WATES&#8212;scheme. That, with an urgent focus on addressing grid requirements, is key to unlocking the potential of that important sector.</p><p>It is worth noting that there are real concerns about the approach that is being taken by ministers with regard to the proposals for new coal-fired generation at Hunterston, as Patrick Harvie said. I accept the potential benefits that CCS can deliver in the future and fully support Scottish Power's bid to pilot a scheme at scale at <place-holder colnum=\"22159\"/> Longannet, but there is a world of difference between retrofitting CCS to reduce existing emissions and sanctioning new-build generation&#8212;with its consequent emissions&#8212;unabated or only partially abated by CCS. I am sure that we will return to that issue in the chamber in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>In the meantime, with the focus squarely on Copenhagen, let me make clear what I believe needs to emerge. As others have said, Copenhagen needs to produce a fair, ambitious and binding agreement. Despite earlier pessimistic predictions, it appears that the outcome is back in the balance. I do not think that portentous declarations that we have two weeks in which to save the planet are accurate or even helpful, but there is no doubt that we are running out of time to strike the type of binding deal that is necessary to avert the catastrophic impacts of climate change.</p><p>The paradox of the developed world creating the lion's share of the problems and the developing world bearing the lion's share of the consequences is shaming, as Stewart Stevenson said. As well as limiting our emissions in the developed world and tying the developing world into tough targets, a properly funded finance package is therefore crucial, as Shirley-Anne Somerville said. That support&#8212;like other steps that we must take as a matter of increasing urgency&#8212;cannot become a victim of the squeeze on public finances.</p><p>We have been treated to a strangely stimulating flavour of consensus this afternoon. Alex Johnstone's attempt to fold Patrick Harvie into a warm, consensual embrace was particularly remarkable.

In this instance, I am happy to congratulate Murdo Fraser for securing the debate, and I heartily applaud the laxative effect that it has had on the Government. It appears that Mr Fraser's motion has finally prompted movement from the minister with regard to details of the upgrade programme that was first announced in September.</p><p>Although I certainly welcome the news that the exchanges in Birsay, Hoy and Papay are to be upgraded, I am a little disappointed that work in Birsay and Hoy is unlikely to be completed for a number of months. That is excessive, particularly with regard to Birsay, so I hope that the minister will think about what more can be done, even at this stage, to bring forward the timeframe.</p><p>As other members have, I welcome the minister's announcement and acknowledge the fact that he has listened and responded to the representations that I, in conjunction with representatives from the communities in Orkney that are directly affected, have been making for a number of months now. Sadly, for the residents of Papay&#8212;as for too many others in Orkney&#8212;the quality of the service that will continue to be available is poor compared with the service in more urban areas.</p><p>In his motion, Murdo Fraser refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a two-tier communication system in Scotland\".</p><p>Like Peter Peacock, I feel that that is further evidence of Mr Fraser's now trademark penchant for understatement. In truth, I believe that we are witnessing an already gaping digital divide that is showing every sign of developing into a yawning chasm. Given the pace of technological change, the challenge for Government and regulators grows ever more difficult. In an ever more competitive and interconnected world, we cannot <place-holder colnum=\"22032\"/> afford to adopt a lowest-common-denominator approach, but concerns are increasing at the scale of the disparity and the way in which rural communities are being left further and further behind.</p><p>With each new development in the technology, communities such as those in Orkney are expected to take their place at the back of the queue and wait patiently. Failure to restore a better sense of balance between the digital haves and the digital have-nots risks storing up serious socioeconomic problems for the future. In that regard, I entirely agree with Cathy Jamieson's remarks that many areas that have limited broadband services also suffer from patchy or completely absent mobile phone reception. More action is needed on mast-sharing or other initiatives to patch up the network.</p><p>Although the improvements that will result from the upgrades that were announced earlier today are welcome, we must recognise that they are likely to impact at the margins; superfast broadband it most definitely is not. More action is needed to tip the scales, so&#8212;as other members were&#8212;I was encouraged to hear Lord Carter recommend universal service provision of up to 2 megabits per second in his \"Digital Britain\" report, but I do not want to steal the thunder from Peter Peacock's upcoming debate. Assuming that Scottish ministers share that aspiration, it would be helpful to know what discussions have taken place, or are due to take place, between United Kingdom counterparts about how such a commitment might be delivered. Aspiration without a clear plan for delivery is simply delusion and will serve only to frustrate those who are left out in the cold.</p><p>A word of warning: suggestions that a levy can be charged on all existing broadband customers to pay for further investment will be met with resistance by many people in rural areas who are already stoically paying above the odds for a service that would be considered wholly unacceptable by their urban counterparts, as other members have already pointed out. Ministers must also accept that their decisions can exacerbate the problem. For example, insisting that rural priorities applications can be made solely online is unhelpful for those who have access to no or poor-quality broadband. In addition, many tourism businesses, such as those which were referred to by Murdo Fraser, are being hindered by the standard of broadband service that they are able to access, and by the centralisation of VisitScotland, which serves to compound their problems.</p><p>The debate has been useful. The issue is so important that it is perhaps unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to make its own proposals and to lodge motion. Given the threat of <place-holder colnum=\"22033\"/> the growing digital divide, there will be ample opportunity to return to the topic again and again in the months ahead.

I also congratulate Citizens Advice Scotland on its very detailed \"Drowning in Debt\" report.</p><p>The debate provides a welcome and timely opportunity to highlight the tremendous work that citizens advice bureaux do in every constituency and region throughout the country. It is also a chance to acknowledge the extent to which the bureaux are a victim both of their own success&#8212;with many more word-of-mouth referrals&#8212;and of the difficult economic circumstances in which we all currently find ourselves.</p><p>Earlier this week, I visited my local citizens advice bureau in Kirkwall. I try to visit regularly, although I am conscious of the need to avoid making a nuisance of myself, given the bureau's large and increasing workload. I consider myself very fortunate in my relationship with the local <place-holder colnum=\"21239\"/> CAB team. In keeping with the rest of the CAB network, the depth and breadth of the expertise on hand in the Kirkwall bureau is highly impressive. The team have certainly helped me in my work, but a more important point is that they have helped many of my constituents who are struggling to deal with a wide range of debt issues for the reasons that David McLetchie mentioned.</p><p>More often than not, those who present to the CAB are, as other members have said, the most vulnerable people in our communities. They include young people, the sick, those with disabilities and, of course, older people. Help the Aged and Age Concern have highlighted the specific problems that face older people, who are&#8212;as Christine Grahame said&#8212;saddled with the highest average debt but stuck on low, fixed incomes with limited means of raising extra money to pay back their debts.</p><p>As this week's report lays bare, debt is increasingly what prompts people to seek help from their CAB. The Citizens Advice Scotland briefing on the workload of the Orkney CAB is extremely disturbing, but I have no doubt that it faithfully reflects the breakdowns that have been provided to members across the country. In the case of Orkney, the average debt level is around &#163;19,500. When one considers that, like many parts of the Highlands and Islands, Orkney suffers less from unemployment than from underemployment and low wages, it is clear that the risks are not just to those who are unfortunate enough to have been laid off.</p><p>Another striking feature of the picture that has been painted&#8212;this seems to apply nationwide&#8212;is the complex nature of people's debt problems, which often involve multiple creditors and the threat of repossession. That puts added pressure on CAB staff, who must then spend much more time trying to disentangle the web of debt that has been built up. With growing numbers of people approaching the CAB for help, that extra time is not easy to free up.</p><p>In the case of the Kirkwall CAB, if not in all bureaux, the problems of space&#8212;in particular, the availability of discreet meeting room facilities&#8212;is also a serious and worsening problem. Orkney Islands Council is to be congratulated on its efforts to work with Voluntary Action Orkney to identify more suitable premises for the CAB and the other third sector bodies that do so much to underpin public service delivery in the islands. However, the truth is that a solution cannot come soon enough, given the pressure on CAB staff and volunteers.</p><p>Although it might seem perverse to argue for more CAB staff given what I have just said about space constraints, I echo the comments that others have made about the valuable contribution that has been made by the credit crunch funding. <place-holder colnum=\"21240\"/></p><p>In the Kirkwall office, that funding has allowed an administrative assistant to be taken on, thereby freeing up the more experienced staff to deal with the increased caseload and more complex cases. Given that there will be a lag as we come out of the recession, I agree with others that that pipeline of support should not be simply shut off next March.</p><p>The complexity of the cases is an inevitable consequence of the way in which many people have sought to manage their debt problems. What is not inevitable and what is absolutely unacceptable, as Jackie Baillie and Jeremy Purvis made clear, is the way in which some creditors choose to pursue those debts. Aggressive and repeated harassment of people who are already under extreme stress is a tactic that is far too often deployed. Some constituents of mine have been encouraged to pay back debt by loading it on to their credit cards. Such harassment simply cannot be allowed to continue, and there appears to be a case for looking again at regulation in that area.</p><p>Similarly, attention needs to be paid to the way in which mortgage-to-rent schemes operate. They offer people scope to manage their way out of serious debt problems and, importantly, keep them in their homes. However, the process can be time consuming and bureaucratic and the information that is gathered is often out of date by the time that it is collated, which forces debt advisers to go back to square one, with the consequence that further debt is incurred. I hope that the minister will agree to consider that matter.</p><p>It would also be helpful if the minister would agree to consider the threshold values for eligible properties under the mortgage-to-rent scheme. I understand that they can be set at unrealistic levels, with the result that entire areas are effectively excluded from the scheme.</p><p>I am grateful to Jackie Baillie for allowing me the chance to put on the parliamentary record my appreciation of the work that Geraldine Ferguson, her staff and the volunteers do on behalf of many of my constituents. That recognition is long overdue.

I understand that, rightly, a firm line is being taken with the Norwegians over mackerel and access rights, but that is likely to colour the Norwegians' attitude to the EU-Norway talks that will start later this month. In the past, that picture and, therefore, the prospects for the December fisheries council would have been clearer by the time that this debate took place. This year we are flying somewhat blind, but I hope nevertheless that the debate will, as in the past, guide ministers as they prepare for those important talks.</p><p>In that spirit, although I share the sentiments in the Government's motion, I feel that it fails to express the severity of the crisis that faces our fleet and lacks a sense of urgency about the immediate priorities. I believe that a bolder statement must be sent from the Parliament, and I hope that other members agree.</p><p>Like other members, I attended the meeting on CFP reform in Edinburgh this week. The array of expertise was impressive, and the growing consensus about the need for a more regional approach to fisheries management was encouraging. Even the Tories, after years of demanding outright withdrawal, appear to have joined the Scottish National Party in recognising practical realities and abandoning their <place-holder colnum=\"20976\"/> unilateralism. However, despite that consensus, there is still no clear or agreed view on how regionalisation might work in practice. As the cabinet secretary acknowledged, more work is required, although much of the detail will be finalised only after the 31 December deadline that the Commission rather unhelpfully set for responses. I make a plea, even at this stage, that, where regional models and plans can be developed and agreed within an overarching framework and objectives, they are progressed. All together or not at all is not a maxim that we should subscribe to.</p><p>Let us be clear that any reform will not be finalised until 2011 at the earliest and more likely 2012. Even then, as National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations chief Barrie Deas suggested this week, big-bang changes on 1 January 2013 are not necessarily in the interests of fishermen or fisheries management&#8212;change will take time.</p><p>Of course, as the minister acknowledged, an exception must be made for discards, because the economic and environmental madness of discards has to be tackled well before 2013.</p><p>Although discussing CFP reform proposals is more comfortable territory for ministers to be on, the upcoming negotiations will be based on current rules&#8212;however much we might wish it were otherwise. Coastal state negotiations have started, EU-Norway talks begin in less than two weeks, and the December fisheries council begins in little more than five weeks. We therefore need to know what ministers are doing to prepare and what approach they will adopt.</p><p>We also need to know that, as well as working closely with the Scottish industry and scientists to marshal the case, the cabinet secretary recognises the peril of opening up needless divisions with UK ministers. That would be catastrophic and would allow the Commission and other member states to run rings round a feuding UK delegation. I hope that he bears that in mind and avoids getting caught up in the Brigadoon-fest that Mike Russell has planned for St Andrew's day.</p><p>The message from Scotland's fishermen is clear. As the <em>Fishing News </em>proclaimed last week,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"2010 is a 'Make or Break Year'\".</p><p>This year's talks will be tough. In part that is thanks to the deal that the cabinet secretary signed up to last December. I quote Bertie Armstrong:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the unmistakable message from the men at sea&#8212;that the regulations controlling days at sea, worked up over 2008 and agreed finally by the Council of Ministers last December are unworkable\"<place-holder colnum=\"20977\"/></p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"can be defended no longer\".</p><p>The anger felt by Scottish fishermen over that deal has been made worse by what they saw as ministers attempting initially to claim that it was a success and then taking months to admit its inadequacies. However, the real concern now is that the Scottish ministers have thrown in the towel before these talks even begin. That sense is reinforced by Mr Lochhead's insistence that further cuts in effort and certain TACs are \"inevitable\".</p><p>Instead of being properly rewarded for the innovative steps that it has taken, it seems that our fleet is being told to accept meekly more pain. That will not do. The minister must now get together with the industry and scientists to marshal the strongest possible case. He must develop proposals for a catch-based management plan to counter the Commission's approach and he must demonstrate an appetite for the fight.</p><p>It is worrying that it now appears that the proposals for putting CCTV cameras on boats in return for more quota were being trumpeted prior to proper consultation with the Scottish industry. Although any pilot scheme can doubtless be finessed to work, the question is: at what cost? Once CCTV is hard-wired into a system that is patently failing, it will be used both to legitimise unworkable rules and to punish further those who cannot make the system work.</p><p>I do not expect the cabinet secretary to discuss in detail his negotiating position, but I offer some thoughts on what it might involve. I welcome his commitment to look for an increase in monkfish and megrim quotas based on the scientific evidence, but greater flexibility is also required in the monkfish regime. As he suggested, the picture on other stocks is, as ever, more mixed. Clearly, the hope is that the best deal possible can be struck.</p><p>In relation to effort, it is vital that no more ill-fitting restrictions are layered on top of what is already in place for cod and on the west coast. With regard to the latter, the cabinet secretary is aware of my concerns about what happened last year and how it came about. I urge him to look at alternatives, possibly involving removing haddock and subjecting it to its own management plan. I know that proposals are being worked up by the industry, and I hope that they will be given a fair wind.</p><p>As ever, the cabinet secretary is assured of the Parliament's support as he embarks on these extremely tough negotiations, but this is a make-or-break year for our fleet. Many skippers are on the brink, having leased effort and quota to cope with last year's deal. Further cuts in either or&#8212;worse still&#8212;both could signal the end for some. <place-holder colnum=\"20978\"/></p><p>That is why I believe that the Parliament needs to send out the strongest possible message of support for our industry.</p><p>I echo the call in the Labour amendment for Government to stand ready to assist, depending on the outcome of the negotiations, but I recommend and have pleasure in moving my amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5119.3, to leave out from first \"notes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises the need for a complete overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy and action to address the environmental and economic folly of discards; believes, however, that the Government's immediate priority must be to tackle the current crippling situation facing Scotland's fishing fleet and the prospect of further cuts in effort and quotas, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to work urgently and constructively with the fishing industry and the UK Government on priorities for the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations to secure the best possible outcome for the Scottish fleet and the longer term sustainability of fish stocks.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There was a time when Santa could set his watch by the timing of the annual debate on fisheries.

Like Sarah Boyack, I am in no way disheartened by the suspicion that we are here because our respective business managers have deemed us and the issue that is under debate to be of little electoral interest to the good people of Glasgow North East.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats support the Government's motion and the establishment of the strategy group to guide future national park policy. We also support Sarah Boyack's amendment's addendum: as the minister has made clear, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national parks have, since their establishment proved their worth. That provides a sound basis on which to move forward and, at the very least, to consider the scope for new national parks, which would rightly be a task for the strategy group. As <place-holder colnum=\"20786\"/> far as marine and coastal areas are concerned, it makes sense to await the outcome of our deliberations on the Marine (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I find it slightly more difficult to support the Tory amendment. Although it properly identifies the potential efficiency savings that are to be gained from reducing the size of the boards, there is&#8212;as I will explain&#8212;always a balance to be struck.</p><p>I believe that my amendment articulates that trade-off by pointing up the importance of ensuring that local people have a strong voice in managing their own environment. I entirely recognise ministers' efforts to safeguard that voice in progressing the strategic review's recommendations, and I welcome the decision to maintain the number of directly elected members on both boards in the face of a proposed reduction in overall numbers, although I note that that is already required under statute. That said, I hope that the minister will go further and agree that directly elected members, council nominees and ministerial appointees should have equal representation on boards. Such an aim could be achieved while keeping overall board numbers well within the set limits, and would deliver further benefits in local accountability and engagement. As Sarah Boyack has pointed out, council-nominated board members provide a valuable democratic link to the people who live and work in the national parks, but the process of directly electing members to the boards could and should engage the public more fully and require candidates and voters to reflect on what the parks should achieve and how they should be managed.</p><p>I accept that a balance needs to be struck and that the strategy group is best placed to weigh up the pros and cons and to make informed recommendations. As a result, with Boyackesque pragmatism, I have, in my amendment, committed the minister only to inviting her strategy group to consider the options. I hope that she will accept it in the spirit in which it is intended. I argue that my amendment would help to reinforce other steps that the minister has taken&#8212;and has outlined again today&#8212;to safeguard the parks' local dimension. For example, I find it encouraging that the Government has agreed to retain the park authorities as free-standing non-departmental public bodies. There was much debate about that when the previous Administration set up the parks: I think that the model is certainly the best way of developing strong links with local communities. It is imperative that we maintain and enhance that local connection.</p><p>The parks showcase our country's remarkable diversity in natural and cultural heritage. As the Scottish Wildlife Trust points out in its briefing, the parks can act as biodiversity hubs, supporting habitat networks and functional and healthy <place-holder colnum=\"20787\"/> ecosystems, which is very much in keeping with the spirit and letter of the legislation that established the parks.</p><p>However, we should not forget that the intention was never to set in aspic the parks and the communities that are within their boundaries. The parks can and must continue to deliver tremendous environmental benefits, but it is important also to emphasise the social and economic opportunities that they present. That point was reflected in the minister's remarks and it is, quite deliberately, a stated priority of both park authorities and one on which they have successfully delivered during their short lives to date. However, I am sure that both authorities accept that more will need to be done if the parks are to continue to meet the needs of their local communities which, unsurprisingly, mirror the needs of communities throughout the country.</p><p>Housing, transport, jobs and education are among the day-to-day concerns of those who live in our national parks. To preserve and protect the uniqueness of our parks, care might need to be taken in the way in which those and other needs are met, but I do not see an inherent conflict in that. We would fail those communities and would not meet the objective of the parks if we did not ensure that the legitimate expectations of those who live and work there are met.</p><p>I have sought to be as consensual as possible on an issue on which there is welcome cross-party agreement, if not unanimity, but I will strike one discordant note before I conclude. Notwithstanding all that I have said, for many people in the Cairngorms park, debates about board structures might be a little dry and even esoteric, but that is not the case in respect of the plans to upgrade the Beauly to Denny transmission line. The project has aroused strong views and emotions for and against, as well as all points in between. I believe that the upgrade is essential if we are to realise Scotland's renewables potential, and that it will help to unlock significant developments in the north of Scotland. If our true potential as a global powerhouse in renewables is to be met, urgent attention must be given to the need for subsea cables and interconnectors, but the Beauly to Denny upgrade is the most pressing issue and a formal decision on the proposal is now long overdue.</p><p>I realise that, whatever the position of the political parties, we all have colleagues who have expressed genuine concerns in representing their constituents' interests. However, that makes it all the more important that a formal decision be made as soon as possible. Ministers have had the reporter's recommendations for about 10 months, and it seems clear from reports that have been leaked to the media that a decision has been <place-holder colnum=\"20788\"/> made. If that was an attempt to soften up opponents prior to a formal announcement, it has not worked. In the interests of good and transparent government, I urge the minister to impress on her colleagues the need for the decision to be made public. Given the project's national strategic importance, I argue that the decision merits a statement to Parliament.</p><p>Our national parks are a phenomenal asset to the country. Having given the concept of a national park to the world through the pioneering efforts of John Muir, we were perhaps a little tardy in practising what our ancestors had happily been preaching for a century or more. Nevertheless, we have made a good start, which should give confidence for the future and create the potential for extending the network of parks. However, as before, we must ensure that we take with us the people and communities who are most directly and immediately affected.</p><p>With pleasure, I move amendment S3M-5110.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; celebrates the success of the boards of the National Parks in giving a voice to local people in managing their own environment, and calls for early consideration to be given to increasing the directly elected presence on boards.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20287305", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate on what has been a genuine post-devolution success for Scotland.

Scottish Liberal Democrats have been long-standing supporters of such legislation, not just here but at Westminster. I am proud of the role that my party has played both north and south of the border, especially with the efforts of my colleague Ross Finnie, who did so much to help establish the platform and principles underpinning the bill. There is much work to do in the coming weeks to ensure that we have a piece of legislation of which we can be proud. Like other members, I believe that we have made a very good start.</p><p>We have been well served by all those who have provided evidence to date. It has been detailed, insightful and, in the main, remarkably consensual. I look forward to working with many of those same individuals and organisations as we begin our stage 2 scrutiny. I, too, thank the committee clerks and SPICe for all their hard work to date.</p><p>As Orkney's MSP, my interest in the bill is more than academic. Economically, socially, culturally and environmentally&#8212;in every way imaginable&#8212;Orkney's past, present and future are forged in the <place-holder colnum=\"20641\"/> seas all around our archipelago. However, this is not a virility test as to which community can lay greatest claim to having a reliance on the marine environment. As the cabinet secretary reflected, Scotland and the UK as a whole depend hugely on our marine resources, so ensuring that they are properly understood and protected, and indeed exploited, is critically important to all of us.</p><p>Like the committee convener, although I support the general principles of the bill I wish to make a number of points looking ahead to the task in front of us at stage 2 and beyond. For the proposed legislation to be effective, it needs to be properly resourced. That recommendation from the committee might appear self-evident, but it enjoys strong support across the board from witnesses who are concerned that ministers might be willing the ends without necessarily willing the means.</p><p>I also encourage the cabinet secretary to rethink his present unwillingness to accept duties rather than powers in the bill. It is hard to imagine Mr Lochhead piloting the bill through Parliament only then to stubbornly refuse to put in place a national marine plan, yet that point simply lends weight to the case for the Government to accept such a plan as a duty on ministers rather than as something that they are empowered to produce.</p><p>Similarly, the committee unanimously supported calls for the bill to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"place a duty on the Scottish Ministers and all relevant public bodies ... to have regard to the need to maintain and improve the health of the Scottish marine area.\"</p><p>That would be backed by indicators that make it clear what constitutes a healthy marine environment. I accept that that might not be straightforward, but I am sure that the committee will be happy to work with the minister and his officials to find a workable solution.</p><p>The committee supports a flexible approach to the membership and governance of marine planning partnerships. That is surely the only way of reflecting the diversity of our marine environment, and that of the communities and interests that are reliant upon it. It is not inconsistent to argue, however, that Marine Scotland has an important role in guiding and supporting those partnerships, particularly in the early stages. Likewise, we should consider whether it is helpful to establish a framework to consider what local plans might look like. That need be no more than a requirement for each plan to set objectives and indicate the policies and programmes to achieve them, but it could avoid partnerships wasting time in putting together plans that are subsequently rejected.</p><p>As for the national plan, I am pleased that the Government accepts the need for climate change mitigation and adaptation to be included in the list <place-holder colnum=\"20642\"/> of objectives in section 3(3). With there being the potential to deliver more than 30GW of power from offshore wind, wave and tidal sources over the next decade, the contribution that marine renewables can make to cutting harmful emissions as well as meeting our energy needs is a matter of record, and they can also play a major role in conserving our seas and helping to address issues such as acidification.</p><p>Marine region designations should be based on an ecosystem approach. Nevertheless, as the committee suggests, the case</p><p class=\"indent\">\"for the major firths and for the seas surrounding Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles to be considered discrete marine regions\"</p><p>is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"reasonably clear-cut\".</p><p>I encourage the cabinet secretary to be a little less coy in supporting that proposition.</p><p>I spoke earlier about the consensus that exists with regard to many aspects of the bill. Sadly, however, I must, like others, report an act of rebellion within the committee on one particular issue. Steps were taken by the previous Administration to give local councils responsibility for licensing fish farms. The system is bedding in well, and it commands strong support among the councils and communities that are most directly affected. I do not accept that it creates undue burdens or confusion for the aquaculture sector, and I cannot agree that administrative neatness should override the right of local councils to take important decisions in that regard if they wish. Indeed, any decisions will require to adhere to the overall national plan. The cabinet secretary should rest assured that I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues stand shoulder to shoulder with him in resisting the call from his own colleagues and others for those powers to be centralised.</p><p>Turning to the issue of nature conservation MPAs, although I accept that designation needs to be based on robust science, I believe that it is critical that, when marine conservation orders are drawn up, specific regard is given to social and economic factors as well as to climate change mitigation. The fear is that MPA designation will result in areas being off-limits to economic activity and development, and ministers can best deal with that myth by being more explicit on the matter in the bill.</p><p>On the sensitive issue of seal protection, I congratulate Advocates for Animals on the way in which they have made their case to the committee so far. I agree with members that improvements have been made, but I am concerned by claims that without close seasons during breeding times seal populations might be under more threat than <place-holder colnum=\"20643\"/> they currently are. We might return to the issue at stage 2.</p><p>The bill is a good one and our collective efforts have contributed to it. It demonstrates the benefits of a consistent approach on the part of successive Governments in Scotland and collaboration between Governments north and south of the border.

Like previous speakers, I believe that few issues currently facing rural Scotland are more significant than the lack of sufficient, affordable housing to rent and buy. As Alex Neil and Peter Peacock said, rural housing has a bearing on everything, from the basic quality of life through to economic development and sustaining our communities&#8212;many of which are very fragile indeed. I accept that the housing issues are not unique to rural areas, but many of the problems faced and the solutions required vary markedly between rural and urban areas.</p><p>For that reason, I welcome the fact that the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee decided&#8212;a decision made before I joined the committee&#8212;to undertake an inquiry into rural housing and, more important, persevered with the inquiry over many months. As the convener <place-holder colnum=\"20310\"/> acknowledged, it is fair to say that the birth of the committee's report was not easy&#8212;we even experienced a change of midwife mid-term&#8212;so I commend Maureen Watt, who took over convenership from Roseanna Cunningham, on successfully delivering our report. I am also grateful not only to Nanette Milne for her generous praise but to my fellow committee members, the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and other staff for their advice, support and good-natured stoicism throughout. Most of all, I pay tribute to the many individuals and organisations that provided us with evidence.</p><p>In the midst of difficult and&#8212;as others have suggested&#8212;unpredictable economic times, we were all challenged to reassess any preconceived notions that we had not only about the scale and nature of the problems that face the rural housing sector but about the remedies that are required. That challenge was by and large met, but I confess that I was a little disappointed by some of the tone and content of the Government's response. Notwithstanding the minister's recognition of the high quality of our report, the Government response could be loosely summarised as, \"You're wrong, we're doing it already and thanks for the commendation.\" At best, that is bad politics, but it is dangerously complacent in the face of the detailed and wide-ranging evidence that was taken by the committee.</p><p>As Peter Peacock said, it is particularly disappointing&#8212;and perhaps surprising&#8212;that the Government has not been more receptive to the committee's recommendation on enhanced pressured area status, which would provide councils with a broader toolbox of measures. The Minister for Environment was particularly attracted to the idea in her previous incarnation as a free-spirited convener of the committee. It was even suggested at the time that the committee might be pushing at an open door. Perhaps the Minister for Housing and Communities could check whether something is perhaps stuck behind that door&#8212;his size 8 boot, for instance.</p><p>Likewise, the committee's unanimous call for the Government to address</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a Scotland-wide shortage of suitably qualified professionals in planning departments\"</p><p>and to help to effect a culture change in planning departments met with a remarkably lukewarm ministerial response.</p><p>I was particularly frustrated by the Government's response to recommendation 16 in the report, on the housing association grant, which urged ministers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to investigate the widespread concern that the assumptions behind proposed changes to Housing <place-holder colnum=\"20311\"/> Association Grant take insufficient note of the extra burden imposed on rural social rented housing providers\".</p><p>The committee made specific note of problems to do with assumed rental income. Although ministers make the right noises about the limited economies of scale that are open to small rural housing associations and emphasise their willingness to continue to listen, those are not new problems, and they persist even though they have been put to MSPs and to ministers and officials for months. In many places, private finance levels are now critical. The only conclusion to be drawn is that ministers and their officials are so convinced that registered social landlords are inherently inefficient or wasteful with money that they do not believe a lot of what they are being told. That is hugely unfortunate.</p><p>In my constituency, for example, assumed rent levels are 8 per cent higher than Orkney Housing Association can achieve. In some of the smaller islands in the north and the south, the figure rises to 17 per cent. If rents soar to meet such shortfalls, I cannot see how properties can remain affordable, particularly in the current economic climate.</p><p>Ministers state that HAG assumptions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"reflected the private borrowing capacity in the Registered Social Landlord (RSL) sector\".</p><p>From my conversations locally, it is not at all clear how that conclusion has been reached. For example, banks now require 120 per cent security cover, but it is a fact that the value of rented housing is not sufficient to provide that level of cover. As a consequence, RSLs are having to put up unencumbered stock. Such an approach cannot be sustained for any length of time.</p><p>The Government's reference to identifying local solutions to particular difficulties met with blank stares in Orkney, although I am sure that the minister will address that when he winds up the debate.</p><p>Government assumptions are also creating serious difficulties in relation to the private sector housing grant. Orkney's allocation for care and repair, fuel poverty, regeneration and grants for disability access and improvement will fall by 20 per cent between now and 2013-14. As one of the new criteria for allocating funding is the number of flats to be found in an area, it is not hard to see why Orkney may have come up a little short, but it is less clear why allocations could not have been made on the basis of housing stock condition, for example.</p><p>However, I give credit where it is due. I welcome ministers' decision to drop their plans for lead developers, which the committee argued would be inappropriate in the rural context. Likewise, I am pleased that ministers have heeded the calls from <place-holder colnum=\"20312\"/> many of us who represent remoter constituencies that greater efficiencies could be achieved by agreeing funding plans of three years or possibly more.</p><p>I hope that that more constructive approach will be carried forward to address the concerns that our report highlights about housing allocation policies and homelessness legislation, which, as Maureen Watt rightly observed, are thorny and sensitive issues. The objectives of the homelessness legislation command solid, cross-party support, as they did when they were introduced. As Shelter makes clear, the real threat to the 2012 target comes from the failure to build more homes for rent that people can afford.</p><p>The loss of a local connection requirement has raised concerns, not least in my own constituency. Recent statistics from the population and migration study illustrate the potential threat, given that there is already a very limited pool of housing. It has been suggested to me that how the Government decides to proceed with local connection and homelessness obligations could determine whether new housing development in Orkney supports or hinders the economic and social development of a community.</p><p>I am pleased that we have had an opportunity to debate the issue of rural housing, and I hope that the Government will take heed of the concerns that have been raised and the spirit in which that has been done. There is a consistent view across the board that more action is needed, particularly with regard to the provision of more affordable housing for rent. It is acknowledged that, as well as councils and RSLs, the private sector has a critical role to play in that. Ministers must now respond and, in cases in which money is made available, current assumptions must be revised to allow it to be used effectively in all parts of the country. If that happens, the time that the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee spent in producing its report will not have been spent in vain.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20206413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome today's debate.

That is very generous. I extend my apologies to you, Presiding Officer, to the minister and to Parliament for being absent from the beginning of the debate. I had to attend a meeting on urgent constituency business.</p><p>I congratulate the committee on its report. As other members have done, and although I am not a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I recognise not only its excellent work but its commitment to gathering evidence as widely as possible from those who are interested and involved in delivering our energy future. I know that the committee's visit to my constituency was very well received. It is acknowledged that the words \"I'm from the Government and I'm here to help\" can chill the blood of even the boldest of business leaders, but it appears that the words \"I'm from the Parliament and I'm here to listen\" can at times act like a healing balm.</p><p>Parliament's willingness to listen goes some way towards explaining the broad welcome that the report's recommendations have received. As Iain Smith suggested, the focus on delivery rather than on prognosis is refreshing, and it was absolutely right to highlight efficiency maximisation, environmental sustainability, social justice and wealth and employment.</p><p>It is also gratifying to note the committee's calls for a ban on new nuclear power in Scotland, the urgent publication of the Government's energy efficiency action plan, a dedicated research and development fund for wave and tidal energy research, scaled-up action on fuel poverty, and the decentralisation of the supply network. Those are all long-standing items on the Liberal Democrat agenda on energy. However, I heed the warning in SSE's briefing for this debate that delivery of energy objectives cannot be treated as a political football. Robust debate is certainly needed, but I know from talking to, for example, marine energy developers that agreement across the parties on the importance of the sector, and on renewables as a whole, is a valued asset. In effect, such agreement de-risks a process that already has its fair share of attached risks. In that regard, I welcome the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth's consistent acknowledgment of his predecessors' work on delivering the objective of creating a renewables powerhouse in Scotland. I will return to that shortly.</p><p>As Peter Peacock, Patrick Harvie and others did, I applaud the committee's decision to put energy efficiency at the centre of its vision for Scotland's energy future. The benefits of not only reducing harmful emissions but of cutting costs and tackling fuel poverty make that a win-win-win approach. As Iain Smith said, there is now broad <place-holder colnum=\"20107\"/> agreement that reducing our energy demand is crucial to delivery of our energy objectives, and that reducing our energy demand can no longer be seen as the Cinderella of the energy debate.</p><p>In responding to the committee, ministers have claimed that those points will be addressed in an energy efficiency action plan. That is a sensible approach, but it begs the question why ministers still have to publish their plan at this stage, despite Mr Mather's claim back in March 2007 that it would be an early priority. Now that we have a reassurance in the Government's response to the committee, I hope that we can comfort ourselves as we brace ourselves for the early autumn with knowing that the plan will be with us very soon.</p><p>I hope that in the plan, as well as setting out how the public sector will take a more ambitious lead and how the significant emissions contribution of non-domestic buildings can be reined in, ministers will address failures in the home insulation programme. The committee called for a scaling up of that effort. The home insulation scheme has been described as having been set up to fail. The budget was slashed in half during a very public falling out between Mr Swinney and Mr Patrick Harvie, and it seems that match funding for the scheme has failed to materialise. That is a concern, but Wendy Alexander has made it clear that the task ahead is of an altogether greater magnitude.</p><p>The committee was right to place heavy emphasis on Scotland's renewables potential. Scotland is well placed in respect of its natural resources and expertise, but serious challenges remain. I have made it clear for a long time that we need to build on the success of the wave and tidal energy scheme, which my colleague Nicol Stephen introduced. The lack of access to a dedicated marine research and development scheme is acknowledged by the committee and the Government's advisers as being a serious inhibitor to development of the sector. In the past, ministers have claimed that WATES money is still available, but under cross-examination, they have been unable to quantify that money or explain how it can be accessed. The Government cannot ignore any longer the marine energy group's call for a flexible, use-it-or-lose-it fund. I hope that an early decision on that will be taken.</p><p>The grid remains a major concern for everyone who is involved in the sector. I echo the calls of Iain Smith, Wendy Alexander and others for an early positive decision on the Beauly to Denny line. I whole-heartedly endorse the committee's call for subsea cables to the islands. It has also called for extended bootstraps down the east and west coasts and the development of a North Sea supergrid. I acknowledge the Government's commitment to those objectives, but caution that <place-holder colnum=\"20108\"/> we cannot wait until the electricity is ready to flow before we put those things in place. I am also happy to echo the calls of the committee, ministers, Scottish Power, SSE, local authorities such as Orkney Islands Council and many others relating to the iniquitous charging regime for transmission. That regime must be reformed if we are truly to unlock our renewables potential.</p><p>The report's focus on supply chain issues is also welcome, although ministers have rather belatedly turned their attention to that matter. There must be substantive work on that&#8212;there cannot be merely a desk-based exercise. In that context, I was concerned that, far from being invited to comment, some of the experts in my constituency were not even made aware of the exercise.</p><p>Iain Smith highlighted the need for a more decentralised model of generation that can empower individuals, businesses and communities to a far greater extent than is the case at present. Smart meters and smart grids have roles to play, as do feed-in tariffs. I was pleased to see that the UK Energy Act 2008 has given the green light to those.</p><p>However, more attention must be paid to how we capture the benefit of renewables developments, both onshore and offshore, for communities. I assure Peter Peacock that even we Orcadians acknowledge the wily negotiating skills of our colleagues up in Shetland. Planning needs to be made as efficient as possible, but where individuals and communities take decisions in their interests and for their long-term benefit, planning issues can be resolved more readily.</p><p>As Iain Smith suggested, a decentralised model would open up significant opportunities in relation to renewable heat. I welcome the Government's commitment to heat mapping, but the climate change delivery plan must take urgent steps to ensure that greater incentives are provided to develop community CHP schemes across the country. From the evidence that was taken by the committee, it is clear that we have much to learn from others&#8212;notably, the Danes. It is regrettable that earlier this year the Government chose to back Green Party calls to rule out for the future energy-from-waste plants.</p><p>It is unrealistic to expect a transition away from fossil fuels in the short term. Abatement and decarbonisation of existing energy sources will be necessary. CCS presents real opportunities, but it is not a \"Get out of jail free\" card; it must be applied robustly and demonstrated at scale. The points that Ross Finnie made in relation to Longannet and Hunterston were valid. In passing, I congratulate my colleague Chris Davies MEP on his efforts in securing funding at European Union level for demonstration roll-out.<place-holder colnum=\"20109\"/></p><p>This has been a good and constructive debate.

However, the publication of the report does not justify the shock tactics that the committee's deputy convener deployed earlier this week on \"Good Morning Scotland\", when he drew attention to the committee's recommendations by threatening to take to the Bournemouth beachfront in Lycra shorts and a string vest.</p><p>The report highlights some fairly fundamental shortcomings in the way that children in Scotland are encouraged to develop the habit of taking physical exercise. Against the backdrop of an alarming rise in obesity, not least among our children and young people, it is clear that those failures come at a social and economic cost that we can ill afford to ignore.</p><p>Although it is not the sole answer, the committee is right to draw attention to the Government's lack of progress towards providing every schoolchild with two hours of quality PE every week. That is considered to be the absolute minimum to ensure that a child grows up with the basic skills of athleticism, balance and co-ordination. Like others, I am not a fan of the expression \"physical literacy\", but it captures the fundamental skills that every child should have the chance to develop as far as possible. Possession of those skills brings with it the added benefits of self-confidence and improved physical and mental health. That makes ministers' willingness to finesse their commitment to achieving two hours of high-quality PE all the more regrettable, as is the low priority that HMIE affords the issue, which drew criticism from the committee and did so much to disturb Christine Grahame.</p><p>Although schools are vital in creating the pathways into sport that are so critical, the responsibility goes much wider. The committee recognises that and urges councils to develop local sports strategies that incorporate measures to maintain and upgrade local authority facilities and to improve access. However, as Jamie McGrigor noted, if such strategies are to be successful, it is necessary for capacity to be built in local sports clubs across the country.</p><p>It is perhaps a little late in my remarks to confess that I did not follow the Health and Sport Committee's evidence taking as assiduously as I might have done, but I did attend an excellent <place-holder colnum=\"19628\"/> briefing session with the Scottish Rugby Union, which it is clear from the final report had an influence on the committee members who were present. The event sticks in my memory partly because of a photo that I have of me sandwiched between Scottish internationalist Ally Hogg and Margo MacDonald&#8212;that is the back row for the Holyrood fantasy first XV right there.</p><p>I was also struck by a discussion that the three of us had that evening about the importance of sport in schools and of the network of sports clubs around Scotland. I expressed real excitement about the appointment of Orkney's first rugby development officer, who took up his post earlier this month. As Richard Simpson made clear, the sport has enjoyed an explosion of interest and participation, and nowhere has that been more evident than in Orkney, where it has been witnessed across age groups and abilities over the past few decades. Bruce Ruthven's appointment will help to take the game in Orkney to the next level, by helping local primary and secondary schools to deliver high-quality rugby programmes, improving the recruitment and training of volunteers, increasing the number of evening sessions, to which Aileen Campbell referred, and creating opportunities for competition across the age and ability range.</p><p>I am encouraged that that is a nationwide phenomenon. More than 65 development officers are now in place, each of whom encourages close collaboration among the SRU, local rugby clubs and local councils. Orkney Rugby Football Club's Kevin Sutherland and Rodney Spence deserve special mention for co-ordinating fundraising efforts and putting in place a comprehensive strategy for making best use of the development officer role. The initiative will pay real dividends for the rugby club in bringing on current and future generations of players.</p><p>I believe that the benefits will also be felt more widely and that the approach that has been adopted will help to increase participation rates in sport generally throughout the islands. Time will tell, of course, but I think that that example demonstrates that a joined-up approach among councils, schools, sports clubs and national sporting bodies can address some of the fundamental issues that are highlighted in the committee's report.</p><p>There are similar examples in other sports, but I have been impressed by what the rugby authorities and the wider rugby community are trying to do.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As with Jamie Stone, it is as a dispassionate observer that I congratulate the Health and Sport Committee on its report, \"Pathways into sport and physical activity\".

My rugby career was cut short many years ago by a cruel, debilitating and ultimately terminal lack of talent, but the same does not apply to my younger brother, Dugald, who played on into his late 20s. His career was ended by a horrendous accident 13 years ago, which left him quadriplegic. Not a day goes by in which I do not wish that he had never taken up the sport, but it would be a greater tragedy if that attitude became pervasive. Indeed, I already have doubts about whether our relationship with risk is entirely healthy.</p><p>Rugby is a sport from which many thousands of people, including Dugald, derive enormous pleasure, whether through playing or watching it or reliving their glory days&#8212;real or illusory. It offers everything from regular physical exertion to lifelong camaraderie. That is not to say that changes cannot and should not be made in it, as in other sports. As the former internationalist and current BBC presenter John Beattie recently observed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have to have a game that combines physicality with a sense that it is trying to be as safe as possible, particularly in the teenage years.\"</p><p>That is why I was delighted that the SRU published its are you ready to play rugby? initiative back in May. The proposed changes, which build on input from players, coaches, academics and medical practitioners, are progressive and can help to improve safety while safeguarding enjoyment. In New Zealand, where a similar scheme has been in operation for some years now, the reduction in spinal injuries has been encouraging. The initiative can make a difference in Scotland through reducing the potential for mismatches at age-group level and introducing better training and preparation of players, coaches and referees and required standards of pitch-side care.</p><p>The initiative cannot, of course, entirely remove the risk of serious injury. Such injuries are&#8212;thankfully&#8212;rare, but they occur and will continue to occur not just in rugby but in a range of sports. However, I would argue that a greater risk arises from our not taking seriously enough the need to increase participation in sport and develop in our young people a habit of taking physical exercise.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I cannot, I am afraid.

With that in mind, I will keep my speech brief, although I will make a number of points on this important issue.</p><p>First, I add my congratulations to Jamie McGrigor on securing the debate and on his motion, which highlights well the stark reality for some of our songbird populations, which have experienced a dramatic decline in recent years. It rightly commends birdwatchers and bird groups&#8212;not only in the Highlands and Islands, as Jim Hume said, but throughout the country&#8212;for the work that they do in recording the state of various <place-holder colnum=\"19431\"/> bird species, not only our songbirds. As an aside, I observe that some of our most melodic birds are not, in fact, so-called songbirds.</p><p>Like other members&#8212;perhaps with the exception of Elaine Murray&#8212;I have been greatly impressed by the success of initiatives such as the RSPB's big garden bird watch, not least because it captures the imagination of the wider public and engages people of all ages in the necessary task of pulling together the most accurate picture possible of how our birds are faring. Of course, despite that public engagement, much of the responsibility for undertaking the fieldwork still falls to genuine birdlifers. Nowhere is that more evident than in my constituency, which is blessed with some of the most impressive and significant bird colonies in the world. I pay particular tribute to my friend Jim Williams, who regularly defies wind, rain and advancing years as he stomps across the Hoy hills gathering valuable data on red-throated divers and hen harriers, and numbers for other species. I find his efforts genuinely humbling.</p><p>I have no difficulty in lending my support to Jamie McGrigor's motion, but caution needs to be exercised when we draw conclusions from the songbird figures that he and others rightly highlight. Like Jamie McGrigor, I congratulate Songbird Survival on the work it does to draw attention to the plight of Scotland's songbirds and the research into the decline of certain species that it helps to fund, but I am concerned about its determination to lobby for changes to the law on predator control. I believe that that sends entirely the wrong signal and that at a point when Scotland is finally and slowly coming to terms with the need to treat wildlife crime seriously it is more than unfortunate. I do not think that it is overstating the case to suggest that such a signal could well be used by those whose motives are far from innocent to legitimise activities that have rightly been condemned by Jamie McGrigor, Jim Hume and every other member who has spoken in the debate, and which the Government and the previous Executive have taken steps to address.</p><p>More research is needed into the causes of songbird decline, especially the decline of woodland species and long-distance migrants, although it is clear already that seed-eating species have been hit hardest. In the main, that is because so few crops now contain enough weeds to keep such species going through the winter. In Orkney, the yellowhammer was the first species to become locally extinct&#8212;that happened back in the 1970s&#8212;and it was followed by the corn bunting, which Nanette Milne spoke about. It hung on in a couple of the north isles until about six or seven years ago but finally became locally extinct as a breeding species. More encouraging, though, is the fact that the fortunes of reed bunting and twite have been turned round through the provision of <place-holder colnum=\"19432\"/> bird crops. The RSPB has paid for some of those, but they are increasingly financed through a variety of agri-environment schemes.</p><p>Further research is needed, but maintaining habitats through suitable management schemes and working closely with farmers and land managers is key to addressing the problem. It will not be easy, but it pales in comparison with the task that faces Scotland's football team in the next few hours.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190567", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Songbird Survival"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You are just keeping me on my toes, Presiding Officer.

Stewart Stevenson triumphantly flourished the rabbit that he had just produced from his top hat, but the suspicion remained that all was not what it seemed. So it transpired: although the new interim date was ambitious, the emissions reduction target of 34 per cent was not.</p><p>Since that debate, there has been ample opportunity to put some backbone into the bill. For example, the Liberal Democrats have made strenuous efforts to get Parliament to commit to a scientifically credible interim target of 42 per cent. Unfortunately, the Government, supported by both Labour and the Tories, opposed such a move; indeed, in an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Government, Labour simply succeeded in priming the trapdoor through which ministers have gleefully escaped.</p><p>In his letter to all party leaders, Scottish and Southern Energy chief executive Ian Marchant said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If the 2050 target is 80% cut from the 1990 baseline, then by the halfway point, 2020, the cuts must be more than half way. That means at least 40% with no ifs or buts or politically-motivated caveats\".</p><p>He went on to add:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"With its rich natural resources, Scotland shouldn't just be waiting for the pack, but leading it.\"</p><p>Ambition has also been lacking in year-on-year targets, with the explicit commitment in the SNP manifesto dumped. The Stop Climate Chaos Coalition has urged the First Minister to honour his commitment to a 3 per cent annual target, while the World Development Movement criticised the decision not to do so as \"incredibly disappointing\".</p><p>Such shortcomings are not insignificant, but the bill will still achieve much if we can ensure that it is implemented effectively. For example, it will lead to real improvements in the energy efficiency of <place-holder colnum=\"18809\"/> domestic and non-domestic buildings and put in place important provisions on local and business tax incentives and permitted development rights. I am proud of the role that I have played in these areas and put on record my thanks to the Association for the Conservation of Energy, Friends of the Earth Scotland and the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition.

In passing, I note that, according to recent evidence, my own constituency might be in the front line in this country.</p><p>I thank everyone who has contributed to the scrutiny process and, again, I congratulate the minister on securing the bill's successful passage.

I also acknowledge the amendment that Dr Simpson lodged, which helps by expanding on some key changes that might need to be considered to address the shortcomings in the regulatory environment.</p><p>John Lamont set out the concerns in Chirnside about an application to open a community pharmacy there. As Christine Grahame said, such concerns are echoed elsewhere&#8212;not least in my constituency of Orkney, where a similar application in Dounby has caused widespread anxiety about the potential impact on primary health care services throughout the west mainland.</p><p>I will focus on the situation in Dounby, but I recognise the important role that community pharmacists play in our urban and rural areas. Their expertise and the service that they provide&#8212;often alongside GPs and other medical professionals&#8212;are highly valued. As Dr Simpson said, following the 2003 OFT report on pharmaceutical services, the Scottish ministers sensibly resisted calls for widespread liberalisation, which would have seriously undermined the position and development of community pharmacies.</p><p>The position and development of dispensing GP practices also merit close attention. As members have said, such practices are particularly prevalent in remote and rural areas. That is in no way surprising. In parts of the country where the population's size and dispersal make delivering public services difficult and therefore costly, bringing services together in a single location can be the only way of making them sustainable.</p><p>The Dounby GP practice has been built up over three decades from its start as a single-handed practice in cramped premises. The surgery now provides local residents with access to a one-stop shop where patients can see one of two doctors, as well as a nurse, a physiotherapist and a chiropodist, all under the same roof. At a single sitting, patients can pick up any medication that they need, which is often ready by the time they leave the consulting room.</p><p>As an integrated primary care team, working closely with the community nurse team that is based at the surgery, the staff understand their patients' social and family relationships; in the case of more dependent patients, they know who the patients' carers are and who supervises their medication.</p><p>In no sense has the application to open a community pharmacy in Dounby village, directly opposite the surgery, been driven by demand from patients&#8212;quite the contrary. I accept Dr Simpson's remarks about the ease with which <place-holder colnum=\"18506\"/> petitions can be struck up, but around 1,500 letters have already been sent to me, from a patient list of 2,300. Petitions have secured even more signatures.</p><p>Such concerns are shared by the wider medical community in Orkney. The secretary of the local medical committee wrote in March:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The resultant substantial and immediate reduction in funding to the Dounby practice, which would occur should this pharmacy application become successful is likely to seriously destabilise it and significantly reduce the service to West Mainland patients which they currently receive\".</p><p>He went on to ask how provision would be provided to patients in the area if the pharmacy were set up but subsequently failed.

It is disappointing that, 18 months since the cabinet secretary's announcement on the zero waste <place-holder colnum=\"18384\"/> society, we are still awaiting publication of the new draft national waste management plan. However, I accept the cabinet secretary's comments that the debate can help to inform the shape of that plan. I hope that ministers will now ensure that the new draft is published as early as possible, and I look forward to future debates on the matter.</p><p>I was struck by the uncharacteristically downbeat tone of the Government's motion. Scotland achieving a target ahead of schedule, in this case one on landfill diversion, would normally be the cue for a triumphant welcome. On past form, one might reasonably have expected the full weight of the First Minister and his press office to be unleashed in celebration of the sheer historic significance of it all&#8212;yet we are asked simply to note the achievement. That perhaps reflects the fact that it flows from the actions that were taken under the national waste plan that was launched in 2003, following the efforts of my colleague Ross Finnie, who was then the minister responsible.</p><p>In 2001, Scotland's recycling rate stood at an anaemic 7 per cent. By 2005, it had already risen to 25 per cent and, since then, it has continued to climb steadily to more than 30 per cent. Although that rate of progress and the change in public attitudes are impressive, the Government's sombre mood might still be entirely justified in the context of international comparison, where Scotland still lags too far behind what many other countries are achieving in the reduction and management of all forms of waste, and as a reflection of the scale of the job that is still ahead of us.</p><p>All the more sobering is the fact that meeting successive future targets will become progressively more costly. For that reason, I question the wisdom of the Government's decision not only to abolish the strategic waste fund but to reduce the overall level of funds that are available to local authorities and the zero waste budget by &#163;26 million. I acknowledge that the shortfall has since been reduced to just over &#163;12 million, but the reduction in funding still seems a retrograde step, particularly given Audit Scotland's concerns about the achievability of the more challenging longer-term waste management targets and the scale of the investment that will be needed to meet them, which was alluded to by Elaine Murray.</p><p>It is not just me saying that; the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, then chaired by the current Minister for Environment, expressed similar concerns in its 2007 report. The committee also drew attention to changes in the distribution of funding, which it felt could penalise certain councils, often those most in need of support. That said, I agree with the cabinet secretary's decision to suspend fines associated with the landfill allowance scheme. That stick might need to be <place-holder colnum=\"18385\"/> kept in reserve, but at this stage a more supportive approach is needed&#8212;although the figures for Glasgow City Council are of particular concern.</p><p>I will touch on some of the issues relating to waste that arose during the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's consideration of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill, as referred to by Elaine Murray and John Scott. Considering the waste hierarchy, the need for the Government's new plan to address the requirements of the waste framework directive is clear, as Elaine Murray's amendment says. Concerns were raised by the Scottish Environmental Services Association in its evidence to the committee, not just about the wide-ranging nature of the enabling powers that are sought by ministers but about the bill's level of consistency&#8212;or lack of it&#8212;regarding EU law and definitions of recycling and recovery.</p><p>A number of witnesses stressed the importance of having better baseline data before embarking on decisions about targets and infrastructure investment. SESA pointed out that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"significantly better capture of data from waste producers and from sites exempted from waste management licences\"</p><p>is needed, possibly under regulations, consistently across the United Kingdom.</p><p>Likewise, I echo the sentiments that were expressed by John Scott and which are reflected in his amendment. Commercial and industrial waste was identified to the committee as an area on which a great deal more could be done, but investment in infrastructure is key.</p><p>It is worth noting the concerns that the waste industry and local authorities raised about decisions taken on, for example, deposit-and-return schemes that could skew existing waste streams and undermine existing investment. One highlighted risk was that setting up infrastructure for a range of different waste management processes may not be the best means of tackling waste, achieving our targets and deploying inevitably scarcer public resources over the coming years.</p><p>The final amendment this afternoon, in Robin Harper's name, presents me with a little difficulty. Along with Elaine Murray&#8212;I associate myself with her comments on the distinction between the different types of waste&#8212;I agree that reduction, reuse and recycling are the optimal routes for us to follow in dealing with waste, but entirely ruling out the option of large-scale waste-to-energy plants seems impractical. In my constituency, much of our waste is still shipped north to Shetland for incineration at no little cost, and the case for building a waste-to-energy plant is increasingly gathering momentum.<place-holder colnum=\"18386\"/></p><p>I agree with Friends of the Earth and others who argue for waste-to-energy plants to be subject to tough standards on the use of the best available technology. I also welcome Friends of the Earth's calls for a greater focus to be placed on efficient technologies, such as anaerobic digestion, to which Jeremy Purvis and John Scott referred. Having seen for myself the benefits of such a process&#8212;albeit on a small scale&#8212;in Westray in my constituency, I believe that it can play more of a role in helping us to achieve our waste and emissions reduction targets. Earlier today, I joined colleagues from various political parties at a briefing from Arup, at which we heard of the role that algae can play in carbon capture. In effect, they eat carbon as emissions are passed through pipes, after which the algae are anaerobically digested, turned into fertiliser and returned to the ground.</p><p>Much of what the cabinet secretary set out in his zero waste announcement last year was welcome. The plan and, most importantly, the programme for its delivery is now needed as a matter of urgency. The Liberal Democrats welcome the debate. We are proud of our record on the issue in government. We are also proud of Mike Pringle's and Jim Hume's efforts to reduce plastic bag use and excess packaging.

This debate was kind of pre-empted by yesterday's SNP press releases. The previous Administration sought derogations for unworkable proposals; it is now up to ministers in the current Government to make the sell for, if not further derogations, then at least the flexibility that we now need.</p><p>The industry's anger is understandable, not least because of the timing of the proposals. We already face the challenge of trying to stem and reverse the haemorrhage of sheep from our hills and island areas. The economic and social impact of a further loss of sheep from those areas could be devastating for many fragile communities, some of which have lost up to 60 per cent of their sheep since 1999.</p><p>The environmental cost, too, must not be overlooked. RSPB Scotland points out in its briefing:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"additional labour and costs implied by the proposed compulsory introduction of electronic sheep ID could contribute to the difficulties in keeping sheep in\"</p><p>some</p><p class=\"indent\">\"areas and so further impact on biodiversity\".</p><p>European Council regulation 21/2004 was designed in response to tracing issues that were highlighted by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. Since then, in 2007, we have had a further reminder of the cost and disruption that such outbreaks can cause. I do not think that any member would dispute the need for good <place-holder colnum=\"17890\"/> traceability of sheep. As with cattle, good traceability of sheep is an essential part of disease control and helps to underpin public and consumer confidence, but any regulation must be evidence based, proportionate and targeted. In all three respects, regulation 21/2004 is defective. Indeed, the 2007 FMD outbreak demonstrated that lessons had been learned since 2001 and that contingency measures were effective in controlling the spread.</p><p>As NFU Scotland makes clear in its briefing and has been pointing out for months, the regulation is undeliverable in its current form. There are many reasons for that. The principal ones are the challenge of maintaining individual identity within large flocks; cross-compliance issues that will arise from a failure to achieve high levels of identification in extensive systems; and the high cost of implementation relative to the value and profitability of the sector and the benefit that will ultimately be achieved.</p><p>Anyone who has even a rudimentary understanding of sheep farming in Scotland can see the impracticalities of what is being proposed, particularly in the Highlands and Islands. My colleagues Jamie Stone, John Farquhar Munro and Tavish Scott can doubtless provide graphic examples of why the proposals are impractical, some of which may even be publishable in the <em>Official Report</em>. Orkney might not boast the wide untamed expanses of the west Highlands&#8212;where satellite navigation rather than EID might be called for&#8212;but it presents its own challenges to local sheep farmers.</p><p>The North Ronaldsay sheep, which are reared on seaweed and kept off the better-quality grassland by a sea wall around the island, are probably the most famous Orkney ovine. One of my earliest memories after I moved to Orkney in the late 1970s was of my father taking North Ronaldsay rolly sheep in his creel boat over to Lingaholm, off Stronsay. As there was no pier and a fairly basic approach to loading and unloading, it is fair to say that the life expectancy of your average tag&#8212;EID or otherwise&#8212;would have been fairly limited.</p><p>The truth is that, from the Borders to the north and western isles, sheep farming in Scotland is&#8212;for practical, geographic and climatic reasons&#8212;very different from sheep farming in other parts of the European Union. To reflect that, the NFUS has developed a series of counter-proposals. The Commission has shown itself willing to respond to the demands of other member states for flexibility, and the commissioner has declared her willingness to do likewise in the case of the UK. It is now imperative that, over the coming months, a similar case is made successfully on behalf of Scotland's sheep industry.<place-holder colnum=\"17891\"/></p><p>The NFUS's proposals identify levels of risk and target accordingly, which has the benefit of reducing the burden on individual farmers, increasing producer acceptance and improving compliance. As a result, high traceability can be more successfully delivered. The basis of the NFUS's proposals is that sheep that are based on the farm where they were born present no health risk and that it is only once they move off the holding that traceability becomes a factor. Until such movement occurs, it is proposed that a simple flock identifier would be the only required form of identification. After that point, various options have been suggested, from full compliance with the regulation through to the use of a single EID under the so-called slaughter derogation, which allows for batch traceability. Those are practical and workable solutions that would deliver disease control and robust traceability and reduce some of the costs to individual farmers and crofters but, as the NFUS makes clear,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"at a political level, this will only work with further pressure from the Scottish Government on the European Commission and on the UK Government and other Member States' governments to re-visit the issue in the Council of Ministers\".</p><p>Therefore, it would be helpful to know what meetings have taken place or are planned with UK ministers to discuss the NFUS's proposals, and what specific steps have been taken to put and keep the issue on the agenda of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the Council of Ministers. Has a meeting been sought with Commissioner Vassiliou? If so, when will it take place? What meetings have been sought or secured with other member states to build support and to discuss the impact and cost of introducing such measures?</p><p>The threat that the EU's proposals pose should not be underestimated&#8212;Kelvin Pate was clear about that earlier this afternoon&#8212;and if they are implemented in their present form sheep farmers will leave the industry in droves. The Scottish ministers have the evidence and the counter-proposals from the industry and they have received an invitation from the commissioner. Thanks to this evening's debate, I hope that they will recognise that they have the full backing of this Parliament.

The industry's anger is understandable, not least because of the timing of the proposals....", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Liam", "last_name": "McArthur", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80350", "house": "4", "member_id": "80350", "person_id": "14046", "party": "Liberal Democrat", "constituency": "Orkney Islands"}, "section_id": "15014550", "hpos": "73", "gid": "2009-05-27.17889.1", "epobject_id": "15014554", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2009-05-27.17888.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14046+section%3Asp#g17889.1", "minor": "0", "htime": "17:02:00", "speaker_id": "80350"}, {"body": "<p>I start by associating the Liberal Democrats with the condolences that were expressed by the minister to the families of those who lost their lives on Loch Creran. As we consider the importance of the aquaculture industry to the Scottish economy, we are ever more conscious of the potential dangers for those who are employed in the industry. The minister was right to acknowledge that any lessons that emerge from the investigation into the two deaths must be taken on board fully in the strategic framework. A prosperous and sustainable aquaculture industry can be founded <place-holder colnum=\"17771\"/> only on ensuring the highest possible standards of health and safety, and on addressing its impact on the environment.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats welcome the publication of the Government's framework, although I share Elaine Murray's and John Scott's concerns about its timing. As, I am sure, my colleague Ross Finnie will observe, the document is the latest contribution in a process that was initiated in 2003.</p><p>In launching the consultation on the document last year, Mike Russell acknowledged that \"strong foundations\" were \"already in place\" as a result of the original framework. As other members have already suggested, those strong foundations were much in evidence at the recent European seafood exposition in Brussels. During a visit to Brussels at the end of April, members of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee were privileged to be able to attend the exposition, albeit briefly, which is now unquestionably the world's largest gathering of those involved in and interested in all aspects of fisheries and aquaculture.</p><p>In this year of homecoming, when Scotland opens its arms and its doors to the world, it is fair to say that the committee perhaps felt that the organisers of the exposition might have reciprocated that welcome a little more wholeheartedly. Nevertheless, even in the short time that was available to us at the site of the 1958 world fair, it was impressive to see such a formidable presence from the Scottish shellfish and finfish industries. The response from those who attended the event&#8212;from customers right through to competitors&#8212;was impressive, too. In the discussions that I had with various exhibitors, it was clear that the industry faces challenges, not least in the availability and, more often, the cost of finance. Equally clear, however, was the message of optimism about the future. In most instances, the banks appear to recognise the encouraging prospects for established and innovative companies, although I suspect that that might not be the case for all companies.</p><p>Many people I spoke to were concerned about how their businesses&#8212;their staff, in particular&#8212;might cope with the pressures of expansion. Although those are problems that managers, and the industry in general, would wish to have, it would be wrong to underestimate the strains that can result from trying to expand within existing markets or moving into entirely new ones. The middle east was the market that was cited most often as the one where opportunities exist. I note what the minister said, but it would be helpful to hear from her what specific support is being provided to support efforts&#8212;such as what work Scottish Development International has done&#8212;to identify and develop those market opportunities.<place-holder colnum=\"17772\"/></p><p>It would also be interesting to hear what assessment the Government has made of potential market opportunities, notably in the United States of America, that might result from the difficulties that the industry in Chile is experiencing as a result of ISA. The perception, at least, appears to be that global supply will not, because of the reduced Chilean harvest, meet demand. That is also pushing up the price of salmon. Of course, it would be a mistake for the Scottish industry to scale up simply to try to fill a short-term gap in the US marketplace, not least because US customers might look for cheaper alternatives to farmed salmon if prices continue to rise, as Callander McDowell has said. It would help to know what discussions ministers have had with the industry about how they might respond to the situation and what assisting role the Government might play.</p><p>It is not only Chile that has been forced to deal with the consequences of ISA, as John Scott said. My colleague Tavish Scott has worked hard to support the industry in Shetland, following the discovery of the ISA virus in four farms in his constituency, first in January and with the latest discovery as recently as yesterday. I acknowledge that ministers and officials have been closely involved in the situation. However, some companies that are free of the virus have been forced to cease or to scale back their operations significantly. Without further help, companies such as Skelda Salmon Farms Limited face serious financial risk.</p><p>Liberal Democrats support the substance of and approach in the Government's motion. I accept that any criticism that I might have made of its length is fully undermined by my attempt to add to it. As I said, Liberal Democrats believe that the highest environmental standards are essential if we are to have the industry that we wish to have. A tension exists with the commitment to growth, but that can be effectively managed, and the Labour amendment would make a sensible addition. John Scott's amendment repeats the motion somewhat, but it would place a more specific emphasis on the industry's impact on Scotland's more remote and fragile areas&#8212;including my constituency&#8212;so it is valuable.</p><p>Robin Harper's amendment asserts that more must be done in several areas. He will struggle to find anyone&#8212;certainly among Liberal Democrats&#8212;who would argue with that. However, I am concerned by the tone, extent and underlying motivation of his amendment. I will listen carefully to what he says, but I am minded to vote against his amendment.</p><p>My amendment returns to skills and training. Members will recall that when we debated aquaculture back in November, the Parliament <place-holder colnum=\"17773\"/> voted unanimously for our amendment, which encouraged the development and retention of a skilled and qualified workforce in the aquaculture industry. Back then, Mr Russell refused to accept that a problem even existed. I note what his successor has said today, acknowledge that Mr Russell might have been the barrier to change and welcome the Government's change of heart.</p><p>Given the standards to which we want the industry to aspire, it is self-evident that we must retain and attract skilled workers. Our small and medium-sized enterprises must be supported to create genuine career opportunities. In both instances, qualifications have a vital role to play. It is therefore of concern that the Government is withdrawing funding from over-20s who seek qualifications. In general, the workforce in the Highlands and Islands is older. Training providers and aquaculture companies in the region are worried about the impact that withdrawal of that funding will have on efforts to improve and extend skills.</p><p>Scotland is the top European Union salmon producer and the third-biggest salmon producer in the world. However, with scale come challenges, not least in controlling disease and managing the impact on the environment. If we are to meet those challenges successfully, the framework will need to be backed by private and public investment. That is the only way of burnishing the industry's reputation. I have pleasure in moving the amendment in my name.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-4186.4, after \"economic downturn\" to insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; further recognises that, if the industry is to attract, retain and develop people for a long-term career in aquaculture, the Scottish Government must ensure that a range of suitable training opportunities are made available\".</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15014382", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by associating the Liberal Democrats with the condolences that were expressed by the minister to the families of those who lost their lives on Loch Creran.

After his detailed and well-informed speech this evening, it is tempting to consider him his party's&#8212;if not Parliament's&#8212;leading authority on the birds and the bees. Given that the current scandal that is laying low the body politic is financial rather than sexual, I am sure that it is safe for him to accept that accolade with justifiable pride.</p><p>I offer my thanks to the Bumblebee Conservation Trust for its briefing and contribution ahead of this evening's debate. The trust rightly drew to members' attention the significant and valuable contribution that a wide range of pollinators make to Scottish agriculture, notably the soft-fruit industry. It is difficult, taking into account the associated processing industry, to envisage how about &#163;260 million of economic activity could take place in Scotland without the sterling efforts of our pollinating insects.</p><p>As the briefing from the Scottish Parliament information centre makes clear, bees make an important contribution not just to the sustainability of our countryside, but to our biodiversity. I am therefore concerned to note the impact that a loss of habitat is having on a range of our bee species.</p><p>Orkney is fortunate to be one of the few parts of Scotland&#8212;and, indeed, of the UK&#8212;that can still lay claim to being home to the great yellow bumble-bee in some numbers. However, it is said that changes to grazing patterns are having a negative effect on bees, as the plant life that protects nests is eaten back and flowering is prevented. Rural Affairs and Environment Committee members discussed the topic earlier this week as we were chauffeured up to Peterhead by our convener, Maureen Watt. Committee colleagues waxed nostalgic for the Swiss model of allowing road verges to grow untamed, thereby allowing a thousand flowers&#8212;and many more insect species&#8212;to bloom and flourish.</p><p>I urge the minister to consider what more might be done to assist beekeepers in my constituency. Peter Peacock and Rob Gibson referred to the potential impact of the varroa mite on hives in Colonsay and other parts of the country. I can testify to the impact on Orkney&#8212;several keepers in my constituency have raised the issue with me.<place-holder colnum=\"17657\"/></p><p>The minister knows that the Bee Diseases and Pests Control (Scotland) Order 2007 (SSI 2007/506) requires beekeepers and others to notify the Scottish ministers of the suspected presence of notifiable diseases. I am sure that she is also entirely familiar with the fact that notifiable diseases and pests include American foul-brood and the small hive beetle. Sadly, they do not include the varroa mite. The extension of statutory infected area status to Orkney and Scotland's islands therefore lifted a layer of protection.</p><p>The Pentland Firth presents any number of challenges for those of us who live and work in Orkney, but it also provides great opportunities, not just in tidal energy, but in the fact that it is a barrier to a variety of animal and insect diseases, as in this case. I concede that exempting Orkney from SIA status might no longer be possible, but I hope that the minister will agree to work with Orkney Islands Council, local beekeepers and transport providers to see whether a voluntary ban on imports of hives and other bee equipment can be established. I accept that that might not be straightforward, but the benefits to Orkney and&#8212;more widely&#8212;to Scotland and the UK would be worthwhile.</p><p>I congratulate Peter Peacock again and look forward to the minister's response to my plea for the bees of Orkney.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15010321", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise for my slightly late arrival and I warmly congratulate Peter Peacock on securing the debate, even if it has provided an opportunity for him to rehash his \"standing up for invertebrates\" joke.

Scottish Liberal Democrats warmly welcome not only the detail of the legislation but the manner in which it has been dealt with since its introduction. I suggest gently that although there are numerous examples of the minority Government's talk of working with other parties to achieve agreement being found wanting, the bill is a good illustration of what can be achieved through early, meaningful and transparent engagement&#8212;not just with Parliament and its committees but with the wider group of interested parties.</p><p>There have continued to be areas of disagreement throughout the process, including this afternoon, but it is worth observing that those have, on the whole, been limited. Resolutions to such disagreements have invariably been found relatively painlessly to satisfy all sides. For that <place-holder colnum=\"17384\"/> reason, I record my thanks, as a member of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, to the ministerial team&#8212;in both its current and previous forms&#8212;and to their officials for the work that they have put in, particularly since the bill was introduced in September last year. At stage 1 I commended them for their willingness to listen and respond, and I am pleased that that approach has, by and large, remained since then.</p><p>I also record my sincere thanks to the committee clerks and to the Scottish Parliament information centre and other support staff, who have helped me up the learning curve since I joined the committee in September last year. Unlike some other members, I did not have the advantage of having participated in the previous flooding inquiry, but the clerks helped me to mask that fact, at least in the early stages. To all those who provided written and oral evidence, both to the committee and on a one-to-one basis, I offer my thanks. Like Elaine Murray and Peter Peacock, I draw particular attention to the efforts of Andrea Johnstonov&#225;.</p><p>It would be an unhealthy state of affairs if we agreed on all aspects of any piece of proposed legislation, however much the overarching principles might commend themselves. Even now, there will be those&#8212;perhaps even ministers&#8212;who can and will point to bits of the bill with which they are unhappy. However, that is the nature of the beast. As politicians it is, in the current climate, nice to think that the issues of controversy are related to policy, and not to the flood risk of one's moat, swimming pool or&#8212;heaven forfend&#8212;tennis court.</p><p>I am under no illusions that, however it might have seemed at times over the past six or seven months, we have been involved in the more straightforward task. Implementing the bill's measures and ensuring that they are effective and will achieve the objectives that have been set will be altogether more onerous. In that regard, we as parliamentarians must ensure that subsequent guidance is clear, well informed and timely; that funding is in place to meet agreed needs; and that we have the appropriate skills mix that is required as part of the culture change that we all agree needs to take place in our approach to managing flood risk in this country. That, as Elaine Murray has suggested, is all that we realistically can do.</p><p>It is imperative that natural flood management processes and features play a greater role in addressing a problem that, as the cabinet secretary said, we are likely to face more and more in the years and decades ahead. That is not to say that more traditional and innovative hard engineering solutions will not continue to be necessary, but a better balance needs to be struck. That can best be achieved by taking a <place-holder colnum=\"17385\"/> longer-term perspective, but without losing sight of the need for early action; by making explicit our expectations of a range of bodies; and by ensuring, among other things, that appropriate compensation can and will be paid. In that way, we can help to effect the necessary culture change. We can do so without the need for a presumption in favour of natural processes, a concept about which there was clearly confusion, particularly among various local authorities. I think that the bill now achieves the right balance in that respect.</p><p>As for my own interest, the issue of coastal flooding has a particular resonance. Again, I record my desire for SEPA to take proper account of data on climate change impacts and local tidal patterns, including tidal surges, in seeking conclusions on flood risk. I echo John Scott's sentiments and concerns on that.</p><p>At stage 1 I concluded that this is a good bill that could be made better. Over the past three months, the necessary improvements have largely been made. The bill does justice to the legacy of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, which was successfully introduced by my colleague, Ross Finnie.

Although there is no doubt that a debate on the future of our postal services fully satisfies the latter criterion, not even Lord Mandelson would attempt to claim that his proposals have been without their critics.</p><p>One issue on which there has been full agreement this evening is the importance of the Royal Mail and of the Post Office network to the constituents we represent. Consensus also seems achievable on the proposition that the Royal Mail and the Post Office network face some serious challenges.</p><p>Like most parts of the country, Orkney recently went through a process of post office closures. A worrying point is that a small number of branches that were not included in that programme have subsequently found themselves in difficulties. The branch at Lyness has already shut its doors.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Royal Mail is asked to compete with private operators, few of which consider the islands to be part of the United Kingdom. While continuing to deliver an excellent service to my constituents, the Royal Mail is often faced with covering the final mile not only for itself but for operators that happily surcharge their island customers.</p><p>Responsibility for the mess is not hard to identify. A series of decisions by UK ministers, which were taken with little consideration for the consequences, have each had a significant and cumulative impact. A succession of services&#8212;from benefits and bank accounts to television and driving licence renewals&#8212;have systematically been removed. Individually and collectively, those decisions have progressively undermined the viability of many branches across the network. The truth is that there is a limit to how many financial services products the post office in Finstown or Flotta will ever be able to sell.<place-holder colnum=\"17322\"/></p><p>With the Royal Mail, too, the UK Government sold the pass when it liberalised the bulk mail market. Whatever benefits ministers felt would result from liberalisation, the way in which they implemented it has ensured that they have come at a very high price, which is now being paid by Royal Mail customers and staff, not to mention taxpayers.</p><p>My argument with Lord Mandelson is not that nothing needs to be done&#8212;it is clear that something needs to be done&#8212;but that I have serious problems with his proposals and do not accept that they will achieve what he has suggested they will achieve. The UK Postal Services Bill fails to offer the investment that is needed to modernise the Post Office network and it will not enable the network to develop new services and regain its vibrancy and viability, particularly in rural areas. I agree with Gavin Brown that more can and should be done to examine ways in which post offices can become the first point of contact between the public and government.</p><p>The bill also fails to facilitate the creation of a post bank&#8212;a service that could simultaneously build on the reputation of the Post Office and the trust that people have in it and address structural issues of financial exclusion by offering banking services to all. In addition, the bill fails to allow the Royal Mail to borrow on capital markets or extend its range of services. It is silent on employee share ownership and it will do nothing to level the playing field as regards a statutory universal service obligation throughout the UK.</p><p>I assure Jamie Hepburn that Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose the bill in the Lords and the Commons&#8212;for all the reasons I have given&#8212;but it is doubtful whether that will have any effect on the SNP spin machine, which has its dial set firmly on \"outrageous\". By way of example, I cite the recent comments of Dave Thompson, who appears to be endlessly capable of working himself up into a lather of synthetic rage. His desire to name and shame Scottish MPs who have not signed Geraldine Smith's EDM presumably stems from his ignorance of Westminster procedure and the fact that there are at least half a dozen EDMs that express opposition to the bill.</p><p>Given that a recent members' business debate involved only two MSPs, one of whom was the relevant minister, I congratulate Jamie Hepburn on giving us the opportunity to participate in a lively and well-attended debate on an issue that is of fundamental importance to all our constituents in all the communities we represent.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14967416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Royal Mail (Part-privatisation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Jamie Hepburn on securing the debate.

Sadly, despite its many laudable features, the bill is still wanting in that respect. Fortunately, there is time for Parliament to rectify that, and perhaps this afternoon we are seeing evidence that ministers are waking up to our concerns.</p><p>Rightly, the bill covers a wide range of issues. I will concentrate on the contribution that energy can and must make in addressing the challenges that we face. In his excellent book \"Sustainable Energy&#8212;without the hot air\", David MacKay, professor of natural philosophy at the physics department of the University of Cambridge, points out that the energy debate is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"inundated with a flood of crazy innumerate codswallop.\"</p><p>It could be that, when Professor MacKay wrote that, he had just attended a mind-mapping session with our very own Minister for Enterprise, Energy <place-holder colnum=\"17118\"/> and Tourism. However, to be fair to Mr Mather, I am fairly sure that that opinion was formed some time ago.</p><p>Like the climate change debate as a whole, Professor MacKay bemoans the fact that discussions about future energy policy involve the use of language and numbers that are intended to impress rather than inform. He concludes that, however we stack up the numbers, there is no getting around the fact that the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"climate problem is mostly an energy problem.\"</p><p>It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that both the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee have drawn attention to the fact that renewable energy and energy efficiency have a key role to play in delivering carbon emissions cuts.</p><p>In its briefing for the debate, the microgeneration and energy efficiency bill steering group makes it clear that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"significant commitments are still required in the Bill that promote micro generation and energy efficiency as a vehicle to achieve early and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\"</p><p>I acknowledge and welcome Mr Swinney's clarification that he intends to introduce a new interim target for 2020. However, as Patrick Harvie and others have mentioned, that still does not address the point that has been made by the steering group, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Friends of the Earth Scotland, Scottish Renewables, the Association for the Conservation of Energy and others that ministers' failure to commit to making immediate, meaningful and quantifiable cuts in emissions effectively risks chucking in the towel on achieving the interim and 2050 targets.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to accept that the bill is bold, but, as I will discuss, it is rather lacking in detail, as many members have suggested.

Inexplicably, the Government continues to treat energy efficiency as the Cinderella of the energy debate. After the consultation that was carried out by the previous Executive, Jim Mather felt confident enough in May 2007 to promise that he would make publication of an energy efficiency action plan an \"early priority\". A year later, he had another stab at guessing the date of the publication, saying this time that it would be published by the end of 2008. Now we are told that the action plan cannot be published until 12 months after the provisions in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill come into force. Two years after the SNP came into office, this continued delay is simply not acceptable. That is why the Liberal Democrat amendment calls for <place-holder colnum=\"17119\"/> an energy efficiency action plan to be published within six months. Unless the Government takes the issue more seriously, its credibility on climate change and, indeed, on fuel poverty will be compromised. On microgeneration, too, ministers must use the opportunity that the bill presents to make progress with the proposals that are set out in Sarah Boyack's proposed energy efficiency and microgeneration bill, which commands widespread support.</p><p>Having dumped local income tax, ministers now have no excuse for opposing local tax incentives to boost the uptake of microrenewables and energy efficiency measures. The Energy Saving Trust argues that council tax rebates are more visible than any other fiscal incentives, and I understand that Ian Marchant of Scottish and Southern Energy has told Mr Swinney that the bill is the obvious vehicle for delivering such an incentive. I hope that ministers will respond positively to that.</p><p>On permitted development rights, the Government must show more ambition, not least in extending those rights to the non-domestic sector. The steps that have been taken by ministers today, while helpful in relation to solar panels and ground-source heat pumps, still do not go far enough. As ACE points out, with regard to micro wind and air-source heat pumps, guidelines threaten to \"stunt development\". Action on that point could be part of a concerted attempt to enhance the contribution that is made by renewable heat. Scottish Renewables proposes a target of generating at least 14 per cent of heat from renewables by 2020. It would be useful to hear the minister's views on how that might be achieved.</p><p>It would also be useful to hear what specific steps are being taken to further empower local communities to address the climate challenge. As the debates in this chamber on Community Energy Scotland and eco-congregations have demonstrated, the necessary desire, capacity and innovation are present in many of our communities and congregations, but a more decentralised, bottom-up approach is required to allow them to flourish.</p><p>The Government is right to remind us of the potential of the bill to be world leading and a fitting tribute to this Parliament as it enters its second decade.

I am a little surprised that Alex Johnstone is performing the role of gardener. If SNP ministers are so thirled to the idea that the Tories have put forward in their amendment, it is hard to fathom why Mike Russell <place-holder colnum=\"16930\"/> did not implement it immediately after last May's members' business debate on fuel costs. Alasdair Allan did not call for an impact assessment on a derogation last May when we debated the motion in his name, and nor did his SNP colleagues who spoke in the debate. The SNP called for action and for a clear statement from Parliament. The SNP called for a commitment to press the UK Government for a derogation. Given that there was no vote on Alasdair Allan's motion, perhaps they felt able to speak up for their constituents.</p><p>Of course, the SNP's preference is not for a derogation but for a fuel duty regulator. The basis on which that would operate has changed almost as often as oil prices have changed over recent years. Stewart Hosie, to his credit, has been remarkably honest in his assessment of the ever-changing approach to a regulator, and has said that the approach is not perfect&#8212;there is no false modesty there. When he was asked whether a fuel duty regulator would do anything to address the premium that is paid in rural areas such as the Western Isles and Orkney or whether the premium would be enshrined by the regulator, he confessed that,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sadly, it is the latter\".</p><p>In its most recent incarnation, SNP policy is that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"indexed fuel duty increases shall be frozen until the international oil prices\"</p><p>drop. Mr Hosie has said that freezes on fuel duty would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"automatically triggered by world oil prices.\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is not our intention to deny the Government any money ... when the price goes down.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>House of Commons</em>, 6 July 2005; c 362-3.]</p><p>Therefore, under the SNP's proposal, when oil prices dropped in January, the SNP's regulator would have automatically ended and duty rises would have been unfrozen. Under the SNP proposal, Scottish motorists, including motorists in my constituency and Alasdair Allan's constituency, would have experienced duty rises in January rather than in April, when they voted against rises, or in September. The SNP MPs were quite happy to wave the September rises through Parliament without demanding a vote.</p><p>It is sad that there was no opportunity to vote on Alasdair Allan's motion last May, but Liberal Democrats are offering Parliament another opportunity today.

Like others, I look forward to meeting many of those involved in telehealth provision at the reception that will follow this debate. In that regard, I warmly congratulate Dr Richard Simpson, not simply on securing this important debate&#8212;which is his debut members' business debate&#8212;but also on ensuring that there is an opportunity for our discussion to continue afterwards in the more informal and convivial setting of a parliamentary reception.</p><p>Being able to access that insight and expertise is particularly welcome for those of us who might generously be described as \"happy amateurs\" in this field. Unlike Dr Richard Simpson, Ian McKee and others, I can lay no great claim to a track record, far less a career, in medicine. However, I represent, and was brought up in, a part of the world where the development of telehealth can have a real impact. We are already seeing evidence of this, as Mary Scanlon indicated.</p><p>Until recently, patients in Orkney who are suspected of having suffered a stroke would have been referred to Aberdeen for consultation with a stroke physician. This would involve cost, inconvenience and probably some discomfort. Invariably, however, it would also involve time&#8212;the thing that suspected stroke patients can least afford after the onset of symptoms. Current evidence suggests that the first 24 hours are critical and that appropriate secondary prevention treatment ought to start immediately. For logistical reasons, this has simply not been possible in the past for Orkney patients. However, since July 2008, telemedicine has enabled some of those problems to begin to be addressed. Dr Mary Joan Macleod, the clinical lead in Aberdeen, and Dr Bob Hazelhurst, the GP lead in Orkney, have been instrumental in developing the stroke telemedicine service for Orkney over recent months.<place-holder colnum=\"16887\"/></p><p>By using video consultations, access to specialists is now possible for my constituents, without the immediate need to leave the islands. The technology that allows this to happen is now in place in GP practices across the islands and in the remote consulting site at Aberdeen royal infirmary, which I was delighted to visit last year. The results since July last year have been so impressive that the team, which also includes Nickie Milne, the project co-ordinator; Andy Keldy, the IT lead; and Anne Duthie, the project manager, was awarded the innovation and improvement award that was presented by the minister at the Scottish health awards in November.</p><p>Undoubtedly, there is potential to do more. Unfortunately, however, there is no computed tomography scanner on Orkney, so thrombolysis following a stroke is not an option at this stage. Although the costs involved in locating, but particularly in operating, such a scanner in the islands would be considerable, the potential benefits are enormous, and not just for stroke victims. I understand that the technology increasingly also allows for a range of neurological and other conditions to be dealt with.</p><p>My concern, which I have expressed to ministers over recent months, is that in carrying out a cost benefit analysis for a CT scanner in Orkney, no account can be taken by Orkney NHS Board of the cost savings to NHS Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service as a result. Reduced costs for transport, admissions, overnight stays and emergency transfers are all savings that would accrue outside NHS Orkney's budget. However, I understand that it would still bear the full capital and ongoing costs of a locally-based scanner.</p><p>There is also scope for telemedicine to provide support and access to professional advice and development for health professionals operating in some of the smaller islands in my constituency and in other remote parts of the country. It has been welcomed by many practitioners in Orkney. The benefits of this for staff and patients in the islands are obvious and considerable. However, care needs to be taken to reassure the public that the technology will not be used as a Trojan horse for centralising services. Telemedicine can enhance and extend the services that are available to patients, but we must recognise that it will raise concerns in some communities that it could be used as an excuse to either remove or reduce the presence of medical practitioners. Those concerns need to be taken seriously and not dismissed as unfounded.</p><p>Telemedicine is making a real contribution in improving the services that are available to my constituents. It has a greater role to play, not least&#8212;as Dr Richard Simpson suggested&#8212;as we deal with the consequences of an ageing <place-holder colnum=\"16888\"/> population.

In a week that confirmed the worst-kept secret of all&#8212;that Scotland is officially in recession&#8212;we have also had confirmation that the jobless total in Scotland has risen by 15,000 over the past year&#8212;15,000 more people who are facing the harsh reality of the economic downturn.</p><p>Although there are sectors of the economy that are faring worse than the newspaper industry, at least in terms of total job losses, there has been a certain brutality about what is happening in the world of print media. It has been suggested that this process is in effect Scotland's Wapping and, as Hugh Henry suggested, it seems to have a whiff of the final reckoning about it.</p><p>No one would dispute that these are difficult times for newspaper and media organisations. Advertising revenues have taken a brutal hit, which comes on the back of the longer-term trend of increasing competition from online and other sources of news content. Those factors demanded a response from traditional print media organisations and some element of restructuring and reorganisation was unavoidable&#8212;a fact not disputed, and even embraced, by the workforce. However, it is how that appears to be being carried out that raises concerns.</p><p>David Whitton was right to point out the lack of consultation and the seeking of redundancies on the cheap. That said, we need to take care in how we express our concern. It is absolutely right that we send out a clear message that a greater commitment to meaningful negotiation with workforce representatives is not only desirable but required. An active and engaged Government is essential in these circumstances, but it is another thing entirely for the Scottish Parliament to suggest that Scottish ministers should in effect prevent compulsory redundancies.</p><p>Like others, notably the public, I am growing tired of hearing Scottish ministers blame their inaction or incompetence on a lack of power or resources.

It is one thing to be opposed to compulsory redundancies, but it is quite another to suggest, as David Whitton seemed to do, that Government can prevent or veto them.

However, it is disappointing that ministers have not put forward a proposition to set out clearly the measures that they plan to take to tackle the most challenging economic circumstances of the post-war period and to seek Parliament's backing for that approach.</p><p>Current ministers lectured us when they were in opposition on the need for motions to be laced with vision and aspiration. The Minister for Parliamentary Business, Bruce Crawford, was particularly critical of what he called \"wishy-washy\" motions, but now he does not even want a wishy-washy motion lest it contaminates the debate with <place-holder colnum=\"16301\"/> party politics. However, I will enter into the spirit of the debate that it is clear Mr Crawford wants us to have.</p><p>I agree with much of what the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth said about the role of clean green jobs in supporting economic recovery. Amid all the understandable gloom around the current state of the economy, there are pockets of optimism. For example, as we face up to the responsibilities of tackling climate change, real opportunities exist for creating new jobs and new wealth. The secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon, recently told the Davos economic forum that although the obvious temptation is to focus on short-term economic problems, it is important to remember that climate change remains the \"one true existential threat\" to the planet.</p><p>I am not sure whether Derek Brownlee was distancing himself from that view and suggesting that economic growth should take priority over other worthy causes&#8212;I hope not. Decarbonising our economy is not optional, but how we choose to do so, where Government makes its investment and what incentives it puts in place will determine whether we emerge from the current economic trough taking full advantage of the green-collar job opportunities.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has announced a target of creating 16,000 green jobs in Scotland by 2020. That target strikes me as somewhat modest, which is not an accusation that is levelled at the Government too often. Modesty is not the real worry, however: in response to the questions that I have raised in recent weeks, ministers admit that they have little idea where those jobs will be created or of what constitutes a green job. In effect, the Government is setting targets for what Donald Rumsfeld would class as \"known unknowns\".</p><p>The RSPB points out in its briefing that those jobs need to be properly defined and measurable. The Government must cast aside its new-found modesty and recognise that opportunities are broad ranging, including the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"development of green infrastructure, environmental management and wildlife tourism\".</p><p>I look forward to reading Mr Swinney's winding-up speech tomorrow to find out whether any further light has been shed on the issue.</p><p>It is right that ministers continue to emphasise the potential of renewable energy to create jobs and wealth. I add my welcome to the cabinet secretary's announcement about the turbine facility at Machrihanish. The benefit of that, as Mr Swinney suggests, will extend beyond the Kintyre economy.<place-holder colnum=\"16302\"/></p><p>The potential that can be found across a mix of technologies should not be underestimated, although it is obvious that I have a particular interest in the marine energy sector. I was pleased to see, from responses to parliamentary questions that I lodged recently, that the Government is now committed to undertaking a detailed supply chain analysis of the sector. The absence of such an analysis at this stage is viewed by the marine energy industry as a barrier to forward planning, and ultimately to job creation.</p><p>Concerns have been raised with me by, for example, those who are involved in vessel supply. Increasingly, bespoke supply vessels will be needed to support the marine energy industry through installation and generation. The scope exists for designing, building and crewing those vessels in Scotland. I would be interested to hear ministers' views on how the development of the sector could be supported, either directly or through incentivising collaboration between technology developers.</p><p>To date, there has been a pipeline of Government support for renewables research and development. However, although I welcome the plans for tiered renewables obligation certificates for wave and tidal energy, I remain deeply concerned about what one developer told me was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a lack of any open source of R and D funding for marine renewables.\"</p><p>For all that the First Minister loves to wrap and rewrap himself in his saltire prize, as Lewis Macdonald said, it will not pay out until 2015 and represents a winner-takes-all approach. Government needs to recognise the need for on-going support for those who are looking to scale up their projects as well as bringing on other, earlier-stage devices.</p><p>A further threat to the creation of a renewables revolution is the limitations of the grid. Although more attention must be paid to decentralising generation and taking seriously issues of storage, the demand for grid infrastructure remains and is growing. I am told that there is no shortage of potential investors but that the regulatory regime needs to be sorted out. Ministers have been part of the broad coalition that has been arguing for change, but that pressure must now be intensified. In my constituency, Fairwind Statkraft last week announced that its onshore wind projects were on hold due to a lack of progress in reducing charges for access to the transmission system.</p><p>The potential for job creation in energy efficiency as well as in energy generation is significant. There is also the added benefit of achieving quick wins in reducing both emissions and fuel poverty. Building up skills and capacity will be crucial to securing that win-win situation. Dave Watson of <place-holder colnum=\"16303\"/> Unison has called for the Government to build up a carbon army to be sent into battle against poor insulation, energy inefficiency and waste. That certainly has a ring to it. It needs to be a nationwide effort, however. At present, carbon emissions reduction target and community energy saving programme funding discriminates against my constituents and others who live in island areas, as do the insulation initiatives that are being promoted by various retailers. That is unacceptable and a nonsense, given the prevalence of fuel poverty in my constituency.</p><p>A nonsense, too, is the fact that, under the Government's insulation and central heating schemes, no local installers are used for jobs in Orkney. Economically, socially and environmentally, that makes no sense. In the future, more attention must be paid to the local recruitment of Mr Watson's carbon army.</p><p>In the area of waste, the potential for job creation is substantial but, unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into that.</p><p>I welcome the debate and look forward to further opportunities to debate the issues more fully.

I do not suggest that no progress has been made in the interim, nor do I suggest that the issues and competing interests involved do not present real challenges for ministers, but the issues will not become any more straightforward.

The proposals on the establishment of a dedicated marine management organisation, the co-ordination of marine planning, an increased local focus, a three-tiered planning structure and the approach to marine conservation were all inherited from the work of AGMACS.

I contrast the approach to the marine bill with ministers' approach to the flood risk management proposals. The collaborative approach with the Parliament and stakeholders on flooding has rightly drawn praise and, I believe, will deliver results in the final legislation. In contrast, the more piecemeal approach to the marine bill does not augur well. There is a risk that the assurances and commitments that ministers give now are effectively second guessing the evidence that will be taken and the conclusions that the Parliament and its committees will reach, although time will tell.</p><p>However, the case for a single management organisation is widely accepted. One of the attractions&#8212;certainly for many of my constituents&#8212;is the prospect of a more streamlined licensing system. The consultation was unclear on whether marine Scotland will act as a single gateway for those who apply for a <place-holder colnum=\"15320\"/> license or whether it will undertake the licensing work in-house. There are pros and cons with both approaches, and although ministers seem to be clear that responsibility for licence monitoring and enforcement should rest with the new body, there is less clarity about which approach they favour in handling applications.</p><p>I note the intention in the consultation to include dredging within the licensing system. From my discussions with Orkney Harbours, there is confusion about how that might operate alongside the existing responsibility to maintain navigable channels. Perhaps the minister will address that in his winding-up speech. Ministers have emphasised their desire for increased consultation, to enable consistency of approach and local involvement, but until we know the detail, it is hard not to see potential conflicts with the streamlining objective.</p><p>We believe that the proposed three-tiered approach to marine planning is appropriate. It should enable Scotland to meet its international obligations while setting its own national marine plan and objectives, and allow more local planning and management to take place through Scottish marine regions. We also support the proposals for a marine science strategy to focus on marine scientific effort. In that regard, I make a passing plea for sea bed mapping and submerged architecture. Members will have to wait a little longer for my discourse on differential crustal rebound, but there is already ample evidence that there was a time when my Orkney constituents would have taken a more active interest in ministers' ill-conceived plans for forestry.

As I did that, I certainly detected anger but, as much as anything, it was anger at having been told that, if the budget was not agreed to last Wednesday, public services would grind to a halt, investment in major projects all over Scotland would not take place and an election was inevitable&#8212;all of which was clearly untrue. I note that, in a piece of masterly understatement, Bill Aitken insisted that lives were at stake&#8212;Mr Neil has some competition.</p><p>Speaking to my constituents, I found no echo of the scaremongering that characterised some of the speeches in last week's debate and no desire to see the Government's budget simply rubber-stamped for ministers' convenience. People want agreement to be reached and a budget to be passed that&#8212;as far as possible&#8212;reflects the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. They want serious measures for serious times.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have responded to that mood, as has the Government. Notwithstanding <place-holder colnum=\"14674\"/> the reservations that I continue to have about aspects of the budget, we have used the process to persuade the Government to make important changes that will lock in long-term benefits for Scotland during the recession and beyond. We remain committed to the need to reduce the tax burden for those on low and medium incomes. That could not be achieved in this budget process, but a platform has been laid for permanent tax cuts in the future through the new strategic review of Government spending.</p><p>Bringing to bear the Council of Economic Advisers' depth of knowledge and array of expertise in considering the budget will provide real benefits, as will the Government's change of mind on a finance sector jobs task force. Despite Mr McLetchie's reservations, under the auspices of the Financial Services Advisory Board&#8212;FiSAB&#8212;such a task force can provide a real focus for action to assist that key sector through exceptionally difficult times.</p><p>Liberal Democrats still believe that the approach of the Scottish Futures Trust is misguided. It has proved costly and resulted in uncertainty and confusion precisely when the construction industry in particular has looked for a clear steer. However, by agreeing to Liberal Democrat demands for councils to receive revenue support under the SFT, Mr Swinney has taken an important step towards ensuring that building programmes for schools and hospitals have a chance of being re-started.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14671142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "After my remarks last week, I am a little disappointed that nobody got round to making \"Groundhog Day 2\".

Week after week, \"Good Morning Scotland\" is left playing the ministerial announcement equivalent of Sonny and Cher's \"I Got You Babe\".</p><p>During the stage 1 debate, the Scottish Liberal Democrats argued that the Scottish Government had not done enough to respond to the economic storm that it rightly predicted. Like the SNP's Treasury spokesman at Westminster, Stewart Hosie, we believe that tax cuts form part of the solution&#8212;putting money back into people's pockets when they most need it. As Mr Hosie recognises, many small businesses in this country pay personal tax and would benefit greatly from such a fiscal stimulus. However, SNP ministers have shown depressing unwillingness even to engage in the debate about how that might be delivered.</p><p>Ministers' response to our proposals since the autumn has been interesting. First, we were condemned for not telling them how to introduce such a change&#8212;a condition that is happily waived in the context of discussions with the Tories and Greens. Then it was the fault of HM Revenue and Customs for saying that they had run out of time to introduce a tax cut this year. Finally, we were told at stage 1 that Mr Hosie's plea could not be answered in the Scottish context because it is impossible to introduce tax cuts within a fixed budget. As Jeremy Purvis highlighted, that position is rather undermined by the Government's actions hitherto.

The stage 1 debate was characterised by a stated willingness on the part of Mr Swinney to strain every sinew to find common ground with other parties. It would appear that that willingness has produced mixed results. Indications are that it has been impossible to find common ground with the Labour Party on skills and apprenticeships. However, fortunately for the Government, this year the Tories have again proved themselves to be a cheap date for ministers.</p><p>Last year Mr Swinney rather ungallantly described the concessions that he had made as \"really marginal\". This year, after tough negotiations by the Tories, he has agreed not to take away the concessions that he made 12 months ago&#8212;which, as he admitted at stage 1, were never under threat. This afternoon there has been much merriment on the Tory benches about town regeneration funds&#8212;that from a party that was happy to sanction the slashing of the enterprise network budgets, which threw regeneration across the country into disarray for months.

The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment's proposed amendment to its long title is a further and welcome enhancement. As with any bill at stage 1, we want to improve certain aspects of it. However, the general principles are absolutely sound, and I acknowledge the early efforts of the Scottish Government to address concerns that have been raised.</p><p>As Sarah Boyack and Roseanna Cunningham observed, the cabinet secretary's task was made easier by the work that the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee undertook for its flooding inquiry last year. It is not false modesty to suggest that that had absolutely nothing to do with me, as I was still serving my time on the Finance Committee. Bringing such pre-legislative scrutiny to bear has significant benefits. I welcome Richard Lochhead's comments in that regard.</p><p>I pay tribute to previous and current Rural Affairs and Environment Committee members, and express my thanks to the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and other support staff, as well as the many individuals and organisations that provided written and oral evidence during our consideration of the bill. That information has provided a solid basis for us to take forward our scrutiny of the bill in the months ahead. It is against that positive background and support for the principles and thrust of the bill that I <place-holder colnum=\"14348\"/> raise the following concerns, which were addressed in the committee's report.</p><p>The issue of skills rightly received much attention during the committee's evidence sessions and has done so again this afternoon. It is recognised that the passing of the bill will result in greatly increased demand for specialist flood management staff, notably hydrologists. The bill's financial memorandum suggests that SEPA will require 55 new specialist staff. That must be viewed in light of the 200 vacant positions in the Environment Agency south of the border and the demands that will inevitably come from Scotland's local authorities for people with many of the same skills. The problem will become more acute as demand Europe-wide intensifies and the world of consultancy proves too alluring to resist for newly qualified and experienced people. I know that the minister acknowledges that problem but, as our report makes clear, the committee</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is not at all convinced by the Minister's reassurance that the steps being taken to recruit and retrain will 'ensure future supply'.\"</p><p>Notwithstanding Mr Lochhead's remarks today, I hope that the Government will redouble its efforts to get to grips with an issue that cannot simply be left to SEPA and local authorities to resolve, and which threatens seriously to undermine the ability of ministers and responsible authorities to deliver effective flood risk management.</p><p>The skills issue also has a bearing on concerns that were raised with and by the committee about whether</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a cultural shift in favour of considering natural flood management techniques\"</p><p>can be achieved. The committee wrestled with whether a presumption in favour of natural techniques and processes was desirable. As Roseanna Cunningham reflected, there is confusion about what such a presumption would mean in practice. However, it is clear that without access to the broader range of skills sets, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect local authority officials to gravitate towards considering&#8212;far less employing&#8212;such techniques. I agree with the convener that ministers must reflect further on that point and come forward with proposals that firmly underscore the need for natural flood management options to be properly considered, and for reasons to be given where such options are found not to be appropriate.</p><p>Legislation of the bill's scope and complexity takes time to introduce and bed down. We are right to be ambitious. We also need to be clear and resolute about our longer-term objectives for flood risk management. However, flood risk management plans will not be ready and in place until 2015, and we cannot lose sight of what is <place-holder colnum=\"14349\"/> expected and required between now and then. Scottish Government officials admitted to the committee that interim arrangements have not been finalised. As a result, it should come as no surprise to the minister, or anyone else, that local authorities across the country are questioning their role and responsibilities in the meantime.</p><p>Jim Moodie from Fife Council, who made quite an impression on the committee, referred to the lack of interim arrangements and suggested that that was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a concern because there is nothing in the bill to say that councils have to do anything until the management plans are in place.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 10 December 2008; c 1273.]</p><p>I accept that it would be a foolish, not to say short-lived, council administration that sat on its hands and did nothing in the face of a demonstrable flood risk in its area, but I hope that the minister will accept the need to clarify the position on interim arrangements.</p><p>The minister will recall the funding concerns that a number of local authorities raised, not only with the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee but with Finance Committee colleagues. As a member of the Finance Committee, and a constituency member from a part of the country that has been badly affected by flooding in the recent past, I know that Jeremy Purvis will elaborate on some of those concerns in his remarks.</p><p>Returning to the evidence from Mr Moodie of Fife Council, he observed that the lack of a clear funding mechanism</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will mean that many schemes will not be delivered at all, because the funding will be allocated to what councils consider to be other priorities.\"</p><p>He added, rather courageously perhaps:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our budgets are defined by accountants and asset management people who are not directly affected by flood prevention issues or functions.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 10 December 2008; c 1270.]</p><p>While Mr Moodie doubtless had his work cut out to make his peace with his colleagues once he got back over the bridge that afternoon, his candour suggests that assurances from ministers about funding may still fall on deaf ears.</p><p>The minister will have observed that the stage 1 report includes a section on coastal flooding, to which we will need to return in more detail at stage 2. In particular, the question of how SEPA takes proper account of data on climate change impacts and local tidal patterns, including tidal surges, in reaching its conclusions will be important.</p><p>Banning development on land below a certain point above sea level is not always practicable, and mitigation still has a role to play. However, as <place-holder colnum=\"14350\"/> the Association of British Insurers and others agreed, development and planning decisions need to be better aligned.</p><p>This is a good bill that can be made better.

The UK negotiating team secured valuable concessions, not least in the flexibility in how the measures were to be implemented, but I struggle to see how the cabinet secretary can claim that what was agreed moves away from the perils of overproduction. Given the current debate about food production and food security, which John Scott mentioned, most farmers and crofters in Scotland will consider Mr Lochhead's claim to be a strange one.</p><p>Nevertheless, I welcome many aspects of what was agreed in November. For example, retention of the beef calf scheme is helpful. It has perhaps not been as effective as we would have wished in keeping cattle on the land, but without it the situation would almost certainly have been far worse. There has, of course, been a debate about whether and how it could be augmented, but I have my doubts that top-slicing moneys across farming would be effective enough to justify the inevitable pain that it would cause.</p><p>As someone who was involved in the introduction of the beef envelope back in 2005, I was interested to note the industry's hearty welcome of the scheme's retention in 2008.

That issue was never going to be addressed in the CAP health check, but I hope that, as part of the joint working that is called for in Sarah Boyack's amendment, it could be identified as a priority for the negotiations over what happens in 2013 and beyond.</p><p>I have little difficulty with most of what was agreed during the health check, aside from some of the now-customary ministerial hyperbole. However, there are serious issues that require urgent attention if we are to secure the dynamic and competitive industry to which the Government's motion refers.</p><p>John Scott is right in his amendment to point to the importance of both food production and self-sufficiency. The cabinet secretary highlighted the fact that, given that Scotland is a major exporter of high-quality beef and lamb as well as fish and other food and drink products, we must be careful how we conduct the debate about self-sufficiency. However, the appetite among consumers for more local produce is tangible, it is growing and it presents real opportunities for our farming community and food businesses. The need to look at how support can be linked to active farming of land will also be important as part of this process and as a response to the dramatic reduction in livestock numbers on our hills and in our remote areas.</p><p>I accept that the historical basis of payments has always had a shelf life and that ways need to be found to ensure that the public continues to get value for money from the support that is provided. That said, calls for an abrupt switch to area-based payments are premature. Along with retention of a bull hire scheme, those are important issues that must be addressed if we are to safeguard the distinctiveness of agriculture in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrat amendment highlights serious failings in the operation of the Scottish rural development programme. In particular, the rural priorities scheme has proved to be, in the words of Dan Buglass of <em>The Scotsman</em>, \"a bureaucratic morass.\" The scheme is worth up to &#163;800 million to farmers and small businesses over the next four years and there seems to be little dispute anywhere, from anyone, that it is not working well. As a consequence, farm <place-holder colnum=\"14190\"/> business viability, as well as our biodiversity and environment, risk being compromised.</p><p>Having chastised ministers for using hyperbole, I will try to avoid making the mistake of using it. However, even the minister has acknowledged&#8212;rather coyly, perhaps&#8212;the existence of</p><p class=\"indent\">\"teething problems and bureaucratic issues\".</p><p>The president of the Scottish Beef Cattle Association, John Cameron, put things rather more bluntly. He described the situation as a \"nightmare\".</p><p>Part of the problem, of course, is the insistence by ministers that all applications be made online. That stipulation poses no problem for many people&#8212;indeed, it has many attractions&#8212;but it has created enormous difficulties, extra costs and frustration for many other people who are without a computer or access to high-speed broadband. We welcome the fact that a review of the scheme's operation is under way and that it is to be wide ranging, but the problems relating to online applications, for example, were flagged up loudly and early. They can hardly have come as a surprise to ministers.</p><p>Of course, Mr Lochhead has insisted that a review was always planned. However, what was not planned was the minister's meeting with the NFUS's less favoured areas committee before Christmas, at which he was left in no doubt about the scale of the problems or the anger that exists. A <em>Press and Journal</em> report at the time suggested that Mr Lochhead</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is understood to be deeply concerned at poor acceptance rates\".</p><p>Nevertheless, the Government still appears to be in a state of denial. Ministers have talked about 3,000 applications resulting in more than &#163;480 million of spending so far. Dan Buglass called that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"smoke and mirrors from the SNP\".</p><p>Some &#163;300 million of that total was made up of legacy schemes that were inherited from previous years, and there is the &#163;120 million in less favoured area support for 2007 and 2008. The cabinet secretary has accepted that just &#163;60 million has been committed this year. I am pleased that he now acknowledges that problems exist. I hope that he accepts the scale of those problems, and I hope that his review will be swift, thorough and wide-ranging, as he says it will be. It is also important that Parliament be provided with an early opportunity to consider his proposed changes.</p><p>I will leave the final word to a north-east farmer, who has been at the sharp end. He was quoted in <em>The Scotsman</em> as saying:<place-holder colnum=\"14191\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Mess is an understatement, the whole system is unworkable and over complex. It is constantly altered and rules changed without informing applicants. I have given up trying to do it myself and now have three yes three separate advisor's working on applications ...

In that debate, SNP speakers showed little of Mr Russell's trademark diplomacy. I am aware of the dangers of attempting to quote the current Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, but Mr Mather opined in 2004:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Given the popularity of the scheme and its undoubted effectiveness, it is hard to understand how downgrading a livestock quality improvement scheme conforms with common agricultural policy reform, which emphasises the need to improve farm product quality.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-05-19.8571.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 19 May 2004; c 8571.]</citation></p><p>What Mr Mather lacks in pith, he makes up for in sincerity. His point was well made.</p><p>In the same debate in 2004, Fergus Ewing, who is now Mr Mather's ministerial colleague, quoted the then president of NFU Scotland, John Kinnaird, as saying that the changes to the bull hire scheme were \"a draconian step\". Mr Ewing went on to note, with obvious disdain:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Mr Kinnaird is not a man given to hyperbole.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-05-19.8563.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 19 May 2004; c 8564.]</citation></p><p>That is not an accusation that could be levelled against the minister for first ministerial apologies and getting things resolved.</p><p>The Government's dilemma with the current bull hire scheme appears to be based on both cost and state aid rules. However, both the Scottish Crofting Foundation and NFUS have sought advice on state aid rules that would appear to call into question the assertions that the minister and his officials have made. NFUS has been in direct contact with European Commission officials. A detailed response is awaited, but Commission officials have made it clear that they see no inherent difficulty with a bull hire scheme.<place-holder colnum=\"14151\"/></p><p>In relation to cost, there appears to be scope for efficiencies. However, abandoning the scheme altogether would result in a reduction in livestock numbers, quality and health. The implications of that for those living in crofting counties are extremely serious. As both the SCF and NFUS make clear, smaller producers cannot afford the cost of quality bulls. Overwintering proves especially problematic, and the risk to smaller herds is acute. As most members and the mover of the motion would accept, some change from the status quo may be inevitable&#8212;and possibly even desirable&#8212;but complete abandonment should not be an option.</p><p>This morning, I spoke to a constituent of mine&#8212;Michael Cursiter of HI Health Ltd, which has offered to run a successor scheme. HI Health is a not-for-profit, farmer-led and health-accredited operation. That is encouraging, as it suggests that HI Health has the requisite expertise in managing stock and the requisite credibility within the agricultural community to make a success of a scheme.</p><p>Mr Cursiter says that, although subsidy would still be required, costs could be reduced. Purpose-built sheds&#8212;accessible by tractor and with bedded pens and bull-handling facilities&#8212;would obviously be required. That could allow the sale of the current prime site, but would require an alternative, relatively central site. I am told that Dingwall, whose mart is enjoying some success at present, might be a sensible option worth considering.</p><p>Retention of the bull hire scheme is not the sole answer to retaining livestock in our remote areas. However, its removal will certainly exacerbate the already serious decline. I hope that the proposals submitted on behalf of HI Health will be given full, urgent and constructive consideration by the minister and his officials.</p><p>The message from the chamber this evening has been clear.

The decision to strip out skills from the remit of the enterprise agencies makes little sense and will result in large set-up costs for a stand-alone agency. It also fails to acknowledge the inherent link between skills and economic development. During the past year, I have been told by Scottish Enterprise staff that they have resorted to consulting a thesaurus, desperate to <place-holder colnum=\"13956\"/> find alternative words for \"skills\", so that they can successfully propose packages of support for key businesses that are crying out for help in recruiting and retaining staff.</p><p>Ministers persist in arguing that there have been no cuts in budgets, a line that the management of Highlands and Islands Enterprise no longer attempts to sustain.

Nevertheless, the debate has demonstrated the collective political will to make the year of homecoming a success.</p><p>Iain Smith reminded members of the role played by our Liberal Democrat colleague Donald Gorrie in floating the idea of homecoming. Roseanna Cunningham acknowledged that and rightly set out the role that all of us as individuals have in making the year of homecoming a success. Of course, the original vision for the homecoming went beyond that of providing an economic stimulus. Willie Coffey and Rob Gibson correctly pointed out the cultural and multiethnic dimensions of the year of homecoming events. However, by playing to our strengths, homecoming potentially has an important role to play as we enter difficult and uncertain economic times.</p><p>Contributions from throughout the chamber reflected on the amendments and made the point that, if the year of homecoming is to be more than a one-off shot in the arm for Scotland's tourism industry, the Scottish Government and its agencies must act to ensure effective promotion of the homecoming in Scotland, the UK and key overseas markets; ensure that our skills base is in the best possible shape to provide the range and quality of experiences that will have participants in this year's homecoming returning year after year; and ensure that we can effectively measure the <place-holder colnum=\"13775\"/> impact of the year of homecoming and follow up the contacts that are made during it.</p><p>Gavin Brown will not be surprised to hear me express caution about the creation of a mega-database of personal details, although I appreciate his point. Mr Brown and, indeed, Jamie Stone are right to point out the role that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises and those in some of the remotest parts of the country, will play in making the homecoming a success and, I hope, helping to sustain and grow their local economies.</p><p>In the limited time available to me, I simply echo the call of lain Smith, Lewis Macdonald and others for the minister to set out clearly and precisely how the Government intends to intensify activity and support for the year of homecoming, not least in the light of modest budget allocations or, indeed, cuts. What specific steps are being taken, for example, in light of changes in the relative strengths of the pound, euro and dollar to capitalise on the situation through targeting both domestic and overseas visitors? Action is also needed on skills. Everyone accepts that Scotland is never likely to be at the cheap end of the spectrum for tourists, but it can quite legitimately lay claim to the quality end. However, that requires greater focus on and investment in skills. The minister must spell out what action he is taking to support improvements in that area.</p><p>I have developed a healthy scepticism about information that emerges from St Andrews house. I was surprised but not astonished, therefore, when I perused my initial copy of the map of events for the year of homecoming 2009. While a sizeable number of the events are not new, that is not to say that they will not be spectacular. I was a little disappointed to note that the internationally renowned St Magnus festival in my own constituency had not made it into the programme. Perhaps the minister in winding up can explain the criteria and process for including pre-existing events. However, I was shocked to see that Orkney was set to host the brass in the park event, though not as shocked as people in the Borders. That appeared to come at a cost, however, as the Orkney science festival had somehow been relocated to Harris. The Western Isles also seemed destined to host the creative connections Shetland event in August, though any disappointment my colleague Tavish Scott and his constituents might have felt was surely tempered by the suggestion by the EventScotland map that Lerwick was set to play host to the Edinburgh arts festival. Thankfully, those errors have been corrected on websites and in the formal homecoming brochure.</p><p>The programme of events provides a solid basis for a successful homecoming on the 250<sup>th</sup> <place-holder colnum=\"13776\"/> anniversary of Burns's birth. However, I hope that the minister will take on board the calls for action from throughout the chamber to ensure that the homecoming does, indeed, leave a long-lasting legacy.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homecoming Scotland 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting debate, which has been truncated to allow time for more pressing issues to be considered.

As we wrestle with some of the macro issues, it is important that we do not lose sight of that aspect of what needs to be done. The Institute for Public Policy Research&#8212;I think&#8212;produced a report a few years ago on the language of climate change, which stressed that a balance must be struck between impressing on people the seriousness of the challenge that we face and convincing them that small individual actions matter and can be effective.</p><p>In my constituency, the congregations of Papa Westray church and Kirkwall East church were among the first to take up the initiative, and I know that others are following suit. The Papa Westray congregation has for some time been particularly active on ecological issues&#8212;all its primary heating needs are met from renewable sources. Also, I awarded Papa Westray its Fairtrade island status last September. The congregation felt that, although it had been active in that regard for some time, the eco-congregation initiative was a useful way of focusing effort, providing support and guidance and helping to maintain the standard of the work that is done.</p><p>The success of the eco-congregation initiative should not surprise anyone. As Sarah Boyack highlighted, it is difficult to think of a theology that is not an environmental theology. This initiative, therefore, very much sings to the choir. In their communities, eco-congregations can act as catalysts for further action&#8212;it is not only MSPs that churches contact and encourage to take action. As Alex Johnstone suggested, the eco-schools initiative has proved successful across the country. In Orkney, Dounby and Glaitness primary schools have achieved green flag status. Glaitness primary's only dilemma is that it does not have a pole from which to display its flag.</p><p>Such initiatives demonstrate the growing public appetite for taking specific actions to reduce our impact on our environment. This evening's debate further raises the profile of the work of eco-congregations and others in our communities in that regard, and it highlights the need for us to continue and build on the support that we give to eco-congregations.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14306199", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Eco-congregation Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Des McNulty on securing this debate and I assure Sarah Boyack that she is not alone in feeling somehow stalked.

I will certainly not risk pre-empting the committee's conclusions on that, even in the absence of Roseanna Cunningham, but it demonstrates that issues with single outcome agreements remain.

Alex Johnstone made interesting points about the climate change challenge. The Finance Committee has focused its efforts on assessing the Government's response to the dramatically changing circumstances. I do not dispute the point that Derek Brownlee and Alex Neil made about there being limits to what the Scottish ministers can do in response.

The delay in producing a strategy on energy efficiency and microrenewables, to which Patrick Harvie referred, is highly regrettable. The adherence, for politically dogmatic reasons, to the Scottish Futures Trust has rightly drawn criticism. The Liberal Democrats have no difficulty with the NPD model; indeed, the trail was blazed by Lib Dems in Argyll and Bute, as I recall.

I do not for a moment want to compare Mr Finnie to an aging rock star, but his appearance does have the feel of a comeback gig about it. However, I am sure that I am not alone in looking forward to his speech. His participation today is certainly an appropriate reminder of the historical context to the subject under discussion and to what has become a unique annual ritual in the parliamentary calendar.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary is aware, the serious challenges that he and the rest of the UK negotiating team face this year are not unusual. EU negotiations and the December fisheries council have rarely been viewed with anything other than trepidation by our fishing industry and others involved.</p><p>Thankfully, we have come some distance since the particularly difficult times that we experienced five or six years ago. However, without some of the tough decisions that were taken at that time, it is inconceivable that any minister would have been in a position to deliver the speech that Mr Lochhead delivered this morning. Although the prospects for certain key stocks are still deeply worrying, the fact that catching capacity is now more in line with available fishing opportunities means that the options open to ministers and officials to secure a deal that is indeed \"fair and just\" as well as sustainable are immeasurably enhanced.</p><p>That difficult period also saw much of the early trialling and promoting of gear selectivity and a range of other technical measures and the development of a more flexible system of managing effort through kilowatt days. The idea of closing certain areas of the sea to fishing at certain times was also being worked up, although early Commission counterproposals on that were blunt and misdirected.</p><p>It is encouraging that the industry, in close collaboration with scientists, environmentalists and the Government, has taken forward work on that suite of measures to the point that they are starting to be rolled out. As the Government's motion rightly acknowledges, that is something for which Scotland's fishermen deserve credit for having taken the lead. Like Sarah Boyack, I congratulate the cabinet secretary on his role in that effort, although I caution him against making any suggestion that he has taken on the work from a standing start. Although more must be done to <place-holder colnum=\"12823\"/> refine this more sophisticated management regime, not least if we are to address the economic and environmental affront of discards, it is to be hoped that we can start to draw a line under the sort of blunt, one-size-fits-all measures that elevated simplicity over effectiveness.</p><p>Key to that shift has been and will continue to be the work of the regional advisory councils. Introduced in the reform package of 2002, the RACs have not all operated as effectively as they might have done, but we are fortunate that the councils that are key to our industry have proved their worth.

The conservation credits scheme reflects that, and it is important that such an approach is built into any reform of the CFP, which is now under discussion.</p><p>Our negotiating position in the talks on the future of the CFP will not be strengthened by people noising off and suggesting that Scottish ministers are hell-bent on a unilateral withdrawal. Although the First Minister has been cagey of late, the recent consultation paper on quota management was less equivocal. It boldly declared:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Government is seeking to withdraw from the CFP\".</p><p>That position is both unrealistic and unhelpful. Although the 2002 CFP reforms did not achieve everything that we would have wanted, the key objectives were secured, not least the safeguarding of relative stability, the Hague preference and the much-cherished Shetland box. Those are fundamental features of the CFP that have served our industry well. They will be under <place-holder colnum=\"12824\"/> threat again in any reform negotiations and must be defended at the same time as we argue for even greater regional management of our fisheries.</p><p>Of course, there are more immediate priorities. Although the prospects for a number of stocks are fairly promising, there are still serious concerns in some areas. Of particular concern is the situation on the west coast, as John Scott rightly said. The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee took evidence on that recently. Nobody disputes the depleted state of the key white-fish stocks, but a wholesale shutdown of the west coast fisheries is neither sensible nor justified.</p><p>John Scott rightly pointed to the threat to the extremely valuable prawn fishery. I agree entirely with the points that he made about a fishery that has been prosecuted sustainably. Those fishing grounds are also crucial to parts of the white-fish fleet, including boats from my constituency as well as from Banff, Macduff and Fraserburgh. A complete closure could force some boats to the wall or displace effort back into the North Sea, neither of which is desirable. I do not expect the cabinet secretary to disclose his negotiating position, but I was encouraged by the reassurances in his opening speech.</p><p>Tavish Scott has highlighted concerns about attempts to reduce effort as part of a trade-off for more quota. That could pose a serious threat to the economic viability of the Shetland and Orkney fleets. I hope that the cabinet secretary will bear that in mind as the negotiations progress.</p><p>This will be a more consensual debate than those that we have had in the past.

As someone who participated in the meetings of the advisory group that was established to help prepare the previous framework strategy, I can certainly reassure the minister that I do not take the move on his part as a slight; indeed, I take modest pride in his reference to being able to build on strong foundations. I also feel some of what Rob Gibson referred to as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"d&#233;j&#224; vu all over again\".</p><p>I am bound to say that successfully balancing the various interests involved is not, as Mr Russell conceded, always easy. I remember&#8212;not that fondly&#8212;that the previous ministerial advisory group spent the best part of three meetings trying to thrash out a mission statement that was acceptable to all. I was reminded of that when I read RSPB Scotland's briefing note for the debate. Despite what Dave Thompson said, the RSPB <place-holder colnum=\"12675\"/> does take issue with the foreword to Mr Russell's latest text, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scottish ministers want an aquaculture industry that is ambitious, thriving, growing, diverse and profitable.\"</p><p>I am bound to say that that bears a striking resemblance to the previous wording, but there is a tension between continued economic growth and expansion on the one hand, and carrying capacity and sustainability on the other. That can be resolved, but it will require sensible compromises to be made along the way, some of which will be difficult. That is very much encapsulated in the RSPB briefing, and in other briefings, and it is reflected in the Labour amendment, which we will certainly support.</p><p>As Des McNulty observed, most members have followed the minister's lead by highlighting the enormous importance of both the fin fish and shellfish industries for many of our remotest communities. My constituency is a case in point, although I know that there is a feeling that Orkney is still not fulfilling its full potential in aquaculture.</p><p>Overall, however, the state of the aquaculture industry in Scotland seems to be more encouraging than was the case a few years ago, notwithstanding the news from Inverness this week. The previous strategy was a reflection of the times in which it was developed, so the time is right for a refresh that will reflect new circumstances, opportunities and challenges.</p><p>There are plenty of challenges. The battle that was fought to persuade the European Commission to instate a minimum import price in response to what were seen as anti-competitive practices by other farmed-salmon-producing countries should not be underestimated. My colleague Ross Finnie, and Allan Wilson, to whom Peter Peacock referred, should be congratulated on their roles. The fact that the MIP was removed earlier this year will have been greeted with relief by parts of the Scottish industry, although I know that other parts of the industry are feeling extremely anxious&#8212;a point that Peter Peacock made well.</p><p>The Commission might believe that there is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"little risk of recurrence of dumping\",</p><p>but as <em>The Herald</em> reported back in August,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there have been predictions of significant job losses in some of Scotland's most fragile communities as a result of the EU's decision\".</p><p>The introduction in 2006 of the minimum import price complicated relations with the Norwegians in particular. It is perhaps somewhat ironic that, as the minimum import price was being lifted earlier this year, ministers found alternative ways of displeasing their Norwegian counterparts by making repeated and partisan comparisons between the two countries.

The reputation of our aquaculture sector is good, but it is also vulnerable. Some people have been, and continue periodically to be, only too happy to use specific cases to generalise about the industry as a whole, which is unhelpful. That underscores the importance of effective marketing by individual companies and by the industry as a whole. It would help if the minister were to outline the role that he sees the Government playing in supporting those efforts. For the avoidance of doubt, that also reminds us of the need to continue to focus ruthlessly on quality and on addressing disease, as well as escapes and site location. High environmental standards and an excellent health status lie at the heart of a profitable and competitive industry, as Jim Hume made clear.</p><p>Points were made about having an effective and streamlined regulatory environment. I reassure Elaine Murray that that is not about being a soft touch or having a light touch, but about a risk-based approach that is rigorous but not needlessly burdensome, and which does not place unnecessary costs on private businesses and public agencies.</p><p>One other key factor in achieving the objectives and ambitions that we all have for the industry is skills, which Elaine Murray mentioned briefly. The minister acknowledges the need to retain and attract skilled workers, not least given the standards to which we want the industry to aspire. I hope that he accepts the need to help our SMEs to create genuine career opportunities and structures, and that he recognises the role that qualifications have to play in achieving that. The minister should therefore be aware of concerns <place-holder colnum=\"12677\"/> that have been expressed to me about the relatively low profile of skills in the consultation document \"A Fresh Start\", which I hope will be rectified in the strategy. He might wish to reflect on whether withdrawing funding from over-20s who seek qualifications will help. As the workforce in the Highlands and Islands tends to be older than that elsewhere in the country, it is easy to understand why concerns are being expressed. I encourage the minister to respond to them constructively.</p><p>In loquacious conclusion, the debate has been positive and constructive. I hope that the minister has found it helpful in developing his thinking.

We support Sarah Boyack's motion, which mirrors our manifesto, too, and addresses many concerns that were highlighted in our motion on fuel poverty, which the Parliament supported in March.</p><p>Sarah Boyack's motion articulates clearly the challenge that we face in meeting our climate change targets and highlights the potential for energy efficiency and microgeneration to help us meet that challenge. It outlines constructively the steps that the Scottish Government must take to make that happen. In that endeavour, ministers know that they can count on the full support of all parties in the Parliament. The development of the energy efficiency and microgeneration bill has been characterised by its cross-party and consensual nature, which was reflected in Sarah Boyack's speech.</p><p>The measures in the energy efficiency and microgeneration bill can provide a win-win-win by reducing carbon emissions, tackling fuel poverty and providing security and continuity of supply. Of course, the general principles are scarcely controversial. Only the most ardent flat-earther&#8212;who appears to be in regular correspondence with Alex Johnstone&#8212;would contest the notion that urgent and radical action is needed to reduce our energy demand and increase our reliance on renewable energy sources.</p><p>At the same time, the Government is right to argue that disagreement will arise on details in the bill&#8212;I can think of one or two issues on which I am likely to find myself shouldering arms with the minister. However, those are matters for debate in due course. The fact is that the Government still flatters to deceive on energy efficiency and promoting microrenewables. Ministers tend to announce and retreat. Nods and winks are given to the press and selected stakeholders, carefully choreographed photo opportunities are arranged and the sense is created that more progress is being made. However, as the bill's steering group makes clear,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Despite several Scottish Government announcements, none fulfils the proposals set out for this Bill or will ensure <place-holder colnum=\"12318\"/> that energy efficiency improvements and microgeneration measures are mainstreamed across society by requiring and incentivising such measures in homes or businesses\".</p><p>If ministers support the motion&#8212;as they say they do&#8212;no further retreat can occur.</p><p>It beggars belief that, 18 months since the Government came into office, ministers still have not published their action plan on energy efficiency. The Government was bequeathed a draft by the previous Executive, which was drawn up thanks to input from a wide range of independent experts, so it is hard to find any justification for the Government's failure to set out its intentions and how it plans to achieve them.</p><p>The preamble to the much-delayed renewable energy framework is welcome but insufficient, as Scottish Renewables and others have made clear. It would help to hear in the winding-up speech what assessment the Government has made of the Association for the Conservation of Energy's proposals on planning, regulation, finance and information and advice, to which Sarah Boyack and Alex Johnstone referred. ACE suggests that about half of new homes are not built to current energy efficiency standards. If that is the case, it is deeply worrying. It would be useful to know what steps ministers will take to address that.</p><p>Given that 85 per cent of existing homes will still be occupied by 2050, perhaps it is more important that the Government set out its intentions to step up the retrofit programme. I welcome the minister's statement about the Sullivan report's recommendations.</p><p>At the heart of any effective strategy must lie fiscal incentives for businesses and households. Agreement on that is fairly unanimous. However, ministers have sought to hide behind the skirts of the local income tax to justify their failure to support the energy efficiency and microgeneration bill. That is a little like ministers saying that they will not bother to introduce any measures until independence is achieved. It is obvious that many nouveau loyalists on the back benches privately agree with that approach, but the First Minister and his colleagues have&#8212;rightly&#8212;rejected it publicly.</p><p>Like the SNP, we support a local income tax, albeit one that is genuinely local and which provides several other safeguards that Mr Swinney is now actively considering. We are happy to work with the Government on ways of using a fairer local taxation system that is based on the ability to pay to incentivise households to adopt energy efficiency measures and microrenewables technologies, but we must establish the principle of such incentives first.

The motion highlights the link between renewable energy projects and the economic viability and sustainability of many of Scotland's most fragile communities.</p><p>Of course, I would argue that it would have been more appropriate to base Community Energy Scotland in the islands but, like Dave Thompson, I welcome the fact that a body that is based in the Highlands has been handed a nationwide remit, which reflects the leading role that the Highlands and Islands have played in the development of community energy. I acknowledge the tremendous work of HICEC in that regard.</p><p>The change in name will not herald a wholesale change in personnel. Many people who have played a decisive part in the success of community energy will make a seamless transition to the new structure. Sam Harcus, from my constituency, personifies that phenomenon. He has been a driving force in the Westray community, so it came as little surprise when he was elected last year to serve as a councillor for all of the north isles. However, Sam is perhaps best known for his work on community renewables projects. He was previously the local HICEC <place-holder colnum=\"12301\"/> officer and he has taken on a similar role in Community Energy Scotland, which illustrates my point. He was also instrumental in taking forward the work of the Westray Development Trust from its inception under the aegis of the previous Executive's initiative at the edge. In that context, the motion makes a valuable point about the link between community energy projects and the building of \"confidence, resilience and wealth\" in small, remote communities.</p><p>The development trusts, now established on most of the Orkney islands, have taken, and continue to take, advantage of community energy projects to build capacity and viability in each island. They also give people confidence&#8212;the confidence that, provided with the right tools, they can help to shape how their islands develop.</p><p>It pains me, as a Sanday man, to acknowledge the lead that Westray has taken. As well as the on-going development of a community turbine project, Westray also boasts an exciting pilot initiative in anaerobic digestion, using slurry and other animal waste to generate heat, electricity and biodiesel. Sam Harcus and his collaborator Colin Risbridger are often seen driving around the island in their biodiesel-fuelled Astra. Meanwhile, the parish kirk and Kalisgarth care home draw heavily on other renewables technologies.</p><p>Other islands are adopting their own approach. Sanday has three turbines&#8212;not the dancing ladies, which can be found elsewhere on the island&#8212;that see funds channelled to island projects through the Spurness community benefit fund. As has been mentioned, last week saw consent granted to community single turbine projects on Rousay and Stronsay. The latter already has three turbines, but the community is determined to adopt a different approach in the next phase of development, and to ensure that more of the revenue is retained in the island. William Caithness, the island's development trust officer, summed it up when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"this is now the first real step towards making our community sustainable in the long term\".</p><p>Eday has been given consent under delegated powers, while decisions are expected soon on similar turbine projects in Hoy, Shapinsay, South Ronaldsay and Burray. As a resident of Burray, I am conscious of the need not to take a cavalier attitude to the proposed development on the island, notwithstanding its potential economic and social significance. However, it is generally acknowledged that the existing Burray turbine is an excellent example of a community-backed and owned project. It is one that other communities in Orkney have long sought to emulate. On a personal level, at the end of each week the Burray turbine stands as a striking and welcome confirmation that I will soon be home.<place-holder colnum=\"12302\"/></p><p>The debate tomorrow morning will provide a further opportunity to develop points about the contribution that small-scale renewables and energy efficiency can and must make in helping us to achieve our climate change objectives.

Unfortunately, on this occasion, one contact&#8212;who shall remain nameless&#8212;whose views I sought on invasive non-native species was clearly confused. He asked, entirely uncharitably, whether I was referring to the various SNP ministers who had been spotted parading through Orkney over the summer. He went on to note, however, that their presence did not seem to be, in Mr Lochhead's words, \"insidious and ... irreversible\", as winter and our recent storms appeared to have put paid to such fair-weather invasions.</p><p>Richard Lochhead can rest assured that I reprimanded his accuser for his discourtesy. Although it is undoubtedly tempting to see Mr Russell as some form of giant ministerial hogweed, I am on record as welcoming those summer visits&#8212;so long as they stop short of the approach taken by wartime GIs, to whom Roseanna Cunningham referred. I will rejoice even more if they lead subsequently to action being taken by the Government in response to my constituents' needs. However, having spent all yesterday afternoon listening to speeches that strayed far and wide from the not-entirely-obvious point of a debate on the British-Irish Council, I will not fall into a similar trap.</p><p>As has been acknowledged by all the members who have spoken this afternoon, this is an important debate. I particularly enjoyed the speeches from Peter Peacock and Kenny Gibson, and I can confirm that Ian McKee has benign status.</p><p>As the joint governmental response makes clear, invasive non-native species pose a serious threat to biodiversity and economic interests in Britain. The cabinet secretary himself has <place-holder colnum=\"11976\"/> conservatively estimated the cost to Scotland at around &#163;200 million. The response is also right to highlight the increased risk that has been brought about by trends in global trade and travel. To those two factors, I add the threat of climate change. The response bears testimony to the partnership approach taken by all the Administrations in Britain and states unambiguously the need for that to continue. The Government's motion reaffirms that commitment, which is very much to be welcomed.</p><p>That said, as Jim Hume set out clearly and persuasively, implementation of the strategy can and should be more localised and should enable bodies such as the Tweed forum to use their expertise to achieve the strategy's objectives. For that to happen, as the cabinet secretary has accepted, a clearer legal framework is required&#8212;a point that underpins Elaine Murray's amendment, which we have no difficulty in supporting. However, the strategy's success will almost certainly have resource implications. It will be difficult to provide those resources but, as the strategy accepts&#8212;and as most members have acknowledged&#8212;delaying action to tackle alien species invariably leads to higher costs because of the damage that is done and the complexity of putting things right.</p><p>I am pleased that our amendment has attracted support from the Government and Opposition parties, but it would be helpful to hear from the minister, in his winding-up speech, what early thoughts the Government has had on resource allocation and how better value might be derived from the resources that are already available.</p><p>Orkney is perhaps afforded a little more protection than other parts of the country. As an archipelago with the formidable barrier of the Pentland Firth between us and mainland Scotland, our remoteness can play to our advantage. That is the case not just in relation to the introduction of alien species, but in the context of disease outbreaks and disease control. Nevertheless, as RSPB Scotland makes clear in its briefing, offshore island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the introduction of non-native vertebrate predators and herbivores. Like Peter Peacock's confessed obsession with slipper limpets, that issue will not be found in any of my campaign literature but it is an important consideration nonetheless.</p><p>For example, the impact of rats on the bird population on Canna is well documented. Rats were initially introduced to the island as stowaways on fishing boats, and the problem started to emerge only as milder winters failed to keep the population under control. Dealing with the problem required concerted and sustained effort over around three years. Thankfully now rat <place-holder colnum=\"11977\"/> free, the situation on Canna illustrates the difficulties and costs that are involved in tackling infestations once they have escalated.</p><p>Egilsay, in my constituency, has experienced similar difficulties, although not to the same extent. The island boasts not only an impressive bird population that includes lapwings, snipe and the occasional corncrake, but the increasingly rare great yellow bumblebee. However, concerns are growing about the number of rats on Egilsay and their impact on local biodiversity. From my discussions with islanders, local RSPB staff and others, it appears that a genuinely difficult calculation has to be made with regard to the need for and the timing and costs of the upheaval that would be entailed by any action. History and common sense appear to suggest that the strategy's hierarchical approach of prevention, early detection, rapid eradication, long-term control and containment is the right one.</p><p>Welcome though the framework strategy for Great Britain is, that is all it is. It requires to be fleshed out with action, which means not only the legislation that the cabinet secretary and Elaine Murray referred to but the training and awareness raising that Rhoda Grant mentioned, improved co-ordination and an increased capacity to respond to and effectively to mitigate the risks presented by non-native invasive species.</p><p>The debate has been useful in teasing out some very complex issues and identifying the challenges ahead. In that context, I echo Nanette Milne's comments on the need to maintain the partnership approach that was initiated by the previous Scottish Executive and, I am happy to say, has been embraced and taken forward by the current ministerial team.</p><p>I caution ministers against heeding any of the siren voices on the SNP back benches urging them to declare epidemiological independence for Scotland. Such calls were made during previous debates on foot-and-mouth disease. However, they stand science and sense entirely on their heads, and I was delighted to hear Mr Lochhead give those nationalist flat-earthers no cause for optimism.</p><p>I welcome the Government's motion, which is improved by the amendments from Jim Hume and Elaine Murray, and I look forward to hosting future invasions of my constituency by the giant ministerial hogweed, the Moray knotweed and other non-native ministerial species when the weather improves.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14186607", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Non-native Invasive Species"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have often found it helpful, in preparing for such debates, to consider whether there is a local angle so that I can embellish my thoughts with some local colour.

Since the election in May last year, the commitment to such a strategy has been if not dumped then, to take a charitable interpretation, progressively downgraded. We were told to expect an energy overview by the end of last year; I am told that it finally appeared last month. Similarly, the long-trailed renewable energy strategy was finally put out for consultation last month. In neither instance did ministers see fit to bring the announcements to the Parliament for debate and discussion. I hope that ministers plan to rectify that. To touch on the complaints of George Foulkes and Margo MacDonald, debating those subjects might have been a better use of our time this afternoon.</p><p>Sadly, that is part of a pattern. The First Minister himself was at it during his statement on the British-Irish summit in Dublin in February. My colleague Nicol Stephen asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Does the First Minister expect to bring his paper on energy to the Parliament in any form before he presents it to the next British-Irish Council meeting?\"</p><p>The First Minister replied:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would be happy to bring the scoping paper for a strand of discussion to Parliament to be discussed, because it contains issues on which I would like to secure maximum cross-party support.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-02-21.6251.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 21 February 2008; c 6251.]</citation></p><p>Those are fine words. I applaud the commitment, but the Government has not seen fit to honour it.</p><p>Of course, we would all accept that the First Minister has a great deal on his mind. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth's comment about the consideration that is being given by summit members to the current financial and economic difficulties is welcome. In response to Mr Foulkes's concern about the First Minister's whereabouts this afternoon, I note that trying to play both sides of the argument in relation to the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB is a time-consuming business.</p><p>I congratulate all those who participated in the summit in Edinburgh, and I welcome the fact that Scotland was able to play host&#8212;again&#8212;to the council's most recent meeting. However, the fact that the First Minister chose to ignore his commitment to consult the Parliament prior to that meeting is a real concern and suggests that his commitment to cross-party consensus on the issue is a little flimsy. It also confirms the growing sense that the minority Government prefers tightly controlled set-piece briefings to proper parliamentary scrutiny and engagement.<place-holder colnum=\"11816\"/></p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to further work being undertaken based on the input of all delegations, and I hope that he will commit to bring that before the Parliament for proper scrutiny. Will the cabinet secretary confirm that a key part of that work stream&#8212;along with renewable energy sources&#8212;will be energy efficiency? All the parties that are involved in the council will have a keen interest in that issue, which is one on which the Scottish Government might be able to take a lead.</p><p>Despite the strides that were made by the previous Executive on energy efficiency, ministers appear to have squandered the opportunity to make early progress in a policy area that unfortunately appears to be the Cinderella of the energy debate. In the light of spiralling fuel bills, rocketing levels of fuel poverty and the fact that the cheapest unit of energy is the one not used, the Government's lack of progress on an energy efficiency strategy is not so much unfortunate as scarcely believable. I have no doubt that some difficult issues are involved, but it is an area in which the Government can be confident of enjoying cross-party support.</p><p>Scottish Liberal Democrats support the continuing work of the British-Irish Council, and we welcome the fact that Scottish ministers have introduced a work stream on renewable energy, on which they intend to take the lead. For that reason, we cannot support the Labour amendment&#8212;although I fully support Lewis Macdonald's points about the need for ministers to work in co-operation. Like Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will take the lead on work on demography, Scottish ministers can take a lead on renewable energy in a co-operative fashion.

I agree that last year's foot-and-mouth outbreak continues to have an economic impact on the industry and that the Government should address proactively the continuing decline in livestock numbers across Scotland, but the amendment, and indeed the Tories, would have a great deal more credibility were it not for the fact that, during the recent debate on LFASS, they failed to lift a finger to help bring forward payments for farmers and crofters.

It needs to be based on real action, and it is time for Mr Scott and his colleagues to assert themselves more in holding the Government to account.</p><p>As I said earlier, in pursuing opportunities for regionalisation, the Scottish ministers must not overlook the interconnections within the farming industry in Britain.

The cabinet secretary is also absolutely right to express disbelief that he and his officials learned of the source of the 2007 outbreak from BBC news. However, holding press conferences in Westminster to release correspondence between ministers is not the manner in which the industry, the public or this Parliament expects the Scottish ministers to behave.

I am also happy to endorse the welcome that is set out in Richard Lochhead's motion for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Scottish Government's commitment to take the recommendations forward\".</p><p>Last year's foot-and-mouth outbreak caused significant disruption and hardship for our agricultural sector.

However, although there were days and weeks last summer when it did not feel like it&#8212;Jim Hume, John Scott and Elaine Murray spoke from experience&#8212;we had learned many of the lessons that arose from the previous outbreak in 2001. Last year was an uncomfortably early test, following on from 2001. By and large, the test was passed, but Professor Scudamore has highlighted ways in which everyone involved can help to develop our level of preparedness. <place-holder colnum=\"11500\"/></p><p>The review and the debate are important, and what we commit to do in the future, in both reducing risk and managing outbreaks, is crucial.</p><p>As Elaine Murray and other members have done, I record again my thanks to the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and his officials&#8212;not least Charles Milne&#8212;for their efforts to keep me and other members informed during last year's outbreak.</p><p>Although the disruption to farmers and crofters in Orkney, as well as to the wide array of ancillary and related businesses, was significant, I am aware that it could have been markedly worse. The fact that it was not worse was due in part to the willingness of the veterinary services, officials and ministers to listen to the points that were being made by my local industry, Orkney Auction Mart and me. I say that in the hope that the positive lessons that were learned last year will not be lost.</p><p>The experience shows that, in Scotland itself, it was possible to take measures that were proportionate with the level of risk and which did not insist on the maxim of all together or not at all. That was very welcome, and I certainly endorse that approach. Indeed, I am conscious that calls might be made for a similar approach to be taken in proposals that are being developed by Scottish ministers to combat the serious and present threat of bluetongue. Again, I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for his engagement with me and my local industry on that issue, and I look forward to developing those discussions in the coming days.</p><p>The Government motion lays particular emphasis on the review's recommendations regarding regionalisation, but last year's experience demonstrates, as Peter Peacock said, that we cannot afford any lazy or partisan assumptions about what that might mean. We do ourselves no favours by insisting \"It's our oil\" but also \"It's your exotic animal disease.\" I recall from the debate last September that some Scottish National Party members urged ministers to class Scotland as a single epidemiological area. To do that would stand science on its head, and I am glad that the cabinet secretary gave the notion short shrift; he set out the reasons for that again this afternoon. The simple fact is that Great Britain is a single epidemiological area. The way in which our agricultural industry is set up&#8212;and must continue, if it is to remain sustainable&#8212;involves considerable trade flows north and south of the border. That trade involves live animals as well as a wide variety of animal products. I note in passing that, sadly, too much processing of Scottish primary produce is still done outside Scotland, representing a loss to our economy of much of the added value of those products. I know that the <place-holder colnum=\"11501\"/> cabinet secretary will wrestle with that issue, as did his predecessor.</p><p>The cross-border trade is of vital importance, particularly in the areas that are represented by my colleague Jim Hume. When Scottish ministers seek</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to minimise the potential future disruption to the Scottish livestock industry\",</p><p>as the Government motion states, it is essential that they do not simply seek to draw a cordon sanitaire along Hadrian's wall. Rather, they should make the case with stakeholders north and south of the border for a rigorous and effective&#8212;but also proportionate and risk-based&#8212;response to any outbreak of disease. I would like to hear the views of the Minister for Environment on that when he sums up.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat amendment seeks to address an anomaly of the devolution settlement that has become more obvious over time and which draws further support from the experience of both FMD outbreaks. As members are aware, the Scottish Government has full policy responsibility for animal health and welfare, yet the budget still resides with DEFRA. Whatever justification existed back in 1999&#8212;I recognise that budgets were generally spent through UK-wide bodies such as the former state veterinary service&#8212;that disjuncture between policy and budget has become increasingly unsustainable, not least because of the challenges that are involved in unravelling it.</p><p>I understand that DEFRA ministers are not opposed in principle to such devolution of resources. Unfortunately, Treasury ministers have the upper hand, so time is of the essence. The Treasury has long had an agenda of passing on the cost of disease outbreaks to the industry, despite a lack of clarity over the nature of the risk and what is and is not in the industry's gift to control.</p><p>Time is of the essence in making the changes that will match up policy and budgets. Since 2006-07, the overall budget for animal health has been depleted; as the cabinet secretary said, any transfer now must not risk the maintenance of existing activity. It is worth pointing out that, given the proportionately high levels of livestock in Scotland, a simple Barnett calculation is likely to be inappropriate and inadequate.</p><p>A similar situation exists with Animal Health. With headquarters in Worcester and funded by DEFRA, the agency operates in Scotland to policy determined by Scottish ministers, who have their own chief veterinary officer and veterinary team at Pentland house. That seems to make little sense. The CVO and veterinary team should have a <place-holder colnum=\"11502\"/> direct link and communication with veterinary implementation on the ground in Scotland.</p><p>Our amendment is not about pulling up the drawbridge but about finding a more sensible means of working. Crucially, it would require Scottish ministers to be able to continue to access the UK contingency reserve fund. At present, applications are made when large amounts of unforeseen expenditure are incurred by any of the UK Administrations. That is a sensible approach and must be safeguarded. The issue goes to the heart of why the failure of the UK Government to compensate for damages that were incurred last year is unacceptable.</p><p>The changes that we propose would enable a more sensible distribution of responsibility and resource, and address Professor Scudamore's calls for greater clarity about and understanding of financial arrangements. I hope that they will enjoy the support of the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the debate.

It might be career limiting were I not to mention the key role that the committee's former convener, Tavish Scott, played in the inquiry and the production of the report.</p><p>As the report makes clear, the extremely stretching 50 per cent target for tourism growth, which was set by the previous Executive and adopted by the current Administration, is the subject of a genuinely lively debate about its achievability. I believe that when targets are <place-holder colnum=\"11029\"/> appropriate, they should be ambitious, but it is inevitable that questions will arise about the extent to which such targets are realistic.</p><p>However, the Scottish Government and the enterprise agencies have, quite rightly, identified tourism as one of the six priority industries and one that is well placed to enjoy considerable growth. Achievement of the growth target will require collaborative effort on the part of the public, private and voluntary sectors. It will also rely on Scotland playing to its strengths and each section of the market and part of the country realising its full potential. That last point is crucial. In turn, that will require a constant and ruthless focus on improving the quality of the tourist experience through investment in facilities, infrastructure, including transport, and the skills of the people who work in the sector.</p><p>Ultimately, the success that we all wish to see will be possible only if we place greater trust, in the shape of responsibility and resources, in the hands of those who best understand each market. That is very much the conclusion of the report by the Royal Society of Edinburgh that was published last week, although I agree with Iain Smith that VisitScotland's abolition is neither sensible nor desirable.</p><p>In reference to our renewable energy resources, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism likes to proclaim that Scotland has won the rollover jackpot in the lottery of life. Although that is not a phrase that I would use, I agree with the sentiment, and that applies equally to our tourism potential. Continuing with Mr Mather's lottery theme, I would suggest that, as with marine renewables, Orkney provides more than its fair share of the winning numbers. According to the traveller's bible, the Lonely Planet guide, Orkney represents the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"glittering centrepiece in Scotland's treasure chest of attractions\".</p><p>Even the weather, which is perhaps perceived to be Orkney's Achilles heel, has delivered of late. During a summer of almost biblical storms everywhere else in the country, Orkney and Shetland topped the sunshine charts. In fact, the only time that I recall it raining was the day that Christine Grahame paid us a visit. There is a moral in there somewhere.</p><p>However, there is mounting anger in Orkney about how and, crucially, where decisions about the marketing of the islands are being taken. That will not be news to the minister, as I have raised the issue with him many times in the Parliament and in correspondence. Sadly, the response has always been a mix of bland assurances and baffling management-speak.<place-holder colnum=\"11030\"/></p><p>The minister saw for himself the level of frustration when he was in Orkney last month. Businesses that are involved in the tourism industry are dissatisfied. Orkney Islands Council, which invests almost &#163;200,000 in VisitScotland, remains unconvinced that it is receiving value for money. An urgent meeting has been set up with VisitScotland's chief executive officer to clear the air. Last month, Councillor Ian Johnstone, who is convener of the council's economic development committee, stated his expectations in the local press:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If we don't get progress we will have to go back to the Minister, though it might be that we will get more autonomy for VisitOrkney from the meeting\".</p><p>We shall see.</p><p>Even more worryingly, tourists themselves are highlighting shortcomings in the overly centralist approach that the Government has adopted. Earlier this summer, a regular visitor to Orkney from the United States wrote to me incandescent about what she considered a downgrading of the local tourism office. In her letter, she said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am writing because of frustration with VisitScotland. If [my husband and I] had our way, VisitOrkney would leave the system\".</p><p>She described how VisitScotland's failure to understand the local market and local businesses had left her husband with no option but to contact each individual self-catering provider. That reduction in the quality of the visitor experience is compounded by the loss of potential income to VisitOrkney.</p><p>Sadly, that lady's experience is not unique, but VisitOrkney is not at fault. The team has worked exceptionally hard alongside the local industry and the council to deliver year-on-year improvement. Barbara Foulkes, who heads up the Orkney office, commands tremendous respect and has done a great deal to enhance Orkney's profile. However, we now have the ludicrous situation in which the head of the local office has no line management responsibility for anyone in that office. I can think of no other organisation that would tolerate, much less consider introducing, such a system of management.</p><p>Meanwhile, control over crucial marketing spend is held centrally. Orkney is an acknowledged destination for which passing tourist trade is understandably a limited feature of the market, so the inability to direct a sizeable proportion of the marketing budget will inhibit its ability to attract visitors. The loss of management accountability and control over marketing also runs the serious risk of demoralising staff.</p><p>In the past, the minister has assured me that tourism offices would remain in the islands following the restructuring of VisitScotland, but it is <place-holder colnum=\"11031\"/> questionable whether, without more control and accountability, the Orkney office can provide more than a name-plate and a place for tourists to shelter should the rain&#8212;and Ms Grahame&#8212;return.</p><p>The previous Scottish Executive took steps to restructure VisitScotland. It was a difficult and sometimes painful process that some local communities felt went too far; VisitScotland felt that ministers had not gone far enough. However, the proposals were considered over many months by an advisory group that was made up of a wide range of experts who examined all the evidence. That is precisely the sort of forum in which the minister would have his flip charts out in a jiffy before one could ask, \"So, Jim, what book have you been reading this week?\" By contrast, the present Government agreed to the demands of VisitScotland's management without any prior consultation. We are all now left rueing that decision, which has served only to add to Scottish tourism's growing pains.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14005179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other speakers, I congratulate the committee on its excellent report.

I welcome the new Labour team to their positions and am grateful to the cabinet secretary for the advance copy of his consultation document on the LFASS. I appear to have two copies of the document&#8212;I hope that I have not deprived another member of one.</p><p>I&#8212;like John Scott and Sarah Boyack&#8212;have not yet had an opportunity to consider the detail of the document. However, on the back of the publication in recent days of the SAC and RSE reports, I agree that this morning's debate is timely. Looking ahead, I hope that the cabinet secretary will agree to work with business managers to ensure that a debate is scheduled towards the end of the consultation period so that a more considered view can be taken about what possible changes to the LFASS might be made better to meet the needs of Scotland's farmers and crofters.</p><p>I appreciate that it is not yet clear whether new European regulations will come into effect from 2010. Nevertheless, the LFASS stakeholder group is right to say that consideration of what improvements could be made in terms of a second interim scheme is time well spent at this stage. Already, proposals have been made on development of the beef calf scheme. Like the cabinet secretary, I am aware of widespread concerns that the limited resources that the Government has at its disposal should be more effectively targeted at compensating those who are actively farming. Changes to land management options to improve take-up and even a recalibration of funds within the SRDP have been suggested. I know that the cabinet secretary and his officials will want to consider all those ideas in more detail&#8212;I think they also merit further discussion in the chamber, in due course.</p><p>Before turning to the amendment in my name, I will deal briefly with the amendments that have been lodged by the Labour and Tory parties. Sarah Boyack's amendment seems to retain the core elements of the Government's motion, on which there will be broad political agreement. However, her amendment introduces some helpful proposals, not least that of streamlining the application process. The cabinet secretary will recall representations that I made on that and the related problems of penalties and appeals even before I took on my current brief. I believe that more can be done in that area and that we may be able to draw on the experience of other member states. The Labour amendment also makes sensible suggestions in relation to public sector food procurement, before returning to the partnership approach that is also reflected in Mr <place-holder colnum=\"10936\"/> Lochhead's motion. On that basis, although we may disagree heartily with Labour on the detail of future reforms, we can support the Labour amendment.</p><p>Likewise, in a spirit of consensus, I have no difficulty with what the Tory amendment says. The UK Government's apparent determination to end direct support to producers after 2013 strikes me as being an act of blinkered industrial vandalism.</p><p>However, it is what the Tory addendum does not say that I find most surprising. It would be rash of me to burn my bridges with Mr Scott so early in my new role; nonetheless, I cannot but think that his addendum could as easily have been crafted by the little elves who are beavering away in the SNP resource centre. What has happened to the chest-beating bravura of Alex Johnstone and Ted Brocklebank, who in the days before the clandestine SNP-Tory coalition, demanded that ministers do things? Motions were lodged by those stout defenders of Scotland's farming industry, demanding that urgent action be taken. No doubt, they, too, were critical of what the UK Labour Government was or was not doing to safeguard the future of the sector. However, they focused on the job in hand in this Parliament&#8212;that of holding Scottish ministers to account. Not so the Tory addendum today&#8212;although John Scott set out several areas in which he will seek to press the Government&#8212;which seems to gloss over such niceties of the devolution settlement.</p><p>Moreover, although it is absolutely the case that ending pillar 1 support would deal a mortal blow to Scotland's farmers and crofters, the effect would not be confined to Scotland. The wording of the Tory amendment bears all the hallmarks of a nationalist rather than a unionist agenda.</p><p>I recognise and respect the concerns that the Government has in relation to the Liberal Democrat amendment; however, I do not believe that they represent an insurmountable obstacle to achieving what my amendment seeks to achieve. Legend has it that a member has not enjoyed the full chamber experience until Mike Russell has taken them to task in a winding-up speech. Although I am disappointed to note that I will be deprived of my baptism by bombast, I will nevertheless attempt to head the cabinet secretary off at the pass.</p><p>As all the speakers so far in the debate have rightly argued&#8212;and as was laid bare in the SAC and RSE reports&#8212;the decline in livestock farming is cause for serious concern. The economic, social and environmental impacts of the reduction in livestock numbers on our hills and islands should not be underestimated. Of course, the longer-term solution to the problem will be more complex and will involve fairly difficult choices, but the real and immediate problems that are created by the <place-holder colnum=\"10937\"/> spiralling costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser demand a more immediate response from the Government. I believe that steps can be taken to ease cash-flow difficulties for many of our most vulnerable farmers and crofters. At a time when we are hearing accounts of farmers selling breeding stock to pay bills, it is surely no exaggeration to say that we face a crisis and that urgent action is needed.</p><p>I appreciate that undertaking the work that is required to make LFASS payments&#8212;in advance, if not in full&#8212;by the end of October will create real pressures within the Government. Nevertheless, as we saw last year with the emergency ewe compensation payments, a scheme can be set up from scratch and payments can be made in remarkably short order. For all the imperfections of that welcome scheme, it was achieved without the database that exists already in relation to the LFASS. I do not accept&#8212;and nor does the NFUS&#8212;that a commitment to make LFASS payments by the end of October risks compromising disbursal of the more valuable single farm payment in December.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14004885", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Less Favoured Areas"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to speak in my first debate in my new role as the Liberal Democrats' environment and rural affairs spokesman.

As we head into the crucial period for livestock movements, the minister will be aware that the general livestock trailers&#8212;GLTs&#8212;and lairage facilities have been greatly welcomed by the farming community in my constituency.

I leave aside the U-turn that SNP ministers made after they came into office, but I was struck by comments that were made by one of their colleagues, Alyn Smith MEP, who recently bemoaned what he called the cottage industry in Scotland, whereby people are too willing to raise complaints with the Commission. I think that Mr Smith was right, so it was strange to discover that it was he who ensured that lifeline ferry services to my constituency have been put under the Commission's spotlight.

Like those of most members, my mailbag, surgeries and constituency meetings bear depressing testimony to the impact that high and spiralling fuel costs are having on individuals and households, and also on almost every small business. Added to the pressures created by a tight labour market, which inevitably pushes up the cost of attracting and retaining skilled staff in particular, the high cost of fuel has had a dramatic effect on business competitiveness. There is a case for saying that high fuel costs are likely to be with us for some time; there is even an argument that they present an opportunity&#8212;or at least a stimulus&#8212;for businesses to innovate. However, the short-term difficulties are serious; they should not, and cannot, be underestimated.</p><p>It is therefore not surprising that the small business bonus scheme has been welcomed.

In a round-table discussion on improving the budget process, Mr Neil expressed frustration at what he said was a fixation with throughputs. He demanded that greater attention be paid to measuring impacts and outcomes. He was right.

If so, it is one with which SNP ministers have become effortlessly familiar over the past year.</p><p>Small businesses face serious and wide-ranging difficulties. For example, red tape continues to be cited as a drag on business competitiveness, particularly for smaller businesses with less capacity to manage the weight of regulatory and other requirements. A report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in February highlighted the problem, suggesting that 52 per cent of Scots surveyed claimed that regulatory requirements had become more of a challenge to their business performance over the past year. It is therefore not surprising that figures released last week by the committee of Scottish clearing bankers showed a drop of more than 30 per cent in the number of businesses set up in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same period last year.</p><p>Businesses are also concerned by this Government's swingeing cuts to enterprise network budgets, and by the transfer of business gateway services away from Scottish Enterprise to local authorities. In the HIE area, the situation is even worse, with no arrangement yet in place for delivering the service.</p><p>On skills, the Government fails to impress. We await details of how the &#163;16 million skills agency will work. Meanwhile, its skills strategy was rejected by the Parliament in a vote in which, remarkably, the Tories summoned up the backbone to vote against their coalition partners.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats believe that the small business bonus scheme can help to safeguard the competitiveness of our small business sector. We agree that, as the Tory amendment says, steps must be taken to raise awareness of the scheme, but we know that if Government is to get the <place-holder colnum=\"9535\"/> biggest bang for its buck, it must have a clearer idea of what impact this and previous rate reductions are having on small businesses.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2102.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and calls on the Scottish Government to commission an independent assessment in 2010 of the impact and effectiveness of the current and previous administrations' business rate reduction measures.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13736303", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Small Business Bonus Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. Our amendment also provides the basis on which to address the concerns that underlie the Labour amendment.

There remains more than a suspicion that, as HBOS has said, ministers are more concerned with political dogma than with the efficient delivery of a major public investment programme that involves schools, hospitals and transport projects.</p><p>At least we have heard a grudging acceptance by the cabinet secretary that achieving the Government's stated objectives will require significant levels of private investment. Perhaps, in time, we will even get an acknowledgement that the private sector should expect to receive a return on such investment, or, in other words, that there will be&#8212;some of Mr Swinney's back-bench colleagues might wish to cover their ears at this point&#8212;private profit. Of course, the cabinet secretary knows that there will be private profit. In fairness, he probably has done for some time. However, for the sake of party unity, it remains the concept that hardly dare speak its name.</p><p>Progress has been made, nonetheless. In recent months, members of the Finance Committee have been treated to vintage Alex Neil as he has fulminated against PPP/PFI. In committee, he has not yet roused himself to the same lather of indignation that saw him denounce PPP/PFI to the <em>Sunday Herald </em>as \"morally criminal\", but he has left no one in any doubt about his desire to see PPP/PFI scrapped completely.</p><p>Sadly for Mr Neil, his script has been rewritten for him. Last week, Mr Swinney told an interested Finance Committee&#8212;and a presumably flabbergasted Mr Neil&#8212;that the preferred non-profit-distributing model was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"part of the family of public-private partnerships\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Finance Committee</em>, 27 May 2008; c578.]</p><p>Interestingly, in his statements last week and today, Mr Swinney erased all mention of PPP. <place-holder colnum=\"9441\"/></p><p>However, he is right&#8212;regardless of the doubts that Mr Neil might still harbour. NPD is part of what the Finance Committee has been told repeatedly in evidence-taking sessions is the evolution of PPP/PFI.</p><p>The witnesses who gave that evidence have been equally clear that PPP/PFI continues to have an important role to play. NPD, for all its undeniable benefits, will not be suitable in every case, notably where risks are high. The Government's decision to rule out PPP/PFI has already created disquiet and uncertainty in the private sector. Importantly, the decision also prevents the Government from securing best value for the taxpayer where the PPP/PFI model best fits the needs of the project.</p><p>Nowhere is that uncertainty more obvious or potentially damaging than in respect of the new Forth bridge. After more than a year in government, ministers appear to have absolutely no idea how they will fund the single largest and most iconic infrastructure project in Scotland. Alex Salmond's much vaunted&#8212;by him, at least&#8212;patriotic bond has been ruled out as illegal, which he must have known it would be when he made that promise. Further, as the Finance Committee has been told consistently, the NPD model is better suited to less risky projects. It is self-evidently not appropriate for the largest and most risky civil engineering project in Scotland for decades. Meanwhile, the cabinet secretary has failed to convince anyone that his idea of municipal bonds will swell to fill the void. That includes COSLA, which has described the futures trust proposals as \"a joke\".</p><p>Serious questions are now being asked about how the Government proposes to fund the new crossing. With a price tag of &#163;4 billion, there is growing suspicion that ministers will be forced down the route of tolling to make up the shortfall. At the weekend, the cabinet secretary told \"The Politics Show\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we've said we're not taking forward a proposal based on tolling\".</p><p>When that is added to his earlier statement in the chamber that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Government is against tolling\",&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>,19 December 2007; c 4553.]</p><p>it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Mr Swinney is softening us up for a U-turn.

It makes a number of reasonable points, as did Derek Brownlee, but it appears to amount to a resolute demand for the Government to \"see how things go&#8212;but keep us posted, will you?\" Mr Brownlee's willingness these days to offer a comforting embrace to Mr Swinney in his increasingly frequent hours of need is remarkable.

As has been suggested, like all of us, Mr Allan's motion is, sadly, starting to show its age. I was contacted at the end of last week by a constituent in Stronsay, who informed me that diesel on the island had now reached &#163;1.50 a litre. Eday and North Ronaldsay have traditionally enjoyed the dubious honour of having the highest fuel costs in the country, yet I was struck by the fate of my Stronsay constituent who is trying to hold down three part-time jobs, for which his vehicle is absolutely essential. Unlike in other parts of the country, on Stronsay and in Orkney as a whole, a vehicle is rarely a luxury; it is a necessity&#8212;for work, for getting to the shops, for accessing services or simply for playing an active role in community life. Overall, transport contributes significantly to the costs of living in my constituency.</p><p>In that context, it is deeply worrying that Orkney Islands Council has been forced to raise internal ferry fares to meet part of the cost of a further &#163;300,000 overspend arising from fuel cost increases. The minister is aware of the extent to which running Orkney Ferries already eats deep into OIC's resources. The council convener, Stephen Hagan, has written to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth to highlight the on-going financial difficulties. Ministers must respond urgently and positively. In his wisdom, the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change has chosen to spend &#163;22 million on a cheap ferry fare scheme for the Western Isles. I urge him to commit to using a fraction of that amount to ensuring that people who live in the north and south isles in my constituency are not disadvantaged further. I remind him that those are lifeline services.</p><p>The persistent and growing discrepancy between fuel costs in my constituency and those on the Scottish mainland penalises most unfairly those who live in remote and island communities. Petrol and diesel in Orkney are routinely 15p to 20p per litre more expensive than they are on the <place-holder colnum=\"9076\"/> mainland, which is unjustified, unacceptable and unsustainable. Of course, fuel duty is a reserved matter. Liberal Democrat Highlands and Islands members of Parliament have led the fight on the issue at Westminster in recent years. During the passage of successive Finance Bills, Alistair Carmichael and Danny Alexander have argued for a rural fuel discount scheme. They have tabled amendments to apply the European Union derogation that allows member states to charge differential rates of fuel duty in rural areas. As Alasdair Allan suggested, countries such as France, Greece and Portugal apply such differential rates. The UK Government even voted in favour of the French scheme, yet the Labour and Tory parties have united to frustrate the introduction of such a scheme in the UK.</p><p>The grotesque disparity in Scotland between fuel prices in urban areas and fuel prices in island and remoter communities requires urgent investigation. Again, Liberal Democrats have taken a lead. When Alistair Carmichael leads a delegation to meet UK Treasury ministers next week, he will again make the case for an urgent investigation into the huge difference in prices across the country. I was pleased that the First Minister offered his Government's support for such an investigation, when I raised the issue with him at First Minister's questions earlier this month. Perhaps when the minister winds up this debate, he will update the chamber on what action has been taken since that commitment was made.</p><p>Part of the delegation to the Treasury will include representatives of the National Farmers Union Scotland. The impact of higher fuel costs is being felt across the board in my constituency, but the farming and fishing industries, both of which are critical to sustaining the local economy in Orkney, are suffering particularly badly.</p><p>Tavish Scott highlighted the problems that are faced by the fishing sector. The fuel cost alone of a 10-day trip to Rockall for an Orkney trawler is around &#163;28,000. Such costs are impossible to pass on, and there is a risk that pressure will be put on more vulnerable fishing grounds closer to land.</p><p>In the farming sector, increased fuel costs are compounding other serious cost increases for feed, fertiliser and haulage. Although an immediate change in behaviour may not take place, serious thought is being given to rationalisation in the future. The consequences for Orkney, where farming accounts for more than 30 per cent of the local economy, cannot be overstated.</p><p>I congratulate Alasdair Allan on securing this important and timely debate. I urge Scottish ministers not only to maintain pressure on the UK Government, but to face up to their own <place-holder colnum=\"9077\"/> responsibilities and to consider the options that they have at their disposal.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13714106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Costs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Alasdair Allan on securing the debate and on his speech.

It amply illustrates the interest in and importance of the issue. As my colleagues have indicated, the Scottish Liberal Democrats welcome the consultation and the spirit of consensus. I agree with Alex Johnstone that this afternoon's debate has provided a useful opportunity for members to contribute to the process.</p><p>However, although we welcome the proposed bill and the consultation, we share with many others a concern about the Scottish ministers' determination to walk the talk in tackling climate change. That appears to be part of a growing concern about the Government's approach on a range of issues.</p><p>Earlier this afternoon, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth treated the Parliament to a rerun of the statement that he originally delivered at Heriot-Watt University last week on the shambolic Scottish futures trust. In describing an earlier performance by Mr Salmond on the same topic, Hamish McDonnell of <em>The Scotsman</em> stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ministers are slowly starting to find out the difference between the superficial and the easy&#8212;the populist issues&#8212;and the deeper, detailed and complicated policies which make a long term difference&#8212;the weighty issues.\"</p><p>That provides a perfect illustration of the problems that ministers face on the proposed bill.</p><p>Members should be in no doubt that, as David Stewart said, the proposed bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will see not only in the Parliament but in our lifetimes. It presents a unique opportunity to maintain Scotland's leadership within the UK and, notwithstanding Bill Wilson's rant about independence, will rightly be the focus of international attention, as Scottish Environment LINK made clear.</p><p>The proposed bill's headline target of an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 is ambitious, correct and achievable. Sadly, there is little evidence yet of how the Government will actually achieve it. For example, achieving the target will require annual reductions of 3 per cent, yet the Government U-turned on its earlier commitment to binding annual targets. That move has understandably been condemned across the environmental community as a betrayal of previous Scottish National Party commitments&#8212;an echo, perhaps, of the Scottish futures trust and other flagship policies.<place-holder colnum=\"9048\"/></p><p>The lack of binding annual targets and interim targets to map out what David Stewart called a reasonable trajectory will reduce the ability of the Government, public agencies and others to respond to events. I certainly do not advocate digging up the roots every year for an examination that could sidetrack Government from fulfilling its longer-term objectives but, as recent increases in fuel costs have demonstrated, predicting what will happen in the future is a notoriously difficult business. Not only that, but the Royal Society of Chemistry makes the valid point that the science of climate change is evolving rapidly and it is vital that flexibility remains to take account of the latest developments.</p><p>In other words, the Government needs to be ready to adapt and respond; it also needs to be accountable. Not only has it ditched its commitment to annual targets, but it is proposing five-yearly targets instead. Given the Parliament's four-year electoral cycle, that appears to be a brazen example of saying \"Not in my term of office.\" That will do nothing for accountability and risks undermining the Government's ability to stay the course and drive the behavioural changes to which Des McNulty, Rob Gibson and others referred.</p><p>The lack of detail is a source of serious concern. In February, Stewart Stevenson admitted to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee that the Government had</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not actually proposed any measures in the consultation\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee</em>, 5 February 2008; c 427.]</p><p>Consultations are helpful in eliciting a wide variety of views from expert, independent and other sources, but they should not be an excuse to abdicate responsibility for setting out a stall&#8212;not only a vision, but an understanding of how that vision is to be achieved. Without detail, it is not a vision; it is a fantasy.</p><p>A number of members have rightly pointed out the need for any emissions policy to be part of a cross-cutting approach. As the former future President of the United States, Al Gore, once said, it is not a magic bullet that is needed, but magic buckshot.</p><p>An energy strategy is key to achieving our objectives. In that context, it is scarcely credible that, as we approach June 2008, the Government has yet to propose a comprehensive and coherent energy strategy. In fact, although it has promised such a strategy since last summer, it is entirely possible that we will get to the summer recess this year still none the wiser about its overall intentions for meeting Scotland's future energy needs. In fact, we were told by sources earlier this year that the overall strategy had been downgraded to an overview. Since then, even that appears to have <place-holder colnum=\"9049\"/> been shelved and we are being told to expect a renewable energy action plan.</p><p>Like many others, I dutifully made my way to Aberdeen last week for the all-energy conference. The great, the good and the downright curious were gathered. The minister, Jim Mather, was allocated his slot and we all sat back to be wowed by the renewable energy action plan. Never have so many been so underwhelmed by so few. To call it a damp squib would be to seriously understate the moistness of squibs. It was a sad anticlimax at a time when, in my constituency, OpenHydro successfully connected the first tidal device to the national grid in the UK.</p><p>The fact that the Government has undertaken the consultation is welcome. The opportunity for Parliament to discuss the issues that it raises is also positive. As Alison McInnes said, it is to be hoped that the bill that is planned for the autumn will not slip further. However, there remain serious gaps in the approach that ministers have set out and serious concerns about their commitment&#8212;and, indeed, ability&#8212;to deliver. I hope that the minister and Government will take on board the views that have been expressed today and by a wide range of interested and expert bodies.

I dare say that Linda Fabiani will insist that that is all part of joined-up government. However, it is what the motion does not say that is most revealing about this minority Government's approach and its determination to stick to the Swinney mantra of downplaying independence at home while pursuing a narrow, partisan agenda overseas when the opportunity presents itself. There is no mandate for such an agenda: it does not command the support of the chamber and, more important, it commands little and diminishing support among the wider public in Scotland. The amendments that have been lodged by Iain Smith, Malcolm Chisholm and Ted Brocklebank address that concern, set the proper context and rectify what is surely an oversight on the part of the minister.</p><p>As with the Government's economic strategy that was launched last year, I found much in the framework with which I whole-heartedly agree. That is perhaps no surprise, as a great deal of the framework borrows heavily&#8212;indeed, as Malcolm Chisholm said, some of it is lifted directly&#8212;from the strategies that were adopted by the previous Executive, despite more of the minister's year zero rhetoric, highlighted by Iain Smith. For example, who can take issue with the need to develop a globally competitive and successful Scotland? Whatever has been done to date, I do not dispute the need for Scotland to do more to remove the barriers to attracting high-quality talent to Scotland and to take steps to retain the talent that we have already attracted by improving the integration of new Scots into our society, but the framework provides little by way of detail on how those laudable aspirations will be achieved.</p><p>Like other members&#8212;perhaps not including Shirley-Anne Somerville&#8212;I recall the less than fulsome endorsement that the SNP gave to the establishment of the fresh talent initiative when it was in Opposition. We remain in the dark as to how the Government intends that further success will be delivered&#8212;although I pay glowing tribute to Ms Somerville's personal endeavours.</p><p>Likewise, I welcome the recognition that major events such as Glasgow 2014 and the Ryder cup can be real drivers of economic growth. Building a lasting legacy from those events will not be straightforward, however, and will take more than warm words. Relentless focus and commitment will be required. In that regard, the Government's record on sportscotland does not bode well.<place-holder colnum=\"8324\"/></p><p>In acknowledging Scotland's financial services sector as a genuine success story of recent years, the framework may be stating the obvious, but it could have served a useful function if it had gone on to identify how the Government intends to support and develop that sector internationally.</p><p>The Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism talks incessantly about how he is getting various groups together in a room&#8212;sometimes rooms with mirrors, usually rooms with flip-charts but always rooms resounding to the echoes of brains being stormed. However, no group of stakeholders and no section of the business community or of academia have urged him or his ministerial colleagues to pack the passport and set off on a mission to talk up Scottish independence.</p><p>Scotland is distinct and our brand in overseas markets is strong, although perhaps not always as strong as we like to think. In sectors as diverse as tourism and life sciences, we have a first-class reputation that provides a solid foundation on which to build further success. Indeed, from ministerial visits overseas in which I participated, I know the positive perception and level of awareness that exists about what Scotland can offer. I remember one European deputy foreign minister&#8212;albeit that, I admit to Christopher Harvie, he was not Icelandic&#8212;who declared that he would give his right arm to be in Scotland's position. That strength of brand&#8212;of what Scotland is and what it can offer&#8212;is not diminished in any way by our being part of the United Kingdom. Indeed, that has enabled Scotland to have a presence and influence and generally to punch above its weight worldwide. Ted Brocklebank spoke learnedly about the extent to which that is an historic phenomenon.</p><p>In Opposition, SNP members were critical of ministerial visits abroad; in office, SNP ministers have overcome that aversion and even developed a bit of a taste for such visits. Where those involve the First Minister embarking on ego-trips to Brussels to promote his one-way national conversation to MEPs&#8212;who, perhaps in anticipation, had taken themselves off to Strasbourg&#8212;no useful purpose is served. Where a confusing message about Scotland's place in the UK and EU is promoted by a minority Administration that has no mandate to do so, active damage can be done.</p><p>Scotland achieved the status of European region of the future in 2004-05 and again for 2008-09. It was also northern Europe/UK region of the future in 2006-07. Those awards require clarity about our position in the UK and in the EU. Talk of independence and EU membership negotiations may play to the gallery at SNP conferences, but it works against the interests of Scotland and Scotland's economy. That fact cannot have <place-holder colnum=\"8325\"/> escaped SNP ministers as they have trotted the globe. The extent to which they have been able to draw on the resources, support and market intelligence of the UK's embassies and councils across the world must have driven that message home.</p><p>Within that context, Scottish Development International has a vital role to play. I have seen first hand the excellent work that SDI does for Scotland in key international markets. I know the value that is placed on that by Scottish businesses. That the Government has left the organisation without a permanent head for more than a year is deeply regrettable. For all its talk of clarity of visions and decisiveness, the Government's actions smack rather of dither and delay.</p><p>As Iain Smith said, the Government's decision to reduce higher education's resource funding in real terms next year is also likely to have an adverse impact on an area in which Scotland has enjoyed a competitive advantage overseas.</p><p>The Government's international framework and supporting strategies have much to commend them. They echo the approach of earlier documents, although they still require some fleshing out. However, the insidious pursuit overseas of an independence agenda causes confusion, damages our interests and has nothing to do with our country's aspirations and sense of ambition.</p><p>In the spirit of Schuman day, which I am grateful to Irene Oldfather for mentioning, I urge Linda Fabiani to think again.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13642948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion is in Linda Fabiani's name, but the reference to the need \"to extend, focus and align the actions and policies of the government and public sector partners\" surely betrays the invisible hand of the high priest of mind-mapping, Mr Mather.

In that I include Labour MSPs, many of whose colleagues at Westminster have been in open rebellion in recent weeks about certain aspects of the UK budget&#8212;albeit aspects of a budget that the same MPs were happy to endorse 12 months ago.</p><p>The motion correctly identifies a number of ways <place-holder colnum=\"8206\"/> in which the UK budget fails to address Scotland's needs properly, and I will come on to those shortly. We will doubtless hear suggestions from the SNP back-bench faithful that the shortcomings in the UK budget provide a compelling case for independence&#8212;for Scotland to be cut adrift from the rest of the UK&#8212;but that argument is grounded more in dogma than in logic. After all, with the help of the Tories, the SNP Government recently secured its own budget. I would contend that, in keeping with Mr Darling's inauspicious debut, and despite what the cabinet secretary himself said earlier this afternoon, Mr Swinney's budget also failed to address many of the needs of Scotland and of the Scottish people. However, I readily concede that the cabinet secretary delivered his budget with a great deal more style. I trust that Mr Swinney will not consider that to be damning by faint praise.</p><p>The motion is justified and measured and identifies most of the key failings of the UK budget. Derek Brownlee outlined the reasons why the debate serves another useful purpose.

Oddly, it has taken rather longer for David Cameron and, indeed, Labour back benchers to <place-holder colnum=\"8207\"/> summon up sufficient indignation to come out against the move.</p><p>Now, the Prime Minister has said that he is sorry, and that his Government is listening and learning&#8212;a triumph of sorts after 11 years in government. However, the issue has provided further evidence of how out of touch the Prime Minister is, how his indecision and dithering are undermining any residual credibility his Government has, and how ineffective or even damaging has been his obsession with endlessly tinkering with the tax and benefits system. In a Scottish context, the effects of that have been particularly acutely felt, reflecting, perhaps, wage levels in Scotland&#8212;not least in my own constituency&#8212;compared with those in other parts of the UK.</p><p>In a desperate attempt to stave off rebellion, concessions have been offered to help mitigate the effects of scrapping the 10p tax rate. So far, the rebellion has been quelled, but the mess has yet to be cleared up effectively, and we have no details. For example, Help the Aged has identified female pensioners aged between 60 and 64 as being at risk of paying more as a result of the chancellor's actions&#8212;or inaction&#8212;in the budget. The additional tax that they might end up paying could be as much as &#163;180.</p><p>As we have come to expect, the UK budget in March was unveiled amid a great fanfare of rhetoric about poverty and redistribution. However, the substance failed to justify the billing, particularly in relation to poverty.</p><p>Last month, Liberal Democrats initiated a debate in the chamber on fuel poverty. Members across the parties rightly expressed concern about the dramatic rise in the number of households that are now paying more than 10 per cent of their income for fuel. I was delighted that Parliament endorsed the Liberal Democrat proposals for a one-stop-shop approach to tackling fuel poverty.

Mr Brown talks constantly of taking the right long-term decisions, but the decision to increase the winter fuel allowance for only one year looks, for all the world, like a short-term gimmick. Not surprisingly, Age Concern is not impressed. In the context of rapidly escalating fuel prices and their impact across the board on the cost of living, particularly for some of the most vulnerable in our communities, the budget was a grave disappointment.</p><p>In my constituency, where paying &#163;1.30 a litre for diesel is already a distant, almost fond, memory, the problems are being felt most severely. A colder climate, a longer heating season and generally poorer-quality housing all contribute to a deeply disturbing situation, which will not be alleviated by a one-off increase in winter fuel payments that have already been more than swallowed up by recent increases in fuel prices.</p><p>In the area of child poverty, too, the UK budget has failed to deliver, with serious consequences here in Scotland. It is now fairly clear that the target of halving child poverty by 2010 will not be achieved. By investing less than a third of the amount that is required to halve child poverty, the UK Government has, in effect, abandoned its own target. The modest changes that have been announced to child benefit and child tax credits are further examples of a failure properly to walk the walk.</p><p>The motion highlights other shortcomings, notably on the rate of corporation tax for small businesses and alcohol duty. Those are both important issues, not least given the proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Scottish economy and the well-documented importance of our whisky industry.</p><p>However, I turn to the difficulties in the housing market. The market in Scotland is proving to be more resilient than the market further south, but Scots have not been entirely abstemious during the recent debt binge. As well as consumer debt, there is estimated to be &#163;74 billion of loans secured on dwellings in Scotland. That is almost three times the Scottish Government's budget. UK <place-holder colnum=\"8209\"/> ministers cannot be held responsible for the irresponsible behaviour of some lenders and, indeed, some borrowers, but there is public interest in averting a wave of repossessions and an overcorrection in the market.</p><p>The motion and our amendment raise legitimate grievances about the approach that the UK Government has taken in its budget. Those grievances are shared north and south of the border. The Tory amendment, however, betrays the now trademark Cameronian opportunism. When Labour brought in taper relief, the Tories dismissed it as a dog's breakfast. Now, it seems that Mr Brownlee and his colleagues are only too happy to tuck their snouts into that breakfast, dismissing Lord Lawson orthodoxy in favour of the dubious radicalism of Geoffrey Robinson.</p><p>When business organisations bemoan a missed opportunity and Scottish trade union leaders criticise UK ministers' failure to address the disproportionate tax burden on low-paid workers, it is fair to suggest that the UK Government's budget has failed to deliver.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-1814.2, to insert after \"10p tax rate\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"deplores the continued failure of the UK Government to provide an adequate package of measures to help families affected by the falling housing market and the absence of sufficient budget provision for the alleviation of child poverty\".</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403640", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Kingdom Budget"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Patrick Harvie makes a number of interesting points, but I point out that my colleague, Alistair Carmichael, has made strenuous efforts over a number of years to press the case for differentials in fuel duty, recognising the punitive impact in parts of the country, including Orkney&#8212;my constituency&#8212;where the price of fuel has long been far greater than elsewhere.

As a result of that membership, I have sons who have a healthy fascination with castles and a rather unhealthy determination to never knowingly be underarmed.</p><p>This afternoon's debate has been a good one. There have been many thoughtful speeches. Helen Eadie's points about disability and access were pertinent. Most speakers, though not all, have paid eloquent testimony to the importance and breadth of the work that is carried out by Historic Scotland. I associate myself with Ted Brocklebank's remarks about the historic concordat, although his reference to the inadequate budget of Historic Scotland leads me to question why the Tories were so keen to support the Government's budget from such an early stage.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister acknowledged the extent to which she is developing work that was put in train by the previous Executive, under Malcolm Chisholm and Patricia Ferguson, and I welcome her announcement on funding and the organisational changes that will, I hope, bear dividends.</p><p>Like others, I will talk about examples in my constituency, in which Historic Scotland is an exceptionally important player. The heart of Neolithic Orkney is one of only three world heritage sites in Scotland, and acts as a magnet for the thousands of tourists who come to Orkney each year. Not for nothing has the Lonely Planet described Orkney as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a glittering centrepiece in Scotland's treasure chest of attractions.\"</p><p>Historic Scotland's stewardship of Skara Brae, Maeshowe and other sites in Orkney is a critical factor in helping the islands maintain and develop the quality of the tourism experience. Of course, Skara Brae, the ring of Brodgar and Maeshowe are also at the heart of Orkney's unrivalled <place-holder colnum=\"7829\"/> archaeological heritage. They not only attract tourists to the islands, but provide archaeologists from the United Kingdom and across the world with invaluable hands-on experience and a unique opportunity to gain an insight into what life was like 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm might be able to lay claim to having the constituency that contains the most listed buildings, but farmers in my constituency have suggested to me&#8212;sometimes with a degree of exasperation&#8212;that they can barely stick a spade in the ground anywhere in Orkney without the risk of unearthing some archaeological artefact. Although we feel blessed, such an abundance of archaeological riches is not without its challenges. However, I believe that they can be managed in a way that prevents damaging conflict between farming and archaeological interests, which is something that I have taken up with the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment.</p><p>That abundant resource has enabled Orkney College to develop a first-class archaeology course framework, including PhDs, which will serve the University of the Highlands and Islands well in the future.</p><p>Historic Scotland's work in Orkney is vital and the organisation interacts well with the council. As the minister quite rightly pointed out, excellent joint work is already under way. Crucially, Historic Scotland also interacts well with VisitOrkney, businesses in the local tourism sector and others.</p><p>There has been a great deal to commend in recent years. For example, I know that the ranger service that is operated by Historic Scotland is extremely popular and greatly valued in Orkney. That service, which is run by astonishingly dedicated and informed people, has helped to develop understanding and appreciation of what Orkney has to offer, among Orcadians as well as tourists. Such is the appetite for finding out more about Orkney's archaeological heritage that Radio Orkney dedicates a regular programme to the subject, fronted by the irrepressible and hugely impressive Caroline Wickham Jones. An improvement in interpretation and facilities at Skara Brae has opened up new opportunities for people visiting the site. Rob Gibson made some good points about the importance of good interpretation.</p><p>Although I do not wish to decry that in any way, we need a sensible debate about capacity and the extent to which Skara Brae and other Historic Scotland sites in Orkney&#8212;and, I suspect, elsewhere&#8212;can continue to withstand the sort of footfall that there has been in recent years. The figures that Historic Scotland released earlier this week boasted, quite rightly, of impressive increases in the numbers of people visiting the <place-holder colnum=\"7830\"/> sites, including Skara Brae. However, careful attention needs to be paid to how those numbers are being managed and the steps that are being taken to maintain the quality of the experience for tourists and the fabric of the sites themselves.</p><p>My colleague Iain Smith highlighted concerns about the way in which Historic Scotland designates listed buildings and scheduled monuments. That can, as he made clear, have the perverse effect of blighting an area by preventing sensible and sensitive development of the building in question. I know from my dealings with Historic Scotland staff locally of the genuine commitment and efforts that they make to work collaboratively with others in the best interests of the islands. However, whether by design or oversight, Historic Scotland has yet to persuade me that it has fully grasped what is involved in being part of a genuine partnership with local communities. Its statutory role and the undoubted expertise of its staff do on occasions appear to blinker it to the views, and sometimes even the rights, of local stakeholders, although I would not go quite as far as John Farquhar Munro's comments in that respect.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Scotland and Local Authorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Patricia Ferguson and Willie Coffey, I declare an interest as a member of Historic Scotland.

First, we had promises of cuts in everyone's bills, with a larger rebate for pensioners, irrespective of their ability to pay. The Tories' next position was that only pensioners would benefit from their largesse. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies exposed their plans as not benefiting the poorest pensioners at all, but instead targeting most resources on the richest 10 per cent of pensioners. The Tories' latest wheeze is to propose an across-the-board cut for all council tax payers, again despite the fact that that would target more resources on the more well off and would fail those who are least able to pay.</p><p>Labour is wedded to the council tax, despite Andy Kerr's suggestion that it is a bad tax, and the Tories refer to it as being \"as fair a tax as you'll find\". Richard Baker and Joe FitzPatrick raised the issue of tax and popularity, which are not natural bedfellows, but it is true to say that the council tax was recently voted the most hated tax.

Such difficulties have been made worse by recent <place-holder colnum=\"6912\"/> failures to carry out free central heating installations in a timely fashion. Those difficulties have not been helped by the continued unwillingness of UK ministers to consider a reduced fuel levy for remoter parts of the country.</p><p>Like other members, I know of older constituents who are choosing not to turn on their heating systems for fear of the bills that they might run up. The consequences of such action do not bear contemplating, not least when one considers that almost 3,000 deaths a year are already linked to people living in cold, damp housing. Such statistics are not in dispute, and nor is the political will across the Parliament to look at how we can address the problem, drawing on the lessons that have been learned to date.</p><p>Fuel poverty will continue to dodge any single magic bullet. That is why Liberal Democrats are challenging the Scottish Government to develop a one-stop-shop approach to tackling fuel poverty. Bringing together the warm deal, the central heating programme and the Scottish community and householder renewables initiative with effective advice services would make a real difference. That would make it quicker and easier to increase the installation of energy efficiency measures, such as better insulation, efficient central heating systems, microgeneration systems and smart meter technology. All those measures would not only save households money, but improve health and contribute to tackling climate change.</p><p>To achieve those outcomes, we believe that the Government should re-establish the fuel poverty forum, which should take the lead in developing a more joined-up approach that harnesses political consensus and drives concerted action. There should probably be a review of fuel poverty programmes first.</p><p>Under Nicol Stephen's leadership, Scottish Liberal Democrats are proud of playing a leading role in efforts to increase energy efficiency and promote microrenewables&#8212;both measures that can dramatically cut fuel bills for families in Scotland. However, we must do more. We call on the Government to make the installation of microgeneration schemes an easier and more attractive option for households. Planning rules need to be changed to remove one of the main obstacles to micropower installation, and we look forward to the Government taking swift action on the back of the consultation that has been launched.</p><p>We believe that using the local taxation levers that we have at our disposal is key. Evidence from elsewhere in the UK suggests that such incentives are tangible and therefore effective. I know that the minister has reservations about their use, but I hope that he will agree to consider seriously how <place-holder colnum=\"6913\"/> such incentives, along with a range of other measures, might be made to work in the interests of increasing energy efficiency and reducing fuel poverty. In an otherwise acceptable SNP amendment, we need greater clarity on that point.</p><p>In their amendment, the Tories have sought to plagiarise our motion&#8212;I suppose that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&#8212;but they remain coy about energy companies' profits and unambitious about local tax incentives. The Labour amendment is an addendum to our motion and strengthens it in the key area of money advice and energy advice.</p><p>In preparing for this morning's debate, I was not hard pressed to find any number of startling facts and figures. As I said, some of them are deeply depressing in 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland. However, I was struck by the clarion call from Energy Action Scotland's director Norman Kerr in the organisation's most recent edition of its quarterly journal, <em>Energy Review</em>. Although he acknowledges many successes over recent years, he expressed genuine disappointment that his organisation is still around to celebrate its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year.</p><p>I hope that all members will join me in committing to do what we can in this parliamentary session and beyond to create the conditions for making Norrie Kerr redundant. That would be a P45 worth celebrating. The Liberal Democrat motion today sets out a broad-based approach that can best achieve that worthwhile objective.

That has helped to address issues ranging from development constraints to the higher quality and environmental standards to which Mr McNulty referred. Scottish Water has progressed to the point where conversion into a mutual company can be achieved in a way that is beneficial both to the consumer and to the taxpayer.

Those of us who sat through the full three hours of stage-managed drama yesterday have cause to feel that more than most, so I commend Mr Swinney for putting in yet another opening and closing shift. It is tempting to ask what reservations he has about the competence of his deputies, when today they are not even allowed to sit on the front bench with him.</p><p>The tone of today's debate could not be more different from that of yesterday's debate on the budget, as epitomised by Derek Brownlee's offer to Andy Kerr at the outset of his speech of what looked like an olive branch&#8212;although, as I am no gardener, it could have been poison ivy. However, as members have rightly pointed out, this debate is important. We are debating the vital delivery of a wide range of key local services throughout the country. In previous debates, and again today, Liberal Democrats have indicated our support for the principle of further lifting local government finance ring fencing. We believe that the principle of increasing the power of local councils and councillors to make decisions about how best to meet the needs of those whom they are elected to serve is sound, but applying that principle in practice is not always straightforward, as I am sure the cabinet secretary would concede.</p><p>It is not good enough for Government ministers simply to denounce as scaremongering the concerns that a range of bodies that support some of the most vulnerable in our communities have raised. As I mentioned in yesterday's debate&#8212;I reiterate this for Bob Doris's benefit&#8212;whether or not someone is scaremongering appears to <place-holder colnum=\"6040\"/> depend on which party or organisation they represent, rather than which concerns they express.</p><p>Ministers need to acknowledge that there is genuine uncertainty and concern among many groups. In my constituency, those who are involved in supporting people with mental health issues are particularly apprehensive about the consequences of the budget and the settlement. That is a fact. At a different time, however, that point would have been trumpeted in full technicolour glory by many of the members who are now sitting on the Government benches.</p><p>It may be that some of the concerns that have been expressed are part of the natural process of positioning with local government and of ensuring that councils resist any temptation to divert funds away from specific local services. I entirely accept that, in many cases, concerns will be allayed in due course. However, the absence of a clear sense of how the single outcome agreements will operate is fuelling those concerns. Derek Brownlee and Tavish Scott, among others, spoke about that.</p><p>Ministers are overfond of heralding the \"historic concordat\" with local government, but it is the way in which the single outcome agreements function&#8212;how councils manage the almost inevitable tension between meeting real local priorities and delivering the Government's grand manifesto promises&#8212;that will provide the true test of the concordat's historic significance. Derek Brownlee was right to highlight the recommendations that the Finance Committee made in its budget process report, to which the Government's response was rather curmudgeonly, as it was to other recommendations that were made to it.</p><p>Back in December, when Mr Swinney first made an announcement on the settlement, I made it clear that, for all the spin and assertion, I did not believe that a proper judgment could be made then, nor even in February, when councils take decisions on their budgets. With due respect to the now absent Lord Foulkes, an objective assessment will be made over the longer term. Our concerns are now on record.</p><p>I accept that local authorities, in keeping with many other bodies, will always say that more money is needed, almost irrespective of the generosity of the settlement. However, ministers will be aware of the concerns in my constituency about the disparity in the level of funding for Orkney compared with other island authorities. It will not surprise ministers that the settlement for the next three years, which effectively locks in and exacerbates that disparity, has been met with anger by many of my constituents.<place-holder colnum=\"6041\"/></p><p>I tackled Rory Mair of COSLA on that point when he appeared before the Finance Committee in December. I asked him about the timeframe for taking forward work to unwind the disparity in funding per head of population between the island authorities. In response, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Examining the distribution mechanism is such a huge issue that we have said to the Government that we need to give councils certainty of funding for the next three years. We must work during that period to prepare plans.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Finance Committee</em>, 4 December 2007; c 179.]</p><p>I would welcome an assurance from the cabinet secretary&#8212;as would Orkney Islands Council and my constituents&#8212;that he will do everything in his power to ensure that those plans are drawn up as a matter of urgency.</p><p>In the meantime, there is the not insignificant matter of the &#163;1 million for Orkney's internal transport needs, which has been raised with the cabinet secretary by me and by the convener of Orkney Islands Council, Stephen Hagan. I know that the cabinet secretary has undertaken to review the situation. I hope that, if not in winding up the debate in the very near future, he can provide some reassurance that the reduction in Orkney's budget will be reversed. Without that &#163;1 million, critical lifeline ferry and air services to some of the remotest and most fragile communities in my constituency are at risk.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe that there are many positive aspects to the settlement. The reduction in ring fencing is welcome, as is the flexibility that it will provide councils. However, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about its implementation and immediate impacts. There are few answers for councils on the missing millions from the waste fund, on the management of funding to tackle flooding and on a viable legal alternative to public-private partnerships that will enable schools throughout Scotland to continue to be built and refurbished. There is also uncertainly about the single outcome agreements and how the Government intends to spin its way out of the hole that it has dug by promising smaller class sizes while not delivering a single extra penny to fund that pledge. As we have heard from many members, there are real concerns throughout Scotland that local government is looking down the barrel of damaging cuts to services.</p><p>The Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008 is not without its good points, therefore Liberal Democrats will not oppose it.

I take Cathy Peattie's point about radio coverage, but BBC Scotland's decision not to film and broadcast this year's Celtic Connections event&#8212;after having done so for the past couple of years&#8212;is an unwelcome and retrograde step.</p><p>It is arguable that Celtic Connections has established itself as a premier event in the traditional music calendar. It goes from strength to strength. I should declare an interest in that my brother, Fionn, plays fiddle in The Chair, which has performed at Celtic Connections for the past two years. The band picked up a Danny Kyle award in 2007 and has just released its first album.<place-holder colnum=\"5916\"/></p><p>There is a strong case for saying that our vibrant music and festival scene would benefit from the wider exposure that only the broadcast media can provide. That has certainly been the case with the BBC's coverage of festivals such as T in the Park and rock Lomond. Of course, the quality of the broadcast is essential. Some people suggest that coverage of, for example, the Cambridge folk festival did not do justice to the atmosphere and feel of that event. It takes resources to achieve the necessary quality but, given the economic, social and cultural importance of the trad music awards and other events in the now busy music calendar, there is a strong case for committing those resources.</p><p>I congratulate Rob Gibson on securing a useful debate and look forward to other members' speeches. I hope that tonight's debate will help to make the case for providing more support and&#8212;it is an important point&#8212;more exposure for the traditional music industry in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Trad Music Awards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Rob Gibson on securing the debate.

It is a shame that in government he has succeeded in reducing the transparency that he and other MSPs at the time sought and subsequently secured.</p><p>As Tavish Scott and others have said, that view is shared by all the Parliament's committees. They all found that their scrutiny work was hampered by a lack of detail in key policy areas. It was echoed by the Finance Committee, which criticised Mr Swinney's unilateral rewriting of the agreement&#8212;the historic concordat&#8212;between the Finance Committee and the Government on the budget process. Councillor Pat Watters may wish to note the respect that the Government has shown for that historic concordat.</p><p>The Centre for Public Policy for Regions also takes the same view, so it is no surprise that Parliament has agreed that there needs to be a thoroughgoing review of the budget process. Liberal Democrats believe that the review should consult widely and, if possible, make recommendations ahead of the next budget process. The cabinet secretary's earlier commitment to co-operate with the review was helpful.</p><p>The lack of detail on the cash-releasing efficiency savings is alarming&#8212;Des McNulty made some interesting points about that. They account for &#163;1.6 billion, which is critical to enabling the Government to meet its spending commitments but, as Tavish Scott mentioned, we still have next to no detail on how, where and when the efficiencies will be made. All we have is 281 words in a technical note. Should the Government and the rest of the public sector fall short of the challenging savings targets, it is not at all clear what the consequences will be, where the cuts will fall, and how more of the SNP Government's promises will start to unravel.</p><p>We heard a great deal in the aftermath of the election last May about the SNP's plan to work consensually with other parties. The First Minister was at pains to point out that, as a minority Government in a Parliament of minorities, he was committed to a new style of collaborative working. As he has found that highly problematic even in his own party at times, Mr Salmond's claim <place-holder colnum=\"5362\"/> perhaps stretched credibility, but he has been as good as his word: he has found a new way of working.

They are evidence too of the accepted need for Scotland to <place-holder colnum=\"5138\"/> work co-operatively within a UK as well as a European and international framework.</p><p>Of course, publication of the UK bill triggered a predictable round of name calling between London and Edinburgh over nuclear power, some of which has been echoed this morning. The Liberal Democrats have made clear our opposition to an energy source that we believe is unwanted, unsafe and uneconomic. UK Labour ministers have now conceded that public and political opinion in Scotland will not tolerate new nuclear power stations in this country. The cabinet secretary was quick to claim credit for that. As Lewis Macdonald pointed out, such self-aggrandisement from the Government is not unusual, except perhaps a little in the case of the usually modest and reasonable Mr Swinney.</p><p>As Alasdair Allan conceded, political opposition to new nuclear build does not readily respect party boundaries. Despite Scottish National Party proclamations, I would suggest that the prospect of new nuclear power stations in Scotland has been off the agenda for some time. However, it has allowed for sabre rattling by Administrations north and south of the border. More gratifyingly, it has even allowed the Tories to step out from under the skirts of their SNP coalition partners and flex their unionist muscles again&#8212;just a wee stretch, mind&#8212;before returning to the folds of the nationalist skirts in time to vote through the budget next month.</p><p>Let us be clear. Last week's publication of the UK Energy Bill means that the nuclear boat has sailed&#8212;if that is not too alarming a prospect for those already concerned about ship-to-ship transfers. There are more immediate priorities, in relation to which concerted action can help to deliver the low-carbon society we all want. Scottish ministers have been consistent in recognising the significant progress made by the previous Scottish Executive&#8212;as outlined by Lewis Macdonald&#8212;in promoting and developing Scotland's world-class renewables potential; in stimulating microrenewables; and in beginning to address the fundamental issue of energy efficiency, as raised by Patrick Harvie. The Government has rightly acknowledged that there is a solid and encouraging foundation on which to build. The national planning framework, published last week, can help in that respect, not least in identifying the national importance of grid infrastructure.</p><p>The challenge now for ministers is to take that national framework and make it flesh. Identifying the priority projects was relatively straightforward, but finding a way of delivering those priorities&#8212;including grid improvements&#8212;will be the true test of the Government. Grid improvements are crucial to unlocking Scotland's world-leading potential in <place-holder colnum=\"5139\"/> marine renewables&#8212;a subject close to my heart, to which I will return shortly. However, realising such potential is still a number of years off, notwithstanding the remarkable progress that has been made in Orkney and elsewhere in Scotland over recent years, and will happen only if the confidence of the industry is not undermined in the meantime.</p><p>Onshore wind is the proven technology. It remains the best means of providing the bridge to the low-carbon future to which we aspire. Consistency in supporting onshore wind&#8212;financially and through timely decisions on consent applications&#8212;will be essential. Offshore wind will enjoy an increasing prominence, particularly as issues of maintenance are resolved, but it is simplistic to assume that those developments will simply come to replace onshore projects in the foreseeable future. Both technologies are key to us achieving our renewables ambitions.</p><p>That will require leadership&#8212;not only industry leadership but political leadership. In opposition, the signals from the SNP were not good. We heard calls for taxes on wind farms. A moratorium was mooted. Some aspiring SNP MSPs were even moved to demand local referenda on wind farm developments&#8212;another creative way, presumably, of managing the planning process. Post election, the tone has thankfully changed. Even local referenda have been quietly ditched&#8212;a straw in the wind, perhaps, with regard to other referendum plans?</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "With the publication last week of the United Kingdom Government's Energy Bill, the debate is timely.

That has been quietly dropped since the election.</p><p>Concerns about intermittency will always be raised in relation to wind&#8212;on or offshore. There is perhaps no single magic bullet here, but a range of options are worth considering. The minister has identified a number. For example, Liberal Democrats believe that biomass has considerable potential. As Lewis Macdonald said, FREDS has carried out valuable work in that area and many others, but barriers to fully developing and exploiting Scotland's potential in biomass&#8212;both small-scale, local projects of the kind to which Gavin Brown referred, and larger plants that could, <place-holder colnum=\"5140\"/> in time, come to help address base-load issues&#8212;still need to be removed.</p><p>Likewise, further investment in developing Scotland's potential for clean coal and carbon capture&#8212;both pre and post combustion&#8212;is essential. The costs are likely to be considerable, but the potential return could be dramatic. In key markets such as China, such technology and expertise place Scotland in an enviable position to derive significant economic benefit from major environmental breakthroughs. Indeed, Liberal Democrats want more attention to be paid to the issue of storage, which remains a vital enabler in helping Scotland harness our renewables potential.</p><p>In the development of marine energy technologies, Scotland enjoys a competitive edge&#8212;due in no small part to the efforts of Jim Wallace and Nicol Stephen in government&#8212;but as well as resolving the outstanding grid and transmission issues, more impetus must be given to efforts to bring forward the date by which such technologies can start to make a meaningful contribution to our energy mix. Double ROCs would provide a powerful signal, but more capital funding is essential to help scale up pilot initiatives. As our amendment suggests, Liberal Democrats believe that the enterprise networks can continue to play an important facilitating role in that process. We want renewables to remain a priority for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, both of which must be resourced to meet that challenge.</p><p>Our amendment highlights the importance of microrenewables. Progress in that area has been slow, despite significant investment, but the bill proposed by Sarah Boyack offers a sensible way of injecting real momentum into efforts to extend take-up of microrenewables. I know that ministers are cautious about supporting the bill, but I would urge them to rethink.</p><p>Of course, as well as microrenewables and energy efficiency, Sarah Boyack's proposed bill addresses fundamental issues of fuel poverty. Tackling fuel poverty will require a broad approach from Government and others. Therefore, it is disappointing that the UK Energy Bill makes no reference to smart metering. The Government should make representations to fast track that technology and ensure that it is rolled out by 2015.</p><p>Another area in which the UK Energy Bill seems to fall short is heat. There is growing acceptance of the importance of heat in the energy debate and of the need to decarbonise heat and provide renewable sources of it.</p><p>It is difficult to address all aspects of the debate in a little more than seven minutes. More localised generation, combined heat and power and small <place-holder colnum=\"5141\"/> hydroelectric power all have an important role to play. There is now overwhelming political and scientific consensus on the existence of, risks from and man's contribution to climate change. The Stern report and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have left no room for dispute about the need for action. There remains a genuine and legitimate debate about the hows, but I hope that it does not deflect us from using the levers that are at our disposal to make the changes that evidently need to be made to create a low-carbon economy and society.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-1152.1, to insert after \"fossil fuels\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"microgeneration and biomass; acknowledges the important role of the enterprise networks in helping to achieve this and the need for renewables to remain a priority for a well-resourced Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and further recognises the central importance of\".</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was drawing attention to the fact that the SNP found a neat way of circumventing the planning process by urging local referenda.

Back in May 2007, with perhaps unconvincing humility, the First Minister talked of a minority Government in a Parliament of minorities. He called on politicians of all parties to work together on issues on which there was agreement. He promised that he and his ministers would propose and discuss their changes in seeking parliamentary approval. The subsequent eight months have shown that that was not uncharacteristic humility from the First Minister, but rather trademark hubris.</p><p>The budget is the most opaque that we have had since the Parliament was established. Elaine Murray mentioned the views of the Centre for Public Policy Research, which has criticised the lack of detail and transparency&#8212;detail and transparency that the Parliament and its committees fought for and secured in recent years. SNP ministers have been hauled before committees that have desperately sought greater clarity on the Government's intentions, but in many cases to little avail. As Iain Gray said, we even had a situation in which the Finance Committee was forced to write to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth to demand a greater level of detail&#8212;detail that was readily and timeously provided by Mr Swinney's predecessors.</p><p>Change is required. Following the debate last November, the Liberal Democrats believe that the review by the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee needs to be taken forward urgently. It must involve not just other parliamentary committees but wider civic Scotland, and it should consider the timescale, content and nature of the budget process. All of that should be done so that the Parliament is in a position to consider, debate and adopt recommendations in time for them to be implemented before the budget process in 2009-10. I hope that there is genuine political consensus on that.</p><p>The lack of clarity in the Government's spending proposals has been well documented. However, I highlight an area of particular concern to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Swinney has set the Government and the public sector efficiency targets, which are generally accepted to be challenging. There is almost certainly political consensus, if not unanimous support, for the need to make the public sector as efficient as possible <place-holder colnum=\"4911\"/> and focused on delivering high-quality services to the people of Scotland. However, to date we have seen precious little detail about how the Government intends or expects to achieve those efficiencies. Given the extent to which Mr Swinney's spending plans depend on achieving the &#163;1.6 billion efficiencies, that is a cause for real concern. What are the implications if, for example, only &#163;1.4 billion savings are achieved? How and where will the cuts fall?</p><p>Mr Swinney has been clear that his target relates to cash-releasing savings. However, on \"Newsnight Scotland\" last night, his colleague Stewart Maxwell insisted that time-saving efficiencies were as important as those that release actual cash. Granted, Mr Maxwell was desperately trying to spin himself out of having to admit that he had just performed a spectacular, albeit welcome, U-turn on the retention of sportscotland. Nevertheless, his remarks and indeed the ditching of SNP plans to abolish sportscotland throw into stark relief the lack of clarity about the Government's intentions. They also seem to betray a total confusion in Government about how it will achieve its efficiency target.</p><p>This has been a useful debate. It has demonstrated again the failure of the Government to deal in an open and transparent fashion with the Parliament, and it has laid bare the constraints on Parliament in holding this minority Government to account. Liberal Democrats want the situation reviewed and rectified as a matter of urgency.

The judgment on whether the First Minister's bombastic assertion has any credibility will take a little longer to make.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis highlighted how Mr Swinney and his colleagues take great satisfaction in waving around in the chamber their concordat with COSLA. From observation, the concordat often appears to be the only piece of paper in his briefing folder on which Mr Salmond can lay his hands during First Minister's question time. However, Liberal Democrats have no difficulty with the concept of freeing up local authorities to take more responsibility and more control over decisions that affect the people whom they are elected to serve.</p><p>I turn to the council tax freeze. No one wants to pay more tax, although Derek Brownlee deviated a bit from the Cameronian mantra in appearing to call for council tax cuts&#8212;even David Cameron now seems to appreciate that tax cuts at the expense of local services are not good politics. As Andy Kerr and Tavish Scott pointed out, the concern is the lack of detail to date on what moneys have been transferred to councils as part of the deal. There remain serious questions as to whether the council tax freeze is fully funded. In his evidence to the Finance Committee in Dundee on Monday, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth suggested that he had erred on the side of generosity. Time will tell whether <place-holder colnum=\"4507\"/> that is the case: if it is not, the cuts in local services may be deep and painful.</p><p>As Gavin Brown said, what has been of truly historic proportions is the Government's spin operation, which has been most impressive throughout. I do not deny that Governments need to get their message across and to set their decisions in context, but time and again over recent weeks, COSLA representatives have had to clarify what they intend to deliver and, importantly, not deliver under the terms of the historic concordat.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis highlighted the inconsistencies in ministerial statements on education. For all the warm words about parity of esteem and a marriage of equals, the reality seems to be somewhat different. Ministers appear to have a gun to the heads of local councils in case they fail to agree to everything that the Government wants, and they are busy telling councils where their efficiency savings should be spent&#8212;not on local priorities, of course, but on uncosted and undeliverable SNP manifesto pledges.</p><p>The First Minister was keen to quote in the chamber the views of COSLA vice-president Councillor Neil Fletcher, so he and his colleagues may be interested to hear Councillor Fletcher's comments on the SNP Government's assertions regarding class size reductions:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"this spin by the SNP led Scottish Government on its policy of class size reduction is a very dangerous threat to its relationship with local government\".</p><p>Similarly, the SNP's assertions that it has secured a freeze in council tax for the next three years were flatly denied by COSLA's president, Councillor Pat Watters, in evidence to various parliamentary committees earlier this month.</p><p>We have been treated to a procession of SNP back benchers heralding the settlement as excellent news for their councils and constituents. I congratulate each and every one of them&#8212;their feat of speed reading of the detailed figures is worthy of hearty acclaim. However, it could just be that they have not read the detail and have not spoken to council members or officers; instead, they have sought reassurance from the briefings provided by ministers. Again, time will tell whether they have been too quick to pass glowing judgment.</p><p>The truth is that councils will scrutinise the detail of the cabinet secretary's announcement and pore over the figures relating to their local authority area, trying to detach raw facts from the overblown rhetoric. Undoubtedly, all councils will have to make difficult choices&#8212;that is inevitable&#8212;but it is not yet clear what effect the single outcome agreements will have on the process. Will they force councils to contort budgets to deliver SNP <place-holder colnum=\"4508\"/> promises, or will councils, in the spirit of mutual respect to which the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth has referred, be free to respond to local priorities?</p><p>What is not clear, despite questioning at the Finance Committee earlier this week and again in response to the cabinet secretary's statement today, is what sanctions the Government proposes for councils that do not deliver elements of the single outcome agreements. What constitutes a breach? Who decides? Do local or national priorities take precedence? Tom McCabe highlighted those tensions in an excellent speech that was applauded throughout the chamber. Tavish Scott rightly questioned whether the settlement will lead to an end to the blame game, which is what the cabinet secretary indicated.</p><p>Those who are involved in the provision of mental health services and support for vulnerable members of our communities have already expressed the understandable concern that with the removal of ring fencing, the resources that are available to them may be cut. The issues are hugely difficult, and the impact will no doubt vary throughout the country. However, without a clearer understanding of how the outcome agreements will operate when they move from the drafting to the implementation stage, it is difficult to see how those issues will be managed satisfactorily.</p><p>Tavish Scott referred to the likely commissioning of Christopher Smout, the professor emeritus of history at St Andrews University, to capture the true historic proportions of the concordat and today's settlement for local government. I suggest that a better hire might be the less illustrious and presumably cheaper Ray Hammond. As a futurologist, he is probably better placed to assess whether the settlement is indeed historic.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394695", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Settlement 2008 to 2011"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At First Minister's question time earlier this afternoon, Mr Salmond, with his now customary penchant for self-effacing understatement, trumpeted Mr Swinney's announcement as the \"best financial settlement for a generation\".

It is no exaggeration to say that it is potentially a matter of life or death to them. It is not a new issue, of course&#8212;my predecessor, Jim Wallace, secured a similar debate in February last year. I pay tribute to his tireless efforts in keeping the issue front and central, and very much in the in-trays of Scottish ministers.</p><p>Despite the widespread and deeply felt concerns of my constituents, despite the worrying stream of cases that have exposed shortcomings in the current air ambulance provision, despite the concerns that have been raised by island general practitioners and nurse practitioners with first-hand experience&#8212;too often bad&#8212;of the current service, there remains an unwillingness to recognise my constituents' right to the level of service that is enjoyed by people who live in almost every other part of the country. As with any such service, the aim must surely be to allow patients who are in need of medical attention&#8212;whether or not it is a life-or-death emergency&#8212;to be taken to the appropriate hospital without undue delay.</p><p>For that to happen, it is essential that we have an ambulance service that is designed to cope with weather conditions, in Orkney in this case, day and night, summer and winter. It is clear&#8212;and it was predicted&#8212;that the Inverness-based EC 135 helicopter alone cannot provide that service. The limitations of the helicopter were set out in detail during last year's debate&#8212;in colourful and <place-holder colnum=\"4354\"/> persuasive fashion, if I may say&#8212;by the current Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change. As Stewart Stevenson explained, in certain weather conditions, particularly when there is icing, that helicopter cannot fly&#8212;conditions that did not stop the previously used Islander aircraft from flying.</p><p>The issue is about more than just the relative capabilities of types of aircraft. Orkney weather changes fast, as I well know, but a Kirkwall-based pilot who is familiar with the weather patterns can make use of short weather windows, whereas an Inverness-based pilot cannot. An Inverness-based pilot might be prevented from flying by weather to the south of Orkney, which would not affect a Kirkwall-based pilot. Today's motion gives an example of just that vital point. On a day when the helicopter could not reach Papa Westray, an Islander, on its scheduled flight in the north isles, was able to use short weather windows to get in and out of the island safely, and it got the elderly patient to hospital.</p><p>Although the issue remains the same as it was when Jim Wallace secured his debate last year, there has been a significant change over the intervening months. Since that time, the communities that are affected have completely lost confidence in the service. I am well aware of that, having visited and spoken to constituents in each of the outlying islands. The issue was reflected starkly in a recent petition, which attracted more than 1,200 signatures from across the north isles&#8212;a staggering figure considering the overall population of the islands. It is a message that the convener of Orkney Islands Council, Stephen Hagan, and I passed on, along with the petition, to the new chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Kevin Doran, when we met him last week.</p><p>Emotions are running high, and it is not difficult to see why. The communities on those islands are tight communities, but they feel vulnerable. Islanders see at first hand the risks to themselves, to their families and to their friends and neighbours. They also recognise the difficulties with attracting people to and retaining them on the islands. The issue goes well beyond emergency health provision; it challenges the fundamental economic and social viability of small island communities.</p><p>It is perhaps invidious to pick out individual cases on individual islands. As I have said, the concerns are felt equally strongly across all the islands. However, the case in Westray last month vividly highlighted the inadequacies of the current air ambulance provision. It shocked the entire community in Orkney and so angered the local GP that he spoke out in unprecedented terms&#8212;\"Some will die.\" That is a direct quote from the Westray doctor, Pedro Ponte. It was also, unsurprisingly, <place-holder colnum=\"4355\"/> the headline in <em>The Orcadian</em> on 15 November. I know that the case has been brought to the minister's attention by the council convener, who is a resident of Westray, and that it is the subject of a formal complaint by Dr Ponte to the SAS.</p><p>For the benefit of members, I will highlight briefly some of the details of the case&#8212;which is the worst but, sadly, by no means the only case in recent times. A severely disabled woman with acute pneumonia was left to travel alone on a delayed air ambulance flight. Her parents&#8212;the only people present who were able to communicate effectively with her&#8212;were denied space on the helicopter because of the weight restriction. The emergency helicopter was requested within two hours. After some delay and various phone calls, it was promised within six hours. It eventually arrived more than seven hours after the initial call from Dr Ponte&#8212;a further delay that resulted in the woman spending well over an hour in the back of an ambulance at the airfield in the middle of the night.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394317", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Orkney Air Ambulance Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this opportunity to debate an issue that is absolutely critical to my constituents.

He is absolutely right, but that is not to say that the pilot or the paramedics were at fault&#8212;quite the contrary. Their actions have been rightly praised by Dr Ponte, Stephen Hagan and others who were involved that night. However, as Dr Ponte said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is Scotland&#8212;if you run an air ambulance service, you have to run it in bad weather. If you cannot do that, do not pretend to run a service.\"</p><p>I have heard what the Scottish Ambulance Service and ministers have said, but I know what is happening on the ground: I know the concerns that are felt locally, including among the medical professionals in the islands, and I know the distrust in Orkney about what we are told by the SAS. Statements that were made by its previous chief executive in public meetings in Orkney undoubtedly contributed to that breakdown in trust. The assertion by Adrian Lucas that use of the Islander for air ambulance flights was prohibited under health and safety regulations proved to be groundless, as did his claim that as a result of the tragic crash off Campbeltown in 2005, the Civil <place-holder colnum=\"4356\"/> Aviation Authority had accepted a recommendation that single-pilot air ambulance flights be banned.</p><p>Such economy with the truth damaged the reputation of the SAS in my constituency. However, I am encouraged by the approach that Kevin Doran has taken since he took over from Mr Lucas last month. He accepted my request for an early meeting along with Stephen Hagan and although he offered no guarantee of an immediate change, he did undertake to review a number of cases, including the one in Westray to which I referred, before coming to Orkney in the new year for meetings with isles GPs, nurses and other stakeholders. I hope that that signals the beginning of a change of attitude and, ultimately, a change in how the service is provided.</p><p>The case for change is unanswerable. I was therefore pleased to see the newly appointed chair of Orkney NHS Board, John Ross Scott, accept that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there are still concerns that need to be addressed\"&#8212;</p><p>which he plans to raise with the SAS board.

There is no doubt that Scotland has many natural advantages&#8212;the minister highlighted a number of them&#8212;but we rest on those laurels at our peril. Improving quality through improving skills is essential, and we can exceed visitor expectations in no other way.</p><p>Our amendment focuses on a number of specific decisions taken by the SNP Government that, we believe, deal a serious blow to the minister's <place-holder colnum=\"3890\"/> claims&#8212;which are certainly sincerely held&#8212;of wanting to see the development of a vibrant, high-quality tourism industry.</p><p>Of course, the minister's Achilles' heel is that he cannot resist a well-turned flipchart. Death by PowerPoint is the only way to die, so the master of matrix management has presented us with a restructuring of VisitScotland that is driven by process and function but ignores reality. Overlaying the structure with that of HIE and Scottish Enterprise may make sense in the land of consultants&#8212;those who are not required to operate in the system&#8212;but in Scotland's three main island groups we will be hard pressed to find anyone that has a good word to say about the minister's proposals.</p><p>I appreciate that further discussions are to be held about the centralising process, although I cannot help but think that some of that consultation would have been more helpful before plans emerged. Emerge is what they did&#8212;to say that they were launched would be to overstate what was in effect their interring in the peroration of a statement about the wholesale filleting of the enterprise networks.</p><p>There is no lack of commitment in VisitOrkney, VisitShetland and VisitHebrides to working collaboratively in VisitScotland's framework. Their track record in the past two years bears witness to their success. As well as tourist numbers, recent headlines in respected tourism publications that suggest that Orkney is the \"glittering centrepiece in Scotland's treasure chest of attractions\" and, perhaps less intuitively, \"Why Shetland is Better than the Bahamas\", serve as evidence of that success.</p><p>The gratuitous and unwarranted restructuring of VisitScotland so soon after the implementation of the previous restructuring pales in comparison with the wholesale demolition of the enterprise networks. Members will recall that, in his statement to Parliament, John Swinney asked us to get our heads round the concept of revitalising the local enterprise companies through their abolition. From the south of Scotland to the Highlands and Islands, people are concerned that the reduction in local decision making and the real-terms cuts in the budgets of Scottish Enterprise and HIE present a serious threat to business start-ups and growth throughout the tourism industry.</p><p>In the HIE area alone, a budget cut of 22 per cent will have been made by the end of the spending review period. It is hard to square that with the commitment in the Government's economic strategy that insists that the tourism industry is a key sector and as such will receive enhanced support. Such tough love raises the question whether being identified as a key sector <place-holder colnum=\"3891\"/> is akin to a football manager receiving the dreaded vote of confidence from his chairman.</p><p>The reduced funding for marketing by VisitScotland that was announced in the budget earlier this month and which Philip Riddle acknowledged in his evidence to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee this week compounds the problems, but Liberal Democrats still believe that the decisions that have been taken on enterprise networks, college funding, a replacement for the air route development fund and Scottish Natural Heritage risk doing the most damage. Nevertheless, the signal that the SNP has sent to the tourism sector by proposing real-terms cuts to VisitScotland's budget&#8212;despite the investment that is proposed for capital grants and the Ryder cup&#8212;is at best inconsistent. What impact that will have on core services remains to be seen.</p><p>Although members agree on the ends, we have genuine differences about the means by which we achieve those ends.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving amendment S3M-945.1, in my name, to leave out from second \"recognises\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"believes that this objective is put at risk by the cuts to the budgets and business support activities of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise which will reduce local decision-making and have a negative impact on the start-up and growth of tourism businesses across Scotland; notes with concern the lack of consultation over the restructuring of VisitScotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit to safeguarding the budgets and autonomy of the island offices under the control of VisitOrkney, VisitShetland and VisitHebrides.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Mather is clearly adopting the same coyness as the Conservatives.

My two young sons have taken to conducting chemistry experiments at home. Not magic potions, not malevolent poisons&#8212;no, I am assured that these are chemical experiments. They are concocted by emptying every bottle in the house that does not sport a skull and crossbones. As a result of one such experiment the other week, we are having to repaint the front porch.</p><p>Normally, I would blame the parents, but as there is barely a science O-grade between my wife and me, my sons' enthusiasm appears to defy simple genetics. However, the experience has confirmed for me the importance of nurturing the innate curiosity of all children about how things work, how they are made up and how they interact with other things. I share Elaine Murray's view about the central importance of how science is taught in schools and how such curiosity is stimulated throughout the critical pre-school years and onwards.</p><p>I am not saying that everyone should aspire to work in scientific fields, but although our scientific literacy bears comparison with our international competitors, a wider appreciation of science by <place-holder colnum=\"3868\"/> non-scientists would certainly be desirable. I echo what Alex Johnstone said: it would be helpful if the minister could tell us what steps the Government is taking to manage the need for good-quality chemistry, physics and maths teachers in future, especially given the current age profile of teachers in those subjects.</p><p>Fundamental though schools are, much of the focus of the debate&#8212;not just today in Dynamic Earth but since the Government announced the budget earlier this month&#8212;has understandably been on the size of the settlement for the Scottish higher education sector. That may be a debate for another day, but there is no escaping the fact that the real-terms cut in the first year of the spending review period and the lower-than-expected rises thereafter will impact on our universities' ability to build on the excellent work that they have been doing.</p><p>In the context of this debate, it is pertinent to draw attention to the impact that the budget settlement will have on research and development and on the critical area of knowledge transfer. Both those issues will be key to developing a response to the energy challenge. Scottish universities have made impressive strides in pooling research capabilities. More collaboration across research disciplines will be an essential next phase&#8212;but, again, the budget settlement makes the process more difficult.</p><p>The theme of this year's science in the Parliament event is energy, and it could not be more appropriate or timely. Anne Glover's presentation set out the stark reality of the situation facing us. The challenges are certainly enormous. However, the impact that each of us as individuals can have should not be underestimated. Public opinion and public acceptance have moved a long way in a relatively short time. There is also a degree of political consensus on the issues that we face, although there is less consensus on how we should address them.</p><p>As the Stern review made abundantly clear, the costs of inaction and delay are considerable, so collaboration between the scientific community and politicians is fundamental. Politicians can lead, educate, regulate and fund, and scientists can innovate, inform and challenge, but what they can achieve together is almost certainly more than the sum of their respective parts. In my constituency of Orkney, real strides have been made through the collaborative work of the European Marine Energy Centre, Heriot-Watt University, the Scottish Renewables Forum, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and government at a local and national level. That work has put Orkney at the centre of worldwide marine renewables.<place-holder colnum=\"3869\"/></p><p>The science in the Parliament event has established itself over the past seven years as a valuable forum in which ideas can be exchanged. In that regard, it can help to ensure that informed decisions are taken for our long-term interests. Like Alex Johnstone, I congratulate all those who have been involved in today's event, many of whom are present in the public gallery. I also congratulate Des McNulty on securing such a worthwhile debate.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Science and the Parliament"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will start by striking a slightly discordant tone: science at the moment is the bane of my life, and chemistry in particular has been the root cause of much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the McArthur household.

Having read the press in recent months, I know how much importance he places on the firsts that he has achieved since taking office. To date, we have been treated to many such momentous achievements: the first time a Scottish minister has been invited to London for a meeting with his UK counterparts; the first occasion on which UK ministers have come to Scotland for a meeting; and the first time that this particular Scottish minister has been involved in a fisheries council in Luxembourg. Leaving aside the veracity of such claims, I certainly take my hat off to Richard Lochhead for his news management.</p><p>I have been intrigued by the debate so far. As I am sure the cabinet secretary will acknowledge, <place-holder colnum=\"3666\"/> previous debates ahead of the December fisheries council have been more than a little lively and tempers have come close to fraying on occasion. In fact, this must be the first debate on fisheries in this chamber in which Mr Lochhead has not been feverishly ringing the death knell of Scotland's fishing industry or, in keeping with the Christmas spirit of advent, counting down the days that we have left to save the industry.</p><p>Much as the SNP Government might wish to take credit for the current state of affairs, for all its bluster about putting fishing interests at the top of its political agenda it is worth asking, what is the real reason why we are in this position? Is it because of the tireless pursuit by Mr Lochhead and his colleagues&#8212;recognising the need to bring catching capacity more in line with available stocks&#8212;of a fully funded and voluntary decommissioning scheme back in 2003? Is it because any proposed cut in a specific quota was welcomed by the SNP as a prudent and sensible step to allow stocks to recover and fishing opportunities to be safeguarded in the longer term? Is it because Mr Lochhead saluted the achievement of the previous Scottish Executive in safeguarding the 6-to-12 mile limit, the Shetland box, multi-annual fisheries agreements and the establishment of the influential regional advisory councils? Sadly, in all three respects, the answer is no. Although I am certainly encouraged to hear less talk of crisis and impending doom, I am absolutely clear that the groundwork for this more harmonious state of affairs was laid by my colleague Ross Finnie, as Sarah Boyack said, often in the teeth of the most vitriolic opposition from Mr Lochhead and his colleagues.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392540", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sea Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Unlike John Scott, I should declare an interest in that I am a son of a fisherman, albeit one for whom fishing is more of a hobby now.

In many respects, those negotiations settle many of the issues in relation to most of the key stocks for the Scottish fleet, including cod, haddock, whiting, North Sea herring and plaice. <place-holder colnum=\"3667\"/></p><p>There is a growing sense that the Commission negotiations operate with insufficient political oversight in those talks. That was acknowledged in the Government's recent strategy on Europe. I would welcome any clarification that the cabinet secretary can offer about how the talks will be managed this year and in future.</p><p>Looking ahead to the EU council in December, in light of the view of ICES that cod stocks are being harvested at more sustainable levels, can the cabinet secretary offer any reassurance about the likelihood of achieving the 15 per cent increase in the cod quota for next year? As he said, such an increase would be sustainable without increasing cod mortality, by bearing down on the issue of discarded fish.</p><p>On other stocks, I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary's comments on megrim, which is a key stock for the Orkney fleet in terms of available swaps. However, it seems barely credible that an 80 per cent cut in whiting catch is being proposed. I would be grateful for an assurance that cuts on such a scale will be resisted.</p><p>Despite the less fevered atmosphere leading up to the talks in December, the cabinet secretary will be aware of the serious concern that has been caused by suggestions that a 25 per cent cut in effort might be put forward by the European Commission. Although such an unwarranted measure would have a disastrous effect throughout the whole Scottish fleet, the cabinet secretary will acknowledge the particular difficulties that it would present to fishermen in my constituency and Shetland, given the time that it already takes them to reach their fishing grounds. That blunt instrument, which is much loved in certain quarters of the Commission, must not be extended.

We have heard much from the current Administration about the importance that it attaches to our fishing industry. I support the sentiment, but I question the obsession with seating plans in the Council of Ministers, which other members have mentioned. Ensuring that the position that is adopted by the UK delegation and backed by UK votes supports Scottish interests is what is vital. Making the case in bilateral negotiations with the Commission and in the council chamber based on the best available scientific evidence is where our energies should be directed.</p><p>However, changes are needed to the way in which the important EU-Norway talks take place. More political oversight by member states is certainly required. I would be interested to know whether the minister can share any more detail on what the EU priorities document refers to as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a number of specific proposals\"</p><p>in this regard.</p><p>It was interesting to note what the document says in relation to the cod recovery plan. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A wide range of actions have been taken ... which have significantly reduced fishing mortality rates ... the Scottish whitefish fleet has been reduced by over 150 vessels in order to bring fishing capacity more in line with fishing opportunities\".</p><p>As Malcolm Chisholm implied, all those measures to bring catching capacity more into line with available stocks were opposed tooth and nail by the SNP in opposition. More mature members will recall that rarely a day went by in Decembers past without the current cabinet secretary feverishly sounding the death knell for Scotland's fishing industry, like a demented cross between Cassandra and Quasimodo.</p><p>I am encouraged by a great deal of the strategy that relates to agriculture. The commitment to increasing simplicity and reducing bureaucracy for our farmers and crofters is not new, but it needs to be pressed ahead with urgently. The cabinet secretary made clear his support for reviewing the system of penalties and appeals. I welcome that announcement because I have been arguing for such a change for some time. I hope that there can be progress in short order, not just to improve how we operate the system but to secure a more proportionate approach at EU level.</p><p>In the short term, the need to reach agreement on the Scotland rural development programme is paramount.

As two of the very few members, along with Alasdair Allan, who are unable to get back to their constituencies after voting on a Thursday evening, if nothing else, the debate provides us with a good opportunity to put to productive use the enforced extension of our time away from the islands.</p><p>As the motion makes clear, and as Tavish Scott highlighted in his remarks, the importance of ports and harbours to the island communities that I represent cannot be overstated. That is reflected in the fact that all but one of Orkney's ports is owned by the local authority, which recognises the fundamental importance of those assets to the economic and social well-being of the islands.</p><p>As other members have made clear, development of those assets involves negotiation with a monopoly owner&#8212;the Crown Estate. I wish to associate myself with the sentiments that are expressed in the motion, that Parliament should have more say and control over how the Crown's assets in Scotland are managed and how they benefit communities across Scotland. That is the firm recommendation of the Crown Estate review working group, which was mentioned, and I hope that the minister will be willing to work constructively with the Government in Westminster and the cross-party group of MPs to explore ways of changing the structure of the Crown Estate.</p><p>I acknowledge that, in recent times, the Crown Estate has adopted a change in tone and has shown more willingness to consider seriously investment opportunities that would serve Orkney's long-term interests. It is, however, fair to say that it has not to date delivered much by way of tangible benefits on the ground, but it would be churlish not to at least acknowledge the welcome, if belated, recognition of the need to exploit Crown marine assets for the benefit of the communities that are so reliant on them. I know that the Crown Estate takes violent exception to the Callander report's recommendations, but it is perhaps <place-holder colnum=\"3058\"/> interesting to observe the coincidence that exists in the review group's undertaking its work and the Crown Estate's change in approach, to which I have referred.</p><p>I want to look ahead and leave aside the structural and constitutional changes that we want. I want to draw members' attention to three issues in my constituency in respect of which the Crown Estate has an opportunity to deliver on its stated good intentions and make a positive contribution.</p><p>On harbour developments, the minister will be well aware from his recent visit to Orkney that Orkney Islands Council recently carried out a Scottish transport appraisal guidance appraisal of future internal transport needs. The process identified that significant investment will be needed not only in new ferries, but in substantially upgraded harbours and even, potentially, in new harbours. I hope that the Crown Estate recognises the importance of that investment to the future success and sustainability of some of our most remote and fragile communities, and the need to avoid adding to the overall costs of that vital work to the local council and the Scottish Government. I also hope that it recognises that my constituents and I will be watching very closely over the coming months to find out whether the new rhetoric is matched by a new more enlightened approach in practice.</p><p>It is not only local harbour developments that are key to Orkney's future success. Orkney is leading the way for Scotland in developing a trans-shipment container hub at Lyness. It is still early days, but potential operators of such a facility have already shown firm interest in it. The potential benefits not only to Orkney but to port facilities and communities from Caithness south are particularly exciting. From meetings that I held recently with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Wick Harbour Authority, I know that they fully recognise that potential, but Invergordon and Inverness also stand to benefit directly. As I said, the project is still at an early stage of development, but it is encouraging that the Crown Estate is engaged in supporting work on the business case for the Scapa hub as well as the essential environmental impact assessment work. I hope that the minister will offer his support to those of us who are encouraging the Crown Estate to capitalise on that constructive beginning and to work co-operatively to progress the Scapa hub project.</p><p>Members may be tiring of my constant references in the six short months that I have been an MSP to the marine energy potential in and around my Orkney constituency. However, that is another matter about which the Crown Estate has made positive noises recently, not just in respect of supporting research but&#8212;more important&#8212;in respect of helping to address the fundamental <place-holder colnum=\"3059\"/> issue of an interconnector linking the resources of the islands to demand further south. There are, however, issues to do with the Crown Estate's decommissioning approach.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity that I have been given to participate in this debate, which has touched on issues that have, and will continue to have, an important bearing on my constituency. Again, I congratulate Tavish Scott on securing the debate and on his long-standing commitment to arguing for changes so that we prevent the leakage of revenue from areas&#8212;such as Orkney and Shetland&#8212;in which it is raised.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390983", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Estate (Taxation on Harbour Developments)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome tonight's debate and add my congratulations to Tavish Scott on securing it.

However, we now appear to be moving into the phase of strategies without substance.</p><p>There is undoubtedly consensus across the Parliament that the overall number of Government targets needs to be reduced, but the glaring absence from the skills strategy of any meaningful targets or measurements of success for improving skills in Scotland is deeply worrying.</p><p>Various members mentioned how central skills at all levels are to helping us to achieve the Government's stated objective of sustainable growth in the Scottish economy. Derek Brownlee made a point about the need for a step change, and I have always been struck by the suggestion that people who are entering the workforce now will go through multiple career changes, half of which will be in careers that do not yet exist. Therefore, it is disappointing that the minister has not been able to be a bit more specific about her intentions and the measures that the Government proposes to take.</p><p>As Murdo Fraser has made clear, Scotland's record on skills&#8212;particularly skills at the higher end&#8212;is comparatively good. The quality of our higher and further education establishments is, in many cases, world class and participation rates are high, although more still needs to be done to widen access. A widening of access will be one of many benefits when the UHI Millennium Institute finally secures university status. It will act as a driver for economic development throughout the <place-holder colnum=\"1616\"/> Highlands and Islands and, in my constituency, reward the tremendous efforts that have been put in by Bill Ross and his staff at Orkney College.</p><p>Orkney College has proved itself remarkably adept at working closely with local schools and local businesses to ensure that the needs of students and employers are successfully met. However, meeting those demands is not straightforward, particularly for a smaller college. For instance, the demand for construction skills has grown quickly over recent years, and the capping of growth in ring-fenced funding through so-called SUMs&#8212;student units of measurement&#8212;is putting real pressure on the college. Although there may be the option to send trainees south, that will not suit many local employers, who will be reluctant for their apprentices to leave the islands for weeks on end. Moreover, one of the college's notable successes over the years has been in providing people of all ages in the islands with an opportunity to further their studies without the need to leave and attend institutions further south.</p><p>I would welcome the minister's view on what can be done, perhaps on a time-limited basis, to help smaller colleges accommodate the occasional spikes in demand of that type. Although I note her remarks on the comprehensive spending review&#8212;which, I have to say, are in marked contrast to her clarion calls in opposition prior to the last spending review, when the previous Executive delivered record investment to universities and colleges in Scotland&#8212;I would also welcome clarification on the current Government's position regarding the creation of the university of the Highlands and Islands.

It offers an opportunity for many of us to reflect&#8212;soberly&#8212;on the health risks of excessive alcohol consumption and the health benefits of a good night's sleep. I welcome this debate and I am pleased to be able to participate.</p><p>I want to use my time to reflect on an issue that is of serious concern to my constituents. The issue was touched on by Ross Finnie, and I am sure that similar concerns are shared in other particularly rural communities.</p><p>The Arbuthnott formula that is used for calculating health service funding is in need of urgent reform. The indicators that are used under the formula for calculating deprivation are flawed, with the result that places such as Orkney are at a disadvantage when it comes to trying to deliver high-quality health care. I fully accept that no formula is ever likely to be considered perfect, and that overrefining criteria can come at the cost of increased complexity and reduced transparency. However, there is a need&#8212;and there is scope&#8212;to make the formula less simplistic in a number of respects, which can serve only to better match health funding to health need.</p><p>To give an example, the employment statistics that are used in the current formula are too narrow and too crude; they take into account only the number of people unemployed and do not reflect the nature of employment. In Orkney, but also across the Highlands and Islands and in much of the south of Scotland, low wages rather than unemployment are a real problem. A formula that took account of the type and quality of employment, and not just the number employed, would more accurately reflect deprivation and need.</p><p>Similarly, the present Arbuthnott formula is too simplistic in relation to housing. The rate of home ownership in Orkney is relatively high, but so too is the proportion of people who live in substandard accommodation. Fuel poverty is also a major issue; I fully accept that that is a nationwide phenomenon, but Orkney's climate&#8212;notwithstanding changing weather patterns brought about by global warming&#8212;adds an extra dimension to the problem.</p><p>Car ownership is another measure used by Arbuthnott that paints a somewhat misleading picture. The extent of car ownership in Orkney is high, but that is a reflection less of wealth than of travel distances and the lack, more often than not, of public transport alternatives. Cars are an everyday necessity; they are a lifeline not a luxury&#8212;and, with the cost of fuel significantly higher in the islands than elsewhere in Scotland, a not inexpensive lifeline at that.<place-holder colnum=\"1243\"/></p><p>The age of the car pool in Orkney illustrates shortcomings in the current Arbuthnott indicators. Almost a third of the cars in Orkney were registered before 1995, compared with 14 per cent in Scotland as a whole. I accept that car ownership should be a measure, but the age and value of the cars should be taken into account.</p><p>Arbuthnott consistently underestimates the impact of remoteness on the cost of providing health care. The formula is based largely on calculations of distance travelled over land, and so does not account properly for the time and cost of sea travel, which can and does add significantly to the cost of delivering public services, including health care.</p><p>The cabinet secretary and others have acknowledged the additional demands of delivering health care services to an increasingly ageing population. That is felt particularly acutely in my constituency. There is a need for improved statistics that better reflect changes in the population and age structure. Current statistics do not identify changes quickly enough, are based on postcode areas that are too large to pick up significant local differences in places such as Orkney, and are not sensitive enough.</p><p>A review of the Arbuthnott formula has been taking place. Other members will doubtless have issues that they feel should be better reflected in any revised formula. However, I hope that the cabinet secretary will accept the compelling case for adjusting the current formula better to meet the needs of those who live in rural and particularly island areas.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386240", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health and Well-being"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the business managers on scheduling this debate   on health and well-being for the morning after the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists Association dinner.

As a result, I must make a personal, impassioned plea for the Edinburgh airport rail link to be taken forward without delay.</p><p>In Orkney, we are perhaps blessed more than most. Indeed, Orkney Island Gold and Orkney the <place-holder colnum=\"1112\"/> Brand have proved particularly successful in highlighting what my constituency has to offer. The quality of the beef, lamb, fish and shellfish are being held in increasingly high regard in Scotland and internationally. Moreover, on the drink front, we have whiskies such as Highland Park and Scapa, a range of beers and the Orkney Wine Company. All of that shows that by harnessing innovation with local produce we can have a great impact both in sustaining a local economy and in securing success in international markets. As Jim Hume said, such moves are good for the economy. I am certainly looking to work with the local council and the tourism and retail sectors to see what more can be done in that respect. Christine Grahame's point about supermarkets was very valid.</p><p>As for health benefits, I should, to avoid any accusations of hypocrisy, say that my own diet leaves an awful lot to be desired. I can do no more than strive to improve it.

In passing, I note that Herman argues persuasively that the treaty of union acted as a springboard for the enlightenment, but that is perhaps a debate for another day.</p><p>I would, however, argue that the enlightenment drew heavily on our commitment in Scotland to education&#8212;to universal public education and a school in every parish.

It is therefore disappointing that the cabinet secretary is not willing to support the call from Scotland's universities for &#163;168 million in additional funding, or to support the 3 per cent real-terms increase in funding for colleges. May I also put in a plea that an early meeting be held with the principal of the UHI Millennium Institute about progress towards university status for that body?</p><p>As Hugh O'Donnell said, Liberal Democrats have long recognised the need for sustained investment in early years provision. I very much welcome Pauline McNeill's well-informed speech about that and the cabinet secretary's decision to build on the previous Administration's success in introducing free nursery provision and other policies. Hugh Henry talked about the valuable work of the learning through play initiative in primary 1&#8212;I hope that the Minister for Children and Early Years will address the Executive's policy on that.</p><p>I was disappointed that the determined to succeed initiative was not referred to.

Falling school rolls in places other than West Lothian offer opportunities, but I take Alex Johnstone's point that figures that are plucked out of the air and enforced too inflexibly will be counterproductive. As a product of composite classes and composite schooling, I stand in their defence.</p><p>School-college collaboration was not really picked up by any member, which is an oversight. It plays a part, not least in engaging people who have traditionally been turned off by a more academic approach in schools. Colleges have often felt like the Cinderellas of tertiary education, but their work in communities is vital to tackling skills needs, not just among young people but&#8212;as Futureskills Scotland's recent report identified&#8212;among the older population, on whom the economy will increasingly rely. John Park made excellent points about that.</p><p>The cabinet secretary suggested that learning will make a smarter Scotland: she will not find a dissenting voice to that here. Much common ground exists. The direction of travel that the <place-holder colnum=\"919\"/> Executive has adopted builds on some&#8212;but not all&#8212;of the previous Executive's successes. Jeremy Purvis identified several legacy issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone said, what has been announced falls short of the unambiguous promises that the SNP made during and before the election campaign. As Jeremy Purvis said, the Liberal Democrats will work with the Executive on much of what the cabinet secretary has announced, but will challenge the Administration when it is failing to deliver. That will be the key to delivering a smarter, healthier and more skilled and successful Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385346", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smarter Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite the controversy over the preannouncement, we have had a good and wide-ranging debate.

Orkney's historic links with Norway alone could provide material for a members' business debate. We might have a chance to debate those links during the next four years&#8212;who knows&#8212;but I am glad that Rob Gibson has secured this debate so early in the new session of the Parliament.</p><p>I will highlight excellent opportunities for further co-operation between Scotland&#8212;Orkney in particular&#8212;and Norway, but first I will question part of the motion. Although I am new to the Parliament I am acutely aware that even orally proposing an amendment to a motion in a members' business debate is akin to swearing in church, but I understand that 17 May is Norway's constitution day&#8212;on that day in 1814, in the post-Napoleonic period, Denmark ceded control over Norway and Sweden. It was not until 7 June 1905 that Norway and Sweden agreed to go their separate ways. Having said that, I acknowledge the significance of the 17 May anniversary, which was celebrated in my constituency in colourful fashion. The focus of the celebrations was on children and families, and the commemoration of the people who died serving their country was both poignant and uplifting.</p><p>There is another landmark date this week: the 24<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the twinning of Orkney and Hordaland, which has built up valuable cultural links. It is probably fair to say that the links between Orkney and Norway are now more cultural than economic, perhaps as a result of the many similarities between Orkney and Norway. However, we can perhaps do more to foster links that will have economic benefits&#8212;I note in passing that Highland Park is now sourced by the Norwegian wine monopoly. The twinning arrangement has resulted in more tourists coming from Hordaland to Orkney and to the rest of Scotland. The development of Orkney's marina facilities has certainly encouraged more yachts from Norway and elsewhere, and I hope that that trend continues.</p><p>The motion refers to direct sea routes. Tavish Scott set out the benefits of the existing Shetland service. The service has benefited Orcadians, but I part company with Tavish Scott to agree with Rob Gibson that the planned Scrabster to Bergen route will provide more opportunities for Orcadians to visit Norway and for Norwegians to visit Orkney. In the light of that, I would welcome the minister's <place-holder colnum=\"865\"/> views on what might be done by using the previous Executive's air route development fund&#8212;I happily acknowledge Iain Gray's role in the fund's introduction&#8212;to support the re-establishment of a seasonal air link between Orkney and Norway. Of course, such a link would need proper marketing support in Norway if it was to be viable.</p><p>The motion mentions the potential for links to help harness the sources of clean power that are available to both countries. I wholeheartedly agree that such potential exists. We have rich wave and tidal resources, which are not far from being commercially viable, thanks to the pioneering testing and development work of the European Marine Energy Centre in Stromness. As Tavish Scott, Iain Gray and Rob Gibson said, we cannot underestimate the importance of the supergrid in allowing renewable energy potential to be harnessed.</p><p>I believe that there are more opportunities for mutually beneficial co-operation between our two countries in shipping. The natural harbour at Scapa Flow already offers ship-to-ship transfer opportunities to Statoil of Norway, but I want those opportunities to be extended. Ports all the way along the Norwegian coast will be able to benefit from the major container transhipment hub that is planned for Lyness in Scapa Flow.</p><p>I am grateful to Rob Gibson for allowing me to break my duck in members' business debates and to do so on a subject of some significance to my constituency.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish-Norwegian Commercial Co-operation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Rob Gibson on securing the debate and acknowledge his longstanding interest in the issue, which probably constitutes a passion for him&#8212;such passions are much to be encouraged in all politicians.

I welcome the debate and I congratulate Joe FitzPatrick on an excellent maiden speech. I look forward to working with him on the Finance Committee.</p><p>As I mentioned two weeks ago in response to the statement by the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism on the UK Government's energy white paper, Liberal Democrats applaud <place-holder colnum=\"666\"/> the Executive's pledge to resist new nuclear power stations in Scotland. Not only would building state-subsidised nuclear power plants produce vast quantities of waste that we do not know how to deal with, it would suck investment away from Scotland's renewable energy industry. That investment is vital if we are to make a breakthrough in marine and other renewables technologies. Building new nuclear power plants would also put at risk our ability properly to fund the development of microrenewables and ambitious energy efficiency initiatives.</p><p>Members are no doubt already tiring of hearing me refer to the enormous potential of Orkney, where leading-edge work is taking place not only in wave and tidal energy but in biofuels, biomass and fuel-cell technology. It is in the interests not just of Orkney but of Scotland for that work and similar work across the country to receive the level of support that is possible only if we do not embark on nuclear new build. For example, if we are to achieve a more decentralised system of energy generation&#8212;I believe that we can and should do that&#8212;that will require significant investment in infrastructure, including interconnectors.</p><p>If the Executive is to achieve its goals on energy, it will need to have the means as well as the ends. It is no use for the cabinet secretary to call for Scotland to aspire to be the world leader in renewable energy while his colleagues call for a tax on wind power and a cap on future wind developments and demand that anything that has a visual impact should be deemed not green. The potential impact of such an approach on investor confidence in the renewables sector could be horrific. I yield to no member in my determination to have wave and tidal energy play a major role in Scotland's future energy generation mix, but onshore wind is the proven technology and it will remain a core component of that mix for decades to come. Anything that undermines confidence in that market risks damaging the development of renewables as a whole.</p><p>Although I encourage ministers to think out of the box, I put in a plea that that should not lead to the honeycombing or detonation of any so-called sad and lonely islands in my constituency. Swona and Stroma might appear sad and lonely to the casual observer who has been sent up by the SNP to think the unthinkable, but blowing them up would set a dangerous precedent for other less-than-ecstatic islands. I am bound to say that that would also risk making the Pentland Ferries crossing decidedly unpleasant in a westerly gale. Perhaps that is what is meant by the title of the debate.</p><p>Significant further investment in microrenewables will be needed. Positive strides have been made in the past few years, but further <place-holder colnum=\"667\"/> incentives and funding are necessary. I urge the minister to commit to measures that will help to drive demand up and costs down.</p><p>On the critical issue of energy efficiency, I am encouraged by what ministers have been saying. As with microrenewables, much has been achieved on energy efficiency, but our performance must continue to improve if we are to strike a better balance between supply and demand.</p><p>I understand that we might have an opportunity before the recess to consider in more detail the proposals for a climate change bill. Such a commitment, to which the cabinet secretary alluded, will receive willing and constructive support from this party. The need to cut carbon emissions year on year is surely now beyond dispute. The SNP made much of the need for binding annual targets while it was in opposition. The SNP manifesto states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In government we will introduce a Climate Change Bill with mandatory carbon reduction targets of 3% per annum\".</p><p>We questioned that commitment, believing that having four-year targets to allow the Government to be held to account over the parliamentary session, coupled with annual reports to the Parliament, provided the sensible way forward.

Likewise, I endorse his call for Ofgem's remit to be amended to take more account of environmental factors.</p><p>Like Iain Gray and Alex Johnstone, I have three main questions. First, the minister talked of confidence, stability and certainty in the energy sector and went on to say that the devil will be in the detail. I suggest that the devil may be in the blanket moratorium that his party proposes in relation to the proven technology of onshore wind. Will he clarify when he intends to commence the SNP's year-long moratorium on onshore wind farm developments and say what impact he expects that to have on existing projects that are going through the planning process? If he still intends that the moratorium will be put in place, how will he build the confidence of the renewables industry in Scotland so that it can grow and deliver an alternative to nuclear power?</p><p>Secondly, the minister rightly drew attention to the cost of the delays in the DTI taking decisions about the carbon capture project in the north-east.

Those of us who are of a betting persuasion&#8212;possibly even the First Minister himself&#8212;could be running a sweepstake on how many times the new politics will be referred to in any given debate or at question time. So far, establishing precisely what the new politics will deliver has eluded us, although it appears to have resulted in John Swinney earning the nickname \"midwife of maiden speeches\". By the looks of things, it is not just the Cabinet that is being slimmed down; the new politics appears to have ushered in debates without motions. I hope that that is not a precursor to parliamentary questions without answers. I suppose we will have to wait until midday tomorrow to find out.</p><p>As a number of members have said, no one can argue with the aspiration of creating a Scotland that is wealthier and fairer. On the basis of today's debate, I dare say that there will even be cross-party agreement on many of the ways in which we <place-holder colnum=\"234\"/> go about achieving that. Certainly, the detail that the cabinet secretary was able to provide on his intentions was welcome. I appreciate that the proposals will take some time to develop, but welcome the cabinet secretary's invitation to the Liberal Democrats and others to work on taking that detail forward.</p><p>As Tavish Scott said, the Liberal Democrats are proud of our record in government, in which growing the economy sustainably over the long term was established as the number 1 priority. That focused record investment on education, on skills and training, on transport and electronic infrastructure&#8212;I make a passing reference to broadband, which I do not think has been mentioned by other members&#8212;on reducing business rates and on encouraging business growth. It is no coincidence that we have seen sustained growth in our gross domestic product figures over recent years&#8212;often, as Wendy Alexander made clear, at higher levels than historic trends.</p><p>It is also no coincidence&#8212;as we have heard on a number of occasions from a number of members&#8212;that employment has been at historically high levels and unemployment has been at historically low levels. I note Alex Neil's point about the construction sector, which has performed well and enjoyed significant growth. The modern apprenticeships scheme has been successful in achieving the 30,000 target. It is clear that there are issues about quality, about maintaining that level and about pressing on, but it would be wrong to draw a veil over that success.</p><p>Education featured in the comments of Jeremy Purvis, Elizabeth Smith and others. More can be done, and skills, research and cutting-edge technologies will remain key to achieving our objectives in that area. It is therefore disappointing that the SNP Government has decoupled enterprise from lifelong learning in the structure of government and, as Jeremy Purvis said, has failed to make a commitment to invest in universities and colleges. However, I look forward to hearing what Fiona Hyslop says in her winding-up speech.</p><p>Historically, Scotland has not had the right levels of investment in research and development. Alex Neil made that point well. Traditionally, we have performed very poorly. The Liberal Democrats believe that an investment and innovation agency should be established. Such an agency would bring together current R and D, proof of concept, incubator, venture capital and equity support from the Government and it would follow best practice in places such as Finland. I note that John Swinney has drawn attention to the Liberal Democrats' track record of developing ideas in that area. I give a commitment to work with him in taking them forward.<place-holder colnum=\"235\"/></p><p>World-class infrastructure and transport are also crucial. As we heard, the SNP's stated intention to abandon key transport projects such as trams and the Edinburgh airport rail link will be devastating not just to the economy of Edinburgh but, given the city's importance, to the overall Scottish economy.</p><p>We welcome what the cabinet secretary said about lower business rates. Ian McKee, Derek Brownlee and Michael Matheson alluded to the importance of reducing business rates still further. That is important to the economy as a whole, but particularly to smaller towns. I think that ministers will enjoy widespread support for the measure, not just in the Parliament but beyond it.</p><p>There has been a lot of debate on Scottish Enterprise. I say simply that Scottish Enterprise&#8212;despite its problems&#8212;Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Development International have all played important roles in delivering Scotland's economic performance. Indeed, they are seen by our international competitors as case studies in the roles that they perform&#8212;HIE in delivering economic development in dispersed rural areas, and SDI in promoting and sustaining inward investment and helping domestic companies to internationalise. The fairness component was to some extent the Cinderella of the debate. As with the cabinet secretary's portfolio, the debate may have bitten off more than it could chew, but I acknowledge the thoughtful contributions of Bob Doris, John Park and a couple of others who focused on fairness.</p><p>I am sure that John Swinney is aware that he will get our support in taking forward the detail of his proposals on the council tax when they come before the chamber.</p><p>Despite the lack of a motion, the debate has been constructive and worth while. The cabinet secretary set out his thinking on a number of areas and members of all parties will be keen to take up the invitation to work on the detail. However, the Government remains silent about its intentions in too many areas, not least transport. I am cautious about adding to Mr Swinney's workload by inviting him to lead yet another debate&#8212;although there are probably a few maiden speeches that he has not yet heard&#8212;but I encourage him and his ministerial team to provide clarity on that point during the coming weeks.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate all those who have made their maiden speeches&#8212;I empathise with them.

Described by the Lonely Planet guide as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A glittering centrepiece in Scotland's treasure chest of attractions\",</p><p>Orkney has much to offer the discerning and, indeed, the less discerning tourist.</p><p>Farming and fishing were prime candidates in my early musings about a maiden speech. Orkney's fantastic reputation for beef, lamb and seafood will be well known to many in the chamber. Although those sectors face challenging times, I know that we will return to those subjects later in the year.</p><p>There were other issues to be considered, and efficient government had serious competition. However, I do not want to create the impression that efficiency in public services is not important to Orkney&#8212;quite the contrary, for many of the reasons to which Alasdair Allan alluded. In a small constituency where public services are delivered to communities that are based on a number of islands, ensuring that maximum value is derived from every pound of public money spent is arguably more important than ever. Indeed, the cost of delivering public services to dispersed island communities with an ageing population is inevitably higher. That is still not fully recognised in the current funding arrangements. I will be arguing strongly about that in the months ahead.</p><p>However, Orkney already has a positive story to tell about making efficiencies and working more collaboratively across the public sector. Considerable work has been undertaken, and was supported by the previous Scottish Executive, to promote closer working between Orkney Islands Council, NHS Orkney and HIE Orkney. During the <place-holder colnum=\"157\"/> election campaign, Liberal Democrats promoted the idea of a single public authority, where there is local demand for one, in Scotland's three island authority areas. That idea has considerable merit and a great deal of support in Orkney, provided that decisions are made and structures are decided locally. Although it offers scope for cost savings that can be redirected towards front-line services, such an initiative could also ensure a greater degree of local accountability and control, despite Tavish Scott's concerns about initiative overload.</p><p>This afternoon's debate is on the approach to government. I commend to the minister an approach that promotes exercising the greatest control at the most local level possible. Perhaps John Swinney will indicate this afternoon whether he is prepared to support the on-going work in Orkney and to provide the necessary transitional funding to enable it to be taken to the next level.</p><p>I am conscious that carrying on a Westminster tradition in the Parliament may be seen by some as heretical, but I believe that the tradition of paying tribute to one's predecessor is worth while. No one in the Parliament will fail to recognise Jim Wallace's enormous service not just to liberal democracy in Scotland but in supporting the creation of a stable, progressive Government in this country. Jim's approach to government was enlightened and far-sighted. He argued fiercely for the Scottish people to have more control over their affairs, through the Scottish Parliament. He also defended strongly the rights of communities&#8212;especially remoter communities such as Orkney&#8212;to be given the tools with which to take control of their futures.</p><p>I know how conscious Jim was of the task that faced him in following in the footsteps of Jo Grimond. I can only empathise with him and note that, over the past 24 years, Jim has made the task of following in the footsteps of one's predecessor considerably more daunting. However, a commitment by the new Government and across the Parliament to empowering local communities further would be a fitting way of taking forward Jim Wallace's work. It would also be a tangible and worthwhile legacy for the new politics about which we have heard so much.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Approach to Government"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Alasdair Allan on his maiden speech, much of which I recognise and sympathise with as a fellow   islander.
