At decision time, Scotland can become the 17th or the 26th country or territory around the world&#8212;it depends on how we count it; I will not go into the constitutional issues&#8212;to legislate for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. We will pass what many regard as the last great reform that is required to achieve full equality in law for lesbian, bisexual and gay people.</p><p>It is true that equality in law will not immediately mean the end of discrimination in all its forms, but it will mean the completion of the first phase of a campaign that began in Scotland at the end of the 1960s and which achieved the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1980, as others have said. That landmark achievement was slowly followed by equalisation of the age of consent and, ultimately, civil partnerships&#8212;an imperfect but at the time progressive move towards our vote today. The bill also makes significant progress on the inclusion of trans and intersex people. After today, campaigning for LGBT people&#8212;for example, for better sexual health and education policies and against bullying or stigma&#8212;will go on, but the crucial point is that it will do so on a similar basis to that for other groups and from the starting point of full legal equality.</p><p>While other countries around the world, including our neighbours in England and Wales, have taken the lead, those of us who have supported marriage equality in Scotland have watched and hoped that our day was coming closer. As each country has taken the step, the pressure for change has increased.</p><p>In each nation, the story of the fight for equality has been different. Each land has its own progressive coalitions, which have been built up over time and which are unique to the relationships and experiences of its people. However, the discrimination and oppression that too many gay and lesbian people have faced have been all too similar. It is said that the world is becoming a smaller place but, for lesbian and gay travellers throughout the generations, the most far-flung destinations must have seemed familiar, because the reality of discrimination has been a constant and near universal fear, wherever is called home. Therefore, I am proud that Scotland can today join the places where difference is neither to be feared nor tolerated but is, rather, accepted.</p><p>When I spoke in support of the bill at stage 1, I said that I wanted to do more than just win an argument for tolerance. Therefore, I also mean something more when I use the word &#8220;accepted&#8221;. The prize is not that we no longer care who gets married to whom, but that we recognise individual human relationships. The commitment to love another person and to spend our days with and for them can be a very private matter, but it can also be a proudly public one, if that is wanted. To my mind, that is the right that the bill creates, and it is one that, distinct from civil partnerships, should be available in the same terms to all couples, regardless of their sexuality and whether they profess a faith. That is the right that other countries have created, and we should join them. We should do so not just for our own people in Scotland in order that the state is truly the enemy of discrimination among its citizens rather than just the arbitrator, but because history has already taught us that we are on her right side.</p><p>In the coming weeks, the eyes of the world will be on Sochi and the winter Olympics there. We will be reminded that the world is not so small and that the attitudes that we rightly condemn in Russia are far more the norm there and elsewhere than what we might boastfully feel are our own enlightened views.</p><p>Each Parliament that has already made the change has done so in its own fashion. In some, there have been tears, hugs and the singing of national or protest songs. Jackson Carlaw took us somewhat towards that, but not the whole way, thankfully. Our chance at history comes at just after 6 o&#8217;clock, but it must be living history for much longer afterwards. We need a Scotland in which we renew our determination to eliminate homophobia and to celebrate, not just tolerate, diversity. We need determination that our small&#8212;and, I predict, positive&#8212;example will help to ensure that we are not for long the latest legalisers of equal marriage but rather are among the early adopters of change that has already taken far too long. It should be remembered that, for many people in the world, we will be just a far-off dream.</p><p>Those of us in the Parliament who have campaigned for equal marriage will be pleased with our work today and our work towards today, but there are many days of individual celebration ahead. Those days&#8212;not this day&#8212;will show that what has been done in the first few countries is more than a dream; it is a hope for all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, wherever they live and whatever their experience. That is why I feel very privileged to support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is no less welcome for being long awaited.

Parents will know only too well that that often means deciding between two or more things that they would like for their child, such as paying for a home improvement or family holiday versus paying for an opportunity for a child to pursue their talents in sport or to have the chance to learn and play a musical instrument. Each parent will know the process that they go through to rationalise between things when money is tight.

I appreciate that Government back benchers have been handed their copy of Jamie Webster&#8217;s quote, which they have stuck to and dutifully read out during the debate. I do not disagree with Jamie Webster. In the event of a yes vote, of course we would have to get behind the Clyde yards. The problem is that I do not want to get behind them just when they are arguing for something when they are put in a difficult position; I want us to have influence over such things. That is the point that all the other union conveners have made.</p><p>Others have said that the crucial issue for the success of the Clyde yards is a healthy order book. In fact, there are two issues: orders and skills. The unions will be making the case for apprentices, who have been a major source of pride for everyone who knows the Clyde yards. It is vital that training continues and that the yards continue to be seen as an attractive career choice for young people from Glasgow and far beyond, because only by maintaining skills and training new apprentices will the yards be able to take advantage of the UK&#8217;s policy of procuring UK defence ships within our borders and to build the new orders that I wish to see, among which the most crucial is the order for the type 26 global combat ship.</p><p>The extra work on the Queen Elizabeth class, which is to be transferred from Portsmouth, is, as Murdo Fraser said, very welcome, as is the order for offshore patrol vessels. That work can bridge the gap in the period up to an order for the type 26.</p><p>The order for the type 26 is the next major order that could and should be placed with the Clyde yards, following those for the aircraft carriers and, before them, the type 45 destroyers. Those ships, the Daring class, are in British service now, and no one who has any interest in Clyde shipbuilding will have failed to have noticed HMS Daring arriving in the Philippines this week, bringing with it much-needed UK aid for the country.</p><p>I want to see HMS Daring, HMS Dauntless, HMS Diamond, HMS Dragon, HMS Defender and HMS Duncan, which were all commissioned by the previous Labour Government, joined by a new class of Clyde-built frigates that can play their role in the defence of the United Kingdom and in projecting British influence at sea&#8212;ships that Glasgow would be proud of.</p><p>BAE Systems has made clear that its preference is to build those UK defence ships in Glasgow. Therefore, the single biggest threat to that order coming to Scotstoun and Govan is the loss of the yards&#8217; status as domestic UK shipbuilders. As others have mentioned, UK yards are able to compete for the work under article 346 rules, which assist the UK to place orders for UK defence ships in the UK.</p><p>I listened with interest to what Annabelle Ewing said about article 346.

Nevertheless, I had perhaps not thought through the reasons why I felt that way about it&#8212;my response was instinctual. I was first asked my views on the issue a few days after the election and, over time, I have found myself being asked about it more and more often. As I thought more about it and listened to others expressing their views, I came to understand my own feelings about it a bit more clearly. In the course of the wider debate that led up to the introduction of the bill, I remembered someone whom I had not forgotten but the extent of whose influence on the view that I had thought was instinctual I had not realised.</p><p>Like the majority of the Scottish population, I strongly support the provisions of the bill. I have also, at various times, pressed the cabinet secretary&#8212;and, indeed, his predecessor&#8212;to hurry along. Therefore, I am very pleased that we have got to this point and hope that we will follow the example of England and Wales and the many other countries that have created equal marriage. I believe that marriage rights are an issue of equality, and I feel strongly that the current position of civil partnerships, which I supported at the time and was proud of my party for having taken the lead in introducing, is not quite enough. Although there is little difference between civil partnerships and marriage in terms of legal rights, the fact that civil partnerships preclude the right of gay people of faith to commit themselves to each other in a religious service is discriminatory. I hope that one of the major achievements of the bill will be to remove that discrimination.</p><p>Equality does not mean that everything must be the same; equally, difference should not be imposed on identical things. Same-sex relationships may be different from opposite-sex relationships, but are all relationships not different and unique? Do they not all share the same basic principle: love for another human being and a desire to commit to spending your life with that person? I do not think that the state has the right to draw a distinction between human partnerships that human beings do not draw themselves, and to me that is fundamentally what the bill is about and why I support it.</p><p>In 2000, this Parliament repealed section 28&#8212;section 2A&#8212;which it did in advance of the rest of the UK. Looking back, we can see that the repeal of section 28 was a victory for equality, but it did not come without cost, just as the years of various discriminatory laws did not come without cost and just as that cost still exists in many parts of the world, as Joan McAlpine rightly highlighted. There are members in the chamber who will have celebrated that victory and they might also recall some of the pain of that debate: the things that were said that can never be unsaid and the people who pushed ahead and, in my view, have never been properly recognised for their efforts.</p><p>When section 28 was debated by the Parliament, I was still at school&#8212;a religious school&#8212;and I recall what was said. I recall talking to classmates about the leaflets that were going through our parents&#8217; doors, the newspaper headlines and the things that were said on the school bus.</p><p>I mentioned that I thought of someone in the context of this debate. I remember a girl&#8212;a young woman&#8212;in my year at school, who one evening appeared on the TV news, which was rather unexpected. She spoke out and, to many of us, she became the first person we knew to come out. She did it by asking a very simple and powerful question: what right do others have to make a judgement about me and my life or to make a distinction about who I am and what I am? That was in the context of the section 28 debate.</p><p>There are many things that I could say about the detail of the bill, and others are rightly saying them. I celebrate the fact that this may be the last major legal change required to remove discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual people from our law, and I am very privileged to be in this place, at this time, to support it. I will follow the amendments at stage 2 and I will support efforts to improve the bill. It is probably not the last major piece of legislation for transgender people, but it is a significant step on the way.</p><p>I will oppose any change to the bill that could threaten a new section 28, however well intentioned people may be on that issue. I do not want a situation in which there is a campaign to come back to the bill because of a section that is inserted at stage 2.</p><p>I do not know whether the woman that I mentioned has sent one of us an email asking us to support this legislation or if she has put her activism behind her.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members bring a range of experiences, ideas and beliefs to the chamber, but it is always worth reminding ourselves that, although they might not always seem to do so, our debates and judgments affect how real people live their lives, the opportunities that they have and their sense of the value that society places on them.

Scotland&#8217;s constitutional future has been key to Scottish political debate all my life.

No doubt, they are as keen as the rest of us to decide the matter once and for all.</p><p>The choice is either a separate Scotland or a continuing partnership with our nearest neighbours, the people with whom we share these islands and together with whom we have built the institutions that act as levellers in our society&#8212;our welfare state, our national health service and many of the things that people all over Britain are proud of.

I am talking about what young people&#8212;and others&#8212;say about non-domestic relationships between men and women, and the view that when a sexual crime is committed against a woman, it is possible that the victim is to blame for it. Jackie Baillie mentioned a few of the contributory factors, which include things as simple as the perception that the way in which someone is dressed gives people&#8212;predominantly men&#8212;the right to make judgments about them and therefore to commit behaviours that in any other circumstance would be beyond them.

I very much agree with Mr Mason on the issue of pay ratios and differentials. In her closing speech, I would be interested to hear the minister touch on a commitment to measure, which is the one thing that we could do now. A commitment from the public sector to produce some statistics on pay ratios might help us to deliver the outcome that Mr Mason suggested.</p><p>Challenge poverty week is an excellent initiative. I congratulate the Poverty Alliance and everyone who has been involved in developing the idea. John Mason mentioned the importance of Christian teaching and what the church says on some of these issues. Last year, I was struck by a comment that Sally Foster-Fulton of the Church of Scotland made to me. She said that the Christian view that the poor are always with us is not meant to be a defence; it is supposed to be a challenge.</p><p>In the policy debate on poverty and how to tackle it, we often create the distinction between absolute and relative poverty, which Alex Johnstone mentioned. Jackie Baillie mentioned the progress that the previous Labour Government made on both. There is reasonable political consensus that eradication of absolute poverty is achievable in a country with our wealth and resources, and that we should seek to export that campaign against absolute poverty to other corners of the globe.</p><p>Our politics, however, tend to divide us on relative poverty. To some extent, that division reflects the differing views of the public at large. There are those who are prepared to accept the inevitability of some poverty for other people, but people are rarely persuaded to accept the inevitability of poverty for themselves or their families. If we accept the inevitability of poverty, we must divide &#8220;others&#8221; into those who deserve our support and those who deserve their fate. The opportunity provided by challenge poverty week will play an important role in encouraging us all to reject that approach.</p><p>I will concentrate on poverty as it affects the people in Glasgow, whom I represent. Glasgow is not a poor city in many respects. The city council rightly promotes Glasgow as the powerhouse of the Scottish economy; its success is vital to the city region and all of Scotland. Quite often, the debate about Glasgow&#8217;s problems, particularly in the media but sometimes in the political debate around the city&#8217;s leadership, depicts a city that is a victim of poverty rather than a survivor of it.</p><p>Rather than list the many challenges that Glasgow faces, which are deep rooted, and the solutions that have been presented, which are often superficial and can be patronising, I will make a couple of observations. Due to the scale of the challenge that Glasgow faces, I do not believe that it is possible to have a serious plan to tackle poverty in Scotland without having a serious commitment to Glasgow. That is not to say that the lived experience of poverty in Glasgow is worse than it is elsewhere, or that poverty in Scotland is unique to Glasgow; rather, it is to recognise that in the big areas&#8212;health, life expectancy, education and quality of work, all of which add up to quality of life&#8212;the scale of Glasgow represents a capacity to intervene that we cannot ignore and the biggest opportunity to turn our faces against the idea that poverty is inevitable.</p><p>I have spoken about my city but another point that should be at the heart of challenge poverty week is the importance of individual human voices in establishing what is to be done. I care about poverty in my city and it is part of my job to advocate on behalf of the people whom I represent. We can all put in place programmes to assist people. However, it is only when we hear the voices of people who have the lived experience of worklessness&#8212;whether because of the lack of a job or because they are unable to work&#8212;or who face exploitation at work that we will ever sustain real change.</p><p>In yesterday&#8217;s cost of living debate, which has been mentioned, Iain Gray talked about the missing &#163;1 billion&#8212;the money that has vanished from anti-poverty programmes since 2007. From the conversations that I have had with poverty campaigners, I know that there is a feeling that we have lost our focus on tackling poverty.</p><p>I might not support many of the changes to the welfare system that UK Government is pursuing or some of the Scottish Government&#8217;s priorities, but those are not the causes of poverty. We will get an understanding of the real causes and solutions and how to scrutinise the budgets only when the voices of the people who are affected are heard properly in the debate.

It is nonsensical of SNP members to pretend that that somehow did not happen.</p><p>In recent weeks and months, a number of people have said to me that Scottish politics is dominated by the on-going referendum debate. Indeed, the Scottish Government has used time in the chamber in recent weeks to debate the one-year-to-go point until Scots have their say on that question. No one on the Labour side underestimates the importance of the referendum, but I think that, across the chamber, we would all regret any impression that the Parliament is not focused on the day-to-day issues that affect the lives of people whom we represent. I hope that this Labour debate goes some way towards redressing the balance.</p><p>The cost of living crisis that is hitting households across Scotland and the UK is the issue that dominated my surgeries this summer. Lynn is a woman who came to a surgery that I held in Partick, and her story is fairly typical of many people I have met. She was forced to give up her work as a supervisor in a busy shop to care for her elderly mother. Lynn&#8217;s mum unfortunately died in January, and since then Lynn has been unable to find another job&#8212;and I mean any other job. Lynn did the right thing by caring for her mum herself&#8212;she saved the state money&#8212;but now she feels that she is being punished, and life is getting harder for her each and every month.</p><p>We know that the impact of the global financial crash and recession has been felt the hardest and longest by those who are furthest removed from the questions of financial regulation. It has been bank workers and not bank executives who have felt the most pain. Those who have lost their jobs in banking, manufacturing and retail and the 49,000 people who have lost their jobs in public services have suffered. Those who were already furthest from the labour market have been penalised heavily, and even for those who are in work, exploitation has been the hallmark of the recovery, such as it is. Zero-hours contracts, reduced hours and pay freezes have been the reward for many of those who are in work, while those who are looking for a job have been encouraged or in some cases compelled to provide their labour without pay.</p><p>At best, that means people having less money in their purses and wallets, putting off home moves or improvements and missing out on holidays, but at worst it means people struggling to clothe their children for the new school term and to put food on the table. At the same time, we have seen childcare become less and less affordable, and it is now less affordable in Scotland than in any other part of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Prices have risen in the shops and on our household bills. Despite falls in wholesale energy prices, the cost of heating a home this winter will take up a larger and larger proportion of incomes. When it comes to a basket of essentials in the supermarket, the JRF has put the rise in what is paid at the till at some 25 per cent over just five years, as I think Jackie Baillie said. Demand for food banks has risen by 35 per cent in the same period, and a fifth of those who access them are in work.</p><p>Since 2010, average wages in Scotland have fallen by &#163;27.30 a week. Public sector workers are emerging from a pay freeze with a 1 per cent increase, or 2 per cent for those who already earn the least, and yet the CPI is at 2.8 per cent and the RPI is at 3.3 per cent. Declining incomes and rising costs add up to a cost-of-living crisis for real people and not just a problem or an opportunity for politicians.</p><p>The question for the Scottish Parliament is how we respond and how we use the powers that the people have entrusted to us to act in their interests. All the political parties are thinking about how we will respond to those problems after the referendum or after the next election, but the crisis is not a challenge of tomorrow. It is one for today, and our response should be an urgent one.</p><p>That is where I take issue with the Scottish Government&#8217;s amendment, because the truth is that the Scottish Government has nothing new to say. What we have heard is a restatement of polices that were debated during the 2007 election or policies that were introduced by the previous Labour-led Government before 2007.</p><p>We need to evaluate what is already being done in terms of the regulation of costs, and spending to help people. We must consider whether those things are working or whether some effects of the policies are unintended or contrary to our objectives and whether reprioritisation is possible or needed. We also need to set out what more could and should be done. There are plenty of things that we should be doing, including extending the living wage, taking action on zero-hours contracts and making the case for training that leads to better quality work. Those steps are all vital and I agree with what has already been said about them.</p><p>An answer to a parliamentary question that I received, which was published in yesterday&#8217;s written answers report, states that no assessment has been made of how extensively zero-hours contracts are being used in colleges and universities, which are some of the biggest employers in the city that I represent. There has been no assessment of whether they are primarily used for teaching and academic staff or whether it is cleaners, technicians, maintenance workers and cooks in canteens who are on them. If we do not even know how many people are being asked to work in a university without knowing how many hours they might get next week, what hope do we have of creating decent employment in other sectors of the economy?</p><p>Fuel poverty, which others have mentioned, is significantly the responsibility of the Scottish Government, and its commitment to tackling the issue is regularly extolled. I welcome every penny that is spent on helping the one in three Scots who live in fuel poverty. However, one of the first decisions to be taken after the election that brought me here was to cut the fuel poverty budget and to remove universal provision of the central heating programme&#8212;universal provision which SNP members have praised in other areas.</p><p>I finish by mentioning a policy that was announced at the Labour conference last week&#8212;Labour&#8217;s proposal to freeze energy bills. Would the SNP support the next Labour Government on that or would it implement a similar plan in an independent Scotland? That is the key question in this debate.</p><p>Members know my views and those of other Labour members on the SNP&#8217;s plans to cut corporation tax for big businesses. Will the minister tell us, in closing, how the SNP can justify cutting tax for energy companies while taking no action on the bills that they demand of their customers? If the question cannot be answered in this debate, I am afraid that it will become a big issue in the run-up to the referendum on 18 September next year.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The action that the previous Labour Government took was to reduce child poverty.

Given the centrality of the referendum to Parliament&#8217;s business in the remainder of 2013-14, it is no surprise that stage 1 consideration of the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill has come before us so quickly; nor is it a surprise that the bill is so fulsomely supported by members of the governing party. The rest of the Scottish Government may be on pause, but the long road to the referendum provides few resting places.</p><p>Indeed, Labour supports the need to get fair ground rules for the referendum established now. We welcome the people having their say on Scotland&#8217;s future, either outside the UK or as part of a continuing partnership with the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We, too, will support the bill at stage 1 because, as Bruce Crawford says, we agree that despite our differing views on the answer, this question should be put and settled next year.</p><p>The referendum campaign has already been described as the longest political campaign that Scotland has seen&#8212;and hopefully will ever see. For any who are already weary, it is worth remembering that Labour&#8217;s referendum, which created this Scottish Parliament, took just two months to organise and devolution occurred within just two years.</p><p>However, this referendum is different from the referendum of 1997. We are clear that the end of the UK is not, as the Deputy First Minister suggested, a development of power sharing within the UK; it is an entirely different idea. Members will no doubt expand on that difference during the debate. Perhaps they will reflect the new-found enthusiasm of the First Minister, who spent the summer expounding on his love of all things British: the Queen, the pound, a shared welfare system, and a defence partnership are just some of the ever-growing number of British unions that the SNP now wants to save from itself.</p><p>The purpose of the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill is to establish the ground rules for how the debate will be conducted next year. Both the yes and no camps have made it clear that we hope for a clear and decisive result&#8212;but we can only hope that the people deliver such a result. If the result is close, it is even more important that we achieve consensus now about the rules to be followed.</p><p>The referendum bill is rooted in rights and responsibilities that are enshrined elsewhere in electoral law and, as others have said, in our previous experience of referendums in this country. However, this contest is different from all previous votes. Questions over expense returns, proper accounting and the duty to behave with respect towards our opponents cannot be left to be adjudicated upon afterwards. Unlike in other elections, electoral courts, the enforcement of electoral law and the ultimate sanction against rule breaking&#8212;rerunning a contest&#8212;cannot be options in this debate. The safeguards must be built into the contest in advance. Guidance or, if needed, enforcement of the rules must take place before polling day, not after it.</p><p>The Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report raises a number of issues that will need to be considered further at stage 2 because, by stage 3, we will need to be satisfied that we have given the Electoral Commission the tools to do the job that Scotland needs it to do.</p><p>On the requirements of purdah, the committee correctly highlights the difficulty that has been created by the Scottish Government&#8217;s desire for Parliament to sit next August, during the purdah period. That is a problem, first, because of the significance of the decision and, secondly, because of the danger of the Government completing its transformation into a campaign. I am sure that it is not the intention of anyone in the Government to hold a First Minister&#8217;s question time on that Thursday in purdah, in which the leader of the Government is barred from providing substantive answers, nor is it intended that his words might not be publishable under restrictions affecting the production of an Official Report, which would be a potential outcome if the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body was included in the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank all those who have been involved in the preparation of the stage 1 report that is before us, as outlined by the Deputy First Minister and including the individuals who were mentioned by the convener.

Like other members, I thank James Kelly for bringing the debate to the chamber and I thank the Parkinson&#8217;s UK campaigners for coming along to the Parliament to put their case.</p><p>As we have heard, up to 100 people are diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s every year. It is a progressive, fluctuating neurological condition that can affect all aspects of daily life. The severity of the symptoms can fluctuate from day to day and can change rapidly during the course of the day. As Margo MacDonald said, there is no cure for the condition and probably not enough research has been done on it.</p><p>James Kelly said that one person in every 500 has Parkinson&#8217;s, which is about 10,000 people across Scotland. As the Scottish population ages, the prevalence of Parkinson&#8217;s will increase. Parkinson&#8217;s UK estimates that the number of people with the condition will increase by 20 per cent by 2020. However, we should remember that not everyone is diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s in later life. One constituent to whom I spoke at this afternoon&#8217;s drop-in session was diagnosed at 35, after five years of being tested for other conditions.</p><p>Nanette Milne is right that the Parkinson&#8217;s UK report gives many examples of the great work that Parkinson&#8217;s nurses do across Scotland. I suspect that not least among them is Jackie at the Lightburn hospital in Glasgow&#8217;s east end, who explained to me much of what I have just said. There is good provision in Glasgow in some respects, but it is not good enough, although it is perhaps better in some areas. I know that Jackie has a case load of about 450 patients. I express my gratitude for the work that the nurses carry out to make the lives of patients and their families better. At what must be a stressful time, the nurses provide specialised care and support for families who receive a Parkinson&#8217;s diagnosis.</p><p>About one in four people in Scotland with Parkinson&#8217;s is admitted to hospital at least once a year. More than half those admissions are unplanned, and one in every 10 people with Parkinson&#8217;s is classified as being at high risk of hospital admission in the next year. However, as I and, I am sure, other members heard this afternoon, Parkinson&#8217;s nurses can help people to avoid and reduce hospital stays and the risks that are associated with them. The nurses are trained to identify risks and they can intervene early to prevent crisis admission. They can also support patients&#8212;for example, with their medication&#8212;once they are admitted.</p><p>The Parkinson&#8217;s nurse team for NHS Ayrshire and Arran estimates that, over 18 months, it has prevented 15 hospital admissions of people with Parkinson&#8217;s by intervening early, which is a saving of approximately &#163;39,000. Parkinson&#8217;s nurses can support hospital discharges&#8212;that ensures that patients move back home with appropriate care plans in place and thereby reduces the risk of readmission.</p><p>People with Parkinson&#8217;s might need medication six or seven times a day or, as I heard this afternoon, up to 10 times a day. As with any condition, missed medication can be serious. The report found that Parkinson&#8217;s nurses have used innovative ways to prevent adverse medication incidents. For example, in Dumfries and Galloway, a daily email alerts system has been set up that highlights the admission of a person with Parkinson&#8217;s to hospital. In Lothian, the nurses have developed an e-module that outlines the importance of giving medication on time.</p><p>My health board&#8212;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&#8212;has eight specialist nurses, who work across the board area. The report highlights how the Glasgow nurses have developed joint clinics with mental health services to address cognitive and mental health symptoms. Those joint clinics have led to a more efficient use of mental health service time; they have also increased the Parkinson&#8217;s service capacity to manage complex mental health symptoms effectively.</p><p>I recognise the good work that Parkinson&#8217;s nurses do. Their support and advice have probably been invaluable to the families who have benefited from them up and down the country.</p><p>Parkinson&#8217;s UK is calling for more nurses; it has said that the nurses should have a workload of no more than 300 cases at any one time, as recommended by NICE. I hope that the Scottish Government can consider those calls and I look forward to a future in which everyone has on-going access to Parkinson&#8217;s nurses.</p><p>Notwithstanding some of the negatives that are associated with the condition, we have all heard this afternoon that it is possible to have a quality of life with Parkinson&#8217;s. As Dennis Robertson suggested, that hope should certainly be our objective after the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694006", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parkinson&#8217;s Nurses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I spoke to my constituents at the drop-in session this afternoon, they asked whether there would be any heckling in the debate&#8212;in fact, they encouraged it&#8212;but, unfortunately, consensus has broken out.

MND is a rapidly progressing terminal neurological disease, and people who are diagnosed with the illness usually become severely disabled. Symptoms include the loss of their ability to walk, speak, feed themselves and breathe unaided. The damage caused by MND is progressive, and people who suffer from the life-limiting disease do not experience periods of improvement. Sadly, average life expectancy following a diagnosis of MND is just 14 months.</p><p>The motion asks us to acknowledge MND Scotland&#8217;s welfare reform campaign and the &#8220;Time to benefit people with MND&#8221; report. I commend MND Scotland for the work that it has done to highlight the impact that welfare reforms will have on people with MND, as well as all the work that it does to support people who suffer from the illness, particularly through advice and support services. Those services are mentioned in the motion but, unfortunately, I will not have time to come on to them in this short debate.</p><p>Most members agree on the devastating effects that some of the coalition Government&#8217;s welfare reforms are having and will have on our constituents and the areas that we represent. Simplification of the benefits system through the introduction of the universal credit is an example of where the UK Government has probably got the broad approach right. However, its approach goes awry in implementation and in the cutting of support for individuals.</p><p>The motion that Christina McKelvie has put before the Parliament highlights the bedroom tax, so I will concentrate my remarks on that measure.</p><p>We know that 79 per cent of households affected by the bedroom tax include a disabled person. Christina McKelvie is quite right to say that, for people who suffer from MND, the second bedroom is not a spare room but somewhere to keep their wheelchair, hoist, breathing equipment and speaking aids. That equipment keeps the person suffering from MND safe at night, but some of it can often be noisy, which means that their partner may need a separate room in which to sleep.</p><p>Furthermore, the houses are often specially adapted for tenants and owners with disabilities. Therefore, any move may incur more cost, as the new property would also have to be suitably adapted.</p><p>Local authorities have said that they do not have the housing stock available to meet the demands created by the bedroom tax. For that reason, as well as the injustices faced by individuals and groups of people with particular conditions, the bedroom tax is, at best, a misguided policy solution to a problem that is really about the lack of affordable and appropriate housing.</p><p>People with MND will be affected not just by the bedroom tax. The &#8220;Time to benefit people with MND&#8221; report also highlights the impacts that there will be from the changes to employment and support allowance and the introduction of personal independence payments, which are being rolled out this month.</p><p>It simply must be possible to achieve a fairer way of assessing need that recognises that people with some conditions will, unfortunately, not get better or even experience significant fluctuations in the severity of their conditions that mean that their capacity to work is likely to change drastically.</p><p>The position that sufferers of MND are in indicates that there are real problems with the system that the coalition Government is putting in place. Indeed, we should recognise that, as Christina McKelvie was right to highlight, the previous system was far from perfect for many of those people. Therefore, the situation represents an opportunity missed.</p><p>In closing, I return to the issue of the bedroom tax and I repeat something that I have said before&#8212;this Parliament as a whole, across the parties, has failed on the issue. I take the view that what Ed Miliband said last week about localising housing support decisions and coupling the issue of support with housing supply is, overall, the correct way to go.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Scottish Government announcements today, which did not clarify any plans for a separate Scottish welfare system, I accept that those people who support independence genuinely believe that Scotland on its own could create a fairer system. The issue for me is what we do in the meantime&#8212;what we do now for people who are affected by MND. On that issue, we as a Parliament have failed to put in place either the money, policies or guidance to protect people from being unfairly penalised by the bedroom tax.</p><p>I hope that all members who take part in the debate will resolve to come together and work together to deliver real support to the real people who are suffering&#8212;not just in 2014, 2015 or 2016, but today, in 2013.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693503", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: MND Scotland Welfare Reform Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christina McKelvie for bringing this important debate to the chamber.

I do not recognise any of the antagonism that he describes in relation to politics in the east end of Glasgow, but I am grateful to him for ensuring that the matter is debated in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>It has not escaped members&#8217; notice that the Royal Bank of Scotland is more than 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer. Unfortunately, it does not appear that that fact has led to the bank becoming any more responsive to the real needs of its customers or indeed to those of the people whom Mr Mason and I represent in the east end of Glasgow.</p><p>The rationale for the closure of the Shettleston branch on 20 June 2013 is that a declining number of customers wish to make use of a physical branch located in their community. Many of us are increasingly using home broadband internet connections, smartphones and other means to access online applications for banking services. However, when my colleague and local Shettleston MP Margaret Curran met RBS representatives&#8212;and I know that John Mason, too, will have raised this issue&#8212;she quoted the footfall figures that were collected and which demonstrate that people use the branch at the rate of almost one a minute. It hardly sounds as if the service that RBS is offering from the cash counters is moribund; indeed, John Mason has described the queues that he has encountered at the branch.</p><p>There are good reasons why people rely on the branch, and the options that RBS seems to think will replace the service for local people are not likely to be useful for many people in the east end of the city. I would have thought that a bank would seek to know its customers and their circumstances as well as possible, but perhaps RBS&#8217;s lack of understanding on this issue partly explains the troubles in which it has recently found itself. It is well known that in Glasgow digital inclusion is in fact a story of exclusion. Many RBS customers in Shettleston will not be switching to an iPhone or app but they will be quite right if they decide to switch bank.</p><p>Likewise, at a time when there is so much debate about how we ensure that the many people who do not have access to a bank account can access benefit payments as a result of welfare reform changes, RBS&#8217;s decision will make things worse. Richard Lyle was absolutely correct to highlight our recent debate on Citizens Advice Scotland&#8217;s report on the subject; indeed, I suggest that the managers at RBS seek advice from CAS on the impact of the changes on communities such as Shettleston so that they understand just how difficult the decision will make the job of ensuring that people have access to bank accounts.</p><p>I also note the concerns expressed by Sandyhills community council and particularly the credit union, which have thrown the issues into pretty stark relief. Given all the prevailing reasons for encouraging credit unions, I have to say that I find it incredibly worrying when a credit union says that such an unthinking decision will seriously affect its ability to provide services to local people.</p><p>I commend the community council, the credit union and all of the area&#8217;s political representatives both from Mr Mason&#8217;s party and my own, and I echo the call for RBS to change its mind.

Jackson Carlaw started well when he introduced a note of levity, but he still made serious and sincere points. Margo MacDonald&#8212;who, if I picked it up correctly, made a sedentary intervention that could probably win an award for heckle of the year&#8212;and Nanette Milne told us that such conditions are absolutely not a laughing matter, but we were still able to progress through the debate in a generous way.</p><p>We should remember that, for every hour and day of those 11 years, Scots have suffered in pain while politicians have failed to put in place all the services for which they have asked us. Despite that, members on all sides have approached the debate in a spirit of hope rather than recrimination. I listened to the radio on my way to the Parliament this morning, and it was clear that many people feel that they have been let down by the seemingly endless debate and investigation of the issue rather than action. Reports and recommendations have come and gone and the sun has set after a number of false dawns.</p><p>Throughout that time, there have also been the voices of those who have been helped by the services that exist, such as those who have benefited from a visit to Bath and those whose health boards provide more support than others. Members throughout the chamber sought to give voice to those people. Perhaps most memorably, we heard Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s description of his hypnotic trip. I noticed that the minister paid close attention to that, so I will let him deal with some of the points that Mr Stevenson raised.</p><p>I think that it was Bob Doris who said that we all have examples of constituents who have been to see us and of partners or family members who have contacted us because a loved one is unable to make that contact themselves. People are often unable to live the life that they would choose to live because they are lying in pain at home.</p><p>In 2011, Scottish Labour included in our manifesto for the elections to this Parliament our commitment to a residential treatment centre for chronic pain. We therefore welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s confirmation this afternoon that that will be adopted by the Scottish Government. We accept that it is sensible to examine the options and consult those who are most likely to benefit from such a service about the best model of delivery for a centre.</p><p>A residential centre is a vital component of what I think John Wilson described as a comprehensive service for chronic pain sufferers because of the respite that it could offer as well as the treatment that it could provide. We know that those who have travelled elsewhere in the UK have benefited significantly from their experience despite the distances involved, which in one case amounted to a return journey of 1,600 miles from Shetland, as Jackie Baillie mentioned. Up to now, only a very small number of people have been able to do that&#8212;the figure is 119 patients. The provision of in-patient facilities closer to home is likely to increase substantially the number of people who will wish to have access to them.</p><p>Graeme Pearson was right to highlight the cost of sending patients to Bath, which has amounted to just over &#163;1 million in the past few years. It would be useful to lose much of the travel element of that expenditure, and we can do that if we have a service that suits the needs of pain sufferers across Scotland.</p><p>An in-patient resource would be an important step and an important statement in not just recognising chronic pain but resolving to help those who are affected. However, the pressures of the likely demand as well as the need to consider the best interests of patients mean that it can only ever be one component of the comprehensive package of support that must be provided.</p><p>Chronic pain is associated with long-term conditions, and long-term support that is proportionate to needs&#8212;and particularly to varying needs&#8212;is essential. When people are able to continue in work, services must be responsive to their lives rather than force them to give up or become isolated as a result of the pain that they suffer. Jim Hume was right to say that, like other long-term conditions, chronic pain can reduce people&#8217;s resilience as well as inhibit their daily lives. Hanzala Malik, for Scottish Labour, argued that the most urgent reform that is required, beyond the provision of in-patient services for those who are most in need, is for the Scottish ministers to act to end the postcode lottery of care.</p><p>Services in different parts of the country should be responsive to local needs and opportunities. As a Glasgow MSP, I particularly recognise the innovation that has been possible in my health board area because of the championing of a managed clinical network by the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS board. However, when chronic pain conditions are so widespread and so debilitating to so many people in every part of Scotland, it cannot be right that a wide divergence exists not only in what support is provided but&#8212;too often&#8212;in relation to whether any real support is offered at all.</p><p>Another related issue that Labour members have sought to highlight, and which is topical across nearly all NHS services at the moment, is the time that people are waiting to access the support that is available. Despite the good practice that exists in Glasgow, for example, last year my constituents who were waiting for an appointment with a pain psychologist could face waits of about 18 months&#8212;waiting times that many of us thought had been abolished since this Parliament was created and took control of our national health service.</p><p>At the end of last year, those waiting times were down, but they were still more than a year. We therefore believe that, following agreement and, I hope, some consensus about what pain sufferers across the country have a right to expect, the Scottish Government will also need to make some firm commitments about what should be considered reasonable waiting periods for people for whom every hour or day of living with pain can be a mental as well as a physical trial.</p><p>The current co-conveners of the cross-party group on chronic pain have been mentioned, as have a number of activists including Dorothy-Grace Elder, who championed the issue as a member of Parliament and has kept up the pressure outside Parliament as a journalist and campaigner, and Susan Archibald, who petitioned the Parliament on the issue and whose willingness to share her story has ensured that attention to her case might benefit others.</p><p>Those individuals and many others have kept up the pressure on an issue that was never going to go away, despite a lack of action from this place for too long. Those outside the Parliament who have persisted in their campaigning know that today is not the end of their wait; the actions that we have discussed and that will now be consulted on are not&#8212;as I think Siobhan McMahon said&#8212;the last words on the matter.</p><p>It is a clich&#233; to say that actions speak louder than words, but it is true that budgets demonstrate commitment much more effectively than platitudes. Providing the required services will be good value for money, but they will need to be resourced. The clinical network in Glasgow, which has been mentioned a few times, was started with only modest initial funding, but 10 out of 14 health boards still have no budget at all for chronic pain treatment. It is therefore no surprise that the Scottish service model for chronic pain is being followed consistently by only six boards.</p><p>A number of members have mentioned the various reports that have been produced. The Healthcare Improvement Scotland report of last year was perhaps the document that caused the most consternation among people who follow the issue of chronic pain because it was perceived to underplay real experience in favour of painting the picture in the best possible light. Such practices from official inspection bodies are not helpful, but on the Labour side of the chamber we are pleased that the current cabinet secretary has decided to look beyond the official picture and attempt to see what support is needed to make a real difference to people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Joan McAlpine raised the cost of prescriptions, and there is a debate to be had about that. It was not necessarily appropriate to raise that issue in this debate, but perhaps when the minister closes he might say a word or two about some of the value-for-money issues. We want people who need painkillers to get them, but painkillers cost 19p from high street pharmacists while it costs the Scottish health service &#163;3.10 to provide them through the current arrangements. There are questions to be asked about that.</p><p>Scottish Labour has reiterated its commitment to chronic pain sufferers. The amendment in the name of Jackie Baillie seeks not to criticise or to trip up ministers but simply to add a degree of urgency around the long-understood and long-awaited need for in-patient provision. Sandra White even appeared to have a venue in mind for that. I hope that members will support that urgency and the need to have consistent services across the country.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate has taken us two hours or so this afternoon, but for the chronic pain sufferers in the public gallery and those in our constituencies and regions who are following our proceedings, the debate about the need for proper support for and treatment of chronic pain has taken more than 11 years.

I also thank Citizens Advice Scotland for the &#8220;Voices from the Frontline&#8221; reports that it has produced over the past year and a half or so. They have been extremely useful and, no doubt, they will continue to be so.</p><p>I live in the G20 postcode area in Glasgow, which is probably one of the postcode areas in the city with the widest disparities, as it extends north from Great Western Road up to Maryhill Road and then further north. In thinking about online services, I am always conscious of the number of constituents who contact me to complain about the lack of such services. For example, I commonly receive complaints that various services that Glasgow City Council offers are not available online. Some people, particularly at the southern end of that postcode area, will be extremely outraged by that.</p><p>There is hidden discrimination, and it has many elements. Christina McKelvie is absolutely right that we have a discriminatory situation around digital inclusion. People might be discriminated against because, for age reasons, they have no experience of using some of the technology. For others, their disability might mean that using technology does not come easily. The issue might be a lack of infrastructure in their area&#8212;whether because of rurality or something else&#8212;or their economic means and inability to afford the regular direct debit to a broadband provider that most of us have, which we either forget about or pay little attention to. However, such discrimination is real for people who live in the G20 postcode, for example, who will be completely cut out of the move by public services to online delivery.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm and Dennis Robertson are right to say that we all support that move if it saves money and is easier for people. There are a range of reasons why we do not want to produce more and more paper for benefit applications. The problem is when the process becomes digital by default rather than digital by design. If the DWP is going to make such a change, it is really not helpful for it to suggest a target of having 80 per cent of benefit applications made online when it is completely impractical for that to happen. There is almost an irony in the Government driving forward information technology advances when we know how poor the Government itself is at IT.</p><p>There is a punishment for misclaiming. If someone makes an error in the process, which might be because they are not used to using digital provision or because it is not available for them, the system will punish them. To be frank, that is ridiculous.</p><p>There is an issue with how we support people. Of course we want libraries to assist people to make applications online, but we cannot put librarians in the position of being amateur welfare rights officers, aware that any errors might lead to money being claimed back from the person who is trying to apply for the benefit.</p><p>I agree with most members on the Government benches on the matter&#8212;obviously, I disagree on the constitutional point and I will not get into that. When such situations happen, we have a responsibility always to think about what we can do about them. We can do much more on training, skills and supporting people to be digital. We should be conscious of some of the money that has been lost from that and of the fact that many computer skills are now described simply as hobby skills.</p><p>St Charles&#8217; primary school in the G20 postcode is round the corner from where I live. I do not know whether it has been able to achieve this yet, but I discussed with the headteacher there some of the issues and how they affect the kids. She said that if some of the parents could come in at half past 3&#8212;or whenever they pick up their kids&#8212;they could use the school&#8217;s computers. She would be really keen to try that. That was an example of someone not just saying, &#8220;Something bad is happening. It&#8217;s not my responsibility to do anything about it,&#8221; but thinking about the practical steps that she could take to intervene. It is not practical to suggest that schools should open themselves up to all people who are in need of a computer to make a benefit application, but that is a small example of the practical steps that we could all think about taking.</p><p>The Scottish Government needs to think about that too, and I look forward to the minister indicating what steps she is taking.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Digital Exclusion"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to be called to speak in the debate, and I thank Christina McKelvie for enabling us to have it.

Despite the pressures that face the NHS in Scotland, we have managed to come together and make it clear that we remain proud of our service, particularly of all our hard-working NHS staff, who are at the front line of delivering a service that is responsive to the needs of patients and which prioritises quality as well as efficiency.</p><p>When the Unison national health conference met in Glasgow two weeks ago, I was delighted to attend and to welcome delegates to my city and to Scotland. The discussions that I had with visitors and local Unison activists reflected that in Scotland, under successive Scottish Governments, we have chosen a different path for our NHS.</p><p>Alongside consensus, there is a need for honesty. Delegates who work in Scotland&#8217;s hospitals were not quiet about the challenges that they face in the service for which we are all responsible. At a national level, the Auditor General for Scotland has described the service as being &#8220;on amber warning&#8221;; at a local level, front-line NHS staff have described the reality of working on a ward with too few nurses. When the standard of care suffers, no one is more frustrated by it than the hospital staff. Health board managers also know that the financial and staffing pressures are having an impact on the ground. Each of us will no doubt be contacted regularly by constituents regarding the service that they are getting.</p><p>Labour has therefore sought to confront the politics of this place with the real-life picture of what is happening in our hospital wards. We should be honest about the funding and staffing pressures that the service is facing, as well as the demographic challenge. The cabinet secretary has spoken about the latter before, and so have we. Health and social care integration is partly a response to our shared view that the current set-up will not work into the future.</p><p>A number of members have pointed out that bed numbers should not be our only guide. The NHS exists to help people get better if they are sick and to help those with longer-term conditions&#8212;and all of us&#8212;as we get older to live our lives as fully as we can. None of us would want to see anyone in a hospital if their admission could be prevented, or to see people lying in a hospital bed for any longer than they need to. That point has been made consistently by this party, both in opposition and when we were in government.</p><p>There is a contrast there with the words of Nicola Sturgeon, which have already been quoted this afternoon. When she was in opposition, she said that cutting bed numbers had been going on for &#8220;far too long&#8221;. In The Scotsman on 8 July 2006, she said:</p><p>&#8220;We should ... increase the number of acute staffed beds to the benefit of the patients of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>The reality, six and a half years later is this: in 2007, the average number of available staffed beds was 17,505&#8212;members should remember that that was after bed cuts had, according to the SNP, been going on for &#8220;far too long&#8221;&#8212;and, in December 2012, the average number of available staffed beds was 16,085. Although Nicola Sturgeon said that</p><p>&#8220;We should ... increase the number of acute staffed beds to the benefit of the patients of Scotland&#8221;,</p><p>what she did was reduce the number of available beds by 1,420.</p><p>At the Unison health conference, Alex Neil decided to revisit the issue of bed numbers. Perhaps he wanted to clarify the Scottish Government&#8217;s position. Perhaps he thought that it was time for an update. For the benefit of Fiona McLeod, Bob Doris and others, it was not Jackie Baillie who said this; it was the cabinet secretary who said:</p><p>&#8220;we are still going to need the same number of beds, the same number of hospitals, the same number of doctors and nurses just to stand still&#8221;.</p><p>That is the direct quote that the Scottish Government has argued should be deleted from today&#8217;s motion and replaced with a reference to minimum pricing. Minimum honesty might have been a better bet from the Scottish Government this afternoon.</p><p>Standing still is also a term that might require further definition. Since 2009, the Scottish Government has cut almost 2,000 nursing and midwifery staff, and student nurse numbers have also been slashed. The number of nursing and midwifery staff is now lower than when the SNP came to power. Far from standing still, an awful lot of nurses seem to have managed to find their way out the door. On bed numbers and staffing, therefore, we seem to have a problem with what is said in public about our hospitals, and what is actually happening in our hospitals.</p><p>On hospitals, Sarah Boyack was absolutely right to point out that, at the same time as the cabinet secretary was making his comments to Unison about bed numbers and staffing, he also asserted that changing demographics&#8212;more older people&#8212;means maintaining</p><p>&#8220;the same number of hospitals&#8221;.</p><p>Again, that is a clear commitment from the Scottish Government. I am sure that, given the cabinet secretary&#8217;s interest in hospital campaigns, it was a guarantee that he was pleased to give. It therefore remains rather unfortunate that, as the same time as Mr Neil was talking to Unison in Glasgow, here in Edinburgh NHS Lothian was confirming that it was looking at closing not one or two but three hospitals. Asked about that apparent inconsistency, a spokesperson for the Scottish Government said</p><p>&#8220;We are committed to at least maintaining the level of quality and provision in Scotland&#8217;s NHS &#8211; and that means having the right numbers of staff and beds&#8221;.</p><p>In 2006, the SNP claimed that NHS Scotland needed to increase bed numbers; by 2012, it had actually cut them. Two weeks ago, Alex Neil was promising Unison activists that the numbers would be kept the same; by the day after that, the SNP wanted to talk about finding the &#8220;right numbers&#8221;. Today, the SNP is asking Parliament to delete all references to numbers and it is also saying that we should have talked about minimum pricing&#8212;except that we did not, so we will have to come back to that one another day.</p><p>Since the cabinet secretary came to his role, we have had a scandal over the SNP&#8217;s hidden waiting lists and attempts to change the four-hour accident and emergency waiting time target, which is the same target that has not been met across Scotland for the past three years. As Jackie Baillie said, Scottish Labour is happy to debate all those issues, and minimum pricing, with the Scottish Government any day of the week. It would however make for a more honest debate if comments that are made outside of the chamber in one week were a bit closer to the comments that are made in chamber a few weeks later.</p><p>When the cabinet secretary was speaking to Unison, he was addressing workers who cope on the front line day and daily. When our constituents come to our surgeries or telephone our offices, they tell us of a service that is under pressure. When the Auditor General says that the NHS is on an &#8220;amber warning&#8221; and when ministers&#8217; comments fail to reflect the situation on the ground, it is the Parliament&#8217;s duty to pause and think about whether we want to have a debate in which the rhetoric reflects reality rather than obscuring it.</p><p>The cabinet secretary simply asserts that beds, staff and hospitals all need to stay the same, at the same time as NHS Lothian confirms that it wants to close three hospitals. NHS Lothian&#8217;s most recent board paper says that the overall number of doctors will decrease. NHS Western Isles is currently proposing a cut from 89 beds to just 53, and my own health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, is conducting an acute services review. None of that squares with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments to Unison but it does square with the Government&#8217;s amendment today.</p><p>If the civil servants got to Alex Neil after his comments today, they also got to all his backbenchers, not one of whom was prepared to defend his comments of last week.</p><p>On the number of hospitals, the number of beds in those hospitals, and the number of staff around those beds, the Scottish Government would do well to remember the purpose of those beds: to provide a warm and safe place for the treatment of someone who is in need. Let us give those people the respect that they deserve by taking their experiences seriously and being honest about how we respond to the challenges that we all know caring for them presents.</p><p>I urge the Parliament to support the motion in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s name and to reject Mr Neil&#8217;s amendment, even though it served the purpose of clarifying that, when he told Unison that all nurses, doctors, beds and hospitals would stay the same, he did not really mean it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting debate.

It has destroyed lives. The companies that are responsible are forever tainted by their involvement, and they must be held accountable.</p><p>This time last week, we marked international workers memorial day in the chamber. Many members made the connection between the fight for decent health and safety regulation in this country and the utterly unnecessary sacrifice of human life for greed and profit that occurred in Bangladesh.</p><p>Here, health and safety is under attack as never before. Vital regulation is being ripped up, and workers are being put at risk by cuts to inspections and a failure to enforce or prosecute. The Tory Government seems to be picking up where it left off in 1997. The focus has moved&#8212;rather, it has been widened&#8212;from trying to break workplace organisation and the labour movement through assaults on collective rights to a new assault on individual employment rights. Workers are being encouraged to swap rights for shares, and the employment tribunal system, which is a last resort, is being closed off, too. A worker who has been unfairly dismissed now has to pay to have their complaint heard.</p><p>It is claimed that blacklisting is a historical practice. What has been uncovered is indeed a conspiracy that has gone on for decades, but members should be in no doubt regarding allegations that have been made about blacklisting during recent construction projects, including for the Olympic games and London crossrail. The same firms are currently benefiting from Scottish public sector contracts, and they are employing my constituents to work for them today.</p><p>By its very nature, blacklisting is a clandestine activity, and its victims are unlikely to know that they are victims. The most recent concerns raised by Unite relate to crossrail contracts, or rather the loss of a contract when it was alleged that 28 workers had been made redundant because of an attempt by union members to raise health and safety concerns. That allegation relates to circumstances in September 2012.</p><p>I ask members to imagine what it would be like to be a construction worker who raises concerns about corners being cut on a site or about the safety of a scaffold or a piece of equipment. What is their motivation to speak out? Now, I ask each member to think about the motivation of the employer, who notes down their name and shares their file to ensure that they never work again.</p><p>The worker concerned might not know that he is on that list. He might suspect, and he might tell others about it, but he will probably be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist. Perhaps his partner blames him for not being able to find work or keep a job. His kids wonder why their friends&#8217; dads are in work, whereas he is unable to provide for them.</p><p>Blacklisting victims are a victim of an imbalance in the workplace between the employer and the employee. There are good employers and bad employers, but that imbalance exists everywhere. Collective organisation by the weaker party&#8212;by working people, both at work and politically&#8212;remains the only way to ensure a tilt towards a world of work for our children that is better than the one that we inherited from our parents and grandparents.</p><p>People who organise in trade unions, people who speak out because something is unsafe and people who agitate for the fair remuneration of their labour should not be blacklisted&#8212;they should be celebrated. Let this Parliament celebrate them by getting on and doing something for them. If the UK Government will not have a public inquiry, let us set one up. Let us demand compensation for victims. Let us examine the contractors who are delivering our public works now. Let us use procurement to ensure that the corporations responsible are hurt in the only place that they will notice it&#8212;on their balance sheets.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690122", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Blacklisting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Neil Findlay not only on securing the debate but on the campaigning that he has done on the issue.

I thank my colleague John Pentland for lodging the motion for debate and for ensuring that members of the Scottish Parliament have the opportunity to honour the workers throughout this country and around the world who have had their lives taken from them over the course of the past year and in the further past.</p><p>I add my voice in support of all the families who have witnessed their loved ones leave for work in the morning, but have looked in vain to welcome them home again. On the occasion of international workers memorial day, we also acknowledge all the workers who have been injured at work or who have been left with debilitating or limiting conditions. As many members will, I will mark the day by laying a wreath at my local event at the People&#8217;s Palace in Glasgow. I encourage all members to look out for the events that will take place in their areas this weekend.</p><p>Workers memorial day is a campaigning opportunity as well as a time of solemn remembrance, but physical memorials are important. In the next couple of weeks, Glasgow will mark the unveiling of the firefighters heritage trail, which will include 12 memorial stones placed to mark sites such as the Cheapside Street fire, in which 19 firefighters were lost in 1960, and the fire at James Watt Street, also in Anderston, in which 22 workers&#8212;most of them women&#8212;were lost when an upholstery warehouse caught fire in 1968. As someone who lives close to the memorial stones that stand in remembrance of the 2004 explosion at ICL Plastics in Maryhill, I am reminded of that tragedy&#8212;in which nine workers were killed&#8212;almost every day.</p><p>As I mentioned, workers memorial day, which falls just before the workers gala day or May day, is a chance to remember, but it is also a focal point for campaigning and activism. I pay tribute to everyone in Scotland and around the world who is involved in the struggle to ensure that in every workplace the world over, the imbalance that exists between the employers and the employed is tilted back a tiny bit&#8212;if not in favour of working people, at least slightly less against them.</p><p>Every year in the UK, hundreds of people die at work&#8212;the figures vary depending on whether we take into account accidents, injuries and conditions resulting from work. John Pentland was quite right to highlight the scandal of blacklisting&#8212;many of those who are blacklisted are workers who have raised health and safety concerns. However, the coalition Government is currently rolling back not just years, but centuries of progress on workers&#8217; rights and health and safety enforcement. It is disappointing that no member of the Westminster coalition parties has remained for the debate.</p><p>At a recent hearing on health and safety that was held by the Health and Sport Committee, of which I am a member, we heard that the rates of death and injury at work remain higher in Scotland than they are in other parts of the United Kingdom, as John Pentland correctly identified. Regarding which powers this Parliament could assume to assist that situation&#8212;if that was considered to be the way to drive down those rates&#8212;I believe that we should look at enforcement powers and avoid any situation in which we might create a race to the bottom on regulation.</p><p>Finally, I encourage members to speak to the representatives of the Scottish hazards campaign group and families against corporate killing, who are in Parliament today. Ask them about 16-year-old Cameron who, weeks into his first job, was killed in an accident involving an industrial lathe; or about 17-year-old Steven, who was killed after a fall of 30 feet while at work in a water treatment plant; or about 18-year-old Lewis, who was killed after being burnt in a garage fire.</p><p>I add my voice to the call to</p><p>&#8220;Remember the dead; fight for the living.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Workers Memorial Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I draw members&#8217; attention to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests.

It is good to see the Lib Dems taking part and defending their policy. That has not been the case in every one of these debates.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP, I thank the convener and many other members for highlighting Glasgow&#8217;s circumstances. According to the report, it will see a loss of &#163;270&#160;million in spending power as a result of the welfare reforms. Bob Doris was right to say that, in absolute terms, that figure is second only to what Birmingham will lose.</p><p>The figure of a &#163;1.6&#160;billion loss to Scotland, which the committee has obtained, is larger than some of the figures that we have been working from, such as that in the Scottish local government forum against poverty report. It is lower than Citizens Advice Scotland believed it might be, and is substantially lower than the figure that the Scottish Government publicised. It is useful to have independent figures in the public domain, so the report is a significant staging post on the journey towards understanding the likely consequences of and, therefore, what our priorities should be for mitigation of Tory policy and the better prioritisation of spending that is being made by the current Scottish Government. Jackie Baillie was right to highlight the information that was published in The Herald today on that subject.</p><p>We have heard that Scotland is in the middle of the table in terms of the potential impact of the reforms. We are not as badly affected as the north of England, Wales or London, but we are worse off than southern England, excluding London. We sit between the west midlands, which are above us, and the east midlands, which is suffering less of an impact.</p><p>Alex Johnstone was right on one point when he said that the impact in Scotland is also differentiated. The number of people who will be affected in the north-east, excluding Dundee, is much smaller than the number in places such as Glasgow, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire. In other words, the impact will be hardest in areas that are already the most deprived and where services are already the most stretched. When it comes to local authorities putting money in to support council tax benefits, these are the areas in which least money is available. The impact will be felt more by the people for whom life is already more difficult than that of their neighbours.</p><p>Mike Holmes of Enable Scotland gave evidence to the committee and highlighted that point when he talked about a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221;. The point was also highlighted by the SCVO&#8217;s briefing for today&#8217;s debate, although it has not been picked up on. Mike Holmes talked about</p><p>&#8220;changes to services, tightening eligibility criteria, fewer college places and a much harder jobs market&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Welfare Reform Committee, 24 April 2012; c 138.]</p><p>and the already &#8220;shockingly low&#8221; levels of employment that exist among disabled people.</p><p>The changes to uprating, to incapacity benefit and to working tax credit add up to the biggest overall losses in the benefits system across Scotland. The situation on tax credits is particularly disappointing, especially given the role that tax credits played in part of our success in substantially reducing levels of poverty when we were in Government.</p><p>Finally, I want to touch on the bedroom tax. In its briefing for the debate, Barnardo&#8217;s called on us to move our debate beyond the bedroom tax, but it has been highlighted by a number of members this afternoon, and it was most clearly set out by Iain Gray. There is disagreement between Labour and the SNP about how we should respond to the bedroom tax. It is important because significant numbers of people are being affected by it, and because it is an example of a change that is unfair and can readily be understood to be unfair. It therefore presents us with an opportunity to convince the large numbers of people who support punitive welfare changes that the Tory approach is not the right one.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That last&#8212;powers&#8212;is an area of disagreement between Labour and the SNP.

I would add that we also need to take the opportunity that we have been given in the debate to think about how we support the veterans of the invasion of Iraq: those who went from our country, not of their own will but at the command of others.

The first Gulf war raised awareness of veterans&#8217; issues because of the lack of support provided to those who returned. Despite the divisions that ran&#8212;and run&#8212;deep across Britain on the issue, we are able to unite on the respect and admiration that are due to ex-servicemen and women.</p><p>According to Poppyscotland, a number of challenges face veterans, which I think we in the chamber can and should focus on. I was surprised by the points that I am about to make when I first learned of them. I highlight them not in any way to make a point about the Scottish Government, because I recognise that work is continuing on the issue, and I hope that the designation of a minister with responsibility for veterans brings focus to it&#8212;I am sure that it does. However, compared with veterans in England and Wales, veterans living in Scotland are 10 per cent more likely to be homeless, 8 per cent more likely to suffer from mental health problems, 5 per cent more likely to have financial problems, 5 per cent more likely to be in prison and 3 per cent more likely to suffer from alcohol problems.</p><p>None of those things can be about a border, and I do not believe that they can be about a difference in the level of care that Scots have or that the Scottish Government provides.

Many things there have improved, not least because of the removal of Saddam, but it remains the case that people there continue to suffer because what would happen afterwards was not a big enough part of the consideration when the debate raged here and around the world about what would happen next.</p><p>What happens afterwards for military personnel is something that we need to mainstream, not just in the run-up to or aftermath of conflict. Support services for individuals may be required for significant periods of time and we must maintain capacity to provide help when it is needed. Smaller measures&#8212;gestures of respect&#8212;are also important. In Glasgow recently, for example, there was a debate in the city chambers on a proposal, which I think was made by an SNP member, that veterans should have concessionary access to public transport as of right. That is a really small effort but, if it was implemented, it might assist with employability for some of them. More than that, for all of them it is just a tiny token of gratitude for service given.</p><p>On all the issues facing veterans in Scotland today, whether they served in western Europe, Korea, Afghanistan or Basra in Iraq, as my cousin did, I hope that we will use the 10th anniversary of division over conflict to resolve unity on what we can do for those among us who deserve, and should expect, our support.</p><p>I said earlier that I did not have any illusions about why we are having this debate in this place today, and I think that the politics of today are being played out here as much as those of a previous time. However, in the few moments that I have left for my speech I want to return to the Scottish Government motion before us.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree that we should record our tributes to those who paid the costs of Iraq, whether they are our own countrymen or the people of Iraq. I wanted to speak today in order that my name be recorded in the Official Report of this debate and to raise concerns about those who live around us in Scotland who continue to be affected. However, a difficultly is posed for me by the motion&#8217;s final clause, which seems to suggest dismissively that those with whom I disagreed about the need for military action were somehow &#8220;reckless&#8221;&#8212;or feckless&#8212;in their actions or their motivations.</p><p>What I know and remember is that military action in Iraq divided us before it began, it divided us when it was happening and it continues to divide us today.

I was born into a prosperous town in the West Lothian coalfield. Perhaps &#8220;prosperous&#8221; is overstating the situation in Whitburn, but we had the Polkemmet colliery and Levi&#8217;s, and British Leyland was along the road. I was a toddler at the time of the 1984-85 strike, and I often think about the changes that were going on in the world then and what a trial it was for parents bringing up children in those communities. They knew that the world that they had enjoyed was slowly disappearing and that the life chances of my generation and those who came after me were about to change so much. Those communities are still changed.</p><p>Many members of my family were miners, although I will not list them all. As I am speaking without notes, I hope that I can do justice to their experience in the pits and their contribution. As I grew up in that community, it became a very different place from the one that I had been born into. I remember many uncles, family friends and others whom I knew around the town who never worked again.</p><p>One of my proudest moments in the Parliament was taking part in a debate on the upper Clyde shipbuilders. That was one of the first debates that I took part in and I was glad that my grandfather, who was a miner, was able to see me elected to the Parliament and to speak to me about that debate. In the debate, we celebrated the success of men and women taking part in industrial disputes to save their industry and transform their communities and their families&#8217; life chances. That is what happened on the Clyde. We are proud that, as a result of the stance that they took, we are still building ships on the Clyde. O that the miners had been able to achieve the same thing. However, the dignity of the miners&#8217; fight is no less for its having been unsuccessful.</p><p>I see that the minister has been taking notes throughout the debate and I know that she is perfectly capable of throwing away the cabinet secretary&#8217;s previous speeches and remarks on the subject. Given that we are creating a new police force, police Scotland, she might take the opportunity to acknowledge that this is absolutely the time to examine whether there is a case to answer, particularly in relation to Lothian and Borders Police, and to ensure that the new police force genuinely polices communities by consent, in the knowledge that the charges of the past have been answered.</p><p>The miners&#8217; strike of 1984-85 was a UK dispute&#8212;uncles of mine in south Wales were involved, and the issues there will be similar. Given the collusion that went on in relation to the strategies of police forces around the UK, I have no doubt that there was an element of co-ordination from the centre. I do not believe that there could not have been such co-ordination.</p><p>The issue is probably the biggest remaining sore in industrial relations in Scotland. It is unique in that sense, but we need to ensure that what happened can never happen again. That is why it is right that we have an inquiry at the outset of police Scotland&#8217;s operation.</p><p>We need to reflect on which side of history we are on. The right thing to do is to ensure that the dispute is thoroughly examined and that people are held to account. I hope that the Scottish Government can do that for us, and I hope that my party will commit to doing that in government if the Scottish Government does not step up to the plate in the current parliamentary session.

Like members across the chamber, Labour members have made clear that we share the minister&#8217;s aspiration and welcome those initiatives that play a part in transforming the rhetoric in this chamber into realities in our communities, including the lived reality for children in every part of Scotland.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Neil Bibby said that there was a consensus across the parties on the main points of substance. At times, we heard that consensus, particularly in the speeches of Malcolm Chisholm, Dennis Robertson, Mark Griffin and Willie Coffey. Although we disagree on the constitutional points, I thought that Mr Coffey made a series of important points, particularly about the experience in his constituency.</p><p>In order for Scotland to be a great place to grow up, Scotland must become a better place to raise a family. Too many parents are struggling to find work to provide for their families. Those parents need access to appropriate education and training&#8212;that includes places at college&#8212;to maximise their opportunities. Malcolm Chisholm was absolutely right that, for those in work, we need to ensure that work pays and is of a decent quality. Public transport is also important for getting there. Perhaps most important of all, we need to provide for every family in Scotland access to high-quality flexible and affordable childcare.</p><p>Those supports for families are vital to improving the chances of all our children. There is no trade-off between a focus on children and children&#8217;s services and all the other policies that support the good society. Labour&#8217;s amendment and our contributions today have sought to make that clear by including an explicit reference to health and, crucially, housing as well as education. It is important to note that our amendment would delete nothing but seeks simply to add that emphasis.</p><p>In moving our amendment, my colleague Neil Bibby made it clear that Labour also believes that our focus must genuinely be on the life chances of every young Scot. For the children that Mr Bibby and Mr Adam represent in Ferguslie Park in Paisley, for the children whom I know Anne McTaggart spends time with in Drumchapel and for the children that Mr Doris and I represent in Glasgow&#8212;for all of those children across Scotland&#8212;our focus must be on their life chances. We must recognise that the support that is required to make a difference will not be the same in every part of town or even for every family living on the same street.</p><p>We also know that the inequalities that children face because of the financial circumstances of their parents are increased when a child is looked after by another family member or by the state. For children with disabilities or for children in families where someone else experiences a disability, a health problem or&#8212;as Annabel Goldie and Mark McDonald quite rightly reminded us&#8212;an addiction issue, the challenges of life are greatest. Those children are in need of support that targets their specific needs.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s amendment also makes reference to two specific reports, which we were disappointed were not highlighted by the Scottish Government. The first of those is the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report &#8220;Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion in Scotland 2013&#8221;, which highlights the 14-year life expectancy gap between a child from a poor home in my region and that of a child born to a more affluent family. I attended the launch of that report in Glasgow, and Scottish Labour has tried to use the opportunity of today&#8217;s debate to remind ministers of the JRF&#8217;s clear conclusion that children in poverty should not have to wait for independence, which was mentioned as the solution by some SNP members&#8212;I think that George Adam even described it as the only solution to child poverty.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In opening the debate, the Minister for Children and Young People referred to the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition that Scotland should become a great place to grow up for every child.

That shows that one in five children across Scotland lives in poverty.</p><p>As Neil Bibby indicated, we will support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion at decision time, but in our view it is remiss for it not to cover the issues of poverty. Although we may have provoked a boisterous reaction from some SNP back benchers, I think that we have succeeded in putting the issues of poverty into the debate.</p><p>As Neil Bibby said, we will welcome the actions of the Scottish Government where we can, but we will perform our role as an Opposition group by challenging the Government wherever it could do more.

I know that the minister shares that ambition.</p><p>We on this side thought that there was too large an element of self-congratulation in the motion, which seasoned observers of the Scottish National Party will have no doubt been shocked to see. The Government talks about the pace of change. We on this side are not reticent about reminding ministers of our record, which was to introduce free entitlement to early education way back in 1997, just months after winning an election. After six years of the SNP in power, parents are still waiting for those 600 hours of provision. The reality is that too many of Scotland&#8217;s children will have grown up in the time that it takes the SNP to deliver on the promises that it has made.</p><p>The Scottish Government is fond of measuring itself against England; indeed, comparisons with the Tories are the SNP&#8217;s favourite measure of social progress&#8212;although, on this side, being less bad than the Tories is the least that we expect of the Scottish Government.

Like others on this side of the chamber, I have questioned ministers on waiting times on a number of occasions. Although my principal concern has been about what is happening in Glasgow, I have also been in the chamber when colleagues on this side have warned the Scottish Government that things were going wrong and have heard ministers&#8217; denials at every stage of this scandal.</p><p>On the occasions when I have asked questions on this subject, I have sought a simple assurance that none of my constituents in Glasgow has waited longer than they should have because of inappropriate manipulation of waiting lists. However, despite all the heat and noise that have been generated, I have never received such a guarantee and, given that I suspect that I will not get it from the Scottish Government today, I will tell the chamber what Audit Scotland said on that specific question. In his splendid speech, Bob Doris should perhaps have taken note of that report when he claimed that the figures have always been open and transparent, because according to Audit Scotland:</p><p>&#8220;The actual time patients waited is longer than the waiting time reported in national performance reports&#8221;.</p><p>Page 29 of the report makes it clear that although 3 per cent of patients were officially recorded as waiting more than nine weeks, the actual figure was 23 per cent and that</p><p>&#8220;the biggest difference in the number of patients was in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&#8221;</p><p>where the figure was 5,000.</p><p>Since the initial indications of this scandal, there have been assertions, excuses and carefully worded obfuscations. First, the allegations were simply malicious lies that had apparently been made up by the Labour Party, then they were a small and isolated example of malpractice. Then we had internal reports that, it was claimed, were exonerations of board managers when they contained no such thing. A national inquiry by Audit Scotland has revealed startling statistics including an example at the Western infirmary&#8212;a hospital that, along with the Victoria infirmary in Glasgow, is experiencing severe pressures&#8212;of 900 orthopaedic patients with painful conditions who were all apparently socially unavailable at the same time.</p><p>At every stage of this scandal, the Scottish Government and the SNP have denied everything and shouted loudly at anyone who dares to ask them questions. Labour called for a whistleblowers helpline because we did not believe that abuse could be happening without anyone knowing but our request was ignored, then rejected and then finally acceded to only when the denials and inaction became untenable.</p><p>If I have one quibble with the motion that is in front of us today, it is about its suggestion that &#8220;clear&#8221; warnings &#8220;were overlooked&#8221;. I do not think that the warnings &#8220;were overlooked&#8221;; instead, the warnings and those who made them were haughtily dismissed by the very person who made her own career blaming every dropped bedpan in the NHS on the previous Scottish Executive.</p><p>The reason that the Scottish National Party is in such a mess on this issue is simple. When faced with a scandal, the former cabinet secretary did nothing but belittle those who asked her for answers when she should have been asking the questions herself. Nicola Sturgeon is not in the chamber this afternoon but the back benchers who cheered and jeered with her then are now having to defend the latest defence. Indeed, it was good to see the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport back in the chamber to do just that. In the latest defence, the definitions of unavailability are being rewritten; patients themselves might have caused the problems; targets are being decried as the problem; and computers and IT systems are to blame.</p><p>As with college funding and blankets on wards, reality is denied until it confronts the SNP in the face. SNP MSPs who a few weeks ago were still arguing that there was no problem are now falling all over themselves to tell us that they actually understand the problem better than anyone else.</p><p>Neil Findlay was absolutely right. The reality is that there is now a lack of confidence in waiting time data that are provided by the Government. When it was trumpeted that waiting times were falling, social unavailability skyrocketed. When social unavailability was uncovered to be the SNP&#8217;s hidden waiting list and it began to fall, the officially approved waiting time figures somehow went back up again. What a surprise.</p><p>Even now, we are supposed to believe that the problem&#8212;which never actually existed, of course&#8212;has been resolved, but patients are still facing inequalities in how waiting lists are being managed across the country. The result of the legal right to treatment policy, which the Scottish Government signed off, is that my constituents in Glasgow will receive seven days&#8217; notice of an appointment. In Lanarkshire, the notice is three weeks. I say to Mr Doris that patients in Glasgow will have their waiting time clock reset if they turn down one appointment. In Lanarkshire, two appointments will be offered.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Two groups should be at the heart of this debate: the patients to whom waiting time promises are made and the front-line staff who are left to deliver on those promises made by ministers.

Under the SNP, there are 2,000 fewer nurses and midwives in the Scottish NHS, and there is severe pressure on hospitals such as the Western infirmary and the Victoria infirmary, where patients are waiting on trolleys in corridors for eight hours at a time. Across Scotland, A and E waiting time targets have not been met since 2009.

In common with amateurs, many professional and semi-professional musicians love making music, but for most the job of being a musician is unlikely to enrich them in monetary terms.</p><p>The MU&#8217;s excellent publication &#8220;The Working Musician&#8221; is the culmination of a major research project that the MU commissioned last year. In the document, the MU has brought together some sobering statistics about the reality of life for the jobbing musician, which I will share with Parliament and the public at large. More than half of the musicians surveyed by the project&#8212;56 per cent&#8212;earn less than &#163;20,000 a year. Almost two thirds of working musicians are not regularly able to contribute to a pension, and 60 per cent of musicians report that they have worked for free in the past 12 months.</p><p>The evidence detailed in &#8220;The Working Musician&#8221; is the result of a survey of more than 2,000 workers and in-depth interviews with both musicians and industry insiders. Most working musicians are multiskilled; four out of five have been performing for more than five years; two thirds have invested four or more years in learning their craft through formal training and education; and 40 per cent hold a degree in music. Other self-employed workers face some similar challenges, but the situation for musicians is on a different scale. I mentioned pension contributions a moment ago: at present, one in five of all workers are without pension provision and one in three self-employed workers do not have a pension, but only 35 per cent of musicians pay into a pension.</p><p>The MU undertook its research because it suspected that the scale of the problem among its membership was large. However, it was also prompted to undertake the research by the explosion in the numbers of musicians reporting the expectation that they would work for free during the London Olympics. The legacy of the cultural Olympiad should not be impoverished music makers. I therefore ask the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs to consider how we should address that specific issue as we prepare for Glasgow 2014.</p><p>Nearly all of us love music. I enjoy gigs, music festivals and, some colleagues might be surprised to hear, even the odd orchestral performance or opera when I can. We will all have different favourite bands, pubs where we go to hear music, clubs and companies that we support. Why do we all value music, but fail to value musicians?</p><p>The UK and Scottish music industries are extremely successful. Money is made, but it does not always go to those who make music. UK music exports amount to &#163;17&#160;billion a year. The UK is one of only three countries in the world&#8212;the others are Sweden and the United States&#8212;that are net exporters of music. Half of all albums that are sold in the UK are recorded by British artists. The British music market is the third largest in the world, and 10 per cent of all the recorded music that is sold in the world is British. In one year, British orchestras played to UK audiences of 4.18&#160;million, toured in 39 countries, performed 457 concerts overseas and generated an income of nearly &#163;150&#160;million. Britain loves music, and Scotland loves music.</p><p>One of the reasons why I ended up in my city of Glasgow was the live music scene. Glasgow is recognised as one of the world&#8217;s foremost musical places, even by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. As Celtic Connections continues in Glasgow this week, so does the rock, pop and indie scene. Glasgow&#8217;s music scene is legendary, and it stretches across the whole spectrum, from contemporary and classical to Celtic and country music. Its venues are equally varied, and it hosts an average of 130 music events each week, which is more than the figure for any other place in Scotland.</p><p>Many gigging artists, session musicians, orchestra players, music arrangers and teachers are told by promoters in the industry and others, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a great gig for you. Lots of exposure. A great support slot. But sorry&#8212;no pay.&#8221; The industry itself has a lot to answer for. My former Labour colleague Pauline McNeill was closely involved with musicians and promoters in efforts to empower artists and improve their working conditions, but there are problems outside the industry, too. Charities are among the worst offenders. Musicians will often hear the statement, &#8220;It&#8217;s for a good cause.&#8221; Most of us will have attended events&#8212;we will possibly have paid a ticket price for them&#8212;for which the sound person and bar staff have been paid and the venue has been hired, but the musicians have been told, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a budget for music.&#8221;</p><p>Fraser Speirs, who is in the public gallery, has said:</p><p>&#8220;The problem occurs when a charity event approaches asking for a band to play &#8216;just half an hour, maybe an hour at most&#8217; and no fee is available. Often I have financed a four piece band only to discover that the PA company, sound crew, lighting rig and guest speaker have all been engaged at their regular commercial rate&#8221;.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with musicians donating to a cause if they want to do so, but the donation should be just that, not an expectation. Every time a musician gigs for free, the likelihood of others being asked to do so increases. Every time someone has to give up music as a job, every one of us who loves music misses out.</p><p>Like other workers, musicians are facing tough times. Their income is threatened by illegally downloaded music, which means that they have to rely on live performance fees more and more. Making music can be a career, not just a hobby. Professional musicians are like any other professionals and should be recognised as such.</p><p>I do not have much more time available in this short debate. I appeal to the Scottish Government to ensure specifically that, wherever music is part of an event that the Scottish Government is involved in supporting, work is not play, and work should be paid.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683226", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Musicians Union Work not Play Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all those members who supported the motion for the opportunity to have it debated today.

Child benefit has, until this month, been paid on a universal basis, with a recognition that, as a society, we all have a responsibility to all the nation&#8217;s children. Universal provision has had the effect of tying middle-income and higher-income families into a system of support that is provided to all. It has meant that the administration of the system has been easier, and there is less of a danger of those most in need failing to claim.</p><p>As the Deputy First Minister rightly said, child benefit has historically been a benefit paid directly to women for the purposes of supporting children. In the overall architecture of our welfare state, it has always been a crucial component of the welfare system. The decision of the UK coalition parties to attack child benefit has been condemned by my party elsewhere, and I am happy to repeat that Scottish Labour regards the changes that have been made as the wrong approach.</p><p>One of the tests that should be applied to any universal provision is whether its application to all makes it easier to reach those most in need and whether or not the cost of means testing would be proportionate. We in Labour recognise the need for money to be spent wisely. We have always argued that most support should go to those who are most in need. It is regrettable that the reform of child benefit and the callous cap on benefits uprating has resulted in a direct attack on children and cruelty towards the vulnerable, who have been labelled &#8220;skivers&#8221; by the Tories and Liberal Democrats.

Not including cuts to child benefit, new mothers will lose &#163;1,300 during pregnancy and the first year of their child&#8217;s life because of the combination of cuts to maternity pay, pregnancy support and tax credits.</p><p>A further result of the coalition&#8217;s changes is administrative chaos. Richer families will continue to be able to claim child benefit, meaning that the state must pay money out and then attempt to claw it back up to the total amount that was paid in the first place. As a result, it is likely that many more people will find themselves drawn into self-assessment tax for the first time.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister&#8217;s motion rightly makes reference to both benefits uprating and child benefit eligibility, and I agree with much of what she has said about both. The coalition parties have sought to turn benefits uprating into a political football, which is regrettable. Their description of strivers and skivers is simplistic and, frankly, offensive to those who are labelled as the latter. Many of those who are affected by the uprating cap are in work, including many whose only benefit might, until now, have been child benefit. Many are out of work, and there is a whole range of reasons for that. The first, it must be said, is a lack of jobs due to the mismanagement of our economy and the stalling of the recovery.</p><p>I turn now to the part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion which I find slightly less persuasive than the first.

There are a number of problems with that assertion, and I fear that members will be well used to spotting them. First, universal benefits on their own do not necessarily produce fair and equitable outcomes. If Scottish National Party members were genuinely interested in a debate on universality, rather than in trying to score political points against Scottish Labour, they would find it in themselves to acknowledge, as they do in the context of policies in other areas, that fair and equitable outcomes are achieved through a combination of interventions, which must include a targeting of the most support at those who are most in need of help.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Benefit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Labour at Westminster put forward a very clear proposal on the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill that the United Kingdom Government could have followed.

Their voices should therefore be heard in the debate.</p><p>For a range of reasons, the level of need that we face in the city of Glasgow is enormous. As parliamentarians, we need to take responsibility for the decisions that we make that impact on the choices that are available to local representatives on the services that they can deliver.</p><p>Last year, the Health and Sport Committee undertook scrutiny of the Scottish Government&#8217;s Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill, which the Parliament then passed. Self-directed support and the personalisation agenda that Glasgow City Council is pursuing are closely related. As a committee, we took evidence in Glasgow from representatives of service users and carers, and heard their concerns about personalisation. That evidence reflected an experience that I had shortly after I was elected in shadowing an older carer who looked after her adult daughter. The lesson that I learned from both was that change must be communicated sensitively and must be underpinned by genuine assessment of need and an understanding of the impact that change has on individuals.</p><p>The other evidence that we heard in Glasgow was from Glasgow City Council&#8217;s social work department. The scale of the challenge was made clear. Despite Glasgow prioritising resources for social work services, it has a system that has not provided equity of support and has not always provided the right support for every individual.</p><p>I mentioned the prioritisation of the budget, which is important. Glasgow does not have a fair funding settlement and it has very challenging savings to make as a consequence. The prioritisation of social work therefore means deeper cuts in other budgets. That is not easy, so let us not pretend that it is.</p><p>I welcome in particular the fact that savings that might be made by the proposed changes will accrue back to social work services. The &#163;11 million for day centres will therefore remain &#163;11 million that is spent on those services. It is about individual budgets and how specific money is spent, so there is not a cut in that respect.</p><p>The challenge of personalisation and SDS&#8212;which all members in the chamber support and voted for last year&#8212;is that, as needs are assessed or reassessed, or as individuals opt to receive support in different ways, the demand for day centres will decrease. The challenge that the Glasgow situation poses for the Parliament is not just in highlighting dissatisfaction with a particular proposal or in respect of supporting the idea that the old way is necessarily the best way; the challenge is to consider the reality of undertaking greater personalisation and SDS. That move will require the reassessment of need at a time of budget pressure and that will be the case across the country.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Day Centre Reform (Glasgow)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Obviously, I am aware of the concerns about the proposals to restructure Glasgow&#8217;s learning disability day services.

I welcome to the public gallery Alison MacLean, senior Unite the union official for the finance sector, and Jenni Brown, chair of the National Australia Group committee of Unite and chair of the Unite finance sector committee. I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests, which shows that I am a member of the same union.</p><p>The Clydesdale Bank is an important institution in Scottish banking. It was founded in Glasgow in 1838 and it is the personal bank of many Scots and of many small and medium-sized Scottish businesses in all parts of the country. Since 1987, the Clydesdale has been part of National Australia Group but has retained its focus as a Scottish clearing bank, headquartered in Glasgow, continuing to issue Scottish bank notes and giving support to many Scottish causes. That is particularly true in the field of sport, where it has been a sponsor of the Scottish Premier League since 2007 and of the Scottish Commonwealth games team since 2005. There are 300 Clydesdale branches throughout the United Kingdom, but around half of them are in Scotland and Clydesdale employs 3,670 staff here. For all those reasons and more, it is right that the Parliament takes a close interest in Clydesdale and the workers who are employed by it.</p><p>In February, National Australia Group announced a strategic review of its UK operations by Clydesdale, including Yorkshire Bank, and I raised the issue in this chamber with the First Minister. At that time, I wanted to ensure that the most robust defence possible was mounted to protect Scottish jobs both because of the value of the jobs to those who do them and because of the strategic importance to the Scottish banking industry and the wider Scottish economy of this Glasgow institution, which has been the subject of previous speculation about National Australia Group wanting to divest itself of the bank.</p><p>Throughout the review period, I have kept in close contact with the banking section of Unite, and I have asked the First Minister to agree to meet union representatives to discuss their concerns. The Scottish Government met Clydesdale management and I am grateful for that, but I am disappointed that correspondence that I have had with the First Minister appears to indicate that no specific meeting with Unite took place that was focused on the uncertainty that has been experienced by Clydesdale workers.</p><p>Members who have supported the motion in my name will share my concern about the news that has since emerged from the bank&#8212;specifically, the bank&#8217;s decision to close a number of financial solutions centres in Scotland. Two business and private banking centres in Dunfermline and Paisley will close; two so-called &#8220;satellite&#8221; centres at Inverurie and Bearsden will also close; and the business and private bank centre in Stirling will be subsumed into the town branch.</p><p>Those closures reflect the bank&#8217;s desire to cut costs. National Australia Group&#8217;s intention is to withdraw Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank from property development and investment lending and to concentrate their activities on personal lending and private banking accounts. Obviously, I welcome any move that has as its objective the correcting of past mistakes, but the staff who are to retain their jobs will want to be certain that the new course that National Australia Group has set for the Clydesdale is the correct one.</p><p>Prior to today&#8217;s debate, I have been advised by Clydesdale Bank and the union that&#8212;and I welcome this&#8212;many of the affected staff will have the opportunity to transfer within the business and most of those who leave will do so through voluntary redundancy. However, it is a matter of great regret that some will be made compulsorily redundant. The figures that I have been given by the bank indicate that 20 Scottish staff are to be forced out in that way. I understand that a number of staff from across the United Kingdom who are to leave their jobs will do so today.</p><p>In some respects, Glasgow is likely to be a beneficiary of centralisation of some of the bank's activities, so I can hardly fail to welcome any new jobs that might be created in, or moved to, my city. However, that does not lessen my concern that, as a result of the changes, the Scottish banking sector will lose almost 100 jobs, which is up from the previously suggested figure of 60. That follows on from the considerable pain that has been experienced by workers at Clydesdale&#8217;s larger competitors in Scotland over recent years and, indeed, weeks given the news that Lloyds Banking Group is to close its call centre in Motherwell.</p><p>It could be said that Scotland will fare better from the changes at Clydesdale and Yorkshire because the majority of the 1,400 jobs that are going will be lost in other parts of the UK&#8212;in particular, as I understand it, in the south of England. However, redundancy, whether voluntary or compulsory, will be difficult for many of the bank&#8217;s hard-working and loyal staff, particularly&#8212;it may be a clich&#233;&#8212;at this time of year, although, in truth, to be told that one&#8217;s job is no longer required by an employer is always a traumatic experience, whenever and under whatever circumstances it occurs.

I was not sure whether I would get the chance to speak in the debate, so I am glad that you have managed to squeeze me in.</p><p>Earlier, we debated the media. In noting the juxtaposition of that debate with this one, I was struck by the fact that, in the Evening Times and STV Glasgow&#8217;s online news, barely a week goes by without our seeing news of a violent attack in Glasgow city centre or somewhere in the city. Sometimes, such attacks are connected with prostitution, but there are also stranger attacks and a range of other incidents. We can only guess at the number of women who live in fear of violence behind closed doors, at home.</p><p>Violence is a whole-of-society issue and one that crosses class. We have talked about the debate on football and whether there is a connection, with increases in domestic violence around football matches. However, we need to remember that violence against women is something that happens in every section of our society, including among groups of men that we perhaps might not suspect. I am also struck by the fact that there was a violent attack in Glasgow this week in which a man was raped. However, we need to remember that 85 per cent of domestic violence is committed by men against women, so a proper effort to tackle domestic violence needs to be informed by a gender analysis.</p><p>The truth is that violence against women exists in our society because too many of us tolerate it. As Gil Paterson rightly said, it is important that so many of us are here in the Parliament tonight to make our views known. In my view, discrimination against women is a contributory factor to our toleration of men&#8217;s violence against women, as is men&#8217;s attitudes to the sexualisation of women and girls. We should be prepared to say clearly that sex is not a right and that men have no right to demand it, nor to seek it through violence or the threat of violence.</p><p>On my way to the Parliament this morning, I listened to my colleague Kezia Dugdale on the radio discussing the issue of everyday sexism. There is no doubt in my mind that there are connections between discrimination, how we view women, the image that we create for young girls and the issues of violence in our society.</p><p>Recently, I met John Carnochan of the violence reduction unit, and I was impressed by what he told me about the international best practice that exists around encouraging men and everyone in society to interrupt violent abuse where challenging it directly might be not possible. I look forward to the violence reduction unit bringing forward its future work programme and its ideas about how we might implement some of that in Scotland.</p><p>In my view, violence against women by men is more than a symbol of societal sexism. As Gil Paterson rightly said, violence in our society, in homes and on our streets is not just a women&#8217;s issue, but it remains an issue on which a gender analysis is vital. Real men neither hit women nor tolerate other men hitting women.</p><p>I commend Jamie Hepburn and indeed all the speakers in this debate.

I withdrew a previous amendment following the debate at stage 2, in which the minister indicated that he would be willing to think again about the matter. I thank him for his and his officials&#8217; time in meeting me to discuss the amendments last week.</p><p>The issue of independent advocacy goes to the heart of the values that underpin the bill. As I said at stages 1 and 2, our intention is that those who use the services have choice and control, but that choice and control must be exercised meaningfully. The service users&#8217; needs, frustrations and aspirations must be heard loud and clear during the needs assessment process, which underpins the move to greater self-direction. Amendment 23 will considerably improve the bill as drafted, and the minister has moved some way.</p><p>I turn to my amendment 1. I will briefly set out the difference between the minister&#8217;s approach and the approach that I have taken.</p><p>The purpose of my amendment 1 is to ensure not only that independent advocacy is enshrined in the bill in name, but that a right of access to it is established for everyone who might need it. Currently, health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland have a duty to ensure that independent advocacy is available in their area. Infrastructure is already in place, but only half the local authorities have advocacy services that are available to service users with a physical but not a mental disability. If the right and the corresponding duty that my amendment proposes do not exist, it is likely that, in half the local authorities, people who think that their voice is not being heard will not be able to find an independent advocate to help them articulate their views in the process.</p><p>I recognise that not everyone who gave evidence to the committee thought that there was an absolute need for a right to advocacy if there was a clear commitment to the services being in place. At stage 2, some members expressed concern that a right was going too far and that it would place a greater burden on authorities to provide services that would not be necessary for the majority. To be clear again, that would not be the effect of amendment 1.

Amendment 23 puts a duty on local authorities to provide information about independent advocacy wherever the council considers it appropriate to do so. I have spoken about the issue to other members who have been contacted by their constituents, and I continue to believe that information about advocacy should be readily available to all and that a right of access to advocacy should exist for all who consider that they need it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678350", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the minister&#8217;s amendment 23, which puts the term &#8220;independent advocacy&#8221; in the bill.

I must say that, because of my ignorance, I had not fully appreciated that, so it was interesting to hear about it.</p><p>Around the time that the motion was lodged, I was travelling on the evening train back to Glasgow when a call when out for a doctor. When one was not found, the call went out for a first-aider. Some passengers grumbled about the delay, but most of us spared a thought for the train guard. Particularly in this week, we should spare a thought for all workers who are left to administer first aid. We can only imagine how stressful that must be for many of them.</p><p>I am a former member of the Royal Life Saving Society. For three years or so while I was at school and during my studies, I had the opportunity to work as a lifeguard. Luckily, during that time, there were only a very small number of incidents, but I was always struck by the number of people who told me that they would not know what to do in an emergency. It is particularly interesting that the emergency situations that arose were often more to do with the sweetie vending machine than the pool. James Dornan is right to highlight the specific issues about children and choking and the importance of encouraging parents to understand first aid for their kids.</p><p>On water safety, I take the opportunity to make a plea to the minister. I am sure that he shares my view that we need to do a lot more to ensure that all children in Scotland can swim when they leave school, which would make a considerable difference to the number of water incidents in which first aid is required.</p><p>St Andrew&#8217;s first aid week is a time to salute volunteer first-aiders. My dad was a St Andrew&#8217;s volunteer. As a child, I used to wait for the end of his shift, whether it was at the football, the theatre or a local gallery, to hear where he had been and then to ask him how gruesome any incidents that he had dealt with had been. I remember the uniform that he wore, which was probably part of a direct chain of uniforms going right back to the origin of the society. Thanks to Mr Dornan, I now understand better the role that the society played as a uniformed organisation.</p><p>I hope that initiatives such as the current television campaign featuring Vinnie Jones, which encourages us all to understand more about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, raise our awareness about the importance of learning first aid and particularly CPR. In turn, that might lead to further recruitment of volunteer first-aiders.</p><p>I mentioned that children in school should be taught to swim. They should also be taught basic life-saving skills and the importance of first aid. Every child should leave school able to deal with an emergency situation and with a basic understanding of life-saving skills. I have raised that issue with the education ministers through questions, and I appreciate the work that the Scottish Government is doing on it, although I feel that we could do more, rather than leave the matter up to individual local authorities and schools to decide.</p><p>I thank ambulance men and women across the country; all workers who are qualified as first-aiders; and, particularly at this time, all volunteer first-aiders. I encourage all of us who have previously trained to refresh our skills and those who have not yet trained to take the opportunity to learn more about first aid.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish First Aid Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank James Dornan and congratulate him on securing this debate on St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid and its first aid week.

At around the time when I was elected to Parliament, an elderly couple were admitted to hospital, where it was determined that they would need long-term care and would not return home. Unfortunately, the husband died within a few days of being discharged after waiting weeks for a care plan to be put in place. The wife fared better, but her daughter was told that she should accept a place in a home without the father. Causing a fuss would result in the elderly woman being boarded around the hospital, with&#8212;as the nurse pointedly remarked&#8212;all the risk of infection that that would bring.</p><p>At my surgery, I regularly hear similar stories and complaints about the unfair system of charging and cost cutting in elderly care; we all do. However, that case sticks in my mind because the woman who faced the dilemma was my mum, and the couple who were languishing in hospital were my grandparents.</p><p>Given that varying tax is not an option&#8212;we know that, when faced with the issue of tax, the SNP&#8217;s immediate response is to try to cut it&#8212;this Parliament of ours operates on a budget that is largely fixed. New tax and borrowing powers will begin to change that but, for the moment, we have what we have. We know that we will have less to spend next year than we did last year. Debating whether everything that we did yesterday is what we should do tomorrow and discussing where every penny of the same money is prioritised to best effect is not the same as cutting; it is doing what we were elected to this place to do.</p><p>When the history of these years comes to be written, it will be asked how we handled ourselves when the biggest crisis hit. How did we work out what really mattered? How did we ensure that the most vulnerable were not hit harder than ourselves?</p><p>The SNP has been given the opportunity that few Governments get but which this Parliament was created for: to take the hardest decisions together, and to debate honestly and on the basis of evidence. I hope that its bringing forward of this afternoon&#8217;s debate is a sign that the Government is willing to begin to engage on the policies that it trumpets in its motion and the policy areas that it deliberately ignores. If not, people might come to think that the wrong choices were made and that the hard decisions were ducked, all to get a referendum answer that never came.</p><p>The Auditor General has NHS Scotland on amber warning, but we know that health is not the only area that should be of concern. Free personal care is universal, but dignity in old age is not. Bus travel is free for 60-year-olds who commute to work but, at the other end of the spectrum, vulnerable two-year-olds get less support than even the Tories can manage to provide down south. Tuition is free for university students, but college kids can get on the bus to look for a place.</p><p>That is the reality of Scotland. College budgets have been cut by a quarter. Local councils are introducing charges for services that are relied on by the vulnerable in our communities&#8212;people such as Elizabeth, a constituent of mine who lives at Dundasvale Court in the Cowcaddens area of Glasgow. When she contacted me two weeks ago, she said:</p><p>&#8220;Each time I have had a fall I am referred to the Community Falls Prevention Programme&#8221;,</p><p>which is &#8220;a free NHS service&#8221; that is offered to people aged 65 and over who have fallen. She went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;In 2004 the occupational therapist who assessed my needs recommended installation of a community alarm to enable me to summon help if required. I used it for the first time on 5 August 2012 when I fell at home and broke my arm and gashed my face. I received a letter dated 15 October 2012 announcing the introduction of a charge, set at &#163;12.00 per 4 week period. This service is offered to people who&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>in the words of the service&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;live alone, are over 65 years and have health issues that make them liable to fall.&#8221;</p><p>Liz describes herself and people like her as a captive audience for that charge.</p><p>In my city, where the poorest of our citizens still die earlier, where the neediest are being hit hardest, where the efforts that we made in the good times were not sufficient and where already hard lives are, we know, about to be lived harder, I fear that self-congratulation disguised as ideology will do many of the people whom I represent little good at all.</p><p>I support the Labour amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676463", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Universal Benefits"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted that the cabinet secretary has joined the anti-Angus Robertson faction in the SNP Government.

Rather, I simply say that to put what I will say in context. By making a blood donation, a marrow donation, or perhaps a living kidney donation, we are giving a gift and we are benefiting from a unique and rewarding opportunity. It is a gift that is in our own gift.</p><p>An organ donation after death should be no different, but Kenny Gibson was right to say that under the current system we have no guarantee that decisions taken in life will be respected in death. We know that 90 per cent of Scots support organ donation, but that fewer than half of us carry the donor card. However, only a tiny percentage of us will die in circumstances in which organ donation might be possible. At present, the gift is not our own, but rather might be for our relatives to make for us.</p><p>Despite progress in improving our system, the fundamental problem with our register and the way in which we ask people to make this difficult choice remain. I believe that a change from an opt-in to an opt-out register would help to support families who are unsure of what they should do&#8212;and we know that many families who say no go on to regret the choice they made for their loved one. Such a change would mean that those who wish to donate could have greater confidence that their wishes would be respected and we know, because the evidence tells us, that it would increase the number of donations.</p><p>That simple change would save lives. The change would be simple and there is evidence that 70 per cent of us already support such a move, even though we have not yet had the detailed debate that might reassure many of those who have concerns. The change is not one that I instinctively supported, but I came to understand it as others helped to bust the myths of so-called presumed consent. Whether there is an opt-in or opt-out register, the fundamental choice remains the same. The choice to give remains something that we should celebrate, not take for granted.</p><p>Faced as lawmakers with 650 people on organ waiting lists, we have the responsibility not to remove the choice but to make the choice as easy as possible. More than 40 members have signed this motion&#8212;I make an effort to sign as many of Mr Gibson&#8217;s many motions as I can&#8212;and almost 60 of us signed a previous motion recognising the Evening Times campaign on this matter, which was supported by 10,000 of the paper&#8217;s readers.</p><p>With the Government&#8217;s support, we could make this change and save lives. I called the change simple, but I acknowledge that reassurance would be required. As Patricia Ferguson and others have pointed out, safeguards would be complex; new procedures would need to be detailed; and, as Kenny Gibson rightly made clear, a significant public information campaign would be essential before we could use any new register. Even if we all agreed today to do this, change would be years off and, in the meantime, more people will die.</p><p>For that reason, I consider the debate to be both timely and urgent. As the new Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has previously indicated his personal support for opt-outs, I hope that the minister will indicate when he sums up whether the Scottish Government will introduce a bill to achieve the change that we seek. If the Government is not minded to legislate, I can tell the chamber that I have had initial discussions with the non-Government bills unit and the BMA and am considering lodging as an alternative way forward a proposal modelled on the bill that Labour has introduced in the Welsh Assembly.</p><p>At this week&#8217;s meeting of the Health and Sport Committee, the cabinet secretary said that although he often looked to the Opposition for ideas he very often did not like the ones he saw. In truth&#8212;and as speeches from all round the chamber have demonstrated&#8212;this is not a party-political matter, but I ask the Government to meet me, perhaps Mr Gibson and any other member who would like to be involved in making this change happen.

Students at the University of Glasgow have raised the issues with me, and many of the concerns are common. I want to use my time to talk about why we need people from the broadest range of backgrounds in legal practice.</p><p>As Kezia Dugdale rightly reminded us, the law is not all about criminal defence&#8212;we should be thankful for that&#8212;and crime is not simply an issue for more disadvantaged communities. However, it remains the case that people from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to find themselves drawn into activities that are on the wrong side of the law. Equally, people who live in less advantaged areas are substantially more likely to be victims of many kinds of crime. I am not saying that a person has to live on a council estate in order to understand the issues&#8212;I am sure that David McLetchie will be pleased to hear that that is not my argument. However, Jenny Marra and Alison Johnstone were right to remind us that, just as in politics, it helps if those involved in our legal system recognise the communities and families that they work with rather than see them as a class apart.</p><p>The minister will no doubt argue that a move from grants to loans to assist students studying for the legal diploma will allow us to support more individuals. However, the Scottish Government must recognise that the view of almost everyone else is that the changes will not result in a widening of the mix of people in the law. Since I assume that the Scottish Government accepts&#8212;it is well evidenced, as Rod Campbell highlighted&#8212;that the law is a profession in which the mix of people in practice is already not as it should be, the Government must then consider extremely carefully the criticisms that are being made of its policy.</p><p>Students studying law are more likely to drop out of the subject if they come from a poorer background, and students from poorer families are more likely to be concerned about debt. They are then less likely, even at the moment, to try to obtain their diploma, because they are more concerned about whether they will find a traineeship at the end of it. Ultimately, they need to find a job with more urgency than others who can afford to take the traineeship risk. Legal traineeships are unbelievably difficult to find in the current environment. It is to the Government&#8217;s great discredit that that is a significant problem in schemes such as the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service scheme, as well as schemes in commercial practice.</p><p>Law graduates are faced with the likelihood of unemployment at the end of their diploma, which is of time-limited value, or at the end of a traineeship when they find that they have been used as cheap labour and are disposed of for the next trainee. Any new barrier on the route to legal practice will have the effect of making law graduates from less well-off backgrounds less likely to try to enter practice. That is a legitimate concern to which the Scottish Government should listen.</p><p>I am aware of law students who have argued that the Law Society should abandon the minimum recommended salary for legal trainees because middle-class law graduates think that that is a barrier to small firms offering them traineeship opportunities. The implications of such a move for less well-off graduates are simply appalling: it would serve to extend the iniquities in the profession.</p><p>I say to the minister, the Law Society, the profession and the universities that they must take heed of Sarah Boyack&#8217;s call both for a coming together that recognises that access is being eroded and for a clear action plan to ensure that at the end of the recession we are not left with a legal community that looks more like the profession in the 1950s than the profession in 2005. If that means thinking again about the move from grants to loans, the Government should consider that. Equally, if it means a change in the way in which we train lawyers&#8212;a questioning of whether a seven-year journey from undergraduate to practice-qualified solicitor is reasonable and whether we as a society are prepared to support law students in the same way as we continue to support medical students and others&#8212;we should consider that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673005", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diploma in Professional Legal Practice (Access)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Sarah Boyack for lodging the motion.

If the purpose of the bill is to provide a framework for a more personalised system of social care, independent living or, as Richard Lyle would have it, freedom, the key point that the Parliament should understand is the level of service personalisation that users are able to direct already. I thought that Christina McKelvie, Liam McArthur and Mary Fee made it clear that, despite personalisation being a long-held objective of the Parliament, the situation across the country continues to vary enormously.</p><p>Variation in the services that people choose to make use of is no bad thing and, indeed, creating more flexible services that are better tailored to the needs of individuals is the goal of the proposed legislation. Scottish Labour shares the Government&#8217;s belief that the problem, in that respect, is not too much variation in individual care packages but, rather, too much variation in the choice and control that individuals exercise over their own care or support. In the case of those who require support to meaningfully exercise choice and control, the chances of self-direction are often slim.</p><p>The Government has set out in the bill a description of what a budget for self-directed support could be used for. By enshrining a right to self-directed support in law, Parliament is providing users of social care with a menu of four options. Those were set out by the minister, Richard Lyle, Duncan McNeil and others, and I will not repeat them. The committee heard and, indeed, proactively found, a number of examples of how such an approach&#8212;or components of it&#8212;is working in different parts of Scotland. However, Parliament should be clear that increasing direct payments&#8212;we should not forget that that has been a feature of our social care system for longer than the Parliament has been in existence&#8212;should not necessarily be the only or most important goal of self-directed support. Increasing direct payments should not be seen as the only measure of success, or the sole indicator of systemic change. Changes in the process of selecting and, ultimately, procuring social care, will not, in and of itself, lead to an improvement in the standards of social care provided or a better experience for those who are assessed as requiring support.</p><p>At a time of significant change in the welfare system and budgetary pressures in local authorities, as members across the chamber have said, there is a considerable risk that some will see SDS as an opportunity not to drive up quality, but to cut costs. Malcolm Chisholm pointed out that the bill comes in advance of changes that are needed to ensure adequate integration of health and social care, and that presents a significant risk to the legislation achieving the Government&#8217;s intended effects.</p><p>Scottish Labour believes that the most urgent change needed in social care is an improvement in quality with an emphasis on respect for&#8212;yes&#8212;choice and control but also for human dignity and fairness across Scotland. To deliver that, Labour believes in a more radical shift towards a national care service, based on local delivery and control, but with minimum standards of care to end the postcode lottery, as Jackie Baillie set out. We look forward to the minister&#8217;s continuing discussions with COSLA to ensure that postcode charging becomes a thing of the past.</p><p>Members have highlighted a number of other areas of concern. Siobhan McMahon talked about the greater focus that is required on how direct payments will be ended, when the need for them has passed. There also remain questions about whether the regulation of those employed through direct payments is all that it should be. Support for carers is spend to save, and there will continue to be questions about whether we are getting the right balance between support to carers and the desire to put the cared-for at the heart of the new regime. Equally, the appropriate role for family members&#8212;often&#8212;in a system that puts greater emphasis on individuals making their own choices and controlling their own budgets is an issue that I suspect Parliament will return to whether the bill passes in its current form or not, and I hope that the Government front bench will continue to have regard to the comments of both Gil Paterson and Fiona McLeod.</p><p>The interests of those who work in the care sector should also be considered, as should the regulation of workers such as PAs. As a member of the committee, I feel that it would have been useful to hear more directly, through oral evidence, from people who work in the care sector&#8212;I know that we received written evidence from such people.</p><p>The final and most substantial concern that I want to reflect on relates to the call for an enshrined right to advocacy. As well as having a right to make choices and exercise control, service users also have a right&#8212;which they may need&#8212;to the appropriate level of support to make their choices and control meaningful, as I said earlier.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As another member of the Health and Sport Committee, I too associate myself with the remarks that others have made about the clerking team and, as Jackson Carlaw did, pay tribute to Duncan McNeil for the powerful way in which he set out the committee&#8217;s approach in examining the bill.

The Government&#8217;s working group on appeals and review is welcome but, as Duncan McNeil argued, it is vital that the Government is mindful of the evidence that the committee heard that a complaints procedure is not a substitute for an appeals process.

It is a custom that is largely followed regardless of whether the topic being debated is of any real interest or relevance to anyone beyond the constituencies and regions of a handful of members. However, on this occasion Ken Macintosh has brought forward a debate in the chamber that is not just relevant, timely, interesting and important but potentially revolutionary&#8212;if Mr Macintosh will forgive me for calling him names.</p><p>Congratulations should also go to Oxfam for the work that it has done and for the way in which it has brought the ideas to public prominence. Oxfam describes the humankind index as being</p><p>&#8220;about valuing the things that really matter to the people of Scotland&#8221;</p><p>including</p><p>&#8220;social relations ... health and skills ... physical environment ... natural context, and ... financial assets.&#8221;</p><p>Those ideas are not unique to Oxfam&#8212;they are part of a wider and growing movement in research, presentation of information and campaigning that seeks to challenge how we value the real wealth in the world around us. Similar ideas have been expressed around the creation and maintenance of more equal societies, and broader measurements are critical to being able genuinely to understand and promote preventative spending measures.</p><p>As Ken Macintosh said, it is welcome that even the UK coalition, not a Government that is known for doing much to promote wellbeing, has at least signalled its intention to begin measuring the very things to which it is doing so much damage.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s own Scotland performs system is a welcome but limited example of those ideas being taken up by the state. Like Mr Macintosh and Mr Park, I am not yet convinced that measurements made in that process are genuinely driving policy choices in Scotland, but I am hopeful that it will become increasingly more useful. I also hope that the suggestions made by Oxfam&#8212;and supported by an impressive list of others&#8212;for changes to the national performance framework have been taken on board. I am sure that the cabinet secretary will say more about that in his closing speech.</p><p>It is a sign of the widespread interest in and appeal of the measures that, as others have said, so many organisations have sent members briefings for the debate. They include the church, as Patrick Harvie importantly reminded us, the voluntary sector and trade unions. Conversations around better and more real forms of measuring success and lack of success are commonplace in the voluntary and campaigning sector and also among health promoters, of whom I used to be one.</p><p>The Labour movement and before that the anti-slavery movement grew out of ideas that people were worth much more than their productivity as workers. It can be too easy for the left to glibly accept initiatives such as the humankind index and assume that they simply reinforce our own world view. In fact, the challenge is just as much to us and others like us who believe in decent work as a route to a better life. At this time, when, as the humankind index tells us, 43 per cent of Scots report a fall in their personal sense of financial security, job creation is a vital responsibility of Government. The view that promoting economic growth as measured by GDP is the way to do that creates a challenge for us, as it can reduce all policy decisions to what is best for growth, which can then become about what is best for business or best for Government. The humankind index encourages us to remember that the creation of a better country means better lives for people&#8212;not just a long dance with powerful and persuasive interests that is justified on the grounds of job creation.</p><p>Oxfam Scotland describes the humankind index as measuring what makes a good life.

As this is an enabling bill, the regulations that arise will form the main substance of the interaction between welfare reform and links to passported benefits.</p><p>As a former member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, I understand that there are three types of procedure for dealing with such legislation: negative, affirmative and super-affirmative. Instead of seeking to lecture those more experienced than myself, I will simply trust that members across the chamber understand the differences between each. Suffice it to say, however, that moving from negative to affirmative procedure would mean that the regulations would become subject to a vote in Parliament.</p><p>Stakeholders who have made representations to the Welfare Reform Committee and who have lobbied in support of amendments 1 and 2 are concerned that the regulations should be right as well as timely. The timescales for both negative and affirmative procedure are the same&#8212;40 days&#8212;and many of the charities and others who support the amendments initially preferred the use of super-affirmative procedure to guarantee maximum scrutiny and the widest possible consideration. However, they have come to accept the compromise of affirmative procedure because they are as concerned as the cabinet secretary is that the tight timescales to which the Scottish Government must work are adhered to.

As we come to the conclusion of the Parliament&#8217;s consideration of the bill, we start to look towards the future and, as the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has said, we begin to think about moving from process to principle.</p><p>In the three debates that we have had on the subject of welfare reform in this session so far, beginning with the issue of the legislative consent motion and then consideration of the Scottish Government&#8217;s legislative proposals, Labour and Scottish National Party members have been largely united in our opposition to many aspects of the reforms to our welfare state that the coalition Government has embarked on.</p><p>At each stage, however, we have been at pains to point out that elements of the changes could have been an opportunity to make the welfare system fairer rather than more draconian. People across the United Kingdom and here in Scotland want a system of benefits that ensures that support is provided to those who need it when they are unable to work or unable to find work. At the heart of our welfare state should be a contributory principle that makes clear our duties to pay in when and if we can in order that we receive assistance when it is needed. Too many of the changes seem to be based solely on a desire to bring down the benefits bill, rather than seek the right balance between support that is affordable and support that is there when anyone needs it.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate, I quoted Ian Galloway of the Church of Scotland church and society council, who said at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland this year:</p><p>&#8220;If austerity means that we all have to tighten our belts, and perhaps especially those who can most afford it, then so be it. But what is really happening is that the most vulnerable are being punished out of all proportion.&#8221;</p><p>That concern, which has been highlighted by groups representing disabled people, social landlords, childrens&#8217; charities and many others, was one of the major influences on Scottish Labour when we argued that the LCM on welfare reform should not be nodded through and that distinct Scottish legislation should be brought forward if required. The resulting bill is, of course, as the cabinet secretary said, enabling legislation that is concerned with putting in place a framework for how regulations will be brought forward that connect both devolved and reserved benefits.</p><p>So-called passported benefits are rightly at the heart of the issue. Capability Scotland, for example, has pointed to the blue badge parking permits, bus passes, leisure cards and energy assistance programmes, because eligibility for each is assessed through receipt of a UK welfare benefit. However, the truth is that the impact of welfare reform could be so large that even at this point we still do not know the true extent of the problems or the opportunities that it may create for the Scottish Government, local councils and others. The Welfare Reform Committee suggested that some &#163;2.5 billion could be taken out of the pockets of poorer people in Scotland. In Glasgow, which the cabinet secretary and I represent, as well as in many other areas, it will also mean that money will be taken from shop tills and from social housing providers.</p><p>Labour supported the general principles of the bill at stage 1. Throughout stage 2 and in our amendments today we sought to improve it by advocating the concerns of those most closely involved with the delivery of services and the representation of those groups most affected. It has been a good process and the Government has engaged with the issues. We did not seek to lodge amendments that did not have the support of people in the sector. For example, there were concerns about the wide-ranging nature of the regulatory powers that ministers were taking without there being any sunset clause. However, we decided not to lodge amendments on that or on other possibly contentious issues.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In its stage 1 report on the bill, the Welfare Reform Committee referred to the evidence that it had considered as &#8220;unrelentingly depressing&#8221;.

For the avoidance of doubt I should make it clear that the Scottish Labour Party will support the bill at decision time.</p><p>In the earlier debate I said that we should remember that this will be a unique piece of legislation and the cabinet secretary has outlined that that is her view too. The legislation began life with a partial&#8212;but unprecedented&#8212;rejection of an LCM, which Labour pushed for. It resulted in the establishment of a special committee, which was pushed for by the voluntary sector. There has been a wide-ranging and vital engagement in the issues&#8212;despite the sense of urgency hanging over us to get the legislation right and to get it in place quickly.</p><p>The work of the Welfare Reform Committee will no doubt go on. In many respects the detail of what will happen next will have to be worked out over the summer and considered when the Parliament returns. Indeed the cabinet secretary indicated that there will be further consultation into the autumn.</p><p>For their part, many of the charities with a close interest in the bill have turned their attention towards implementation. There has already been some debate about what that might mean, including in the pages of Third Force News.</p><p>Labour considers that receipt of universal credit or personal independent&#8212;sorry, independence&#8212;payments should become a passport to devolved benefits. I have obviously been listening to the psychologist too much and I cannot say that word now either. We also believe that all those who are currently eligible for a devolved benefit should remain so.</p><p>In the stage 1 debate I asked the cabinet secretary to consider the position of advice services and to right the wrong that the Scottish Government has been involved in by pocketing the money for advice services that arises from the UK welfare reform changes. I pointed to the example of the Welsh Assembly Government, which has invested considerably in its citizens advice bureaux to help them to cope with the huge increase in demand that welfare reform will no doubt create.</p><p>There will be difficult choices ahead in this process and the test, in my view and in the view of Labour, will be whether those choices are made fairly and not arbitrarily.</p><p>The bill is not one that either the Government or the Opposition would wish to be necessary, but it is necessary.

The union of today recognises the will of the Scottish people for a Parliament of their own. Home rule within the union is in my view the best of both worlds. Devolution has allowed people who live in Scotland, who, as the First Minister puts it, care most about Scotland, to take decisions.

We all expect that there is a role for assessment to ensure that people get what they are entitled to and what they require. There is no role for assessment to be used to harass people or to attempt to punish them through bureaucracy.</p><p>Labour and the SNP have come together to agree that another way must be found. In rejecting the most offensive parts of the LCM, we agreed to set up a special committee of this Parliament, and the Scottish Government introduced its bill, which we have debated today at stage 1.</p><p>Jackie Baillie made it clear that the Labour Party supports the general principles of the bill. However, the test should be whether the bill meets the expectations and intentions that we had when we embarked upon the legislative process.</p><p>We should remember that we have been debating a unique piece of legislation this afternoon, as was highlighted by Michael McMahon and most recently by Elaine Murray. This is the first time that this place has rejected UK proposals in an area where a UK solution would, in our view, have been desirable and where the bulk of power and legislative authority resides at the UK level.</p><p>At the outset, the Scottish Parliament was clear. We wanted a Scottish welfare reform bill that put in place a framework to ensure that benefits could be provided to those who require them, and a bill that did that in a timescale that met both our needs and, more important, the needs of those people. We wanted a bill that provided new ways of testing eligibility for passported benefits. We wanted clarity to ensure that devolution of the social fund works to assist anyone who needs to rely on it. Most important, we wanted a bill that mitigated the worst effects of the UK Welfare Reform Act 2012 in respect of the devolved aspects.</p><p>We also wanted an opportunity for public debate about what assistance and support the Scottish Government and local government should provide. We wanted a workable set of proposals that local government and others would be able to implement and which provided the appropriate resources to ensure that they could do their jobs.</p><p>All in all, that was a lot to expect from a short bill that largely provides enabling powers, and Labour members and others have raised concerns about whether the bill lives up to our expectations of it. We heard concerns from Siobhan McMahon about community care grants, from Anne McTaggart about financial and digital inclusion, from Margaret McDougall about housing benefit, and from both Margaret McDougall and Margaret Burgess about advice services, to which I will return later.</p><p>In effect, what we have is enabling legislation that could provide interim measures that are designed to safeguard the entitlements of those who rely on any or several benefits that are provided by devolved or local policies. That is welcome. Furthermore, we appear to have support for the principle that new applicants in groups that are currently eligible for a passported benefit should have access to what they need regardless of what future support they might have under universal credit. That is also welcome, if that is what the cabinet secretary is committing to today.</p><p>We now need much more work to be done on how that future eligibility will be assessed. In that regard, the scrutiny role of the Parliament and the committee that it set up for this express purpose will continue to be vital. The committee&#8217;s ability to work together and provide the required level of scrutiny has perhaps not been the best example of how that should be done, as we have heard today. However, it should be a clear conclusion of the stage 1 debate and the debate that has taken place in the voluntary sector that the further powers that the Scottish Government is seeking to take require a robust procedure that involves the affirmation of the Scottish Parliament. All of us who are signed up to doing something about this deserve no less, and the cabinet secretary should welcome the challenges to ensure that we are doing all that we can to mitigate, rather than demand acquiescence to the view that the Government always knows best.</p><p>Elaine Murray was right to point out that it is regrettable that the First Minister missed the joint ministerial committee meeting today, but I am sure that we are all pleased to see that the Minister for Public Health has hot-footed it back from that meeting. We look forward to hearing what information the UK Government provided. As we heard in the debate, it has been a frustration of the committee that it has not received more information from the UK Government, so I hope that more information was provided today.</p><p>We should be clear that the consultation that will follow the bill should be as full and active as possible. As Michael McMahon said, it needs to be based on draft regulations. We need to consult on proposals, because people need to know what they are commenting on and what the options are. I commend the Poverty Alliance for its evidence and its participation in the change model, which was showcased recently at the poverty assembly and which is one way of showing how people who rely on benefits should be involved in shaping what happens next.</p><p>The clear conclusion that I believe should be taken from this debate and from the evidence that the committee heard at stage 1 is that we need to do much more on the provision of information and advice as full implementation of the attacks on our welfare state draws nearer. Margaret Burgess was right to raise that point. Last year, our CABx dealt with 203,462 new benefit cases, which represented a third of their total case load, but in the same year funding for their advice services fell by 9 per cent.</p><p>All the indications are that demand will explode as benefit cuts are implemented and anxiety about new assessments increases. That could result in advice services in Scotland simply grinding to a halt. In contrast, the Scottish Government is accruing &#163;1.7 million a year in consequentials due to increases in advice service funding in England and Wales. Why are we still waiting for the SNP to pass on that money to the front line?</p><p>Understanding what is happening to real lives out there is the Government&#8217;s test on welfare reform. Arguing over words and lines in a committee report is not the response that Scotland needs from its Parliament. Pocketing cash that could make a difference to the cash in the pockets of real people is not what is expected of the Scottish Government. Further, any attempt by the Government to obfuscate future parliamentary scrutiny of its actions by seeking to make use of a less onerous scrutiny procedure will not do either the SNP or the people whom we are trying to help any good whatsoever.</p><p>We will support the bill at stage 1, but I hope that the cabinet secretary will reflect seriously on the concerns that have been raised in this debate and that will no doubt be raised as we go forward to stage 2, and try to put in place a bill that can do what we all want it to do, which is to mitigate the effects of the welfare reforms.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667406", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The member almost makes a reasonable point.

I hope that the exhibition, which has been given considerable support by the Scottish trade union movement and by Glasgow City Council, is a considerable success.</p><p>Glasgow has a vibrant and exciting art scene. It is also a very political city, as I was reminded on Sunday when we celebrated May day&#8212;international workers day. The combination of art and politics is therefore not an unusual one for Glaswegians.</p><p>Glasgow is also a friend of the Cuban people. While Alex Mosson was Lord Provost of Glasgow he was instrumental in signing the Glasgow-Havana partnership, which formally twinned the Clydeside to the Caribbean in 2002. I understand that when Alex Mosson shook hands with one Raul Castro to symbolise that agreement, the heavens opened and the Cubans were treated to a good west coast downpour. It was fitting that at that time Glasgow also played host to a festival that celebrated not just Cuban art, but Cuban music. I am sure&#8212;and I am sure that Elaine Smith is too, given her reference to it earlier&#8212;that Havana Club rum was also enjoyed by many Glaswegians on that occasion and in that celebration.</p><p>Cuba is a huge country that is much bigger than Britain, but it has a population of just 11 million. The revolution has led to steps forward that socialists on these islands would wish to highlight, such as the high standards of Cuba&#8217;s universal healthcare system and its long-standing position as one of the world&#8217;s most generous givers of international aid, despite its comparative position as a poor country.</p><p>The Presiding Officer will be aware that the Cuban people are not able to enjoy the best of relations with all their neighbours, not least because of the hostility to the revolution that still exists in the United States.</p><p>I had the privilege of hearing Rosa Aurora, the wife of one of the Miami five, speak at the Glasgow May day rally. I note the statement that was provided by Amnesty International yesterday. Of course, Amnesty is not an organisation that has been uncritical of Cuba, and it has raised concerns about human rights, which I would certainly wish to see upheld in Cuba as in any country&#8212;that applies just as much to the United States in relation to the Miami five. I associate myself with Amnesty&#8217;s comments that the men&#8217;s trial was unfair, and I very much hope that the United States will change its policy in relation to Cuba by ending the blockade, and that friendly relations, such as those that the United Kingdom has enjoyed with the island, can come about.</p><p>In August 2011, the United Kingdom signed a bilateral agreement with Cuba that sought to foster closer relations and partnerships, including in the cultural arena. The Minister for Parliamentary Business and Chief Whip will be aware that I asked the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs in written questions about what the Scottish Government was doing to improve its relationship and to contribute to the United Kingdom&#8217;s policy of partnership at that time. I was disappointed by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s answer, which suggested that improving links with Cuba, despite the Glasgow-Havana link, was not a priority.</p><p>I hope that when he winds up, the minister will say a little more about what can be done as a result of the debate and the important visit by Her Excellency the Cuban ambassador to extend a hand of friendship from the Parliament across the Atlantic.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666424", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cuba"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Patricia Ferguson, Scottish Labour&#8217;s spokesperson on culture and external affairs, has asked me to pass on her apologies.

As a member of the Welfare Reform Committee, I have taken a close interest in the cumulative effect of the changes. Taken together, the package represents a serious attack on the principles of a contributory welfare system&#8212;a system to which we all pay in when we can in the expectation that we will be supported, at least to a minimal level, when we need help. There is no doubt in my mind that the changes will further increase levels of poverty across Scotland and the UK and in my city of Glasgow.</p><p>I am aware of constituents who have already experienced hardship as a result of the changes to local housing allowance. I am particularly concerned about the impact that that will have on women and children. Maeve Sherlock outlined many of the reasons for that in her excellent speech in a debate that took place last year in the House of Lords. Anyone who is not convinced by the seriousness of the risks that the changes pose should read her demolition of the UK Government policy in Hansard, in which she describes how single mothers will be forced from work and from their local area, where they might rely on other family members to support childcare. That could happen because of a cut of just &#163;12 a week, an amount that Baroness Sherlock rightly says could just as well be &#163;1,200 to a mother on a low income&#8212;&#163;12 a week could be the cost of a pair of children&#8217;s shoes or of putting a family meal on the table.</p><p>The changes to housing benefit will force families to move. In my area, that is likely to mean that single people without children who are on low incomes will be shunted into the city from the surrounding areas. In Glasgow, there are more than 1,500 single housing benefit recipients who are aged between 25 and 34. They could be forced to move from communities in which they might have grown up to something that is frankly close to a ghetto. The likely beneficiaries will be the private landlords who make money from cramming people into tenement flats that have been designated as houses in multiple occupation.</p><p>I do not have time to discuss the hugely disturbing effect that the changes will have on social landlords. Their risks will rise and their incomes will fall. The higher levels of rent arrears and the cost of recovering rents will diminish their capacity to borrow to fund new housing or improvements to existing stock. That is before I even get to the economic and, just as important, social cost of eviction.</p><p>As members have said, we in this Parliament should be concerned about the impact that all that will have on our efforts to beat homelessness. I commend the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s report on the 2012 homelessness target. In Glasgow, we have the highest level of homeless applications, but we are already 90 per cent of the way towards meeting the target. We have rightly closed large-scale homeless hostels, but there is a real danger that they will return because of the shortage of temporary furnished flats, which are the key option in eradicating homelessness.</p><p>In my view, therefore, the housing benefit changes represent the single biggest housing policy intervention in Scotland since the Parliament passed its groundbreaking homelessness legislation. In this case, and particularly for the coalition parties, that should be a cause of shame rather than pride.</p><p>We have not heard whether the Government will support the amendment in the name of my colleague Elaine Murray, which seeks to encourage the Scottish Government not simply to lament what the coalition is forcing on us, but to produce a clear strategy to mitigate the worst excesses of Tory misrule. My colleague Margaret McDougall outlined a number of areas in which the Government could do that, such as allocation policy and the difficulties with online applications&#8212;although, unfortunately, the Scottish Government has cut the budget for digital inclusion. The Labour Party has always argued that the Parliament should have that role should we ever find ourselves in this situation. Today&#8217;s poll tax is called the bedroom tax.</p><p>The Scottish Government claims that it wants control of the whole benefits system, but it must demonstrate its political will with the powers that are already at its disposal to mitigate the worst effects. I take Bob Doris&#8217;s point that it will not be possible to mitigate them all, but we need a clear plan to mitigate what we can.</p><p>In great challenge comes opportunity, but in grasping the opportunity the Scottish Government must understand that it will be required to make choices about its priorities in changed circumstances and that it must put resources as well as rhetoric behind the plan that it must develop and present to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is not possible to wholly separate the housing benefit issues from the wider programme of welfare reform.

We all agreed that Scotland has a negative relationship with alcohol, and that that relationship should be challenged. That is a bold statement.</p><p>Through its production and sale, alcohol is an important and integral part of our economy. It is a part of life. We drink to wet the baby&#8217;s head and we buy pints for our friends, when&#8212;if not before&#8212;they reach the date of majority. We celebrate success with champagne&#8212;or some of us do&#8212;and some of us drink to unwind or to socialise in the pub on a Friday afternoon, or we go home to a glass of supermarket wine. After our debates in the chamber this afternoon, many members will head downstairs to mark Commonwealth day. An alcoholic beverage will be offered at the bottom of the steps and a proportion of members will accept a glass, some perhaps keeping an eye out for a second one. Alcohol creates jobs and sustains industries. We know that it is a popular part of life.</p><p>I do not believe that we need to ban alcohol from this building or from our supermarkets. The negative impact of alcohol comes because of harms that are largely a result of alcohol abuse and overreliance on drink&#8212;that is what separates drinking from smoking, at least to some extent. Tackling Scotland&#8217;s drinking problem, by which we mean tackling drinking that has become a problem, along with tackling the problems that lead to alcohol abuse and those that abuse can cause, is an issue on which we agree in the chamber. We do not need to divide on it, or imply any division or lack of commitment on the part of others.</p><p>As a committee, we agreed that tackling problem drinking requires a range of responses. I welcome and agree with much of the alcohol framework, which was written in partnership with experts, and I commend everything that the Government has done to advance that agenda. Similarly, I welcome the proposals introduced by my colleagues Dr Richard Simpson, who is a former consultant in addictions, and Graeme Pearson, who has served at every level of policing in Scotland. They are both much more expert than I am and, indeed, than many of the rest of us are. The Government believes, and the cabinet secretary has argued, that minimum pricing is the most pressing legislative change that needs to be made next, and now.</p><p>Before I came to this place, I had no strong view on minimum pricing, but I was certainly aware that my party&#8217;s opposition to it had not brought us any particular electoral advantage. Now I am here, and find myself a Health and Sport Committee member, and I discover that the majority view of committee members is that the evidence that we received in support of minimum pricing was &#8220;overwhelming and compelling&#8221;. The witnesses from whom we heard, and their range of views, were interesting, intriguing and persuasive in some cases, but that their evidence was overwhelming and compelling was not the conclusion that I reached.</p><p>Indeed, when the cabinet secretary gave evidence, she did not claim that an overwhelming and compelling case existed somewhere else in the world, or from hypotheses, to show that minimum pricing would definitely work exactly in the way that a theoretical model suggested, with no unforeseen consequences and no disproportionate impact on those with lower incomes. Instead, she argued, perfectly legitimately, that on balance there was a case for trying the measure, and she accepted that even if it delivered all that she hoped for it would not be a silver bullet. I ask Parliament to draw its own conclusions about how a majority of committee members managed to find the Government&#8217;s proposals even more impressive than the Government itself claimed them to be.</p><p>I do not dispute that there is a link between price and consumption, and I agree that overconsumption can undoubtedly lead to harm. The evidence for both those things is well understood and the world did not need a report from our committee to tell it that. My concerns are not based on the legality or otherwise of the measure, although witnesses did express such a concern. I would prefer notification of the policy to Europe, and I welcome the commitment to that. I would want to have a better idea of how the market might respond. I hope that a sunset clause and proper robust evaluation will help if the market responds in a way that makes things worse by changing pricing structures or the marketing of specific products.</p><p>However, those problems do not explain my unease about the bill. Increasing by law the price of goods in supermarket baskets will take money from consumers and pass it on to retailers. I hope that that is understood. If someone has money, that is fine, but if someone is on a low income, even if they drink moderately, safely and legally within all the guidelines, they will be disproportionately penalised by the minimum pricing measure. They will spend a higher proportion of their income on their weekly shop, which many of us already find hard to afford. Some, like Bob Doris, see that as a price worth paying to get a particular policy prescription agreed, no matter that heavier and problem drinkers and young drinkers are less likely to be price sensitive or that poorer people already drink less than wealthier people. If someone cannot afford the increased price of your safe and legal tipple, which they enjoy responsibly, then tough&#8212;it is a price worth paying because it might reduce overall consumption at population level.</p><p>I hope that we will all reflect on that when we go downstairs to our next reception or to the bar where we can use our salaries to buy a drink in the full knowledge that the minimum pricing measure will have no impact on us. For the reasons that I have given and others, I support the amendment in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s name, which calls for the totality of the windfall that will accrue to supermarkets from lower-income people as a result of the measure to be eliminated by a social responsibility levy, which is a measure that was accepted before.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has said previously:</p><p>&#8220;we suggested that we work together to use the social responsibility levy to claw back increased revenue for reinvestment in our services.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 10 November 2010; c 30143.]</p><p>However, what is the Scottish Government&#8217;s position now? It has no plans to implement the social responsibility levy. Without a proper measure to claw back the windfall that will go to supermarkets, minimum pricing is not just a tax on the poor but a simple transfer of money from the poor to the rich.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As another member of the Health and Sport Committee, I associate myself with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s opening remarks about Duncan McNeil, the members of the committee and the clerking team.

The Glasgow to Edinburgh route is the most important strategic rail route in the country, but any improvements to the line that would reduce the service that is provided to passengers on the Queen Street to Anniesland line through Maryhill in the manner that has been suggested would be completely and utterly unacceptable. I congratulate Patricia Ferguson on raising the concerns that she has raised on behalf of her constituents as the MSP for Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn.</p><p>In a recent debate on the cities strategy, I pointed out to the cities minister that stations in cities are close together for a reason. Transport Scotland has completely cocked up its consultation by including the Glasgow stations beside the suggestion that there is somehow an overprovision of rail services and/or stops in Glasgow. The SNP&#8217;s record on rail services for Glasgow is poor, and the wrong-headed, wrongly focused and wrongly conceived consultation from Transport Scotland is just the latest example of that.

The centre manager, Gareth James, said:</p><p>&#8220;The location of the station in Nitshill does not need altering. The Office of Rail Regulation figures show that Nitshill station has seen an increase in traffic of over 25% in two years and 50% in five years ... This part of Glasgow is poorly served by public transport&#8212;no Sunday rail service and a bus service that has recently been truncated further&#8221;.</p><p>Scottish Labour raised the issue of bus regulation this morning, of course.</p><p>Mr James also said:</p><p>&#8220;the train station is unmanned and does not have step-free access on the south-bound platform. Quite the opposite from closure, at this time Nitshill station would benefit from investment, particularly with regards to making it more accessible.&#8221;</p><p>He is right, as is a woman from Mosspark to whom I have spoken. She regularly walks from that station in the dark in the evening, and she is extremely concerned about the threat to her safety as a result of having to make a longer journey.</p><p>Glasgow City Council is right to condemn the consultation, and the Evening Times was right to launch its save our stations campaign. The question that the minister must answer in his closing speech is why a suggestion was made, in a fact sheet that accompanies the &#8220;Rail 2014&#8221; document from the Scottish Government&#8217;s transport agency, that threatens the future of Ashfield, Barnhill, Duke Street, Gilshochill, Kelvindale, Kennishead, Maryhill, Mosspark and Nitshill stations. What is the difference between the 14 stations that are mentioned in the fact sheet and the other 50? Why are those 14 stations mentioned in the fact sheet and not the others?</p><p>Bob Doris said that he was reassured by the discussions that he has had with the transport minister. I am sorry, but why, then, does he have his picture on a leaflet that is being put out by the SNP in Glasgow entitled &#8220;Save Our Stations&#8221;? The leaflet is not about improvements to stations; the title is &#8220;Save Our Stations&#8221;. That is also the title of the Evening Times campaign.

Our cities are the powerhouse of Scotland&#8217;s economy. As the cabinet secretary said, they are our major population centres and 86 per cent of us live within an hour&#8217;s drive of a city. Our cities are home to many of our most important cultural and intellectual institutions, and they are our major transport hubs. In the modern economy, we must harness the potential of such advantages to ensure prosperity through innovation and growth. We need design and planning, not accident and by-product.</p><p>We are not seeking to pitch one part of the country against another or to put undue emphasis on the urban over the rural. Rather, we acknowledge that the success of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Stirling can not only improve the wellbeing of the people who live and work in those cities but drive forward the prosperity of the city regions and the whole of Scotland.</p><p>We debated cities strategy briefly in the opening days of this parliamentary session, in the context of a wider debate about the cabinet secretary&#8217;s portfolio priorities. During the debate, the cabinet secretary talked about bringing forward a stand-alone debate on cities strategy as soon as possible, and it appears that today is the first opportunity that she has had to do that, as she said.</p><p>During the debate on the cabinet secretary&#8217;s portfolio priorities, I expressed hope that the Parliament would be an active partner with the cabinet secretary in developing her new area of work as cities minister. It is slightly unfortunate that our first chance in that regard comes after the strategy has been published rather than beforehand, which would have enabled us to inform the strategy. Members of all parties could have contributed usefully to an earlier debate. However, we can make a useful contribution at this stage, too, and I accept the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments about the collaborative approach that she wants to take in the spirit in which I am sure she made them.</p><p>Scottish Labour particularly welcomes a number of aspects of the cities strategy. I am pleased that it will continue to be led by the cities themselves. Given the work that SCDI did on the six cities review, I welcome its continued involvement and its role as chair of the leadership group. The cities minister&#8217;s role should be as an enabler and occasional fixer in times when a lack of joined-up government means that the priorities and problems that the cities might encounter are not understood.</p><p>This is the first debate on cities in this session, but previous Governments were not silent on this area of policy.

It is a matter of regret that the Government has not taken the opportunity to restore the cities growth fund, as Labour said it would do in its manifesto.</p><p>Members will have read the briefing from the Scottish Wildlife Trust, which describes the approach to sustainability as a missed opportunity. I have raised the issue with the cabinet secretary in written questions, to which she has responded. I am glad that the Government has responded by providing a dedicated funding stream for projects that will promote sustainability. That element of funding has significant potential, as it could encourage collaboration between our six cities to determine what could be done to make them greener and to share learning between them.</p><p>The original &#163;5 million amounted to just &#163;830,000 per city. We have several questions about how the fund will operate, and the cabinet secretary alluded to where we could look for more detail. The funding is to be used to prepare business cases in order that other moneys can be leveraged in to support the cities agenda. That might be of more value to smaller authorities than to larger ones, so how will we ensure that we get the maximum benefit in deciding which projects are to be supported? Who will be directly involved in deciding on bids? What criteria will they use? Will only local authorities be able to bid, or will other partners be involved too? SNP back benchers have even suggested that community groups might be able to bid. I appreciate that the cabinet secretary said that the Government will consult the cities on some of those points, but I hope she agrees that a good starting point for the strategic use of what is a welcome but small fund would be to use the criterion that was applied by the previous cities growth fund, whereby projects had to be of regional significance and benefit.</p><p>The Scottish cities knowledge centre is a welcome development, and I congratulate Glasgow and St Andrews universities on it. Evaluating and understanding what works and undertaking comparative work on what is being done elsewhere will be valuable and essential in ensuring the future development of the cities agenda. That is perhaps more important than ever in a time of straitened public resources. I hope that those with an interest in developing a bolder cities policy can look forward to some imaginative reports emanating from those experts.</p><p>You would be surprised, Presiding Officer, if I did not mention some of the priorities that my, and indeed the cabinet secretary&#8217;s, city&#8212;Glasgow&#8212;might wish to be part of the debate. On connectivity, Labour again urges the Scottish Government to investigate all options to provide support for air route development. Glasgow City Council has stepped in to provide a small fund in the absence of a national scheme. Although the council is to be congratulated on that, the fund does not replace the support that Government previously provided, and it cannot alone ensure that our key transport and business hubs are connected to the markets around the world where opportunities for increased trade exist.</p><p>That is one of a number of areas in which the strategy does not go as far as it could have done. It does not respond to the calls from Edinburgh and Glasgow for further reform of the disbursal of business rates. There is no mention of surface public transport links, particularly a link to Glasgow airport, which remains a key missing link without which the city cannot grow properly. Indeed, a link to regional and national public transport infrastructure could benefit the whole country. Today&#8217;s debate comes at a time when Glasgow&#8217;s newspaper, the Evening Times, has launched a campaign to save stations on the rail network because Transport Scotland seems to have misunderstood the very nature of an urban environment and has identified rail stops as being too close together. Of course they are close together. That is how people live in a city; indeed, it is probably one of the definitions of a city.</p><p>In Dundee, there have already been calls for the fund to be used to create a jobs task force, and in Edinburgh we need action to tackle the fact that the capital has the highest percentage of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds. Aberdeen and Inverness desperately require improvements to their trunk road connections, but on a slightly smaller scale, they also require assistance to link the major trunk roads within their city boundaries at locations such as the Haudagain roundabout.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister&#8217;s appointment as cities minister has perhaps been branded by more cynical types than me as part of the SNP&#8217;s local government election campaign. Only last weekend, she was pictured with her group of wannabe city fathers at the Glasgow campaign launch. I say &#8220;city fathers&#8221; advisedly, because it appears that the SNP forgot to select many women to run for the council. If the agenda for cities is the opening salvo in the campaign, I am afraid that the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s bang has been somewhat undermined by the lack of buck provided.</p><p>The Scottish Labour Party welcomes this slightly overdue debate, and we welcome the publication of the strategy, as far as it goes. We would have welcomed an investment fund that was more akin to the cities growth fund. The purpose of our amendment is to highlight the level of ambition that that fund demonstrated, which goes well beyond what the cabinet secretary outlined today.</p><p>I hope that, during the debate, there will be some support for more ambition. Getting support for Scotland&#8217;s cities right could help us to get much more right for Scotland&#8217;s economy. In each region, there are opportunities to do more. We must recognise that, as the cabinet secretary rightly said, the publication of one document and the creation of one strategy group to talk about the big ideas that we need are not enough. We need the big ideas to be advanced now. We hope that the cities alliance will set out a radical vision that is bold enough to make clear the tools that it needs to really do the job.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01740.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; further recognises that this new fund builds on the success of the previous Cities Growth Fund, which provided substantial and targeted support for the development of Scotland&#8217;s cities amounting to &#163;173 million between 2003 and 2008, and further welcomes the initiative as a renewed focus on the actual and potential contribution of Scotland&#8217;s cities to economic prosperity and job creation through better connectivity, sustainability, better use of knowledge and improved liveability for all those who live and work in Scotland&#8217;s cities, their regions and in the country as a whole.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agenda for Cities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I entirely accept that point, but rolling the fund into the allocation meant that it was used to pursue the Scottish Government&#8217;s priorities, whereas its purpose had been to allow cities to pursue their own priorities.

As an avid listener to &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; for many years, and as a keen gig-goer, I fully support the sentiments that Ms McAlpine expressed in her motion and I enjoyed her speech. I also associate myself with the remarks that she made about &#8220;Newsweek Scotland&#8221; and &#8220;Scotland at Ten&#8221;.</p><p>The contemporary music industry in Scotland is often overlooked, but it makes a significant contribution to the Scottish economy and to our cultural life. My city of Glasgow is, of course, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization city of music. That designation recognises the extent of interest in classical and traditional music but also the importance of the Glasgow contemporary music scene.</p><p>I listened carefully to Mark McDonald&#8217;s speech. As a former student of the University of Aberdeen, I well remember the Aberdeen music scene and Mark McDonald made a cogent case for what happens when something as important as the radio slot is removed from the scene and people have to turn their attention elsewhere. I well recall many long nights spent in Drummond&#8217;s in Belmont Street in Aberdeen and many other quality establishments. That is a point well made. Without the opportunities provided by &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;, which is based in Glasgow but provides a showcase for talent from all over Scotland, contemporary music will have a very serious problem.</p><p>In previous parliamentary sessions, Pauline McNeill campaigned extensively with the cross-party group on the contemporary music industry. It developed a music manifesto that focused on recognising the successes of music promoters and the recording industry, and improving conditions, particularly for live musicians. She even arranged for gigs to take place in the garden lobby of the Parliament, which I enjoyed attending. I am sure that, having raised some of these issues again, Joan McAlpine might want to think about what more we can do to promote contemporary music.</p><p>I was pleased that, during last May&#8217;s elections, Scottish Labour was the only party to develop and promote a comprehensive music policy, which included initiatives on instruments and recording facilities. Pauline McNeill was very much the driving force behind that work.</p><p>&#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; is a vital part of the Scottish music scene. Many successful bands made early appearances on the show and Joan McAlpine mentioned some of them. More than that, the show has been a showcase for live music, and not just music from Glasgow. It allows listeners around Scotland and in other parts of the UK to hear the best of unsigned talent. Later commercial success is only one element of what makes a band great.</p><p>I fully endorse the motion. I look forward to hearing what action the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs is taking to put pressure on BBC Scotland or will take if she has not already had the chance to do so. If we were talking about the closure of the BBC orchestra or a reduction in the coverage of traditional music, we would rightly be up in arms. Although I regularly enjoy those types of music, pop and rock is often forgotten by the powers that be, perhaps sometimes because of the stuffiness of the corporation.</p><p>I regret that I was not able to attend the lobby that Joan McAlpine organised, but if I can help the campaign in any way, I make clear my willingness to do so.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659334", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in an important debate, which is attracting considerable interest in the Parliament, on the subject of contemporary music in Scotland and the specific issue of &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;.

That was suggested by a majority but not all of the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s members and was supported by some but not all of the groups that submitted evidence.</p><p>Scottish Labour believes that, in agreeing to such an ad hoc committee, the Parliament should be clear about the work that we expect it to carry out on our behalf. We do not need an alternative work and pensions committee that focuses on reserved benefits or constitutional changes and which would move responsibility for benefits around but do little to improve the lives of the people who are likely to be hardest hit by the changes. Fiona McLeod made that point very well when she said that today&#8217;s debate is not about the constitution. Our amendment is therefore intended to be constructive and helpful to ensure that the Parliament has clarity about the committee&#8217;s role, and to suggest that the model of working should be genuinely collaborative. We should ensure that we do not put the issues that are likely to arise from the Welfare Reform Bill in a silo. Rather, the committee&#8217;s work should be drawn from the experience and expertise of our existing committees and it should provide a forum for a regular check on the bill&#8217;s impact on areas in which this Parliament can direct some influence and in which the Government has some responsibility.</p><p>I say to Bob Doris, who made an excellent speech, that we accept that the Government takes a different view on who should have responsibility for our welfare state. It is the Government&#8217;s right to hold and articulate that view, as it is our right to disagree with it.</p><p>As we consider the next steps, there is a job to be done in focusing on the devolved aspects. Alternative proposals for a way forward must be introduced quickly and in a manner that gives confidence to those who are at present deeply worried about how the changes will impact on them. Siobhan McMahon described the fear that exists out there.</p><p>I have followed the issue closely over the past few months and it has been a source of frustration to me that the Government did not go into detail in the spending review or in the local government settlement. I recently questioned ministers about whether those who are currently entitled to free bus travel as a result of receiving a disability benefit would keep their bus passes, and was reassured to an extent by the Government&#8217;s statement that there were no plans to make any changes. I hope that that was not just a carefully worded reply, and that the Government indeed meant that all those who have a bus pass now will continue to have one. Jackie Baillie mentioned that again this morning, and perhaps the minister could confirm it in summing up. It may be a small issue with respect to the overall changes, but it is important for many disabled people and it is an indicator of the Government&#8217;s intent.</p><p>My colleague Jackie Baillie and others raised concerns about the community care grant, the crisis loans and the devolution of council tax benefit, and again we would be grateful for some clarity from the cabinet secretary when she closes the debate.</p><p>I repeat our frustration with the UK Government&#8217;s approach on welfare reform. I support the amendment in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s name, and I urge members on all sides of the chamber to do likewise to ensure that we have on-going scrutiny in the Parliament that is targeted and useful to all those who have an interest in these vital changes.</p><p>If the Parliament should agree to withhold consent for the UK Government to legislate on all aspects, and instead instruct the Scottish Government to introduce a bill of its own, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government will both face a very serious challenge to address some of the concerns that have been expressed and to achieve a fair and equitable solution in respect of the devolved aspects.

In fact, this year it was ranked first by postgraduate students for managing research, learning support and accommodation services. In this debate secured by Sandra White, we pay tribute not only to Glasgow&#8217;s universities but to all Scotland&#8217;s universities for their work in ensuring that Scotland maintains and improves its position as a first-class destination for higher education.</p><p>Of course, international students are an important source of revenue for our universities, particularly in postgraduate courses and especially at a time when institutions are seeking to balance their budgets in straitened financial circumstances. However, in acknowledging that economic factor, we should also be clear in our aspiration to make the student experience, student learning and student support the best they can be for international students as well as our own and rest-of-UK students.</p><p>Sandra White&#8217;s motion highlights that 94 per cent of international students who studied at Glasgow said that they were satisfied with their expert lecturers and 91 per cent of final-year students expressed satisfaction with their learning experience. The motion that I lodged notes that 96 per cent of students agreed that Glasgow is a good place to be, as Sandra White said&#8212;I am sure that she and I are in complete agreement with that sentiment, particularly on a Thursday evening, when we are both keen to return to the best city in Scotland.</p><p>The University of Glasgow currently has about 4,500 international students. It is estimated that, on average, each one contributes some &#163;10,000 to the city&#8217;s economy. Glasgow gives a warm welcome to all who choose to visit or stay in the city, and I want to express the value that we place on international students as part of Glasgow&#8217;s unique cosmopolitan mix. Many international students choose to stay in Glasgow or the UK, but we thank even those whose stay with us is short for everything that they add to our diversity as a city and for the role that they play in our community and our politics.</p><p>I pay particular tribute to the academic and other staff at the university for achieving the accolade that we are celebrating at a time that I am sure the university management would acknowledge has been difficult for the whole of the university community.

I am kind of torn between two responses about my ideal choice of career. One answer is that I would have been in social work, but that does not really help me in this debate. So, I turn to my first choice. Given that as a small boy I had a profound Lego obsession, I would dearly have loved to have become an architect, had I the brains, patience or artistic flair to pursue that.</p><p>Buildings shape our environment, our working lives and our relaxation. The difference between good and bad buildings can have a huge effect on our quality of life and the quality of our public space. I welcome the inclusion of place making in the debate.</p><p>As a Glasgow representative, I am in so many respects a privileged person&#8212;perhaps in no respect more than in relation to our built environment. Glasgow boasts great buildings and important spaces, but our built environment reflects change and dynamism as well as landmarks that should be preserved. I thought that Patricia Ferguson made an excellent speech about her experience of life in the Red Road flats and some of the changes in the city that we have seen over the years.</p><p>It might be unpopular, but one of my favourite documents is the Bruce report&#8212;which was actually two papers&#8212;in which the corporation engineer Robert Bruce set out options for the long-term redesign of Glasgow city centre in the post-war years. The report and interesting drawings that are associated with it are well worth a look for a range of reasons. The plans to move railway stations and to open up new expressways and motorways are breathtaking, if not a little frightening, in their scale. Plans to demolish slum housing, combined with options for the demolition of George Square and the creation of new municipal buildings, speak equally of a vision for a brave new world as well as a desire to leave the past behind.</p><p>Elements of those various schemes happened&#8212;the M8 being the most obvious example. In other areas, the report continued to influence planning through to the days of Strathclyde Regional Council. Many important Glasgow streets and tenements were cleared for new super-road arteries that were never built.</p><p>Architecture and design are important and stimulating, not least because in the kind of pencil drawings that are in the Bruce report we can see glimpses of a future that never came, albeit that we might be thankful for that.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654653", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy (Architecture and Place Making)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to be called to speak in what has already proved to be an interesting and informative debate.

I certainly think that there is a place for iconic buildings.</p><p>As a world city and home to thousands of people, Glasgow has, for better or worse, been influenced by the thinking of Sir Basil Spence as much as by the surviving works of George Gilbert Scott, Alexander Thomson or Charles Rennie Mackintosh, or by the outstanding Catholic churches and commercial buildings of my own favourite practice, Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, which Linda Fabiani has already mentioned. In Glasgow today, the key skills of building design and planning are taught in our colleges, universities and, of course, the Glasgow School of Art. Whether undertaken at a Park Circus architecture practice or as part of an apprenticeship with City Building helping to construct the Glasgow house, these careers provide worthwhile and rewarding work.</p><p>Buildings do not exist in isolation any more than people do. They can either make or spoil spaces; in Glasgow, we have examples of both. Living in Glasgow&#8217;s unique west end, which is a mix of Victorian estates, pre-urbanisation industrial and residential buildings&#8212;particularly around the River Kelvin&#8212;the University of Glasgow&#8217;s postmodern concrete towers and many new buildings and older buildings that have been given a new lease of life, I am acutely aware of the importance of planning and good design to communities where the built environment is considered precious.</p><p>However, good buildings should not be the preserve of only affluent communities. Investing in the skills that are required to make and maintain better buildings and places can benefit all Scotland. The new school and hospital building programme that was implemented in the years after 1997 has given us many fine new public buildings; however, it is probably the case that the quality of many of those buildings improved as capacity improved and more were built. Indeed, I visited one of those buildings&#8212;Hillhead primary school&#8212;just last week.</p><p>Architecture and design should be seen as a Scottish success story and I hope&#8212;indeed, I am sure&#8212;that in having this debate the cabinet secretary is signalling her intention to invest in and celebrate our skills and innovation, as well as her determination to ensure that the Scottish Government gives even greater priority to the challenge of constructing sustainable buildings and places.</p><p>Finally, I wish to associate myself with the remarks that were made by the cabinet secretary, Patricia Ferguson and others on VAT for building extensions.

I pay particular tribute to Margaret McCulloch, who spoke eloquently, to Mark McDonald, who made an excellent contribution&#8212;at least for the first half of it&#8212;and to Siobhan McMahon, who spoke passionately. Labour as a UK party has scrutinised and highlighted many of the same inconsistencies, anomalies and downright unfairnesses.</p><p>Scotland has a higher proportion of claimants for every one of the benefits that will become the universal credit. The impact will be severe and long lasting and will result in a disproportionate hit on our economy. The reduction in spending power will devastate efforts to regrow the economy and will place demand on already overpressed and underfunded services such as housing and money advice.</p><p>The Scottish Government has rightly acknowledged&#8212;in the debate but not in the wording of its motion&#8212;the impact that the changes will have on many devolved benefits, where UK benefits are used as passports to particular services.

It put the fight for fairness, dignity and the right to work in the spotlight for the whole world.</p><p>As seminal moments go, it was a long one and was prompted by the UCS board telling the unions on 11 June 1971 of the cash crisis. It really started in the days that followed, with the first stewards&#8217; meeting in the hall of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers and the larger meetings at Carlton Place and then at the Rosevale bingo. It took the men who were built in the yards of the Clyde to Downing Street to force a meeting with Edward Heath. It caused a general strike across the west of Scotland and brought an emergency session of the Scottish TUC to Partick burgh hall. It brought the TUC itself to Glasgow, elevated four wise men and secured the support of the then shadow secretary for trade and industry, Tony Benn.</p><p>All of those things have become the stuff of legend, but none of them is the real reason why the UCS work-in was important. This anniversary is not important because Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie became so iconic. It is not important because John and Yoko sent a cheque and red roses. The first pronouncement of the co-ordinating committee was clear:</p><p>&#8220;We are going to fight ... Helping us is helping yourself ... Demand the right to work.&#8221;</p><p>This anniversary is important not just because they fought but because they fought and won. On 9 October 1972 a deal was secured to save the fourth yard at Clydebank:</p><p>&#8220;Not a yard will close - Not a man down the road.&#8221;</p><p>The importance of this anniversary is not just about remembering the struggle, the sacrifice and the strength of workers united and determined in their objectives. The stewards of UCS warned that the end of shipbuilding on the upper Clyde would be unthinkable because it would recreate the conditions of the 1930s. Well, that fear is again abroad in Scotland. Speaking years after their work-in about why they had done what they had done, one of the men said:</p><p>&#8220;If government cannot organise for decent work for all who can work, then what is the point of government at all?&#8221;</p><p>That is the challenge for this Parliament and, if I may be political for a second or two, for the Scottish Government, too.</p><p>The spirit of UCS and of the many workplace struggles that we have seen in our country since have informed our political debate in Scotland. More than that, they have influenced the very foundation of this Parliament. I believe that collectivism, solidarity and tenacity are our traits as a nation. If we wish to be remembered for what we did in this time, we must make them our hallmarks, too. The right to work is not just an economic necessity; it is, as UCS demonstrated, the right to dignity. The workers of UCS knew the social pain and consequences of mass unemployment in their communities and in their families.</p><p>It is right that we are marking this anniversary in this place tonight. It has been remembered this year across Scotland, with various events that colleagues have mentioned. I congratulate the unions involved in the marking of the anniversary. I commend to you, Presiding Officer, my own recent motion on the continued flourishing of shipbuilding on the Clyde, which marked the departure of HMS Dragon, the latest of our Clyde-built Daring-class destroyers and the large hull section known as &#8220;Lower Block 3&#8221;, which will become part of the first Queen Elizabeth-class carrier.</p><p>We are still building men and women on the Clyde, and thanks to the workers of UCS we are still building ships, too.

I will focus my remarks on the &#8220;better way&#8221; elements of the motion.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to my past service on the general council of the STUC, which came to an end in April 2010. In my final few months serving on that body, attention was focused almost exclusively on the banking collapse, the bail-out and the potential consequences for ordinary working people in Scotland and for our public services.</p><p>It was clear to us then that we were all threatened with a political backlash against public spending and an incoming Tory Government intent on using the global financial crisis as an excuse for ideological attacks on working people. We believed that, rather than learning the lessons of regulatory failure and seeking to correct market excess and corporate greed, the Tories would instead seek to further reduce regulation and tax at the top by punishing those in the middle and at the bottom. We knew that the deficit, which we considered to be manageable and necessary to sustain the economy and return us to growth, would be misrepresented and used as an excuse to attack investment in public services and public spending in general.</p><p>Both of those fears have proved to be correct, which is why the STUC embarked on a campaign to educate workers and the public about the economic facts and the assault that we knew would come. The &#8220;there is a better way&#8221; campaign has been the biggest mobilisation of trade unions, civic Scotland and community activism since devolution. It has involved the voluntary sector, churches, local community groups and affiliates on local trade union councils and it has been extraordinarily successful.</p><p>The campaign is explicitly not just an anti-cuts campaign. It pre-dates the Government&#8217;s cuts agenda and is not a response to the actions of others. It is a proactive articulation of the long-held view of the STUC and others that consensus around financial deregulation, diminishment of manufacturing and so-called labour flexibility in a market-knows-best economy was never going to be a sustainable route to a prosperous or equal society.</p><p>The campaign highlights four priorities: living wages, fair taxation, public services and jobs. It was launched with a rally in this city last October and I was a steward on the march. I know that the Labour shadow secretary of state, Ann McKechin; my leader in this place, Iain Gray; and many members from the two main parties in the chamber were also present. As I said, that was the launch of a movement and the proclamation of an idea, not an end and not the culmination of a campaign. Since then, the STUC and its affiliates have been continuing to rebuild their campaigning capacity, with many better way conferences and training events taking place in workplaces and communities around Scotland.</p><p>I pay particular tribute to the Public and Commercial Services union Scotland for its Wick wants work campaign. Two weeks ago, I joined my colleague Neil Findlay at a meeting of the West Lothian TUC to discuss its campaign and I commend it for what it has already achieved. A major mobilisation of Scottish workers also took place with the march for the alternative in London. Again, I was able to be present and the rally was addressed by the leader of my party, Ed Miliband.</p><p>As an MSP I will continue to pursue the issues and causes that have brought me into this place. There is an alternative economic vision, which the Scottish Government and the UK Government should be listening to. In relation to the cuts that are being imposed, I hope that the minister will say something in closing about the different impacts that they will have in many communities and on many low-paid workers and vulnerable people.</p><p>I know that Government back benchers were on the march last October. I hope that they will remember, in the five years ahead, why they were there. Hundreds of placards were produced bearing the slogan &#8220;fair taxes&#8221;. They were not brandished in support of slashing corporation tax. Indeed, a speaker from the Irish Congress of Trades Unions explicitly warned against the approach that is still being espoused by the Scottish National Party, despite the death of the Celtic tiger dream and the bending of their arc of prosperity.</p><p>Focus on those issues will now be in the context of looming industrial action, which the Tory Government is provoking with its announcement of final positions in advance of negotiations with the unions. At the congress of my own union, the GMB, at which, but for my election to the Parliament, I would have been a delegate, Vince Cable threatened basic rights and freedoms, which are recognised internationally, for workers to organise and represent themselves collectively in defence of their interests and conditions, their industries and, in many cases, their public services.</p><p>My party fought the election on a manifesto that contained many elements of both the better way priorities and the people&#8217;s charter, which Elaine Smith outlined earlier, and I look forward to pursuing my involvement and activism in these issues in this, our Scottish Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649062", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: There is a Better Way Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elaine Smith, as others have done, on bringing this debate to the chamber.

However, as Bob Doris said, health inequalities demonstrate an important link between health and the cities strategy, with the 100 GP practices that serve the most deprived areas being found predominantly in Glasgow, some parts of Edinburgh and Dundee.</p><p>As Colin Keir said, Scotland&#8217;s cities are our nation&#8217;s economic powerhouse. Each is home to excellent universities whose teaching and research can drive Scotland forward. The cities are hubs for business and tourism and for social and cultural life. Here in Edinburgh and in Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness, Stirling and my own city of Glasgow, our people are proud of our cities&#8217; heritage and ambitious for their future.</p><p>The previous Labour-led Government produced the cities review, which was the last major piece of work on cities.

As the cabinet secretary said, the six cities vision is the starting point. That agreement, which the Scottish Council for Development and Industry brokered, shows that the cities have come together to focus on their shared economic ambitions and priorities and deliver long-term sustainable growth.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s cities&#8212;and particularly Gordon Matheson, Glasgow City Council&#8217;s leader&#8212;have pursued the cities agenda in recent times. It is therefore welcome that the Scottish Government is now listening to what our cities need to prosper and grow, especially in these times when city governments are taking tough decisions as a result of budgets that are not in their control.</p><p>The cities want a focus on building infrastructure that can deliver economic impact; developing our cities as creative centres of productivity, knowledge and innovation; and putting cities at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s sustainability. The Government should recognise our cities&#8217; economic contribution to Scotland and create trade and tourism plans that acknowledge our cities as the gateway to Scotland.</p><p>The truth is that Scotland has lagged behind many other countries that have invested in their cities. Taking a strategic approach to their welfare and contribution is in the interests of all. Of Scotland&#8217;s population, 27 per cent live in our cities, but our cities produce 47 per cent of gross value added, which amounts to &#163;44 billion; 43 per cent of business turnover; 40 per cent of jobs; and 36 per cent of research and development.</p><p>The Centre for Cities report &#8220;Cities Outlook 2011&#8221; identified Scotland&#8217;s major cities as being better placed to avoid a double-dip recession than cities elsewhere in the UK. It argues that cities should be given more power and flexibility to respond to their problems and to identify their opportunities for growth.</p><p>We need a new funding model to support long-term investment in Scotland&#8217;s cities that learns lessons from the cities growth fund and the derelict land fund. I know that Glasgow City Council places importance on that; Sandra White also mentioned the issue.</p><p>Glasgow needs changes from the Government if it is to prosper. Despite huge investment in our roads&#8212;for example, Glasgow City Council has committed &#163;12 million this year and more is to come&#8212;they are still not up to scratch. Government funding is based on lengths of road and not usage.

The business case for high-speed rail is weaker without Scotland&#8217;s inclusion and our existing rail links already lack capacity at a time when intercity rail demand is increasing. Within Glasgow, we need the Scottish Government to commit to the whole fastlink route to link the Southern general, the city centre and&#8212;vitally&#8212;the Commonwealth games site at Dalmarnock.</p><p>On all those issues and more, a minister for Scotland&#8217;s cities must be an enabler and not a centralising force that seeks to take control. Since the election, some members of the Scottish Government have faced two ways on controversial restructuring of Glasgow&#8217;s universities and weighed into arguments about care provision in a manner that seems to single out Glasgow for party-political purpose. However, the cabinet secretary was quoted in The Herald as saying that she would not seek to interfere with council powers in Glasgow, and I take her at her word. Instead, we should focus on the areas in which strategic support and enabling of city governments can make a difference, such as those that I have highlighted today, and, in Glasgow&#8217;s case, tackling poverty and creating enough new jobs.</p><p>Given that Glasgow asked for a stronger cities policy, it would not be acceptable if that were now used as a platform to attack particular administrations or to campaign for a change in political leadership. The debate on Glasgow&#8217;s future must be about more jobs for Glaswegians, not more councillors for the SNP.</p><p>Collaborative engagement with Glasgow on the cities agenda is in the interests of our whole country. I look forward to further debate in the weeks and months ahead.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree absolutely with Margo MacDonald on that point.

I am honoured to make my maiden speech in this our Scottish Parliament, as a member for Glasgow region.</p><p>As with others on these benches, my feelings on being elected to this place were tempered by sadness at the loss of some good representatives from the city of Glasgow. As I was most closely involved with the campaign in Glasgow Kelvin, I hope that members and other Glasgow candidates who are not with us will forgive me if I take a moment to say a particular word about Pauline McNeill. Committed to Scottish home rule, not only was she a champion of my city, its people and its causes, but she had other international interests, particularly the cause of the Palestinian people. She is a loss to my party and to this Parliament.</p><p>Like other colleagues, I want to congratulate the SNP on winning the election so decisively and welcome Shona Robison to her place as minister. She might not recall, but in a previous life working in health promotion I had much pleasure in arranging for her a health walk with a Paths for All volunteer scheme in Fife. In her tenure as Minister for Public Health and Sport, she showed real commitment to health-enhancing physical activity, and I hope that in her new role she will continue to promote a more physically active Scotland as well as a successful sporting Scotland.</p><p>I also hope that the minister agrees that protecting the number of active sport co-ordinators in local communities and ensuring that it does not decline is key to encouraging Scots to become more rather than less physically active, and that she will give priority to the issue of expedited disclosures for coaches and others and, indeed, the question whether in some cases such disclosures are needed at all. For example, it cannot be right that some volunteer leaders are having their criminal records checked simply to lead a health walk. The role of the Scottish Government, local councils, health boards and other organisations in this field should be to open up pathways to sport activity and better health, not to block them.</p><p>When I was young I swam competitively, and like Richard Simpson and Patricia Ferguson I ask the minister to consider the role that free swimming lessons for all primary-age children can play. I am not talking just about access to council pools for those who are already using them or about bringing in swimming lessons at some arbitrary age, such as seven. Sport and physical activity should be part of growing up for all our children, and maintaining healthy activity levels should be part of life for all grown-ups.</p><p>Glasgow is a city that loves sport. I know that because I live in the shadow of one of the world&#8217;s great football teams: Partick Thistle Football Club. Given that football is our national game, I ask the minister to provide real and proactive assistance to supporters who wish to play a role in governing or owning their clubs. In that respect, I highlight Bill Butler&#8217;s work with the supporters trust on this issue in the last session.</p><p>Be it in international competitions or in local youth clubs, sport has the potential to make us better people. In sport, we learn the rules of fairness, strive for individual success and often learn how to be part of a team. From climbing walls and outdoor sports to swimming at Tollcross and bowling at Kelvingrove, Glasgow is one of the world&#8217;s great sporting cities. That is why the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games are so important both to the city and to Scotland. In my first speech in this chamber and on this subject, I pay tribute to Glasgow City Council, the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland and everyone, including the Scottish Government, who was involved in winning the games for Glasgow and getting us to where we are.</p><p>The Glasgow games, which are on time and within budget, are on schedule to be the great success that Glasgow needs them to be. They are vital for the regeneration of the east end. As Richard Simpson highlighted, they are the first major international sporting competition to put a health promotion legacy at the heart of their planning. If that health legacy is to be meaningful, it is essential that the minister publishes baselines from which we can measure the success or otherwise of that ambition.</p><p>Glasgow 2014 has massive potential, not only to transform the city&#8217;s infrastructure but to improve Glaswegians&#8217; life chances. Many young people will benefit from Glasgow City Council&#8217;s Commonwealth apprentices programme, which builds further on the excellent work that we are already doing in Glasgow. Glasgow City Council has put Labours&#8217; politics into policy, given opportunities to our young people and ensured that the fight against youth unemployment is at the front and centre of everything that my party does. As a former chair of the Scottish Trades Union Congress young workers committee and a past member of the STUC general council, those issues matter to me, and I will make youth employment, decent jobs for all and fairness in the workplace my priorities in the Parliament.</p><p>In the period since the election, there has been speculation in the media about who is running Glasgow 2014: Glasgow City Council or the Scottish Government. I say gently to the Scottish Government that putting next year&#8217;s local elections in Glasgow ahead of the success of the games would be very bad sportsmanship. Supporting the organising committee and all the partners to deliver the best games yet, delivering for Glasgow&#8217;s east end, improving Glasgow&#8217;s health and increasing levels of physical activity are my goals for the 20th Commonwealth games, and I hope that the minister shares them.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I support the amendment in Richard Simpson&#8217;s name, and I am grateful for the time that you have given me. I look forward to the challenges ahead of me as a new member. I will put the interests of the people of Glasgow first in the Scottish Parliament, and I will strive to do my best for the people I am proud and humble to represent.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
