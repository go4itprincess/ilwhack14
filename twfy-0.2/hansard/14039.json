Were it not for the bravery of a local passer-by, Broagan might not be alive today to tell her tale.</p><p>The physical and psychological wounds that Broagan suffered will take a long time to heal. She missed part of her education as she underwent a series of painful operations and skin grafts to repair the damage to her face and other injuries that many of us would consider extremely concerning.</p><p>Thousands of similar incidents involving out-of-control dogs have been recorded over the past five years in Scotland. Over that period, there has been a 17 per cent increase in the number of such incidents. Too many children have suffered because of the current dog laws and action must be taken.</p><p>Last month, I arranged a meeting with the First Minister and a number of mothers whose children have been the victims of dog attacks: Veronica Lynch, whose daughter, Kellie, was killed by two Rottweilers in 1989; Zoe Hall, whose four-year-old daughter, Sophia Bell, was seriously injured by a Labrador; and Broagan&#8217;s mother, Tracy Cox. The accounts that we heard were harrowing.</p><p>The Daily Record has printed a number of pictures of children who have suffered from dog attacks. They do not make comfortable viewing, but they tell the real story of the anguish that many families have experienced as a result of serious dog attacks.</p><p>So, what can we do? As a result of last month&#8217;s meeting involving the First Minister, the Scottish Government has launched a consultation document. I welcome that and the extremely positive discussions that took place during that meeting with the First Minister.</p><p>I also welcome the First Minister&#8217;s commitment to a summit to discuss how we take the issue forward and to look at how to promote responsible dog ownership. I hope that that will allow further debate on the issue and that we will consider putting in place robust measures to develop responsible dog ownership.</p><p>I put on the record the fact that I am strongly in favour of compulsory microchipping. We must look at using that method to promote responsible dog ownership. A lack of compulsory microchipping or any mandatory licensing suggests that we are not serious about ensuring responsible dog ownership. Proper enforcement of those control measures, combined with the regular maintenance of a central database, would be integral to their success. We would have to put in place the necessary resources to make a compulsory database a success.</p><p>Another measure that might be worth considering is the introduction of a restricted breeds list that is similar to the Irish model. The Irish list includes two breeds that are banned in the United Kingdom and large breeds such as Rhodesian ridgebacks, German shepherds and Rottweilers. Those animals or crosses of them must be muzzled in public places and walked on short leads by people who are no younger than 16. Those dogs earned their place on that list not because they are perceived to be more dangerous than other dogs or more aggressive than Jack Russells or Yorkshire terriers but because of their physical attributes. Their weight, height and jaw strength make them possibly dangerous dogs in public.</p><p>Broagan McCuaig was attacked for six minutes while she was being rescued by a grown man who punched and kicked the dogs that were mauling her. As I said, if it was not for that bravery, she would not be here to tell her story. Following such attacks, it often transpires that the owners were not fit to be owners. If a restricted breeds list was put in place, perhaps we could prevent such individuals from being owners.</p><p>More focus should be placed on assessing owners and considering the environments that dogs are kept in. When a family wish to rehome a dog from an animal charity such as the Dogs Trust, they are often required to undergo a home assessment. There is scope to introduce such measures for the ownership of dangerous dogs.</p><p>In the comfort zone of the debating chamber, it would be easy for us to play it safe and not consider introducing muzzling, licensing, microchipping or a restricted breeds list. However, we owe it to Broagan McCuaig and all the other victims to take robust action in a way that will make a genuine difference.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dog Control Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who have supported my members&#8217; business motion and welcome the fact that it has received support from all the parties that are represented in the chamber.

I do not want to hear excuses; I want to hear commitments to ensure that the housing associations&#8217; work can continue.</p><p>Since the 1970s, CBHAs have played a crucial role in regenerating our communities, particularly in Glasgow. There are many communities that would not exist today were it not for the vision, tenacity and determination of CBHAs. I can name many such communities, and the long list would include the Gorbals area, the Springburn area where I was brought up, south Dennistoun and the tenement properties in the area that John Mason represents. Those communities would not exist if it were not for the CBHAs&#8217; determination.</p><p>Not only did the CBHAs build houses; they brought forward projects to support the people in them. They built community facilities and used their expertise in development and attracting funding from various sources, including the lottery. They have been a boon for local employment, have strengthened local economies and have allowed social enterprises to flourish. All those social and economic achievements were led by community-based housing association tenants and owners who were members of management committees. That model has a proven track record of success.</p><p>What is clear from every piece of evidence that has been presented to the Parliament and from what we can see on the ground is that the community-based housing association model works. Yes, it requires public subsidy and support from the Government, and it might not be the cheapest option, but we get what we pay for. We got the cheapest option when we built housing estates such as the Red Road and Sighthill ones. They were described in their day as being cost-effective solutions to providing housing, but a lack of infrastructure and proper management has meant that those houses are being torn down as we speak. Had there been the community control there that we have had in the areas that I referred to, I am sure that those estates would have stood the test of time.</p><p>My motion refers to what is happening in the real world. Although demand for social housing is increasing rapidly, the Scottish Government is cutting the grant levels that are available to local housing associations for their development work to continue. The graphs on the piece of paper that I am holding up, which was provided to every member in the chamber, illustrate clearly the challenges that housing associations face. One graph shows that, when Labour left office in April 2007, the grant per new build unit was just over &#163;76,000. The SNP Government has cut that to the present rate, which is just over &#163;44,000 per unit, resulting in CBHAs across Scotland withdrawing from development. They are doing so because they need Government financial support that will allow them to ensure that schemes stack up.</p><p>Those cuts are putting at risk the very existence of our community-based housing association movement. The current funding environment has led to the growth of housing organisations masquerading as housing associations when, in fact, they are big businesses that operate from outside Scotland. I am afraid that their interests are not the interests of our communities as seen in the community-based housing association movement; their interests are to ensure that they make a fast buck out of their investment. They might be able to come in to build the houses and meet the targets that the Government has set&#8212;they can do that as cheap as chips. However, they will not be able to do it in the effective manner in which our CBHA movement has done it for many years.</p><p>My call to the Scottish Government is clear: reverse the cuts that have been placed on our local housing associations and let them get on with the job of regenerating our communities and protecting the investment that has been in place for nearly four decades. That will ensure that many of our communities are able to provide good and ample social housing for people to live in.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693250", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community-based Housing Associations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like me, John Mason will receive every single day many requests from constituents who want to be rehoused by many of the community-based housing associations that are represented in the public gallery.

For me, what is compelling is the fact that we have talked the talk for more than seven decades, but now is the right time for us to take a once-in-a-generation opportunity to finally move on and move the issue forward.</p><p>It is recognised that the Leveson inquiry highlighted the experiences of many victims who suffered at the hands of journalists who abused their power and hacked mobile phones and bank accounts. They did so without giving any consideration to the impact of their actions on their victims.</p><p>The inquiry heard from my constituents Margaret and Jim Watson, whose daughter Diane was stabbed in a school playground by Barbara Glover in April 1991. In December 1992, their son Alan committed suicide. Alan was deeply hurt by what was said about Diane in newspaper articles, and newspaper articles were found in his possession when he was found dead.</p><p>The articles were written by Jack McLean on behalf of the Glasgow Herald and Meg Henderson on behalf of Marie Claire magazine. Jack McLean and Meg Henderson wrote articles that bore no resemblance to the truth about Diane. Their articles about her murder were written without any proper research, and they made the nastiest remarks in connection with her character. They should be ashamed of their contributions. All the comments that they made in connection with Diane&#8217;s character were completely without foundation; they were simply made up to ensure that the newspaper column for the particular day was filled.</p><p>A lot of what Jack McLean and Meg Henderson said about Diane would, of course, have been said in the knowledge that the family members were not in a position to take defamation action against those journalists on behalf of the deceased family member. Margaret and Jim Watson have campaigned for a number of years to bring forward legal remedies on behalf of bereaved families to challenge inaccurate and defamatory information that has been written about deceased family members. I understand that the Scottish Government has completed its consultation exercise on the possible options for legal remedies that may be available to family members. I ask the First Minister to comment in his concluding remarks on how the Government wishes to bring them forward following the Leveson inquiry.</p><p>We have a job to do to protect the free press, but not at the expense of innocent people, such as Margaret and Jim Watson. I have known them for more than 20 years and have long admired their determination to get justice on behalf of their children and in their children&#8217;s memory. That said, we should continue to remind ourselves that Margaret, Jim, Alan and Diane did not choose to be in the public arena. They should not have been placed in a position to have to be judged by the likes of Jack McLean and Meg Henderson. They found themselves to be victims. We have a job in the Parliament to ensure that we protect such victims from some of the challenges that they face in the media.</p><p>The inquiry also heard from the First Minister, who advised us that he believed that an Observer journalist had hacked into his bank account. He raised the matter with that newspaper but failed to report it to the police. I have been an elected representative for nearly 19 years. During that time, I have attended a number of public forums and have sought to ensure that members of the public report every crime. I ensure that they are aware of the fact that unreported crime is not the way forward for their communities.</p><p>I ask the First Minister to explain in his concluding remarks&#8212;I would be happy to accept an intervention&#8212;why he did not report that matter to the police. The most senior politician in Scotland should set a good example by ensuring that unreported crime is reported at every possible opportunity.</p><p>This is a consensual debate&#8212;we recognise that and we recognise some of the challenges that face us.

It is clear that all the evidence that the committee received on the issue points towards retaining the status quo. In the evidence that she gave on behalf of the Campaign for Freedom of Information in Scotland, Carole Ewart provided a reasonable explanation of why the existing legislation has served us well. There is no evidence to suggest that the current system has been abused. I ask the cabinet secretary to reflect on the written and oral evidence that has been given.

Particular concerns were raised in connection with arm&#8217;s-length organisations and housing associations, and I would like to reflect on my experience of dealing with housing associations as a constituency MSP.</p><p>In general terms, I have found community-based housing associations to be more than willing to provide information to members of the public. In my experience, they are usually well managed by local management committees, which ensure that they are transparent and open. However, my experience in requesting information from national housing associations such as Link Housing Association has been more disappointing. Although such associations are recipients of significant sums of public money, my experience is that they operate on the basis not of the public having a right to know but of what they think that the public should know.</p><p>The 2002 act provides a legal framework for members of the public, including MSPs, to know what to expect from certain public organisations when they submit a request for information. It is clear from my experience of dealing with the Link Group that the absence of any legislative framework means that it is in control of how and when information is released to me, as the local MSP.</p><p>There are opportunities for organisations to consider how they can provide information proactively on the web, so that the public can access it rather than have to request it, but resources are a challenge in that respect. Although I am convinced that that is not the case for larger housing organisations, resources are a particular challenge for smaller housing organisations, and research must be carried out to ensure that smaller organisations are not adversely affected.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Information Commissioner suggested that the Government could legislate for a routine review of which bodies should be included within the realms of the FOI act, and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on that.

This might not be the consensual debate that would be within the comfort zone of some of the members opposite, but it is an important debate because the issue faces many communities throughout Scotland.</p><p>One of the challenges that we face in our constituencies lies in ensuring that we have good local colleges that can deliver the training programmes that people need to get out of unemployment. That is crucial to communities. The constituency that I represent, Glasgow Provan, has been well served by both John Wheatley College and North Glasgow College. I considered it a great privilege to be involved with both of those colleges when they invested more than &#163;80 million in a capital programme to build three new colleges. They were commissioned and built during the years of the Labour-led Executive from 1999. Those iconic buildings were built in areas where working-class communities face some of the most severe challenges in respect of unemployment.</p><p>I remind the minister of the differences that exist in Scotland. Unemployment in my constituency, Glasgow Provan, is double that in the constituency of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning. To me, that represents some of the severe challenges that we face in our communities and the need for money to be invested in those communities to ensure that we deal with some of those challenges.</p><p>In respect of positive solutions, of course we are united in the Parliament in forming an alliance to deal with youth unemployment and indeed adult unemployment. I do not think that there is one member who does not want to tackle unemployment. However, it is surely perverse, in the economic position that we find ourselves in, that we are not investing in the opportunities that can exist in colleges to get us out of the recession.</p><p>I ask the Government to consider the lack of parity that exists between higher education and further education in Scotland. I was appalled to hear the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning tell a group of John Wheatley College students that he was very firm in his view that parity did not exist and that his commitment was to higher rather than further education. The challenge that faces this Parliament is ensuring that that lack of parity does not exist in future and that we give every student in Scotland, no matter whether they are in further or higher education, a genuinely equal chance to prosper in their local community and a proper opportunity to improve their educational attainment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670516", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: North Glasgow College (Funding Cuts)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I congratulate Patricia Ferguson on raising an important issue that faces many constituencies throughout Scotland.

I would not fault them for being&#8212;on many occasions&#8212;robust, outspoken or difficult in order to ensure that their children&#8217;s complex needs are met. In my dealings with Isabel Kelly and Sandra Martin&#8212;she is not a relative of mine&#8212;I have found their arguments to be cohesive, intelligent and robust.</p><p>I am afraid that the same cannot be said of the education officials in Glasgow City Council. They have failed on a number of occasions to recognise the scale of the parents&#8217; concerns, and they are unwilling to negotiate with the parents on an equal basis. It is another David and Goliath story&#8212;one that has highlighted a number of poor practices that exist throughout Scotland with regard to how education authorities consult parents.</p><p>We need to be clear that the decision is one for Glasgow City Council, regardless of the minister&#8217;s decision on whether to call it in. I welcome the fact that&#8212;as Humza Yousaf said&#8212;we have taken a cross-party approach in representing the parents at Gadburn.</p><p>Councillor Leonard and Councillor Davidson, who are Labour councillors, have been working closely with Councillor Thoms, who is a local SNP councillor. The councillors have met with education officials on numerous occasions to try to resolve the various differences that exist.</p><p>For many of the parents, the main issue&#8212;as Humza Yousaf highlighted&#8212;is that they no longer have confidence in mainstream education. Their children been poorly supported during the whole process, leading to some of the issues that have been raised, such as children being bullied and parents finding it difficult to feel sure that their children will be able to continue in mainstream education.</p><p>I have met the parents on a number of occasions and advised them that I am an advocate of ensuring that children are given a fair chance to access mainstream education&#8212;an ethos with which I think many members in the chamber would agree.</p><p>I have learned from the Gadburn parents that, as Humza Yousaf suggested, the issue is not as straightforward as it seems. Given the parents&#8217; preference for special needs provision, the proposed move to Barmulloch primary school is perhaps the way forward. Of course, the parents&#8217; first preference is for Gadburn school to remain open. However, if possible, they want a separate educational establishment at Barmulloch, given the possibility that the establishments could consider integrating in future.</p><p>The parents&#8217; requests are not unreasonable, given the circumstances in which the parents find themselves. We must consider their requests alongside the request from members today for the minister to call in the decision.</p><p>We in this Parliament should show leadership. We should call on the education officials to work closely with the local elected members to ensure that the interests of the parents&#8212;and, more important, the interests of the children&#8212;are paramount in making progress on the issue.

As a result of that legislation, we have seen our local communities being abandoned by bus companies that care little about their needs, despite the fact that those communities and their local authorities have been going out of their way to build an infrastructure that assists bus companies in dealing with the challenges that they face in delivering bus services, for example in areas such as traffic congestion. Indeed, I cannot help but observe that, in a perverse way, we appear to be encouraging the big bus companies to cherry pick in the first place by providing bus lanes, sometimes to the detriment to the needs of local people, who also need services delivered in their communities.</p><p>The time is right for the Parliament to take action to protect our communities from the cherry-picking activities of bus companies throughout Scotland. I do not know what world Alex Johnstone lives in, but I ask him to pay attention to the concerns of my constituents in the Glasgow Provan constituency. In Cranhill, they face serious challenges in accessing bus services. In the Dennistoun community, people face challenges with bus companies cherry picking routes. That is the real world of the challenges that our constituents face throughout Scotland.</p><p>As Elaine Smith mentioned, we also need to recognise the impact that the withdrawal of bus services has on vulnerable communities, in Glasgow in particular. In Glasgow, where the car ownership rate is among the lowest in Scotland, people depend on bus services as a lifeline to get them to employment opportunities and hospital appointments. Not to take action would be an attack on those local communities and the most vulnerable in our society. For many of those people, as Elaine Smith said, it is not a lifestyle choice to take the bus. Being able to attend a hospital appointment or an employment opportunity is a necessity.</p><p>I believe that we are elected to the Parliament to ensure that the vulnerable are represented. That is why I sought election in 1999 and that is why I believe that we need to put in place a more robust system to deal with bus companies and to bring forward proposals to regulate them. If regulation is good enough for the bankers, it is good enough for the greedy bus companies. Let me clear about this: bus companies need no protection. Stagecoach had half-year profits of almost &#163;80 million and those of First reached just under &#163;60 million, so I hope that the Scottish Government will not seek to protect those companies.</p><p>I say once again that it is becoming clear that the time is now right for real action, not just talk about partnerships. We have sought to engage through partnerships for many years. The time is right for those bus companies to recognise that the current legislation favours the cherry picking that has been done for many years.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to community transport. I hope that he will commit himself to community transport associations such as the North Area Transport Association, which covers my constituency, and I hope that we can continue to develop such associations.

The debate also gives me an important opportunity to pay tribute to Gerry McCann, who has led the community campaign for Lightburn hospital&#8217;s future in the east end community.</p><p>Those members who are not familiar with the east end of Glasgow where Lightburn hospital is located will have heard on numerous occasions about the horrendous health challenges that the east end of Glasgow faces, which health professionals, academics, the press and the media have often advised us of. For example, 32 per cent of people who live there are more likely to die from heart disease, 36 per cent of them are more likely to have their health classified as not good and 40 per cent of them are more likely to die from lung cancer.</p><p>Taking that background into consideration, it seems astonishing that Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board proposes to accelerate the deterioration of those health figures by closing the very health facility that could assist in their improvement. For 65 years, Lightburn has been a lifeline facility for many of its users. Its 75 beds have been used by patients who require intensive support, such as those with Parkinson&#8217;s. I pay tribute to the valued service that staff at Lightburn have provided over those years.</p><p>I do not doubt for a minute that we are all united in our aspiration to improve public health. That should go without saying. I would have expected the same of Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board but, during its consultation on Lightburn&#8217;s future, it has displayed little concern for those people who will have to spend an additional 90 minutes on bus journeys to visit relatives or to attend day appointments. The board has been unable to deal with the many arguments that have been put to it in connection with public transport, and it has failed to provide evidence that the proposed changes would improve public health, which should be the aspiration of any health board. Its arrogance towards, and lack of concern for, those people who use Lightburn was displayed recently when it evicted the Parkinson&#8217;s group from the facility that has assisted its members&#8217; rehabilitation for many years. That is clearly unacceptable.</p><p>It is clear from my dealings with the health board over the years that a trend of running down health facilities that are earmarked for closure has prevailed for many years. It is the job of this elected chamber to stand up to that unacceptable practice of running down services before decisions have been taken by the relevant minister, and it is time that we did so.</p><p>In moving forward, I call on the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy&#8212;who, it must be noted, has unfortunately not attended the debate; I would welcome an explanation of why that is the case from the Minister for Public Health&#8212;to reject the recommendation that the health board has put to her. I do so for a number of reasons, which I included in my submission to the consultation process, but let me specify two of them.</p><p>First, the health board has again presided over a flawed consultation process in which, from the outset, it has promoted its own agenda by advising us of its preferred option. The process was so flawed that much of the information that was provided requires further clarification. I will elaborate. The board reports in its transport needs assessment that more than 80 per cent of those who attend the day hospital at Lightburn use an ambulance or patient transport and that less than 20 per cent of them travel by car. I note that the document says that none of them uses bus or train to travel to Lightburn hospital.</p><p>To suggest in that document that everyone from the east end has access to a car or patient transport shows clearly how out of touch the health board is with the reality of the local situation. Car ownership in the east end is among the lowest in the United Kingdom. It must be recognised that many of my constituents will have to use public transport&#8212;limited as it is, given the challenges that we face in the bus industry. That is a flaw in the consultation document proposals.</p><p>Secondly, and most important of all, I ask the minister to recognise the negative impact that such changes will have on the community and to take into consideration the fact that poor public transport links to the other sites will ensure that the residents of the east end of Glasgow face genuine challenges every day. We need to recognise that east-end residents will simply give up on visiting a relative who needs a visit in hospital, or give up on the much longer journey to an important day patient appointment.</p><p>I would think that the minister would have preferred an objective process that allowed for a genuine discussion on the hospital&#8217;s future, not a carefully crafted consultation document that pointed towards the response that the health board would welcome.</p><p>I do not doubt that the decision will be difficult for the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy, Nicola Sturgeon.

Unlike others who have made speeches over the past couple of weeks, this is not my maiden speech. Indeed, the subject that I will focus on&#8212;how best to manage registered sex offenders&#8212;is one that I have covered on many occasions, but I make no apologies for that.</p><p>On 24 June 2004, Mark Cummings, aged eight, was murdered by registered sex offender Stuart Leggate. Members will recall the campaign that Margaret Ann Cummings brought to this Parliament, following that tragic event, for better management of sex offenders. Her public petition ensured that the Parliament formed its first ever justice sub-committee, the Justice 2 Sub-Committee, which the current Cabinet Secretary for Justice was a member of, along with others. The sub-committee made 33 recommendations, the vast majority of which have been taken forward.</p><p>We should be encouraged by that, as we sometimes hear criticisms of the effectiveness of the Justice Committee and other committees in the Parliament, but we should recognise that during that process we set aside our political differences to protect our communities from the most dangerous individuals on our planet. I say that in the context that the vast majority of adults in Scotland have a decent and honest relationship with young people and interact positively with them. However, we need to recognise that sex offenders, in particular, find ways to evade being monitored, and we should take every measure possible in this Parliament to deal with that.</p><p>There have been many recent well-publicised examples, which is why it concerns me that, of the 33 recommendations, the one issue that remains outstanding&#8212;with which the cabinet secretary will be familiar&#8212;is the fact that sex offenders are not required to disclose their background to prospective housing providers. That is an issue for both the social rented sector and the private housing sector. Following the murder of Mark Cummings, I contacted the local housing provider and was astonished to learn that he had no knowledge of Stuart Leggate&#8217;s background when he allocated him a property in the Charles Street area of my constituency, within a multistorey development with closed-circuit television monitoring.</p><p>As protocols stand at the moment, housing providers do not require that information to be disclosed to them, although other information requires to be provided, such as information relating to an individual&#8217;s background&#8212;for example, whether they have been involved in antisocial behaviour and whether an antisocial behaviour order has been served on them. I welcome such questioning, but we should not exclude disclosure of information about sex offenders from housing application forms. I ask the cabinet secretary to address the matter in his concluding remarks and to consider it in further detail.</p><p>I hope that the Government will take forward challenges that were brought to us in Professor Irving&#8217;s report. I am sure that those of us who are familiar with his report recognise that he amplified several serious issues about how best to manage and monitor registered sex offenders&#8212;particularly the issue of social profiling, which I hope that the Government will progress.</p><p>We need to consider how we categorise offenders. Simply placing sex offenders on the register without properly assessing risk is not good enough. We must consider how best to develop that.</p><p>There are 3,258 registered sex offenders in Scotland, 2,591 of whom live in our communities. What concerns me about the statistics from police forces throughout Scotland is that 26 offenders are missing or abroad. The information that I can examine and interrogate shows that those individuals have been missing for the past five months. I seek an assurance from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice that the appropriate resources have been put in place to monitor those individuals. Does he find it acceptable that they have remained missing or abroad for the past five months? That is a challenge for the Government, which it should consider taking forward.</p><p>Johann Lamont talked about parliamentary scrutiny of the legislation to which Christine Grahame referred. On several occasions, I have heard politicians refer to the need not to have a knee-jerk reaction. Following the World&#8217;s End case, the First Minister said that politicians should not have a knee-jerk reaction. If that was good enough following that case, surely we should consider it in the context of what Christine Grahame, as the Justice Committee&#8217;s convener, has said.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary will deal with some of the issues that I have raised. I hope that we can move forward, particularly following the sad anniversary of the tragic murder of Mark Cummings.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in a justice debate.

It is recognised that being a member of the Public Petitions Committee does not offer the same headline-grabbing opportunities that other committees do, but the role is crucial in ensuring that members of the public have an opportunity to raise local and national issues of importance, and in monitoring petitions to ensure that the public get the engagement that they deserve from the process.</p><p>I have never been a member of the committee, but I have made representations on a number of occasions on behalf of constituents who have submitted petitions. I recall a petition that was raised some time ago by my constituent Margaret Ann Cummings, whose son Mark Cummings was tragically murdered by the registered sex offender Stuart Leggate.</p><p>In submitting her petition, Margaret Ann Cummings made some powerful and constructive points in respect of managing sex offenders. It was a very successful petition as, for the first time ever, the Parliament set up a sub-committee&#8212;of the Justice 2 Committee, in that case&#8212;which made more than 33 recommendations. That made a genuine difference to how the previous and current Governments formed their points of view about how to manage registered sex offenders.</p><p>Margaret Ann Cummings and other petitioners, including Margaret Watson, who is another constituent of mine, have commented on the respect that they felt they received at the committee and the genuine way in which the committee worked on a cross-party basis to consider their petitions. We should welcome that example of good practice.</p><p>I also welcome the committee&#8217;s public outreach programme, which involves visiting various parts of Scotland. As the convener pointed out, there are parts of Scotland that we would not have been able to reach if it was not for the process in which the committee engaged.</p><p>Of course, we should never be complacent, as Parliament sometimes can be. The committee has shown us, through its own level of best practice, the best ways to ensure that we engage with people throughout Scotland.</p><p>I am mindful of the fact that the committee is sometimes viewed as a last port of call for members of the public, who may have dealt with a number of authorities and now see the committee as a way of solving their concerns. We need to consider that, but we also need to think about why members of the public arrive at the petitions process in the first place. There may be some constructive work for the committee in the future in considering why members of the public are not being treated fairly by the authorities to which they have been referred. In my experience of petitions, that is particularly the case with the quango health boards throughout Scotland, which on many occasions have not listened to the concerns of local members of the public, who end up submitting a petition.

On behalf of his constituent Julie Love, Bob Doris made the important point that the committee allows the opportunity for issues to be debated and for members to consider whether to introduce a member&#8217;s bill.

The petitions process provides an opportunity for members to ensure that an issue is debated and that evidence is gathered.</p><p>I, too, pay tribute to Ryan McLaughlin, who is a credit to his mother and to other people on whose behalf he spoke. We should recognise that other parliamentary systems would not afford him and others the opportunity to make their case, which is sometimes passionate and personal. Petitioners should never apologise for speaking about their personal experiences and for ensuring that we take matters forward.</p><p>Members highlighted several petitions. The petition from John Muir was the first to create an opportunity for a debate in the chamber, among people with various views on knife crime, who considered the issues and challenges that face the Parliament in connection with knife crime. From speaking to John Muir and others who participated in that event, I know that they welcomed the opportunity to engage with politicians and felt that they were treated with respect and genuinely influenced the process. The more petitioners can be afforded the opportunity that John Muir was given to have an event, the better the Parliament&#8217;s reputation will be. I say well done to the committee&#8217;s members for giving John Muir that opportunity.</p><p>How we engage with young people was mentioned several times in the debate. All Saints secondary school in my constituency hosted the committee meeting at which the 1,000th petition to be lodged was considered. Young people were engaged in that. We need to consider how we engage with them on their terms, rather than on parliamentary terms, as in the past.

I remind them that it is all very well for them to make that point in their comfort zone, from the headquarters of whatever authority they serve; the issue is also complex for carers, who find themselves&#8212;sometimes unexpectedly&#8212;having to provide care for the young people they champion. I champion them for making that provision.</p><p>We should reflect on the casework that many of us have dealt with and which represent some challenges that kinship carers face. Over the years, I have learned that the commitment of kinship carers to ensuring that children are in a loving environment that gives them a future is a clear feature.</p><p>I will mention one person whom it is important to recognise&#8212;she will not mind me mentioning her name. She is my constituent Jessie Harvey, who <place-holder colnum=\"31808\"/> has been involved in the Poverty Truth Commission. She has been involved in several exchanges with elected representatives and she has been keen to speak her mind several times. We need that in today's debate&#8212;not just clear thinking but clear talking about how we can take the issue forward.</p><p>We should recognise the point that Jessie Harvey has made several times&#8212;that if it were not for the intervention of kinship carers such as her, where would we be and where would local authorities be? We can talk about the costs of child care and of full-time care and about a number of other challenges that would face the children involved if it were not for the interventions. We do not spend time on debating some of those challenges.</p><p>One challenge that faces us is the lack of a co-ordinated approach from local authorities when kinship carers take on their role. On many occasions, the approach is informal and the formality that should be attached is not present to ensure that kinship carers receive the support that they should have. Over the years, a number of kinship carers have made the point that they want a charter to be in place to ensure that they receive proper support when they decide to undertake kinship caring.</p><p>In my experience, the fact that kinship carers will care for the children is never in question. I have not yet met a kinship carer who said that they did not want to care for the young people and give them a future. However, kinship carers want authorities to give them effective support in the process. They also want to be treated with respect. Kinship carers are not respected when they are given promises of support in the process of taking on the role but that support does not transpire.</p><p>We do not debate kinship care enough, which must be a major disappointment to kinship carers. We all need to take responsibility for the fact that we have not debated the issue as often as we should. Let us learn that lesson from today.

She should be commended for her hard work and diligence on a highly complex issue. I vouch for the fact that she was determined to reach the chamber today&#8212;I shared the train journey with her. The phrase \"husky dogs\" was mentioned a <place-holder colnum=\"31309\"/> number of times, in case we could not get on that dreaded train. We are here, anyway.</p><p>The committee has provided a comprehensive analysis of the various challenges that we face in considering the bill. Patricia Ferguson has shown a mature attitude to taking on a number of those challenges, showing humility where required and ensuring that the issues will be dealt with at stage 2.</p><p>I am convinced that the bill will give consumers protection from the unscrupulous and unacceptable practices of many property factors. I understand that more than 200 factors are unregistered under the current regime, which is unacceptable.</p><p>Part 1, which deals with the registration of property factors, will require Scottish ministers to prepare and maintain a public register of all property factors. In the information age that we live in, it is perfectly reasonable to require such information to be provided on the internet. That requirement should not be seen as cumbersome; it should have been in place already. It should not be difficult to provide people with that sort of opportunity.</p><p>Part 1 will allow Scottish ministers to refuse or deregister a property factor, and to remove them from the register of factors. I welcome the inclusion of that provision in Patricia Ferguson's bill. When we discuss the issues and challenges that we could face if we were to deregister a factor, we should take into account some of the challenges that other professions face when people have to be deregistered. I do not remember anyone advising me that we could not deregister a dentist because he had a number of clients&#8212;that is like saying that we should not challenge the very principle of whether he should be a dentist in the first place, because of the chaotic circumstances that would ensue. As part of the principle of the issue, it should be accepted that, where a factor is not performing its duties, it should not be in place. However, I appreciate the challenges of dealing with title conditions and so on, and I hope that the minister can address some of those challenges.</p><p>A further challenge is the very principle of whether to regulate. As a number of witnesses stated at committee, the feature of regulation appears in a number of professions and has done for many years. It is a proven case, and David McLetchie amplified that point. The voluntary approach has simply not worked and, as has been stated by many people in the industry&#8212;from the profession itself&#8212;the rogue factors would simply opt out of the scheme if it was voluntary. What Patricia Ferguson proposes will provide clarity for all concerned, including reputable factors in the <place-holder colnum=\"31310\"/> industry. There are many such factors, but the rogue factors make it difficult to acknowledge that.</p><p>A number of members, including me, deal with cases that concern property factors. As I said, many factors try their best to provide a service, sometimes in difficult circumstances, for example when owners&#8212;often absentee landlords&#8212;show no interest in investing in their properties.</p><p>However, the issue is that there is not a level playing field. Consumers are being exposed to unscrupulous activity on the part of factors, particularly when they dispute bills. It is common for consumers to dispute invoices&#8212;I have done so many times and I am sure that many members have done likewise. A constituent of mine disputed a bill for &#163;8 from Walker Sandford Property Management, which turned into a bill for &#163;1,200, because of the charges for the reminder letters that were sent to him. I appreciate some of the challenges that Walker Sandford and other property managers face in collecting invoice returns, but it is unacceptable that the people whom they serve&#8212;our constituents&#8212;should be charged &#163;15 per letter or that a bill should accumulate to more than &#163;1,200.</p><p>I hope and am convinced that Patricia Ferguson's bill will deal with such unacceptable practice and that the provisions on dispute resolution will ensure that there is a level playing field for everyone.

She recognises that that is a barrier to people from underrepresented groups. That view was reinforced by a number of stakeholders, including chairs of public bodies.

As I said in the previous debate, we need to be cautious in our approach to that. Efficiency should not be sought at the cost of the service that we wish to deliver. That is the challenge that faces many of us as we try to ensure that the services that our commissioners deliver are accessible and transparent. There is absolutely no point in having the sort of one-stop shop that we have debated today when no one understands what it is or even realises its existence. How then can it help them in their everyday lives? It would be a problem for us all if the bodies that deal with complaints responded only to those who shouted the loudest or articulated their complaint most efficiently.

This legislation is being developed for the right reasons and in our constituents' best interests. Indeed, in this Parliament we do not revise legislation as often as we should, and we should take that fact into consideration.</p><p>We have heard in recent days, and will no doubt hear more in future, about the economic challenges that face us. Given that the SPCB-supported bodies are responsible for expenditure of more than &#163;7.5 million, we should take every step to improve their governance arrangements, and the bill provides for that.</p><p>Although, as Trish Godman said in the stage 1 debate, the start-up costs for the new commission for ethical standards in public life in Scotland, for example, will be considerable, there will in future years be savings compared with the cost of running three separate bodies. Also, I noted that in that debate it was estimated that accommodation costs would fall by between &#163;18,000 and &#163;25,000, and that a further &#163;10,000 in savings would be made by merging the chief investigating officer <place-holder colnum=\"27072\"/> and the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. I also believe that, in the first full year, other savings will amount to &#163;163,000. Given the current economic climate, we should welcome that, and I welcome the minister's commitment to ensure not only that we deliver effective services but that we are open to considering how best our Scottish commissions and commissioners might deliver those services. However, we must ensure that at every step along the way the Parliament is involved in discussing and interrogating the whole process.</p><p>Finally, I pay tribute to the hard work of Trish Godman and the other members of the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee.

Today I am taking the opportunity to interrogate such legislation.</p><p>In a recent debate on the subject, my colleague Johann Lamont stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am entirely sceptical towards most things about life, I was equally sceptical about the role of commissioners, and I was open minded about the options that were identified by the corporate body\".</p><p>I reassure Johann Lamont that she is in good company, as being sceptical is the norm in the Parliament.</p><p>On a serious note, there is no room for complacency. We should make no apologies for seeking to improve the role of our commissioners in our local communities.

That will allow the SPCB to rationalise the number of premises that the bodies use.

The approach will provide many opportunities to make best use of resources and to consider ways in which we can improve service delivery to members of the public.</p><p>During the debate and other recent debates on the issue, many colleagues have recognised the need for commissioners to be operationally independent. However, several colleagues have made the fair point that that should be balanced by ensuring that the Parliament's interests are considered. As members have said, we cannot be seen to be writing a blank cheque. The bill will provide the opportunity for scrutiny. As many members have alluded to, the process of holding commissions and commissioners to account will not dilute their independence. The opportunity for parliamentary committees to play a more prominent role in that is an important step. The process will provide a public record of the commissioners' role in our communities. There will be opportunities for commissioners to be held to account in a useful and constructive way that will allow them to provide more information.</p><p>This stage 1 debate is not a headline-grabbing debate such as the budget debate that is taking place in another place.

Punishment sometimes comes late.</p><p>I have taken time to peruse the stage 1 report. I pay tribute to the committee's hard work, particularly that of Helen Eadie, who is a long-serving member. It should be recognised that the committee is not afforded the headline-grabbing opportunities that other committees have but, as we have said on many occasions, its work is crucial to the workings of Parliament. I commend the committee for its work.</p><p>I will touch on a couple of issues that have been raised during the debate and during the committee's consideration of the bill at stage 1. Part 3 raises important issues about accessibility, publication and the preservation of acts of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish statutory instruments. In relation to publication and accessibility, the committee acknowledges that legislation is now most readily accessed online and accepts that print copies should no longer be the primary means of making available Scottish legislation. I note that we have made progress. The Scottish Government has given a commitment to make clear the requirement to publish all SSIs online. That must be welcomed, but I agree with the committee that the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"provisions of the Bill as introduced appear to fall short in terms of preservation of Scottish legislation.\"</p><p>The minister commented on that earlier, which is to be welcomed, but further consideration of the provisions is required.</p><p>I make those comments as someone who fully supports the digital revolution. I practise what I preach, as I run a paperless constituency office. However, the argument is not about the modernising agenda, but about how we preserve digital material. There is great merit in the committee's point that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in the absence of an internationally agreed standard for preservation of digital material, there should be a statutory duty on the face of this Bill for the Queen's Printer for Scotland to deposit printed copies of all ASPs ... with the National Library\".</p><p>I welcome the commitment from the minister to make progress on that. We should pay particular attention to the details and give careful consideration to preservation of digital material for future generations.</p><p>In evidence to the committee, issues were raised relating to the implementation of Scottish Law Commission reports. In particular, I refer to <place-holder colnum=\"22671\"/> the powerful evidence from Mr Iain Jamieson, particularly his reference to a statement from the chairman of the Scottish Law Commission, who said that there is a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"danger ... that Scots law will fall behind the rest of the world's legal systems in responding to the challenges of an era marked by rapid technological and economic change.\"</p><p>We should take such concerns seriously and consider how to make progress.</p><p>Given the significant public resource that is invested in the preparation of Scottish Law Commission reports, we believe that it is imperative that a logical approach be taken to ensure that the Government considers them properly. As the committee said, there seems to be merit in the system that has been adopted at Westminster when Law Commission reports are considered.</p><p>A wide range of comments have been made. As Bob Doris said, the debate is not the most addictive viewing for people in the public gallery or for our constituents in Glasgow. However, the technical nature of the bill requires us to consider the issues seriously. I hope that in the minister's closing remarks he will continue the constructive tone that has been set so far and refer to some of the issues that have been raised. I look forward to supporting the bill at stage 1, with the proviso that at stage 2 we will have to consider carefully the issues that have been raised.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495384", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, there might be time.

Its proposals have been debated over many years&#8212;those debates are available for scrutiny in the <em>Official Report</em> .</p><p>As a member of the Justice Committee, I remember being concerned about the volume of SSIs, in particular, that were debated at the committee&#8212;there always seemed to be concerns about the lack of full and proper scrutiny. I also felt that a large number of SSIs were considered prior to the recess. Today's debate affords us an opportunity to make progress in a practical sense.</p><p>However, it is important for us to recognise that the Subordinate Legislation Committee has highlighted a number of important issues. As the minister said, we have regulated those matters under the three transitional orders that were made under the Scotland Act 1998. The minister was right when he told the committee on 3 November that, 10 years on, it is the right time for us to move on.</p><p>I note that the Crown will now be bound by the terms of an act of the Scottish Parliament or instruments under such acts, unless it is expressly exempted. I suppose that that move is considered to be part of the modernising agenda. However, it is important to highlight the concerns that have been expressed by the judiciary, advocates and the Scottish Law Commission. On behalf of the Labour Party, I share the Subordinate Legislation Committee's concerns about some of the challenges that may be faced in connection with the future drafting of acts of the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"22659\"/> Parliament and Scottish statutory instruments. A constructive tone from the minister would be welcome, to ensure that further consideration is given to those concerns and to provide reassurances on how they can be addressed.</p><p>As the minister indicated, in paragraph 157 of its report the committee welcomed section 28, which will extend from 21 to 28 days the minimum period before an instrument that is subject to the negative procedure can come into force. That move is to be welcomed, but I understand the concerns that the committee expressed on the issue. Although the committee recognised the validity of the minister's concern that extending the period further could lead to delays in the lawmaking process, it made the point that he was painting a worst-case scenario that included the summer recess. It is not unprecedented for politicians in the chamber to paint the worst-case scenario. I do not necessarily criticise the minister for doing so, but it would be welcome for objective consideration to be given to other scenarios. Perhaps the Scottish Parliament information centre could provide that information. Jamie Stone made the point that the hand of the Parliament should be much stronger and that members should be afforded more opportunity to scrutinise instruments.</p><p>In the limited time available, I have been able to highlight only a couple of issues.

Those challenges have been created by many years of custom and practice that, as members have indicated, have not always served the best interests of those who seek fairness in our courts. In their speeches today, members have made clear that the status quo is not an option.</p><p>We were right to embark on the review back in February 2007, to identify ways of improving how the courts work. Lord Gill's report should be seen in a positive light, but that does not mean that we agree with all the recommendations that he has set out. It is important that we have a constructive dialogue to move the issue forward. I will highlight a number of issues that the report raises. Like other members, I do not profess to have read every page of the documents that are before us, but I have had an opportunity to peruse them and to highlight some of the issues that are important in taking forward the review.</p><p>Like other members, I commend those who served on the Gill review group for their hard work and diligence over a protracted period; I recognise their efforts. However, on a less positive note, I was disappointed that the group did not include trade union representation. The STUC's response to the review made the important point that, as major users of the civil courts, with experience of representing their members, the trade unions would have been a useful addition to the group.</p><p>The report refers to overreliance on temporary or part-time resources. I concur with the many respondents to the consultation who pointed out that, in any working environment, a lack of experience or commitment can lead to poor decision making and case management. On the face of it, there is a conflict of interest in having a solicitor or advocate who appears in a court sit in the same court in a judicial capacity on a part-time basis. We need to investigate that issue and to take further evidence on whether there is such a conflict of interest. We should examine how we can take forward Lord Gill's recommendation that part-time sheriffs be used mainly to cover leave, illness and emergencies. However, like other members, I recognise that they are a useful resource and play a crucial role in providing cover throughout our court system.</p><p>The report contains a useful set of recommendations in respect of information technology advancements in our court system. I have visited courts, toured procurator fiscal offices and visited legal establishments on many occasions and have become increasingly aware of the fact that a badge of honour seems to be attached to having volumes of paperwork on one's desk; I wonder whether Lord Gill had a similar experience in a previous life. The report confirms <place-holder colnum=\"20495\"/> that the management of paper files ties up important resources that could be invested elsewhere. The development of an e-filing system like the one in Singapore must be taken forward. As David Whitton and Bill Aitken mentioned, the report refers in detail to the benefits of conference calls in case management and to the positive effect of their use in commercial procedure in Glasgow sheriff court.</p><p>The report highlights some of the significant defences that exist in the civil court system. However, it does not go far enough when it says that we should encourage the use of IT systems. That could lead to patchy application of policy across the courts. Rather than encouraging the use of e-mails as a system of communicating with the courts&#8212;I am not convinced that that would work&#8212;we should consider making the use of IT systems compulsory.</p><p>Chapter 8 of the report refers to facilitating settlement and provides useful information on the current arrangements for the four pre-action protocols that exist in Scotland. The Digby Brown consultation response highlights the fact that the voluntary protocols that are currently in place have failed to address concerns about unrealistic pre-litigation offers. There can be no doubt that pre-action protocols are valuable and have a place in our justice system. We need all parties concerned to be willing to engage, but we also need to deal with those who do not display a willingness to enter into the general principles of pre-action protocols.</p><p>The report will have its critics and its plaudits. It is important that the Government shows leadership in pursuing reform, and we have committed to taking that forward with it. We should also ensure that there is balance in understanding the concerns that have been raised by those who are sceptical about the process.</p><p>Members will have received an e-mail from the Unite union, and I put it on record that I am a member. It raises concerns about the future of civil justice and seeks assurances in respect of access for workers. It would be useful for the Minister for Community Safety to provide clarification today that he is willing to continue engaging with stakeholders.</p><p>I call on the Parliament to support the addendum in the name of Richard Baker.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civil Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am stating the obvious when I say that it is clear from   today's debate that the Gill review has presented us with many challenges.

I can think of many examples in my constituency of the integration of the fire service into the local community&#8212;I am sure that members can think of examples in their areas. I was delighted to attend the Springburn fire station open day a couple of weeks ago, and I commend the service for giving the community access to its local fire station and for providing the all-important home safety advice to which the minister referred.</p><p>We are debating the draft fire and rescue framework because the Government has a legal requirement under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 to report to the Parliament and to advise on relevant authorities who are acting in accordance with the provisions of section 36(1). We will support the motion. We have lodged an amendment to the motion, and we will also support the amendment in the name of Robert Brown.</p><p>It is of fundamental importance that the Government has an open mind on issues that have been raised by stakeholders who have an interest in the framework. The Fire Brigades Union <place-holder colnum=\"19443\"/> provided a helpful briefing, which sets out a number of issues. First, on governance and structures, many words have been said over the years about the need for local fire services whose priorities are set locally. We should embrace that principle, but we should acknowledge that on occasions the setting of national priorities will have an effect on our ability to deliver local services. The FBU made a fair point when it said that ministers must be in a position to set national standards when that is required. It would be helpful if we could hear feedback from the minister on that point.</p><p>The 2005 act requires community planning partnerships to establish local single outcome agreements. It has been refreshing to witness the enthusiastic way in which my local fire service has engaged with community planning. In the past we failed to realise how important it is that the fire services should be key stakeholders in our local communities. We need to recognise that partnerships are key to providing benefits for our communities. I hope that the minister will continue to encourage such partnerships.</p><p>People who attack our firefighters while they carry out their important duties are a blight on our communities. The Parliament was right to deliver the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, which gave our firefighters more legal protection. The minister mentioned the work that is done with young people in particular, which I welcome&#8212;although it is not only young people who attack firefighters. Visits to local schools, for example, promote positive links with young people and are welcome.</p><p>In my and many other members' experience, the vast majority of people support firefighters and have done so for many years, and only a tiny minority view firefighters as a target for antisocial activities. We need to ensure that the 2005 act is doing what it is meant to do, by providing our prosecutors with a sentencing tariff that sends a clear message to people who will not listen to reason. We also need to be convinced that firefighters are reporting attacks and that they feel that the authorities are willing to act on those complaints.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that the key stakeholders document refers to supporting our local economies. During difficult economic times some businesses may feel under pressure to cut corners. The fire service can play a crucial role in providing advice on issues related to fire safety. We all recognise that fire safety legislation can sometimes be complex and bureaucratic, and it is a benefit to any business to have the fire service on its side with helpful and valuable advice.</p><p>It is widely acclaimed that our firefighters are trained to a very high level. The Scottish Fire <place-holder colnum=\"19444\"/> Services College provides that training, and I am sure that we all agree that it is of high importance to ensure that the safety of our firefighters is given priority. It is important that resources and time are spent on ensuring that that high standard of training is provided throughout Scotland. Labour believes that it is important that we get best value from the training that is delivered across Scotland and that standards are consistent.</p><p>It is important to highlight the concerns that have been raised by the FBU. Although it recognises that the Scottish Fire Services College provides a high standard of training, it is concerned that there appears to be less consistency in the training provided by local fire service authorities on what are identical training modules.</p><p>We all respect the fact that there will be different training requirements throughout the country, and of course there should be local flexibility in what is provided on many of those courses, but there is a need for the courses to be consistent throughout Scotland. It would be welcome if the minister, perhaps through an intervention or a comment in his closing speech, could advise us on how he wishes to take forward this issue that the FBU has raised.</p><p>When we passed the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, we did so with the support of all the main political parties and based on the principle that we wanted to improve the way that fire services are delivered throughout Scotland. At the same time, we wanted to promote equality and fairness. I believe that all of us would have signed up to that principle, so I was surprised to learn that there appears to be a fragmented approach towards discipline, grievance and dispute procedures. In particular, I note that only one fire authority provides employees with the right of appeal. The basic right to fairness in the workplace should always include the right of appeal.</p><p>I would be grateful for clarification of the Government's position on the issue. I hope that the minister agrees that when we passed the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 it was certainly not with a remit to remove the right of an employee to an appeal during a grievance procedure. It is important that we consider that issue in the context of fairness.</p><p>A number of wide-ranging and important issues will be raised in today's debate, and many key stakeholders have a number of views on them. We all recognise the important role that our fire and rescue services play in our local communities and their professionalism, which I would argue is recognised throughout the world. It is important&#8212;I have made this point throughout my speech&#8212;that the Government shows a willingness to have an open mind on how we shape the document that is before us and how we take forward many of the <place-holder colnum=\"19445\"/> issues that members who contribute to the debate will have to consider.</p><p>I hope that the Government can show leadership in that respect by recognising that, as the minister said, some difficult decisions will have to be taken. Those decisions must be taken for the right reasons, and in doing so we must embrace the principle that we will work together. I hope that members in other parties will be minded to support my amendment and Robert Brown's amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-4810.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and recognises the tremendous contribution and crucial role played by firefighters in Scotland and the need for consistent and rigorous enforcement of health and safety standards in fire and rescue services right across Scotland.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire and Rescue Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I concur with the minister's remarks in respect of the late Ewan Williamson, and on behalf of my party I send our condolences to his family during this difficult time.

The Scottish Government has failed the justice system by allowing Mr Megrahi to be released and transported as a free man to a hero's welcome in Tripoli.</p><p>Kenny MacAskill has failed to answer a number of simple, straightforward questions today. Why could not Mr Megrahi serve his sentence in a facility that was managed by the SPS? Let us put it on the record that Labour members would not have expected him to arrive at the Marie Curie <place-holder colnum=\"19076\"/> hospice in Springburn, but we believe that other options were not given due consideration. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice has failed to demonstrate how he interrogated the options that were before him. The police estimates that Mr MacAskill presented to the chamber have no status or proper scrutiny attached to them. In Mr MacAskill's words, Mr Megrahi is a \"dying man\". Suggesting that a dying man requires 48 police officers to guard him clearly requires further investigation. I was concerned about the option-appraisal process that was carried out via a telephone call to the assistant chief constable. That was a sloppy manner in which to carry out an appraisal. Did the Government, which is concerned about potential costs, take into account the costs of the hundreds of police officers who were required to police the Faslane 365 protest, which its party took part in? No, it did not.</p><p>The evidence that victims were a true part of Mr MacAskill's decision is also open to question. Some 189 of the victims on the Pan Am flight were Americans. Given the grief of their families and the fact that such robust concerns were raised by the US Government, like Jack McConnell and many others I am disappointed that Mr MacAskill sought to engage with the families of the American victims via videoconference. I genuinely do not wish to make a cheap point&#8212;this is a serious issue&#8212;but, given that ministers are only too happy to cross the Atlantic for events such as tartan week and the homecoming event, why did the cabinet secretary not make that same journey to consult with the American political representatives and the families who have been so affected by Lockerbie? To meet Mr Megrahi personally, but the American victims only via videoconference, is to get one's priorities very wrong. Even worse, when we examine the documents that have been made available for the public record, we see that the meeting was at the request of Mr MacAskill.</p><p>Many of us were disgusted at the VIP reception that Mr Megrahi received on his arrival in Tripoli. The scenes of a convicted Libyan bomber being welcomed in Tripoli should have been avoided. Although I accept that we cannot control the outbursts of jubilation from the Libyan people, we should have considered how conditions could have been attached to Mr Megrahi's release to ensure that public grandstanding was prevented. We should have considered including provisions dealing with Mr Megrahi's behaviour, given that he is still on licence and is still required to report to East Renfrewshire Council. Surely that message should have been sent out. I ask once again that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice put on record and make available for public viewing the representations that he made to the Libyan Government calling on it to keep its particular homecoming event at a low key.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173555", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi (Decision)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that I do not have time.

The Government <place-holder colnum=\"18533\"/> press release refers to the prison estate that the Government inherited. It is important to recognise the work that was carried out by the previous Scottish Executive, under the leadership of Jim Wallace and Cathy Jamieson, to modernise the prison estate. In 2005, the previous Executive announced an investment in HM Prison Edinburgh of &#163;16 million. That included a new prisoner house block and a health education centre, which enabled slopping out in Edinburgh to end. At HMP Glenochil, a &#163;28 million investment enabled the construction of a new prison house block and a health centre. That investment also allowed us to move forward. Under the previous Executive, an investment of more than &#163;35 million in HMP Perth enabled the construction of a new prisoner house block, a health centre and an activity centre, which allowed the ending of slopping out in Perth.</p><p>I could go on, but the important point is that the previous Executive highlighted concerns about slopping out and took action to ensure that the number of cells in which slopping out was required reduced from more than 1,900 in 2001 to the figures that have been referred to today. It made a significant investment in the prison estate, at an unprecedented level.</p><p>Such investment in the prison estate does not fit with the populist agenda. Understandably, the vast majority of our constituents want money to be invested in schools, community facilities, health centres and so on, and politicians respond to that. The passage of the bill will lead to savings of an estimated &#163;50 million, so perhaps we can meet the aspirations of our local communities in that respect.

I will touch on a number of the themes that have been raised today and at stages 1 and 2.</p><p>As John Lamont mentioned, the common-law system allows courts to take account of aggravating factors in determining sentences. It is important that we recognise and respect that but, as I said during the stage 1 debate, it is also important that we represent the views of those who contributed to the evidence sessions. Witnesses told us that the common law cannot send out a clear message that such hate crimes are unacceptable in Scotland, and it was generally felt that establishing an offence of statutory aggravation would address many of the motivations behind such crimes.</p><p>I am disappointed that the bill does not contain any provisions for mandatory sentences. As Patrick Harvie will be aware, I have raised that point on a number of occasions in a constructive manner. I made the point, which Margaret Smith and Bill Kidd also touched on, that there are some individuals who, as a result of their social profile&#8212;as I would refer to it&#8212;will not respond to anything other than a robust mandatory sentence.

Sometimes our authorities do not get it right in dealing with members of the public, and particularly with disabled groups, as the RNID points out.

Working with the UK Government, we delivered an effective piece of legislation. Without the 2002 act, we would not be debating the cashback for communities scheme in the first place.</p><p>The prosecution of criminals has always taken priority and it will continue to do so. However, it has always been unacceptable that the ownership of the proceeds of crime remained immune from legal challenge where criminal proceedings were not available. The 2002 act gives the police the power to seize the cash of suspected drug <place-holder colnum=\"18033\"/> dealers. The principle and ethos of the legislation is that the moneys that are seized should be reinvested in communities that are affected by crime.</p><p>Like other members, I have seen so-called drug barons flaunting their wealth in communities, with their flash cars and luxury homes, and showing contempt for authority. As Bill Aitken and others have said, that sets the wrong example to future generations. That is why the humiliating&#8212;to them&#8212;process of recovering drug dealers' wealth is to be welcomed. However, despite the best efforts of the many people who are involved in the process, I am not convinced that we recover anything like as much cash as we should. Richard Baker is correct to say that we should not blame anybody for that, because we recognise the challenges that are involved, but the moneys that are recovered are minute compared with the sums that criminals obtain. Using the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, \"Panorama\" found that, in the past three years, the Scottish unit that is responsible for criminal confiscations froze &#163;60 million of assets but managed to recover just &#163;6 million of that. We all find that unacceptable. Collaboration between all the relevant agencies is important.</p><p>On regeneration, as Margaret Curran has said, our communities are held back because of the unacceptable criminal activities that take place within them. Tricia Marwick mentioned that as well. The Parliament must represent not the minority but the majority of people in our communities, who live responsible lives.</p><p>We welcome the cashback for communities programme, but we do so on the basis that the communities that are most affected by crime will see the recovered money. There are examples of cashback money being invested in my constituency. Bob Doris helpfully mentioned operation reclaim, which has been running successfully for the past five or six years, following the tragic murder of Firsat Dag in Sighthill in 2001. The additional funding from the cashback programme has been welcome. Reidvale adventure playground in my constituency has also benefited.</p><p>There are many good examples of activities for the young, but as others have said, we need more transparency in how projects are identified for funding. I ask the minister to clarify the process in his closing speech. Does a project board decide how funds are invested? It is important that the process is transparent and that we move forward on that basis.</p><p>Those who have suffered because of criminal activities should see the proceeds of crime. As Michael Matheson and Tricia Marwick said, we should ensure that our communities are <place-holder colnum=\"18034\"/> empowered to apply for funding. That is another important aspect. All too often, it is those who are more informed or are considered more sophisticated whose applications for Government funding are successful. I am afraid to say that parts of my constituency such as Springburn, Ruchazie and Blackhill, Possilpark in Patricia Ferguson's constituency, and other areas have suffered dramatically because of drug barons. A number of members made the constructive point that those communities must be genuinely empowered to apply for funds.</p><p>We should also examine the basic criteria for funding. After all, we want the majority of it to be provided to communities rather than to the authorities that fight crime. I know that certain police authorities in England and Wales have benefited from the cash that has been seized. Richard Baker raised the possibility of police chief constables looking for up to 50 per cent of the assets seized. I acknowledge that the cabinet secretary is dealing with that issue. I understand why police officers and other authorities that fight crime might find the prospect of keeping the cash appealing, and I realise that some might even argue that such a move would incentivise police officers, but I do not think that anyone should need to be incentivised in dealing with this matter. Instead, we should be motivated by our determination to humiliate criminals by stripping them of their wealth and ensuring that they get the message that they will not benefit from our communities and that we will stand up to them and their associates.</p><p>The \"Panorama\" programme that was transmitted earlier in the year filmed Michael Voudouri, who pocketed more than &#163;3 million from an international fraud scheme that he ran. According to the programme, Mr Voudouri, who served a prison sentence for his crime, now lives in a &#163;2 million house in the Stirlingshire town of Bridge of Allan&#8212;in Richard Simpson's area, I understand&#8212;and drives a &#163;60,000 car. We have to address the public's concern that although we deal with the perpetrators of crime, their families and associates still benefit from those crimes. Indeed, Bill Aitken has made the same point on a number of occasions. We must send a very clear message to those individuals that we will ensure that the law is on our side instead of, as Richard Baker has pointed out, the legal aid system apparently being on their side.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15015668", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is always welcome to get the last penny out of the drug baron's pocket, and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides an opportunity to do that.

There is no doubt that the Amber alert system has great merit and would make a difference to the protection of children from people who pose a threat to community safety.</p><p>A great achievement of the Parliament is that we can show unity when we give priority to children's safety. We have done that on a number of occasions. I experienced such unity when the sub-committee of the Justice 2 Committee in the previous session of the Parliament considered the management of registered sex offenders. The need to ensure children's safety lay at the heart of the sub-committee's report.</p><p>Many parents have experienced that heart-stopping feeling when we momentarily lose sight of our child. The relief that we feel when we find them is indescribable. It must be unbearable for parents who are not so lucky&#8212;there are many well-publicised examples, such Kate and Gerry McCann. We need to be convinced that every opportunity is taken to enable a missing child to be found by the relevant authorities. The missing children alert scheme would provide added protection.</p><p>Every year some 130,000 children go missing in Europe. We know that the sooner information on a missing child reaches the public, the greater the chance of tracing them. That is why the proposals for an EU-wide alert scheme are to be welcomed. We know that a similar system in the United States works well, as Robert Brown said. Since 2003, that scheme has recovered more than 400 children, of whom 80 per cent were recovered in the crucial first 72 hours. I am aware that the proposed scheme has the majority backing of MEPs, including Catherine Stihler and David Martin, and I hope that we are a step closer to ensuring that any child who goes missing in Europe is given the best chance of being recovered.</p><p>As I said, every year, more than 130,000 children go missing in Europe. Most are returned within a week but, on average, each year six children are never found. The pain behind those statistics cannot be described. That should ensure our determination to progress the issue and look at every possible avenue to ensure the safety of our children. There is no doubt that a scheme <place-holder colnum=\"17911\"/> similar to the Amber alert scheme in the United States would save lives. The European Parliament's initiative is a good example of how Europe-wide action can make a real difference.</p><p>The USA's Amber alert scheme operates in 13 states and has successfully saved the lives of many abducted children by breaking into media broadcasts to give details of suspected child abductions and by flashing up messages on highway signs that alert drivers to keep an eye out for children. Robert Brown spoke about the scheme's approach. The criteria that are used to trigger such alerts are as follows: the child should be under 16 and missing; a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent thinks that the child might suffer serious harm or death; the child must have been kidnapped or be suspected of having been kidnapped; and there must be sufficient descriptive details of the victim or the offender to justify the alert.</p><p>Having spent 10 years as an MSP, it seems ridiculous and unacceptable to me that such a scheme is not already in place. Many of us have the notion that such a scheme should involve a much more sophisticated approach&#8212;I learned that as a result of scrutinising the legislation on the management of registered sex offenders.</p><p>We live in a computer age. We use the internet, mobile communications, blogs and so on. Surely we can use such information technology to our advantage to ensure that our children are given every possible opportunity.</p><p>The Parliament is at its best when we work together to ensure the safety of our children. I urge the minister to listen to all the parties' points of view and implement a scheme that plugs the gap that exists nationwide before more children go missing.

As many members have suggested, the community courts model provides a structure for those opportunities to be delivered, but it is clear from the speeches of the apologists on the SNP benches that the SNP is out of touch with the reality that our communities face. Our communities want to see justice done, yet the SNP is the only main party in the Parliament that does not adequately support community courts.</p><p>It is not only the main political parties that support community courts; the Lord Advocate said, in March 2007:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This court will be at the heart of the community, delivering justice that is swift, visible and informed by a thorough understanding of the offender's background and of the impact of the offence in the wider community.\"<place-holder colnum=\"17197\"/></p><p>With the greatest respect to the High Court in Glasgow, I do not consider it to be at the heart of the community. That was wise counsel from the Lord Advocate, who has significant experience of the courts in delivering justice for our communities.</p><p>Frank McAveety referred to the proposal to develop a court in the Bridgeton area of his constituency. That proposal provided an opportunity to ensure that the courts would be seen as relevant and effective in providing solutions to many of the problems that Bridgeton and other parts of Glasgow face in respect of antisocial behaviour in our communities.</p><p>We show humility sometimes and realise the need to be objective. We recognise that courts alone cannot solve all the problems, and so do our communities. We believe strongly that communities have a role in contributing to solving many community problems.</p><p>Many communities sense that courts are removed, attitudinally and physically, from the problems they face. I do not believe that our courts properly appreciate the challenges that our communities face when they try to combat antisocial behaviour.</p><p>As Richard Baker and other Labour members said, we support the principle of payback. That is why, in government, Cathy Jamieson did not just talk a good game but delivered the game. She delivered community reparation orders, which were scrapped by this Government. I have yet to speak to any community representative who does not want certain offenders to be given the opportunity to face up to their unacceptable actions. Reparation orders provided that very opportunity, and so too would community courts.</p><p>The problem lies with the Government's unwillingness to fund community courts adequately. There can be no doubting that community courts will cost money but, with regard to the point Robert Brown made about the spend-to-save principle, I would say that spending money on community courts would save money in the long run.</p><p>Compare the cost of a community court&#8212;&#163;3.75 million, with annual costs of &#163;700,000&#8212;with the effect that vandalism and antisocial behaviour have on our communities throughout Scotland. Courts often talk about low-level offences, but those so-called low-level offences are not low level to the communities that are affected by antisocial behaviour. I say that on behalf of my constituents and the pupils of Balornock primary school, whose playground project has been vandalised. They want action to be taken to stop antisocial behaviour. We believe that the community courts would have provided an opportunity for that to happen.<place-holder colnum=\"17198\"/></p><p>The debate has exposed this Government's lack of innovation.

I will highlight some of the issues that were raised in the stage 1 process. The committee recognised that the common-law system allows courts to take account of aggravating factors in determining sentences. However, a number of witnesses told us that the common law cannot send a clear message that such hate crimes are unacceptable in Scotland. The general feeling was that having a statutory aggravation will address the motivation behind such crimes.</p><p>On balance, Labour members are content that the statutory aggravations should be created. We need to ensure that we take every possible step to send out a clear message to those who commit <place-holder colnum=\"15881\"/> crimes of hatred because of an individual's presumed sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.</p><p>The bill contains no provision for mandatory sentences. Many witnesses made the case that an appropriate response was the way forward and that the judiciary should have discretion in sentencing. Although I accept the right of the judiciary to have discretion in sentencing, I believe that we need to monitor carefully the effectiveness of sentencing policy in dealing with those who commit hate crimes. The Parliament needs to acknowledge the unacceptable fact that some individuals react only to the possibility of a prison sentence. Patrick Harvie has to take that into consideration and he may want to address it in his closing speech.</p><p>Although the community sentencing disposals to which Tim Hopkins referred in his evidence can be considered as a serious alternative to prison, I am not convinced that they are always appropriate sentencing options for the perpetrators of the crimes that were described to the committee.</p><p>The bill requires that, in recording a conviction that contains an aggravation relating to disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity, the court must do so in a manner that shows that the offence was motivated by prejudice on one of those grounds. The step is to be welcomed, but I would have expected such information to be recorded at present, although we heard evidence about the difficulties of recording such crimes. On a positive note, Superintendent David Stewart told the committee that recording these statutory aggravations will give police forces baseline figures to work from and allow them to target resources. That is a positive step in the right direction.</p><p>There can be no doubt that training plays a crucial role in raising awareness of legislation. As we have heard on many occasions in the chamber, it is important for new legislation to be implemented consistently and robustly. In this case, additional resources may be required. I would welcome a commitment from the minister in his closing speech that resources will be provided to the relevant agencies.</p><p>There is no point in passing the bill if crimes are not reported, so we must ensure that victims are given respect and proper consideration. In its written submission, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People Scotland stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"deaf and hard of hearing people are even less likely to report crimes against them because some find it difficult to access police services. For example, police stations may struggle to find interpreters at short notice when deaf people who use BSL as a first language want to report a crime. As a young deaf man who tried to report a crime at his local police station recalls: 'I had to wait for an <place-holder colnum=\"15882\"/> interpreter at the police station from 4.30pm to 10pm and in the end, I was tired.'\"</p><p>If people are to be convinced that they should report crimes and that they will be taken seriously, we must ensure that an action plan is in place to deal with such experiences.</p><p>I call on the Parliament to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14855737", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Patrick Harvie on the progress that he has made so far on the bill.

In press reports earlier this week, rather than express his thanks to local authorities for making sacrifices in their budgets to bail him out, Mr MacAskill sought to put the SNP's spin on the very little progress that has been made and on the budgetary commitments that the Government <place-holder colnum=\"15464\"/> has failed to make. As I have said on many previous occasions, it is unacceptable that the SNP Government should claim that its interventions have made a difference to police numbers. I have a restricted document with me today that confirms that, despite the SNP Government's conditioning of the public message, the SNP's interventions have not made a difference on police numbers. The document shows that many of our police authorities intended to review their recruitment levels regardless of the Government's intervention.</p><p>On previous occasions, many members have asked why the Labour Party did not promise to deliver 1,000 extra police officers, so I remind them that making the promise is easy, but delivering on the promise is the challenge. The people will judge the Government not on the promises that it made but on the broken promises on which it has not delivered.

It's not right that taxpayers pick up the whole of the bill, licensees should pay their way too.\"</p><p>Such a \"get tough\" message on alcohol abuse from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has received support on previous occasions from those of us on the Labour benches. During the passage of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, I lodged an amendment that would have allowed us to ensure that the polluter pays, but my amendment was opposed by Fergus Ewing and Bruce Crawford. Because of their opposition, we were unable to introduce that polluter-pays principle. Mike Rumbles&#8212;whom I see on the other side of the chamber&#8212;will recall that amendment. The polluter-pays principle is not accepted by all members of the Scottish Government, which is divided on the issue.

Although many chief constables, including Stephen House of Strathclyde Police, have said that they want to take steps to minimise abstraction of community police officers, doing so can sometimes be difficult, given competing demands for officers. I recently observed the policing operations during a Rangers and Celtic game at Ibrox football ground, at which it was clear that many of the 500 police officers had been abstracted from communities throughout the west of Scotland. Although we should accept that such events require police resources, it is important to accept that football clubs, for example, should be required to compensate police authorities properly for the time that police officers spend at events such as football games.

Bill Butler has said a number of times that we need to recognise that there are some serious individuals who need to be imprisoned for the safety of our communities, which should not be jeopardised by the Scottish Government's drive to empty our jails because it has failed and because it is so inept and lethargic when it comes to procuring our new prisons.</p><p>I call on the cabinet secretary to confirm when the new Low Moss prison will be complete. I am not interested in the construction start date or in the procurement process at this time&#8212;that will be a debate for later. We want to know when the prison will be complete. I would be more than happy to accept an intervention from the cabinet secretary on that point, but he is not willing to make one.</p><p>A number of members expressed genuine concerns about how the Government will ensure that the many measures that are set out in the document will be delivered. We want to know how they will be delivered in financial terms. The document will mean nothing unless the Government sets out clearly how it will ensure that the resources for a \"fair, fast and flexible\" justice system are delivered. It is not good enough simply to produce a glossy document that says nothing about how the Government will deliver on it. Robert Brown, Bill Butler and Bill Aitken all made that point a number of times. It is about attention to detail and about ensuring that we know how the measures will be taken forward.</p><p>Delivering a \"fair, fast and flexible\" justice system will be resource intensive&#8212;I think every member who spoke made that point a number of times. It will require new programmes for payback schemes and additional resourcing for drug treatment and testing orders, to which Richard Simpson referred. The money is simply not there. If the minister is confident that the money is there, he should show us. I am happy for the minister to give us a chance at some point&#8212;perhaps in another document&#8212;to follow the money so that we can ensure that it is brought forward.<place-holder colnum=\"13885\"/></p><p>The Government must stop hiding behind the so-called historic concordat, which is now prehistoric, and show leadership by making it clear how it wishes to advance its vision.</p><p>A number of members asked why Labour members are so strongly opposed to the scrapping of six-month sentences, and accusations have been made that Richard Baker and Bill Aitken are competing for right-wing credentials. We are opposed to the scrapping of six-month sentences because we are in touch with the realities of our local communities. We are on the side of the people in those communities and we understand their genuine concerns about community safety. Bill Butler was extremely effective in amplifying those concerns on behalf of his constituents. We will take every opportunity to express the genuine concerns of our constituents.</p><p>Many offenders have been given two, three, four or five opportunities to mend their ways. For us, the safety of our communities is the paramount consideration. It is simply not good enough to make statements in a glossy document: the Government must mean what it says. Of course we want to provide opportunities for people to be rehabilitated inside and outside our prisons, but we must at the same time consider our communities.</p><p>The Government's document mentions the kind of alternatives to custody that offenders would be involved in. The section entitled \"Paying back to communities\" gives the example of the wibbly-wobbly wall that was built by offenders in Orkney. Is that an example of the tough alternatives to custody that Henry McLeish mentioned in the Scottish Prison Commission's report? Wibbly-wobbly walls have been built by offenders for many years&#8212;in recent years, Bill Aitken might even have given a number of people community service sentences that have involved such activities. Community service has been carried out for decades. The wibbly-wobbly wall that has been built in Orkney is not an example of \"innovation\", so why does the minister refer to it as such? Community service orders have been available for decades; they are not an innovation.</p><p>Although the idea of payback sounds good, we must track offenders more effectively after payback, once they have served their sentences. Labour has said on several occasions that no effective evaluation has been carried out to ensure that community disposals work.</p><p>The Government's policy is based on the assumption that the judiciary's increased use of custody over the years reflects dissatisfaction with the rigour of community-based alternatives and that if community sentences were more rigorous, more severe sentencers would make more use of them, thereby reducing their use of custodial <place-holder colnum=\"13886\"/> sentences. That is a simplistic belief. As Bill Aitken acknowledged, many factors come into play, including the offender's circumstances, their condition, the nature of the offence and the nature of the offender's past convictions. The Government's commentary that sheriffs are using community sentences to deal with daft laddies who need a bit of tender loving care simply does not add up. The Government must address such issues.</p><p>As Labour members, we are proud of our record on justice. When it mattered to local communities, we were on their side. That will always be the case. I am delighted that my colleague Dave Stewart will lodge a proposal for a member's bill to set up a new victims commissioner, which I hope will receive the support of members of other parties.

Aileen Campbell gave <place-holder colnum=\"13562\"/> a clear example of the cavalier attitude that existed.</p><p>We have moved forward, and we should acknowledge that we have done so as a result of some extremely constructive public awareness campaigns that have set out a zero-tolerance approach to drink driving.

It works with senior pupils and college students to consider a range of issues that face new drivers, and it emphasises the dangers of drink driving. I note that around 1,500 young people take part in the project every year. The project's content reflects the findings of statistical evidence and feedback from emergency services personnel. We sometimes miss out the emergency services when it comes to feedback. Consultation is also done with education officers and road users. We must welcome the innovative and hard-hitting approach that the safe drive, stay alive campaign has adopted, particularly its involvement of the parents of road accident victims and other victims.</p><p>Our amendment recognises that the consultation that the UK Government is carrying out on road safety and related matters offers a holistic approach to the five key areas of speeding, drink driving, seatbelt wearing, drug driving and careless driving. I believe that the Department for Transport's consultation is a fair and comprehensive document. In relation to the point that Mr Brown and Mr Finnie&#8212;who has left the chamber&#8212;made, I refer to the consultation's invitation to respondents to say</p><p class=\"indent\">\"what priority they think should be given to a change in the prescribed alcohol limit for driving\".</p><p>The consultation could not be any clearer; it will provide opportunities to respond on that specific issue.</p><p>I will not take any lectures from a Government that has passed only one piece of justice legislation and one piece of transport legislation in <place-holder colnum=\"13563\"/> 21 months and that has passed a total of only seven bills since it came to power.

Richard Simpson dealt with the matter constructively. We believe that alcolocks, which work by linking the ignition to an onboard breathalyser, constructively use the technology available to deal with persistent offenders who take every opportunity to evade the law.</p><p>This is not the last time we will debate this issue.

I give special recognition to Des McNulty and Duncan McNeil, who with others have campaigned on the issue since the Parliament's formation. I am proud of the stance that the Parliament is, I hope, taking. However, given what John Lamont said, I am not sure of that. I take it, though, that the Conservatives support the bill.</p><p>We are taking a stance on behalf of the hard-working men and women throughout Scotland who have been negligently exposed to asbestos. Like <place-holder colnum=\"12053\"/> others, I pay tribute to the role that unions such as Unite have had, alongside Clydeside Action on Asbestos, in addressing the serious challenges that claimants face.</p><p>The key word for me during this stage 1 debate has been \"negligence\". To all those who protest against and oppose the bill, particularly the insurance companies, I say that we would not be here were it not for the fact that&#8212;I direct this point to Jackson Carlaw&#8212;employers exposed their workers to asbestos. Indeed, it has been known since 1892&#8212;this fact has been clarified&#8212;that asbestos is a poisonous substance. The Justice Committee received written evidence that industry leaders on some occasions deliberately ignored and, indeed, hid the dangers of asbestos. That written submission has not been contested. It is important to take that into consideration, while entering into the spirit of consensus on the issue and ensuring that we take it forward.</p><p>The more that I consider the issue, the more concerned I become about the way in which men and women have been labelled a problem by the insurance industry. Let us be clear: the claimants are victims. The problem is with those employers who exposed the victims to asbestos. I refer to the evidence that we received from the insurance industry. Perhaps it is not surprising that it raised concerns that the enactment of the bill would result in insurance premiums increasing. However, from the evidence that we received, I believe that that view is speculative and has little effective written evidence to support it.</p><p>During an evidence-taking session, I asked Dominic Clayden&#8212;the director of technical claims at Norwich Union Insurance Ltd&#8212;the following question:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"So it is possible that there will not be an increase in premiums.\"</p><p>Despite his having provided us with significant written evidence advising that there would be an increase in insurance premiums, he admitted in his response:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There may not be, but if the bill is enacted, it will create an upward pressure on premiums in Scotland.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Justice Committee</em>, 2 September 2008; c 1032.]</p><p>I cannot help observing that another pressure on premiums may be the massive legal costs that the industry has incurred as a result of raising 10 test cases in England and Wales. Perhaps the industry's vigorous and aggressive approach towards dealing with those claims has raised the possibility that insurance premiums might be increased.</p><p>Several witnesses on various occasions said, \"Of course, this is an emotive subject.\" Of course the subject is emotive. It is emotive for those who have been exposed to asbestos and for their <place-holder colnum=\"12054\"/> worried families. They should make no apologies whatsoever for being emotive.</p><p>What compounds such feelings of anxiety is that the insurance industry's answer to the problem is to educate claimants to condition them into thinking that they need not worry any further about their condition. Once again, I cannot help observing from my recent experience of submitting a life assurance form, for which I was subject to the usual interrogation process that many of us will have experienced, that the insurance company did not say that I need not advise it of particular medical conditions. As I recall, I was interrogated about, and had to submit details on, every possible medical condition. If the insurance industry advises that information on pleural plaques need not be submitted in a medical insurance application form, I am sure that we will be able to take the issue forward.</p><p>As several members have said, pleural plaques are not visible. The disease causes irreversible damage to the lining of the lung such that, if it involved visible tissue, compensation would obviously not be denied. The fact that pleural plaques do not affect a person's external appearance should be irrelevant.</p><p>On the financial memorandum, it is not often that I disagree with Bill Aitken but I am not uneasy with the challenges that we face in respect of the bill. Of course the Parliament's role is to scrutinise any legislation that is introduced, but the challenges that the bill presents are no different from those that we face with every piece of legislation that is introduced. Let us be clear on one thing: the political will of the Parliament is to proceed with the bill. I believe that that view will prevail.</p><p>I read with interest the <em>Hansard</em> report of the debate that was secured by Jim Sheridan MP. In a powerful speech, he used his personal experience of having worked in Glasgow's shipyards to provide an account of the irresponsible attitude of employers. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I remember times when we could see asbestos dust floating in the air. The foremen would tell us to carry on working because it would not do us any harm. I do not blame the foremen or managers, because they were only doing as they were told.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, House of Commons</em>, 23 January 2008; c 460WH.]</p><p>That is the account of a man who personally experienced the shipyards.</p><p>In conclusion, we on the Labour benches believe that the bill deals with an industrial legacy of which Scotland's employers should be ashamed.

As the minister correctly pointed out, the bill has been developed over several years, especially since 2006, when Cathy Jamieson was a minister.</p><p>We have heard many good speeches today, but I do not expect today's debate, which has had an historically unprecedented degree of consensus, to be widely reported. I do not expect Sky News or the BBC to report how consensual we have been today, but neither do I expect the man or woman in the street to get excited about the bill. However, it is important to recognise that the Parliament plays an important role in engaging with the judicial authorities and responding to their concerns in the context that Robert Brown mentioned. We need such legislation to deliver a fair justice system in our communities throughout Scotland.</p><p>The transfer of Scottish Court Service functions to the Lord President has been a continuing issue. Throughout the process we have been advised by the judiciary that widening the role of the judiciary to include the management of our courts will improve the delivery of justice. We will hold the Lord President to that commitment. We on the Labour benches support the proposed transfer, but we will carefully monitor how effective that transfer is. We expect the Lord President to recognise that, as democratically elected representatives, we will want to interact with him in ensuring that we are able to scrutinise the management of our courts service. I have not yet received the correspondence that the Lord President has apparently sent me. I look forward to receiving it, and anticipate that it will be helpful and will show how far we have moved forward in the debate.</p><p>Unlike Bill Aitken and John Lamont, we supported the provision on a complaints reviewer. Chapter 4 refers to judicial conduct, and I refer in particular to the proposal for a complaints reviewer. The world we live in is, helpfully, now more open and accountable, so more than ever it is good that we should ensure that the independence of the judiciary continues. We also have a responsibility to ensure that procedures are being followed properly, and we believe that the complaints reviewer will provide that opportunity. In the modern world, that should be welcomed.</p><p>Like others, including Richard Baker and Nigel Don, we strongly support the case for mandatory training. There is compelling evidence, particularly in relation to cases in which children give evidence&#8212;that we require certain levels of sensitivity and experience. Like others, I have the greatest respect for those who serve on our judicial benches; many have many years' experience and we should commend them for their <place-holder colnum=\"11286\"/> hard work over the years but, like others&#8212;including us&#8212;they are not infallible, and they, too, can benefit from training and, in turn, provide a better service to the public. If the Lord President is determined to ensure that that is the outcome of this legislation, that will be a step forward. We will monitor the delivery of mandatory training carefully.</p><p>It should be noted that, once again, we have placed greater responsibility on the judiciary. Their destiny is now in their hands and they must ensure that better justice is delivered. Today, our exchanges have been constructive and consensual to an unprecedented level.

We worked closely with the Liberal Democrats to ensure that those who were in prison needed to be in prison. However, I make clear that our priority when developing our policies in future will be the safety of our communities. We make no excuse for that.</p><p>All too often we hear from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice about the bad and sad in our prisons&#8212;those who do not belong there and should make their way to a new career, perhaps in the construction industry, building the new Commonwealth games village or constructing the new M74 motorway extension. Apart from the fact that that is an obvious slur on hard-working men and women in our construction industry, it is becoming apparent to me that the cabinet secretary is intent on developing policy outside the chamber. If he is genuine about his proposal, which we strongly oppose, Mr MacAskill should bring it before the chamber so that we can have a genuine debate.</p><p>As other members have said, we need to know from the minister what he means by the bad and sad. Gavin Brown and others sought that information from SNP members. The cabinet secretary should give us examples and indicate which individuals would be eligible for his bad and sad alternatives to custody scheme. Is he&#8212;as Bill <place-holder colnum=\"10803\"/> Aitken suggested&#8212;referring to shoplifters, who pose a genuine threat to many communities throughout Scotland and to our economy?</p><p>What message does it send to victims of domestic violence if the perpetrators, who would have served a sentence of six months or less, are told that, thanks to the bad and sad alternatives to custody scheme that has been provided compliments of the new Government, they will no longer do so?</p><p>A number of members have sought specifics, so I will provide the chamber with a specific example that is on the public record. Recently, the boxer Scott Harrison was handed a two-month sentence for assaulting his girlfriend and a two-month sentence for assaulting a police officer. I am happy to give way to the Minister for Community Safety if he wishes to contradict me. Members of the Parliament have fought hard to make it clear that domestic violence and assaults on public workers are unacceptable; in fact, we have legislated to prevent such activity.</p><p>What message would we send to our communities and to the victims of crime if we labelled the perpetrators of domestic violence and those who commit crimes against public workers as bad and sad? Such offenders are not bad and sad, but individuals against whom our communities should be protected; offenders should not be protected by the Government. It is sad for the victims of crime that the Government is so obsessed with emptying the prisons of Scotland. Labour members will not allow the Government to pursue that policy.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice again seeks to condition the Parliament into believing that sheriffs imprison every individual who walks through the doors of their courts. John Lamont made a powerful point on that. Many of those individuals arrive at Barlinnie prison as a last resort.</p><p>I will give another specific example. What about 18-year-old George Maxwell? He was already on bail for carrying an offensive weapon and attacked two police officers with a samurai sword while under the influence of drink and drugs, but was freed with a probation order and 260 hours' community service after the sheriff heard that he had gone teetotal. That individual and many like him would have a number of opportunities and end up in Barlinnie prison as a result of their unacceptable actions. Surely, when the Parliament is considering how to deal with knife crime, sentences such as the one that was served on George Maxwell send out completely the wrong message.

However, I am happy that the cabinet secretary has now clarified that he will not deliver 1,000 additional police officers, which is unlike what we heard from the First Minister again today.</p><p>The committee report also rightly refers to the concerns about the tensions between the SPSA and the police forces. We cannot ignore that. I am afraid that I am not reassured by the cabinet secretary's comments on that; they mean that he is not willing to show leadership to ensure that we deal with that issue. I appreciate what a complex issue it is, but we call on the cabinet secretary to show leadership by defining the SPSA's role and the relationship that it should have with other agencies throughout Scotland. The creation of the SPSA was supported by a wide spectrum of interest. Labour supported it, and we continue to do so. However, the cabinet secretary must show leadership to ensure that we take the issue forward. It is time for him to do that in the most effective manner possible.</p><p>The committee also called for a clearer definition of the role of community policing. We need to develop further how our community police officers and their senior officers interact with the <place-holder colnum=\"7563\"/> communities that they serve. I have been struck by the difficulty for communities in identifying their community police officers. I interrogated Strathclyde Police's website today to try to find out who my community police officer is, but it did not provide that basic information. If our officers are to be accountable to their communities, we should provide on websites, for example, basic information on who those officers are and contact details such as e-mail addresses. In the modern era of information technology, it is unacceptable not to provide such basic information.</p><p>The committee firmly supported the crucial role that community wardens play by assisting our police officers throughout Scotland. I note with interest that the Minister for Community Safety, Fergus Ewing, will ensure that the committee's views on that issue are taken into consideration. I make it clear that Labour members are proud of what our communities have done over the years in partnership with our community wardens, which the previous Liberal and Labour coalition delivered, to stand up to antisocial behaviour. Any attempt to dilute the stance that the previous Government took will not be accepted by Labour members.</p><p>As the committee moves on to its next inquiry phase, it is important that we continue to be willing to progress the issues with an open mind, that we give our communities maximum protection and that we make the most effective use of our police officers throughout Scotland.

We have also heard about the public petitions process. Michael McMahon spoke effectively about the case of Mr and Mrs Curran, who made their concerns known through the public petitions process, after the death of their daughter, Gillian. It is important to put on record our appreciation of them for making their case so constructively, and of the Public Petitions Committee for ensuring that their concerns were amplified through the parliamentary process.

He should also acknowledge that families find themselves part of the process through no fault of their own, that they have no specific knowledge and that the evidence they receive can be distressing. It is important to consider how to deal with families.

We must recognise that a great deal of resource and time is invested in fatal accident inquiries. The crucial part of the process is in ensuring that lessons have been learned. That is the point that Nigel Don rightly raised. The monitoring of recommendations should play a crucial role in the process and it surprises many of us that more consideration is not given to ensuring that we monitor the recommendations and that they are delivered on.</p><p>The purpose of the fatal accident inquiry process is to learn lessons. If we do not monitor the recommendations that come out of an FAI, we do not complete the process. If we want genuinely to monitor recommendations, we cannot escape the fact that resources will be required. We and Lord Cullen will have to consider that issue. As Nigel Don said, resources will be required to ensure that we implement and monitor effectively, whatever recommendations Lord Cullen makes at the end of his review.</p><p>We welcome the commitment to have the review consider legal representation for families. Michael Matheson spoke effectively on that point. Fatal accident inquiries are complex, and we sometimes underestimate the challenges that families face during the process. Labour members believe that legal representation is a key issue. The current provisions may have been right in 1976, but in 2008 very different arrangements are required. Lord Cullen's findings on legal representation will be crucial.</p><p>We are encouraged by today's debate, which has been constructive.

Perhaps Mr Ewing, when he sums up, can clarify the fact that <place-holder colnum=\"7397\"/> he made such remarks about the process on many occasions.</p><p>I have read with interest the unprecedented number of briefings in recent weeks regarding the prison overcrowding challenges that face the Government. John Wilson, Mike Pringle and other members are concerned about overcrowding, and they quite rightly made a case in that respect. I also heard some quotes from the governor of Barlinnie prison on the overcrowding challenges that he faces. I respect Bill McKinlay, who represents the prison that is located in my constituency, and I recognise the challenges in his role of managing Barlinnie prison. However, no one in the chamber should allow Mr McKinlay to believe that adding 50 prisoners to the HDC scheme will give him any respite from overcrowding. That is the serious point that needs to be made in the debate. The order will make no difference to the overcrowding challenges that we face.</p><p>If the order is passed today, perhaps the cabinet secretary will ensure that members will be kept informed, through the convener of the Justice Committee, of the success of the order, and of whether it has any positive impact in dealing with overcrowding. The overcrowding argument has been the pivotal one that the cabinet secretary has made in respect of the order. He must, on a regular basis, be able to prove that the legislation is making a difference.</p><p>In the interests of good, open and accountable government, and assuming that the Government presses ahead with its plans today, I ask the minister to clarify in his summing-up speech when the extension of the HDC scheme will actually be operational&#8212;not when the legislation will be passed. That is the most important point in the debate. It is about not what we do in respect of overcrowding, but what difference the home detention scheme will make.</p><p>As I said, the Government has once again failed to convince the Parliament. It might win the vote today, but it will not have won the argument. I call on the Parliament to support the motion in the name of Bill Aitken.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 27 March 2008: Home Detention Curfew Licence (Prescribed Standard Conditions) (Scotland) (No 2) Order 2008 (SSI 2008/125)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Once again&#8212;for the third time&#8212;the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has failed to convince members of the merits of extending the home detention curfew scheme from four and a half months to six months.

That modernisation presents many challenges, as the Lord Advocate knows, but she has taken them on.

Our advocates on the front line must be able to deal with the additional responsibilities that are placed on them. That theme was clear from the Justice Committee's recent visit to the Crown Office. For any changes in the justice system, we must both ensure that additional resources are provided and consider reconfiguring resources that are in place.</p><p>Members will note that, in the amendment in Pauline McNeill's name, we have called for more time in the timetable. On reflection, and as other members have said, we have in the past not had the full opportunity to interrogate proposed justice legislation. The Law Commission took more than three years to produce its report and its comprehensive set of recommendations, as I said. It is important to do that work justice by interrogating the proposed legislation effectively. The Parliament will have a job in ensuring that that happens, because extending the timetable has always been difficult, despite members' determination.</p><p>I reiterate Pauline McNeill's comments about changing the law in relation to children. We need to be clear that changing the law concerns not just how the legislation is implemented, but the message that such legislation sends to society. I ask the justice team to consider that carefully in producing the bill and to give us every opportunity to interrogate that aspect. We say that in a co-operative and constructive manner to ensure that whatever is passed provides absolute clarity.</p><p>Pauline McNeill also talked about clarity being provided to juries. I am not sure whether such clarity will be achieved in full, because of the need for expertise, or whether juries will at all stages be completely aware of the legislation. Let us face it&#8212;the report contains 62 recommendations. What can we expect of our juries? We need to be clear about that. However, we should ensure that common knowledge can be made available to juries. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will elaborate on that issue, which can be discussed later.</p><p>Margaret Smith made a thoughtful and effective speech&#8212;I say to her that Labour members give out positive vibes. She drew a good, thoughtful analogy with society's attitudes towards the stabbing of a young man in the street, which amplified the concerns about society's attitudes towards rape victims. Bill Aitken also drew an effective analogy. However, it is not good enough for us to draw such analogies in the Parliament. It would be better in the long run for us to ensure <place-holder colnum=\"6696\"/> that we do something about the situation. That is the challenge that the Justice Committee will face.</p><p>The Law Commission's recommendations and the draft bill that it has produced mean that the Justice Committee has a great deal of work ahead of it. It will have a job to do in interrogating the draft bill, and Labour members will take that process very seriously.

Many of us welcomed the input from and commitment of the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, who was involved in the sub-committee; our Labour member, Jackie Baillie; and others, including the Presiding Officer, Alex Fergusson.</p><p>We are disappointed that some 14 months later, 17 of the 33 recommendations are outstanding. I ask the cabinet secretary to take this as a constructive point: the Government needs to be clear about which issues are outstanding, what resources will be provided and when we can expect to hear about further progress.</p><p>There is consensus on many of the issues that surround the management of registered sex offenders. We have had many debates in the chamber on the matter. However, the Government needs to be reminded that the recommendations of the Justice 2 Sub-Committee are our priority. They are of paramount importance to the safety of our communities and our children throughout Scotland.</p><p>All too often, we react to tragic events and we console and empathise with families who have suffered the loss of loved ones. We on the Labour benches call on the Parliament to ensure that we have at least taken the issue forward and created opportunities to minimise the risk that many of our communities face. I have made the point in the chamber several times that when we refer to registered sex offenders, we refer to a minority of people in our communities. In our communities, adults and children interact in a positive and constructive manner. It is important to recognise that the motion refers to a minority.</p><p>A key aspect of the Justice 2 Sub-Committee's recommendations is the need to place greater responsibility on the authorities that manage registered sex offenders, be they housing authorities, prison authorities, social services authorities or local government authorities. They all have a responsibility to deliver on the <place-holder colnum=\"6416\"/> management of registered sex offenders.</p><p>The Parliament's role is to show leadership and direction by legislating to improve the current arrangements and by providing policy direction. However, we need to ensure that the authorities play their part. We on the Labour benches&#8212;and I think we should all be united&#8212;want to inject some sheer doggedness and ensure that the authorities deliver on the recommendations and the other policy objectives on the issue.</p><p>Our motion also mentions the importance of retaining DNA samples in both the detection and prevention of crimes of a sexual nature. The cabinet secretary has often acknowledged that, in developing policy, it is important to listen to our police authorities throughout Scotland. I say to him that the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and almost every police authority support the retention of DNA samples and the position in England and Wales.

I am sorry <place-holder colnum=\"5244\"/> to say that such attacks are clearly evident in my constituency, as in many other constituencies throughout Scotland. They have been evident for a number of years. In fact, members might recall that in September 2002 I lodged an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill to provide the same sentencing tariff for an attack on a firefighter as for an attack on a police officer. Over the years&#8212;we heard about this particularly during the passage of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill&#8212;it has been evident that air-guns are used as a method of terrorising communities and emergency workers, which is unacceptable.

We think that they make good sense. Bill Aitken amplified a number of the greater public's concerns about ensuring that fines on individuals are effectively enforced. Margaret Smith's amendment speaks volumes, and it will help to ensure that the profession is with us and is part of the reforms. The cabinet secretary will be encouraged by the fact that we will also support his motion, which Labour members are greatly encouraged by. Of course, the motion is on the implementation of a piece of work that was carried out by the Labour ministers Cathy Jamieson and Hugh Henry. We want that legacy to be taken forward, and we thank the cabinet secretary for the kind words in his speech that acknowledged the work of the previous Executive and for his assurance that it will be implemented.</p><p>Labour members want to ensure that the new legislation is enforced effectively and is resourced. We can see from the financial memorandum to the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill that the Government will face a number of challenges in the upcoming spending review period to ensure that some of the financial commitments relating to courts are met. We will be holding the cabinet secretary to account in that respect.</p><p>The public perception&#8212;sometimes unfair&#8212;is that justice is not being done, that it is not being done within the timescales that are required to secure public support and that it is not being effectively enforced. I am not in a position to give any personal experiences of having being cited as a witness, but many of us have heard from constituents who have endured very difficult experiences. The minister referred anecdotally to his own experience.</p><p>During the passage of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill, we heard about the experiences of many communities and their frustration with the justice system. Their perception was that the justice system works in favour of the accused&#8212;the perpetrators&#8212;rather than the victims. The 2007 act addresses that. It <place-holder colnum=\"4259\"/> will help us to strike the right balance and consider the victim's point of view.</p><p>A number of specific matters were raised during the passage of the 2007 act, and the cabinet secretary mentioned some of those today. A key element of ensuring that the legislation works is the early preparation of cases. It is fair to say that there should be early preparation anyway and to ask why it was necessary to bring forward a new initiative. Perhaps we should have considered more effective early preparation of cases, which perhaps should have been happening before the bill was passed. However, we want to look forward rather than back. Labour members are confident that the Lord Advocate and her team will ensure that the time framework is delivered.</p><p>Resources will be required, and I ask the Minister for Community Safety to clarify how the challenges will be resourced. For example, we have heard many times about the cost of preparing social inquiry reports and the difficulties associated with that. We have heard from the Scottish Police Federation about the challenges, including information technology challenges, that it faces in preparing for cases. We have to ensure that the resources are in place. That is a challenge for the Government.</p><p>We have heard anecdotal evidence of the need to ensure that hearings are more effective. I am sure that we all hope that the change in the period between hearings from four weeks to two weeks will improve the system. We want the timescales to be fine tuned. The minister must make a commitment to provide the funds that are required to do that. We also want to ensure that the timeframe is enforced locally. Stuart McMillan was right to say that we need to take steps to ensure that we enforce the timescales. However, I do not agree with his specific point, because individuals could take advantage of statutory timescales. I do not want such difficulties in our justice system, so I do not think that that is the way forward.</p><p>It is crucial that our JPs and sheriffs work with the system and us to implement the reforms; otherwise, they will not work. The previous Government signed up to provide significant resources to ensure that training was provided to assist with the process. I ask the minister to provide the necessary resources to train both new and existing sheriffs and JPs so that they are aware of the reforms. We must be clear that, unless those at a senior level in public services sign up to the reforms that the Parliament legislates for, they will not work.</p><p>I disagree with Christina McKelvie's comments on work orders. We believe that there is a time and a place for work orders. In fact, in the financial memorandum to Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill, we set out the costs of <place-holder colnum=\"4260\"/> the work orders, which we saw as a way forward. I seek assurances from the minister that the pilots that were set out in that financial memorandum are in place and that, if they are successful&#8212;as the evidence that was brought forward showed they would be&#8212;they will be effectively resourced in the future.</p><p>The cabinet secretary is well aware of the challenges that face him in ensuring that the legislation is effectively enforced.

The majority of consumers out there would probably welcome such a model and the opportunities that would arise from a much clearer pricing policy and a more tailored service.</p><p>There is a need for caution, however. The merging of services in such a business model could allow the integrity and independence of solicitors to be questioned. How solicitors would interact with other professions would need to be made clear. Unlike some members I am not legally qualified, but as a lay person, I am well aware of the high value that is attached to the independence of solicitors when they go about their daily business. That is why that proposed business model should be interrogated carefully.</p><p>Moreover, a number of press and media reports&#8212;I do not know whether there is other detailed intelligence&#8212;have told how members of the criminal underworld take the opportunities offered by that business model to infiltrate legal practices. Such concerns were raised about the situation in England and Wales. I welcome the clear commitment from the minister to deliver a Scottish model that is based on the Scottish legal system. He rightly sets us apart from other parts of the United Kingdom because of the demographics of our communities. That point should be given serious consideration. Let us not be distracted by the model that has been delivered in England and Wales, although there might be opportunities to learn from experience there.</p><p>We need to balance our approach to the proposed model with listening to some of the concerns that have been raised by legal professionals. A concern that has been raised with me is that people who are not qualified in the legal arena are providing legal advice. Under any new business model, we must be clear that anybody who provides legal advice must have a legal qualification. I seek assurances from the Government that it will deal with that genuine concern from legal professionals about unqualified people on the periphery of the legal arena.</p><p>Another concern that was raised in the Which? super-complaint was about competition. Most of us would argue that competition is a good thing for consumers. We all like a bargain&#8212;whether it is Pauline McNeill on her many visits to Buchanan <place-holder colnum=\"3416\"/> Galleries in Glasgow or people who trawl through the price comparison sites on the internet to find a cheap holiday or cheap insurance. I am not sure whether there will ever be a price comparison site for legal services&#8212;perhaps there already is one, or perhaps somebody has thought about developing one. Although I am not legally qualified, I argue that comparing prices on the internet for legal advice is probably more complex than comparing Asda's grocery prices with those of Tesco and others.</p><p>We must ensure that competition works in the consumer's favour and that our communities benefit from it. Although many of the arguments for the proposed business model are probably well meant, that model might not provide genuine competition. A number of sole traders provide a valuable legal service and we must ensure both that they are able to continue to do so under any new arrangements and that competition remains.</p><p>In the cabinet secretary's speech to the Law Society, he said that Tesco already has internet advertisements for a &#163;199 conveyancing service in England and Wales. Perhaps the price appeals to the consumer, but will they get the same quality of service? Another concern is that many public limited companies with aggressive and robust business plans would not want to be involved in some of the more detailed work that sole traders carry out, which could lead to cherry picking. Perhaps some sole practitioners already cherry pick&#8212;I am not sure&#8212;but we must interrogate such arguments carefully.</p><p>In conclusion, the Law Society said in its consultation document that, of course, there will be rigorous debate on the subject in the Law Society. There is always rigorous debate in the Law Society&#8212;what better people to have such debate than legal practitioners? That is a good thing. Although today's debate is perhaps undersubscribed, when we reach the more detailed stages of the debate on the proposed business model for the legal profession and various organisations have made their representations to Parliament, there will be more rigorous debate in the chamber.</p><p>We welcome the fact that the Law Society has said that the status quo is not an option. That is a mature way to approach the debate. It is also a welcome response to the various reviews that have taken place and to the Which? super-complaint. The legal profession has a responsibility to take the issue forward.</p><p>The Presiding Officer is gesturing that I can go on for as long as I like, which is unusual, but I will finally conclude by saying that we need to have a rigorous debate in the Parliament. It is important that whatever model we deliver makes a genuine difference in communities throughout Scotland. <place-holder colnum=\"3417\"/></p><p>For far too long, many of our communities have not enjoyed the access to justice that they should have enjoyed and we must ensure that the legal profession provides a high-quality service in that respect.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-847.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and considers that this approach should also widen choice, provide easier access to legal services and create the conditions for more affordable services so that social justice will be at the heart of future changes.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391953", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Legal Services Market"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome that commitment from the cabinet secretary and agree with that way forward.

I was recently struck by the quality of the car parking facilities in many shopping centres and by the fact that those facilities are provided free. That led me to compare the free car parking spaces in those facilities with the fact that our hospitals charge for car parking. It reflects poorly on society that people who visit relatives and staff who care for patients who are at a vulnerable period in their lives are charged to do so.</p><p>I will deal with several of the arguments that Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board has presented in respect of the implementation of car parking charges at Stobhill. I was born in Stobhill hospital and have lived in the area my entire life, but I have never known a problem with car parking at the hospital. The capacity has always been sufficient and no issues have arisen with commuters abusing the car park to use it as a park-and-ride facility to travel to Glasgow city centre.<place-holder colnum=\"3388\"/></p><p>One reason that the health board has given to justify the proposals is that they would fit with the board's green transport policy. If the board cared so much about its green transport policy, why has it not put in place what is required to deliver it? Not one additional bus service will be delivered by 25 November, not one cycle shed will be in place&#8212;which is a Glasgow City Council requirement&#8212;and there will be no showering facilities for those who wish to cycle to work. The health board has implemented no element of the green transport policy.</p><p>That is another example of how Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board puts its policies first and worries later about the policies that will have to follow. It is unacceptable. I call on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to say in her summing up that she will ensure that the health board puts in place its green transport policy before it implements the car parking charges at Stobhill hospital.</p><p>For many years, Stobhill hospital has enjoyed the support of the community and has had an effective and constructive relationship with it. However, there is already evidence that that relationship will be put at risk if the car parking charges are implemented. There is evidence that building contractors who are involved in the ambulatory care and diagnostic unit project are parking in the surrounding area and that those who wish to evade paying the charges will do likewise. Despite the fact that I, and other elected members, have made representations to senior health board staff on that issue, they have not been able to deal with it.</p><p>We are aware of the tensions that car parking can cause, particularly when people park outside their own residential area. That will be a consequence of the implementation of car parking charges at Stobhill. I call on the cabinet secretary to meet me and the local residents who will be affected, so that she can hear about the problem at first hand. I note that she visited the hospital to launch the new ACAD unit, which I welcome. However, she also has to meet the people who are concerned about this issue. I hope that she will make a commitment today to do so.</p><p>The health board has also confirmed that it will make proposals for a private company to enforce the car parking policy. When the parish council built Stobhill hospital in 1899 to ensure that poor people could access health facilities, I am sure that it did not expect that 100 years later we would not only impose car parking charges on those who are already financially disadvantaged but use private companies to enforce those charges. I ask the cabinet secretary to join me in condemning such use of private contractors and to ensure that <place-holder colnum=\"3389\"/> those who are already financially disadvantaged are assisted.</p><p>Far too often in members' business debates there is no clarity in the minister's response. I call on the cabinet secretary to suspend the introduction of charges at Stobhill hospital until the board's green transport plan is put in place. That point has already been made by the hospital's medical staff association. Will she review the very principle of implementing charges at Stobhill hospital? I accept that charges might have to be implemented at some sites but not at others. Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board has made it clear that it will take a blanket approach to implementing charges, which is unacceptable.</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary carry out a review of the impact that charges will have on the surrounding community? The current review of hospital car parking charges is wide ranging, but it does not cover specifically the challenges that Stobhill hospital will face.</p><p>The strength of opposition to the charges is something that I have not seen since the save Stobhill campaign. A number of representations from unions, communities and elected representatives have been made. I ask the cabinet secretary to ensure that their views are considered seriously.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Stobhill Hospital (Parking Charges)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hear an allegation from Cathie Craigie that it might be my mobile phone that was interfering with the sound system, but it was definitely not mine.

Those of us who have been elected members for a number of years will have had a number of disputes brought before us in which conciliation and alternative dispute resolution would have been the way forward. I remember disputes about council house sales from when I was a councillor. Members of the public wanted to settle disputes about land allocation, and that case was made on a number of occasions. I have also dealt with a number of cases that involve property factors. There are opportunities to ensure resolution much earlier in such cases.</p><p>The Labour Party would welcome clarification from the minister on how ADR will be promoted. That is important. Christine Grahame made a point well when she asked what the public understand by the term. How many of us had to do a Google search on it last night for our speeches? We can see from that that the public would experience difficulties throughout the country.<place-holder colnum=\"2960\"/></p><p>It is also recognised that provision of the different forms of mediation throughout the country is patchy. I had an offline discussion about that with Charlie Gordon, who made the point that the cost is sometimes prohibitive. In the Glasgow Housing Association example, it is &#163;180 per day. The Government will have to provide additional funding to ensure that such disputes can be resolved.</p><p>The public would also be surprised to learn that there are opportunities for such arbitration to be legally binding&#8212;public information is required on that. Bill Aitken made a powerful point about the need to ensure that people who use alternative dispute resolution comply with the agreements that are reached at the conclusion of the process. It would be helpful to hear evidence on the percentage of parties who comply with such arrangements and on whether there are repeat offenders in respect of non-compliance.</p><p>James Kelly made a very good point about citizens advice bureaux and law centres throughout Scotland, which fulfil a valuable role in ensuring that our constituents are aware of the options that are available to them. Many CABx and law centres are undervalued, as is shown by the funding that has been made available to them. If we are serious about providing opportunities for alternative dispute resolution, we must ensure that they are given additional funding for that purpose.</p><p>The cabinet secretary said that he will bring forward proposals for a dispute resolution centre. I would welcome clarity about where the centre will be located and when it will be created. Perhaps Fergus Ewing can give us that information when he sums up.</p><p>A number of academic reports have stated that there is confusion about what is meant by ADR&#8212;a number of members made that point today. We would welcome leadership from the Scottish Government in providing clarity on the matter. There have been many debates and academic reports on the issue, but we need clarity and guidance.</p><p>The cabinet secretary would not expect to reach the end of the debate without hearing Labour members making the case for additional funding. Often, members of the public will not enter mediation if they believe that the costs will be prohibitive. I mentioned that in relation to GHA. Complainants will not propose mediation if they believe that they will be financially penalised as a result. We have to be clear that, in respect of the complainant, there are opportunities for costs to be avoided.</p><p>I understand that the matter is complex and that, often, complainants do not want to bring matters to conclusion through mediation. I have dealt with a <place-holder colnum=\"2961\"/> number of constituents who were determined to have their day in court. That was how they wanted to make their case, and mediation was not an option for them. They were clear that going to court would give them an opportunity to amplify their concerns. The matter is complex, but we need a framework that provides opportunities for mediation. Pauline McNeill made the point powerfully that there has to be a way of enforcing the process if we want to ensure that people enter it.</p><p>In conclusion, there has been an unprecedented level of consensual debate this morning, except on Hearts football club. I cannot remember a debate with the Scottish Government in which there has been so much consensus. It means that the cabinet secretary and the minister do not have to come back to Parliament on the matter until they have specific proposals. I hope that, from today's debate, they understand what we want. We look forward to hearing their proposals. The debate is not the most exciting debate that we will have, but it is important to people who are involved in disputes.

I will talk about underage consumption.</p><p>On the proposal to ban certain drinks promotions, Labour members condemn retailers who seek to benefit from drinks promotions that encourage irresponsible alcohol consumption. However, we must be careful about how we deliver a ban. We considered the issue carefully during the passage of the Licensing (Scotland) Bill. Some people take advantage of drinks promotions responsibly&#8212;I hope that that includes most members&#8212;and should be entitled to have the opportunity to do so. We must consider whether evidence backs up the cabinet secretary's proposals. We must place on retailers a social responsibility to ensure that they do not encourage irresponsible consumption. Perhaps the simplest argument that we could put to retailers is that it is not in their interests to shorten consumers' lives by providing opportunities for alcohol abuse. The more we work with the industry to get that message across to retailers, the more successful we will be in implementing our strategy.</p><p>We must accept that alcohol abuse takes place in our streets and fuels antisocial activity throughout Scotland. I am sure that all members have heard from organisations in their constituencies who have expressed concern about the consumption of alcohol in public areas, particularly by young people. Such behaviour sets the wrong example for the next generation of young people. I am proud of the measures that were delivered by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 to ensure that legal remedies, such as dispersal orders, are in place to tackle unacceptable behaviour in streets throughout Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"2753\"/></p><p>The zero-tolerance approach to such behaviour is welcome, which is why we have difficulty in accepting the Liberals' amendment. We support rehabilitation, but we must send a clear message of zero tolerance of irresponsible behaviour on our streets. On many occasions, rehabilitation has been offered and a number of other avenues exhausted before dispersal orders were considered.</p><p>There is no doubt that underage drinking presents a serious challenge to many communities throughout Scotland. The Labour amendment urges the cabinet secretary to call a summit of political leaders and relevant stakeholders in Scotland, to provide a framework and to develop not a strategy but an effective action plan to deal with this serious issue. At least 52 per cent of young girls in Scotland get drunk twice a month, which is unacceptable.

John Lamont said that Annabel Goldie raised the issue of drugs misuse even when it was not fashionable to do so. I argue that all members in the chamber have raised the issue and that it has always been the fashion to do so, because drugs misuse affects many parts of Scotland. It is important that we learn. We are not pioneers of the cross-party approach. I am old enough&#8212;I suppose that most of us are&#8212;to remember the Scotland against drugs campaign, <place-holder colnum=\"1478\"/> which is the one thing for which I give Michael Forsyth credit. The campaign highlighted the need for parties to work together and the need for us to acknowledge the challenges that our constituents face.</p><p>It is important that we move away from the language that members have used today and in previous debates&#8212;the word \"holistic\", the \"joined-up approach\" and many other such references that have been made&#8212;and talk about the specifics. Duncan McNeil and other members raised specific points, and it is important that we take them on board. He also raised the issue of the importance of having a more robust regime in the methadone dispensing programme. I know that in my constituency there is a role for pharmacies to play in supporting addicts who are involved in the methadone programme and ensuring that they and their children receive services during that process.</p><p>Trish Godman made a constructive and informed speech on the importance of kinship. Every member in the chamber values the role of grandparents and other carers in respect of tackling drugs misuse. In that area, members of the Parliament can move away from using language such as \"holistic\" and \"joined up\" and say, \"Yes, we will take on board the importance of the role of kinship, and we will move forward to ensure that grandparents and other carers feel valued.\" To be honest, I am afraid that grandparents and other carers do not feel valued at the moment. When they do, we will be setting a clear agenda on which we can move forward.</p><p>As in previous debates on drugs misuse&#8212;I checked the <em>Official Report</em>&#8212;members mentioned that there were 421 drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2006. We talk about the challenges that arise in relation to drugs, but we should also consider how we can learn from that statistic. We are talking about human beings and human tragedies, and many families are affected by drugs misuse. Is it time to consider establishing a drugs commission? I would like to hear the Executive's view on that. Will the Cabinet Secretary for Justice take the matter forward and consider holding a more detailed inquiry into how those deaths occurred? Are there lessons to be learned from the specific detail of the deaths of those individuals? We are referring to human beings; they are not just statistics. Perhaps we should take a more detailed approach to ensure that we learn from the statistics. The Parliament launched an inquiry in respect of the McKie case. I argue that a public inquiry might be required into the 421 drug-related deaths in Scotland. Such an inquiry should at least be considered, because it would help us to understand the statistics and ensure that, when we invest in challenging the misuse of drugs, we get best value.<place-holder colnum=\"1479\"/></p><p>I turn to the question of how we tackle antisocial behaviour and the importance of ensuring that the right environment does not exist for the drug dealers who are the scourge of our communities. Let us face it&#8212;constituencies such as mine and Margaret Curran's are havens for drug dealers. Through the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, we successfully provided unprecedented levels of investment to tackle drug dealers. I speak from my personal experience in dealing with Glasgow's neighbourhood relations team. For the first time in my career as an elected representative, which will have lasted 14 years in December, I had a call and an e-mail from the neighbourhood relations team in respect of a drug dealer who was carrying out activities in my constituency. The team asked for a letter of support in respect of a court action. That happened because the team is working with the various authorities throughout Glasgow to tackle the drug dealers in our constituencies. The action is a result of the previous Executive's unprecedented investment in tackling antisocial behaviour. I call on the Government to continue that high level of investment, including the investment in closed-circuit television, which plays a crucial role in tackling drug dealers.</p><p>I am sure that we all wish Graeme Pearson every future success as he retires from the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency. He has played a crucial role in providing leadership to those who tackle the most dangerous individuals in our communities&#8212;individuals who supply drugs. I welcome his innovative approach. I hope that the new Government will ensure that every support is given to the SCDEA so that it can continue its good work. Nothing hits drug dealers more than the recovery of assets from them and their families. Constituents often raise concerns with members about the fact that drug dealers' families benefit from their activities.</p><p>We on the Labour benches will continue with the spirit of consensus. I am sure that other members will do so, too. However, it is important that we hold each other to account and have a robust and constructive dialogue, that we drill down into the 421 deaths, and that we do our best for communities throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386762", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Misuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to maintain the spirit of consensus, after one slight interruption.

We will leave no stone unturned to make sure that that policy is delivered. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Justice 2 Sub-Committee, which was convened by Jackie Baillie. The minister and other members who are in the chamber today played a crucial role in making 33 comprehensive recommendations on managing sex offenders.

It is more important for the current Government to ensure that those recommendations are advanced. We will hold it to account on that. As we have said consistently&#8212;I made this point to Cathy Jamieson, so it is not an issue of political affiliation&#8212;we must also ensure that the recommendations are resourced.

We look forward to finding out about proposals on how we can work together in the UK.</p><p>I turn to some of the Tories' proposals and their recent announcements on three issues in particular&#8212;the first of which is satellite tracking of registered sex offenders. We welcome that measure, which was announced by David Blunkett in 2004. Three pilots took place in 2004 and we hope that during the discussions that take place efforts will be made to ensure that pilots are rolled out in other parts of the UK. Of course we welcome the use of satellite tracking systems, although it is important that we ensure that they will be effective.</p><p>As regards what has been described in the media as the naming-and-shaming websites, we welcome the introduction of a system to ensure that communities are made aware of the identity of the people whom I have described as the most dangerous individuals on the planet. However, such a system is already in place: Crimestoppers already provides an opportunity for us to expose such individuals. A representative of Crimestoppers to whom I spoke this morning informed me that that organisation would be happy to develop the existing portal and that such a system could be introduced in Scotland very quickly. I understand that discussions took place with the previous Scottish Executive and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to ensure that that is possible. A system that will ensure that we can expose the relevant individuals when they are at their most dangerous is already being delivered.</p><p>Lie detectors are another measure that David Blunkett introduced in 2004. He made it clear that although they would serve a purpose in acting as a deterrent, they could not&#8212;understandably&#8212;be used during court proceedings. On that basis, Labour members welcome the Tories' proposal.</p><p>Another important piece of work by the Justice 2 Sub-Committee was consideration of how best to manage a housing strategy for registered sex offenders. People were concerned that there was no coherent strategy. I know from discussions with the previous Minister for Justice that it was intended that an action plan would deliver a strategy to ensure that we managed sex offenders <place-holder colnum=\"558\"/> rather than their managing us, which was the previous protocol.</p><p>Retention of DNA samples was discussed earlier. I appreciate that there is no consensus among members on that issue, but the Labour Party is determined to give our communities added protection&#8212;we are motivated by that determination.</p><p>We talk often about how best we can minimise the risk from sex offenders. In line with our manifesto commitment, we said that we would revisit the issue of DNA retention. I raised the issue, in fact, during the course of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill last year. DNA retention can undoubtedly be a useful tool in detecting sex offenders and in preventing sex offences.</p><p>We are willing to develop the use of satellite tracking, lie detectors and naming-and-shaming websites for sex offenders, so I do not believe that DNA retention, which has been carefully tested, is a civil liberties issue. The law lords considered the issue in detail and made it clear that DNA retention does not contravene human rights. We therefore welcome the cabinet secretary's statement that he will revisit the issue of DNA retention.</p><p>When I consider civil liberties&#8212;I make no apologies for saying this&#8212;I also consider the civil liberties of Mark Cummings and Angelika Kluk. We should bear that in mind when we consider whom we represent.

Margaret Curran and other former ministers worked hard in co-operation with the various parties that are represented in the chamber.</p><p>We also deleted the database of excuses that existed prior to the passing of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004. Before that act came into force, the authorities would say, \"We can't do anything about it because we don't have the legal remedy to deal with these issues.\" We ensured that the toolkit to deal with antisocial behaviour in our communities was available to the authorities. As a result of that legislation, communities are much stronger and are willing to stand up to the tiny minority of people who indulge in antisocial behaviour.</p><p>We will enter into the spirit of co-operation that has been mentioned today&#8212;while stressing the fact that it has existed for the past eight years&#8212;but we will not join the hug-a-hoody alliance that has been created in the chamber today. We will not make communities safer by making excuses for the tiny minority who cause havoc in those communities. In July last year, David Cameron said that hoodies are trying to \"blend in\" rather than appear threatening. I do not know whether hoodies exist in the community that he lives in, but I can assure him that they exist in the community that I live in and represent. They exist in the Aitken Street area of my constituency and a constituent of mine who lives there advised me that four young men with hooded tops were trying to blend into the local community while they were vandalising her car. We will not join the hug-a-hoody alliance; we will stand up to the unacceptable behaviour of the tiny minority.</p><p>It is important to stress, as we have done on a number of occasions in this chamber, that the people I am talking about are a tiny minority. The vast majority of young people play a constructive role in their local community. We are parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts and we all know that to be the case. We will not take any lectures from anyone in that regard.</p><p>Margaret Curran mentioned the escape route that the SNP's manifesto talks about&#8212;the six-month sentence policy that, as Kenny MacAskill advised us, will involve sheriffs being able to serve a six-month sentence only in exceptional circumstances. I will elaborate on Margaret Curran's words on that subject and clarify, by reference to the Scottish Executive's statistical bulletin for 2005-06, what kinds of individual we are talking about. We are talking about 600 <place-holder colnum=\"436\"/> housebreakers, 1,600 people who have been convicted of common assault and 60 people who have been convicted of serious assault and robbery, among others, getting off scot free. I ask the minister to clarify, when he sums up, whether those are the individuals who will serve their sentence in the community and to confirm that he will not allow sheriffs to have an opportunity to ensure that such people are given&#8212;as a deterrent to others&#8212;a custodial sentence. I remind the minister that when Parliament passed the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, it took the decision to enable sheriffs to give people six-month custodial sentences for offences relating to that piece of legislation.</p><p>Every year in this chamber, there is a Dutch auction in relation to police numbers. Mike Pringle did his party a disservice when he said that he did not know how the figure of 1,000 new police officers was arrived at. Perhaps the minister can advise us how the SNP arrived at the figure of 1,500 police officers. I ask the minister to clarify whether he will give ministerial direction to police boards in relation to frontline police officers. What will he do if chief constables say, \"I'm afraid that we are not going to deliver those community police officers in your local communities\"?</p><p>I and other elected members have made the case for additional resources on a number of occasions, but we have been advised that it is not for ministers to direct local police boards. The minister, Fergus Ewing, is pretty good at asking people to say yes or no. I ask him, when he closes the debate, to say whether he will give ministerial direction to ensure that community police officers are directed to communities such as the one that I represent. He can then go back to the police boards and tell them.</p><p>We on the Labour benches are proud of the Labour-led Executive's record. We look forward to holding the Executive to account.

That is not something that members will have heard me debate as often as maybe I should have in the chamber. I have been enthusiastic about debating the enforcements that should be available, but I have been less enthusiastic about looking at how to deal with the perpetrators. However, that is the next phase of the process.

On 11 January, the <em>Evening Times</em> quoted a number of the residents of the area. Marisa Fairweather, of Alexandra Parade, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need the zone to be extended. The high police presence has had such a positive impact upon residents' quality of life. I'm no longer frightened to go to the shop at night. When I was growing up around here in the 1960s and 1970s there were police on the streets.\"</p><p>Sally Barnett, a clerical assistant at Alexandra Parade primary school, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The community does seem like a safer place since the start of the dispersal zone. I've noticed that the bus shelter outside the school has not been smashed up for a while and neither has the one outside Ladbrokes. They used to be attacked quite regularly.\"</p><p>There are a number of such quotes from local people who support the remedy that has been made available.</p><p>I put on record my appreciation of the work of Strathclyde police's E division, Chief Superintendent Scott, Superintendent Marsh and <place-holder colnum=\"31186\"/> Sergeant Dougie Stevenson, as well as the work of the front-line police officers who have been involved in the enforcement of the dispersal order.</p><p>Many members will have heard me criticise the Strathclyde police force when it has not lived up to the standards that have been expected of it. I believe that I was right to do so. However, it is important to commend it when it has ensured, in a constructive and creative way, that the legal remedies that are available to it are being enforced.</p><p>The purpose of securing the debate is not only to raise awareness of the success of the dispersal order, but&#8212;given that the dispersal order expired on 13 January&#8212;to look towards the future.</p><p>We have to consider the possibility of extending the dispersal order in some form. The local community representatives have raised concerns that the dispersal order has expired and that the local community will again become the environment that it was before. There used to be large groups of all ages&#8212;this is not just about young people&#8212;blocking pavements, preventing local residents from going about their lawful business, urinating on the pavements, gang fighting and causing traders and local people difficulties. In order to ensure that we do not go back to those dark days in Dennistoun, I am asking the minister to consider supporting us in our attempt to have the dispersal order extended in some form, even if that is not the form in which it has existed in the past three months. Doing so would promote the principle that we regard it as unacceptable for large groups to congregate and continue to cause problems of antisocial behaviour in our local communities.</p><p>My proposal is, of course, resource intensive. However, I ask the minister to consider the suggestion that front loading this investment in local services will have a positive impact in the long run. If we prevent the kind of antisocial behaviour that we have not seen for three months, including graffiti and a number of other types of vandalism, we might make a cost saving in the long run. I ask the Executive to consider what work can be carried out to analyse the experience in Dennistoun in order to clarify whether there have been beneficial cost savings in the long run, which, anecdotally, seems to be the case.</p><p>If there is one failure in relation to the dispersal order, it would be the fact that we have not been creative enough in communicating with young people. Activities are available to young people in the Dennistoun area and many other parts of my constituency but, given that we live in an age of the internet, iPods and mobile phones, we are not creative enough in getting across the message about those activities.<place-holder colnum=\"31187\"/></p><p>We have to get that right. We communicate with young people in the same way that we did 30 years ago. We need to be more creative and provide more effective information to young people. We should use our schools more effectively to provide the information. I have made the point on a number of occasions that schools should play a more integral role in providing information.</p><p>Today, I call on the minister to consider introducing a youth charter that gives young people throughout Scotland a right to information via a website. At present, information is provided on an ad hoc basis. Voluntary groups do an excellent job in providing information, but they do not have the resources to continue doing that. I want information to be provided in a more sophisticated and creative manner that ensures that positive activities are made available to young people and ensures that there is no excuse for them or their parents. There are far too many excuses out there. We need to deal with those excuses and ensure that the information is provided.</p><p>As I have said in the chamber a number of times&#8212;I make no apology for repeating the point&#8212;we should pay tribute to the voluntary organisations, including churches, that play a crucial role in providing services for young people in our local communities. I do not think that we give them half the support that they should get for doing that. They played a crucial role in the dispersal order in Dennistoun by ensuring that young people who were interested were involved in more constructive activities. It is important that the voluntary organisations are commended for that.</p><p>We should also recognise the crucial role that local housing organisations have played in the dispersal order and ensure that they are continually supported so that they can continue to bring forward creative solutions. For example, they made proposals to subsidise the cost of overtime for police officers who continue to be involved in the dispersal order. I commend Milnbank Housing Association and Councillor Elaine McDougall for being involved in that.</p><p>In the words of the local community, Dennistoun is once again a decent place to live. People can live there without fear. They can walk the streets and go about their law-abiding business. The businesses in Alexandra Parade say that they now operate in a much more positive environment. They want to continue to do that.</p><p>Earlier today, during the stage 1 debate on the Prostitution (Public Places) (Scotland) Bill, we talked about accepting humility. I ask every member in the chamber to accept that, when dispersal orders are introduced in the right way <place-holder colnum=\"31188\"/> and with the proper preparation, they can work.

She has made her case in an effective and constructive manner. I have experienced her charm offensive on a number of occasions, although she keeps calling me \"Michael\".

Many of us here today are parents and we have shared the anguish of the parents of women who are involved in prostitution and of women who have been murdered in various parts of the United Kingdom, including the women who were murdered in Glasgow, to whom Bill Aitken referred. As a parent, I wonder what other parents want us to do as their elected representatives. Do they want us to promote management zones that would result in their daughters continuing to be involved in such activities, or would they support our examining ways of ensuring that their daughters' lifestyles are diverted and that they became involved in more constructive activities?</p><p>I am a parent of two daughters and I support Routes Out's approach. Parents should not find themselves in anguish; many parents are not even aware that their children are involved in such activities, which is why I believe in the Routes Out approach. I agree with a point that was constructively made by Tommy Sheridan: there is a need to consider more effective means of ensuring that resources are available for organisations such as Routes Out. It has made interventions for many women, but has done so at later stages, so we must consider how we can intervene much earlier.</p><p>However, that is not the purpose of the bill, and it would be wrong to go off in that direction.

Phil Flanders should consider that factor because, if there was no <place-holder colnum=\"28412\"/> Scottish Parliament, he would not have been able to lodge his public petition in the first place. He would have got as far as the lobby at Westminster. One of the positive aspects of the inquiry is the fact that it was initiated by the Parliament's public petitions process.</p><p>The committee received a lot of helpful and good-quality evidence from all the industries that are involved. The haulage contractors were willing to come forward with their ideas about the challenges that the freight industry faces and they suggested a number of initiatives and ways in which progress could be made. I was most impressed by their commitment to the movement of freight to the rail network. However, I am not convinced that the rail industry and the haulage industry are working in collaboration as effectively as they should be. The rail industry needs to be more open about the opportunities that are available given the capacity of the network, and I call on the Minister for Transport to consider how we can ensure that more open information is available to the haulage industry. Such information will allow the industry to take forward the projects that it suggested during the inquiry.</p><p>A number of points were well made during the inquiry, but some of them were contradicted by the evidence that was provided by our adviser, Professor McKinnon. For example, the points that we heard about driver shortages were contradicted by Professor McKinnon's evidence. We need further research on the matter. There are good training organisations&#8212;I know that Christine May has a particular interest in training&#8212;including Ritchies HGV Training Centre, which is located in my constituency. It provides good opportunities for drivers to enter the market in the first place, and we should ensure that we continue to encourage the initiative and innovation that such companies have shown.</p><p>A number of members have strong views on increasing the speed limit on single-lane carriageways. Fergus Ewing has made well-informed comments on the issue on a number of occasions. However, I am not convinced that we have the evidence to make such a change. We need more independent research into the proposal and its implications for safety and logistics. We should consider the proposal, but we should be cautious. I note, however, that a number of witnesses made powerful points on the matter and that it should not be dismissed.</p><p>We discussed the provision of roadside facilities for haulage contractors. The trade unions representing the contractors made the point on many occasions about the need for us to plan more effectively for good-quality and low-cost roadside facilities for haulage contractors. That is not an issue reserved to Westminster, but one on <place-holder colnum=\"28413\"/> which we can influence local authorities and road networks to ensure that we provide quality facilities for haulage contractors throughout Scotland. There are good examples of several areas in which the issue has been pursued, but much further work could be done.</p><p>A number of contractors made a powerful point on a subject on which we perhaps did not elaborate in our recommendations&#8212;the demands that are placed on haulage contractors by their clients. In particular, they mentioned the supermarket industry, which has placed unreasonable demands on contractors on a number of occasions. I do not think that we addressed that effectively in our recommendations.</p><p>The Minister for Transport should show leadership by calling a summit with haulage contractors and their clients and examining more effective ways of ensuring that they work logistically with the haulage industry to make more effective use of the loads that travel on our road networks. The haulage contractors raised many examples of their concern that they were perhaps not making best use of the load potential because of demands that are placed on them by clients. We need leadership from the Executive to ensure that clients take the issue seriously.</p><p>The inquiry was lengthy, but we tried to reflect on the issues in Phil Flanders's original petition for which we have devolved responsibility.

If the SNP introduces a bill, we will scrutinise its proposals for collecting a local income tax.</p><p>The Parliament has on many occasions shown great pity for those who live in deprived areas. We talk about league tables. Our civil servants are obsessed with presenting in glossy documents and on websites the terrible statistics on what faces Glasgow. We spend a lifetime on providing league tables that show the educational attainment challenges that face Glasgow and we talk about the health statistics that face Glasgow and many other local authority areas. However, we do not talk about how the local government settlement should attack those deprivation figures, so I call on COSLA's leader, who I know is considering the matter, to examine the proposals that Charlie Gordon made to COSLA in his former capacity with Glasgow City Council and the case that other local authorities have made for deprivation figures to be taken into account in the allocation of local government funding. The challenges that face not only Glasgow City Council, but other local authorities, should be considered at the same time.</p><p>Of course, tackling deprivation costs money. If we are serious about tackling educational attainment figures in Glasgow that are not at the levels that they should be, we need money. That is why I am willing to consider whether efficiency savings, if they can be recovered, should be redirected to deal with deprivation. We might not allocate such funds through the local government settlement, but we might be able to tackle deprivation in other ways by using the budget that is available to the Scottish Executive. I would commend the Executive if it used the efficiency savings from local government to tackle deprivation in other ways. We talk about siphoning off funds, but I would commend the Executive for redirecting funds to tackle deprivation.

I also thank Help the Aged, and particularly Richard Meade of that organisation, for providing a helpful briefing and for campaigning so effectively on winter deaths of the elderly.</p><p>The statistics speak for themselves. More than 2,760 people in Scotland&#8212;2,550 of whom were elderly&#8212;died of winter-related illnesses in the past year. In the Greater Glasgow NHS Board area&#8212;which covers the Springburn constituency that I represent&#8212;there were 450 winter-related deaths, of which the majority were of elderly people. The tragedy that lies behind those statistics is that with the right strategy and effective action plans, those numbers could be drastically reduced.</p><p>I do not want to use my speech to applaud the Executive, the Parliament and the utility companies for the very good work that they have done so far; that would be an opportunity missed. The briefing document describes the good work that has been done. Instead, I will make the point that more has to be done to tackle the statistics. If all was right, the figures would not be at their current levels.</p><p>What action can we expect from our utility companies? Their collective profits come to &#163;6.7 billion. I do not grudge any public limited company the opportunity to make its profits, but I want the <place-holder colnum=\"21847\"/> utility companies to do more to target those who are most at risk. Direct payments should be made to those whom we can identify on a postcode basis as being most at risk. I welcome several of the initiatives that have been made by some of the utility companies, but I want there to be more direct targeting of subsidies to those who are in most danger because they live in fuel poverty.</p><p>For far too long, public limited companies have discriminated in favour of those who are economically active and who have the most disposable income. That is true of banks and many other PLCs. Here is an opportunity for our utility companies to set an example by discriminating in favour of those who are most at risk because they live in fuel poverty. I want those companies to lay out their plans for discriminating directly in favour of those who live in fuel poverty and I would welcome the minister's response to that possible initiative.</p><p>From various initiatives, we have seen that community action plans can make a difference, and I would like local communities to set out such plans. Consider the success of many organisations that are in regular contact with the elderly. For example, the alive and kicking project, which is based in the Red Road area of my constituency, provides a range of opportunities to target those who are most in need as a result of fuel poverty. The project provides benefits advice and ensures that people take up their council tax benefits. It also provides advice on healthy living; the Help the Aged briefing makes it very clear that such advice can reduce winter-related illnesses. The project puts on concert parties and members take trips to Spain, Ireland and many other parts of the world as part of the healthy living and active lifestyle that the project encourages for the elderly.</p><p>I commend another excellent project&#8212;the north of Glasgow good morning project&#8212;in which direct contact is made with those who are most vulnerable in the local community. We live in an age in which we have to deal with unwanted calls from call centres. In that project, the reverse happens: the workers make direct contact with the elderly. We should consider doing that in a more concentrated and sophisticated manner; I would like initiatives such as the good morning project to be rolled out to other parts of Scotland to ensure that those who are most at risk are contacted and that their needs are met.</p><p>We have missed an opportunity to take advantage of the advances in information technology throughout the world in recent years. Some time ago, I spoke to an 83-year-old constituent who advised me that she wanted me to contact her by e-mail. She was offended when I registered surprise that she had an e-mail address&#8212;she was very proud of being a silver <place-holder colnum=\"21848\"/> surfer. That made me realise that IT could be a very effective way of getting information to the elderly and of communicating with them. Advances in IT could provide a more targeted approach to delivering health advice and information about activities in their communities to the elderly. I look forward to hearing the minister's response to that suggestion.</p><p>Sometimes in the chamber and in committee we hear calls for research to be done into a particular subject. I am not always happy with that approach, because it can be used as an excuse to introduce a stopgap and to defer the setting in place of action plans. However, I recognise that on this issue there is a need to clarify the challenges that we face. We must also recognise the contribution of all those who help the elderly&#8212;the unsung heroes such as home helps, concierge staff and the many other workers who are in contact with the elderly and who play a crucial role in tackling fuel poverty and ensuring that people are given effective advice. We should conduct research into the effective work that those people do in tackling the number of excess winter deaths.</p><p>It would be wrong not to applaud the good work that goes on. We should recognise that there are partnerships, but also that there is a need for a more holistic approach to them. We need to look at the statistics and at targeting those who are at greatest risk on a postcode, street-by-street basis. After all, many credit card companies target people on such a basis&#8212;let us use such methods to target those whom we believe to be most in need. I would like to see a more effective partnership between the utility companies, the Executive and everyone else who has a role to play.

I also welcome the interest that I have received from the media throughout the world. In fact, I had inquiries from <em>The</em> <em>Australian Financial Review</em> magazine, which showed an interest in the issue.</p><p>My motion sets out my concerns about the closure of 60 Clydesdale Bank branches throughout Scotland and the devastating effect that those closures will have on local communities and the staff, who have so loyally served those branches over the years.</p><p>I put on record my appreciation of the staff who have served in the two Clydesdale Bank branches in my constituency: Springburn and Duke Street, where closure is proposed. The staff have established an effective relationship with the community in the Duke Street area. I thank them for the dedication that they have shown.<place-holder colnum=\"18566\"/></p><p>From time to time in the chamber we hear about companies that face economic challenges and about the need for the Parliament to assist companies during that process. I have supported the Executive in the way in which it has engaged with such companies in considering their future and the difficulties that they face.</p><p>The proposed closure programme has not been a partnership process with the Parliament. I say that because there has been no consultation with elected members. I received no correspondence on the issue until after the announcement and I know that that was the experience of other members whose constituencies will be affected. The bank's approach demonstrates contempt not only for the Parliament but for local communities, which should be consulted. It also shows disloyalty to staff.</p><p>We face a challenge, because we must stand up to a culture of greed and to the bank's disloyalty to its staff and customers. On its website, the Clydesdale Bank proudly boasts:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"People are the very heart of our business.\"</p><p>However, people in the deprived area of Springburn and in other deprived areas, such as Alexandria, will not be the heart of the bank's business. The hard-working families who are returning to work with the help of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Scottish Executive expect more from banking institutions in Scotland.</p><p>I represent a constituency that fights the regeneration battle every day with the help of partnerships, the local authority and local economic development companies. The Executive can take credit for fighting that battle in my constituency: unemployment has been reduced by 50 per cent and by 75 per cent among young people. I am proud of those achievements, but regeneration will not be assisted if there are no good local banking facilities. We do not want people to have to have recourse to local loan sharks and we do not want furniture shops that charge an annual percentage rate of more than 38 per cent; we need good banking facilities. However, the proposed closures will not deliver such facilities to us.</p><p>I welcomed the opportunity to meet representatives from the bank last week. The bank has said much about alternatives whereby people can make deposits into and withdrawals from their accounts via the local post office. It will not have escaped members' notice that the Parliament has debated proposed post office closures. The bank has not been able to say what would happen if the post office also closed. Nor has it said whether the proposed arrangements with post offices would remain in place in perpetuity. If the bank cannot guarantee that the arrangements will continue, the <place-holder colnum=\"18567\"/> Parliament should not accept the proposals. I mean no disrespect to the diversification of post office activity or to the dedication of post office staff when I say that a post office is not a substitute for a bank. Banks are financial institutions and have qualified staff who can provide effective on-site advice. We must accept that post offices cannot offer such services.</p><p>Richard Meade made a powerful point when he described the rejection of the campaign's proposals for banking facilities to be shared locally. The banks roundly rejected the proposals. A challenge faces anyone who suggests an alternative approach. Richard Meade works for Help the Aged and told us that elderly people, as well as local businesses, need local banking facilities.</p><p>I hope that the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is aware of how strongly communities and elected members feel about the matter. I ask the minister to answer two specific points and I hope that he does not go down the road that Nicol Stephen takes and indulge in the art of evasion. First, will the Executive name and shame the public limited companies that do not contribute to regeneration? The Executive cannot preach to local companies that they must play a part in regeneration and tackling social exclusion if it does not commend the organisations that play their part and expose the ones that do not do so. I ask the minister to consider having a naming and shaming programme.</p><p>Secondly, I ask the minister to consider requesting a meeting with the chief executive of the National Australia Bank, John Stewart&#8212;an Edinburgh man I understand, who will, no doubt, be paying a visit to Edinburgh at some point; I hope that it will be soon. I ask the minister to consider meeting him in Australia at his headquarters, expressing the Scottish Executive's commitment to the regeneration battle and the key role that local financial institutions such as the Clydesdale Bank play in it and requesting that the bank reconsider its position.</p><p>The Parliament has a key role to play in the regeneration of our communities. It is time that we stood up to the banks and advised them that they need to play their part&#8212;we need to preach the need for them to do so. If they do not want to play their part, we will take these issues to the people and ensure that we work in partnership in future.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343979", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clydesdale Bank (Branch Closures)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take the opportunity to thank the 47 members of the Parliament&#8212;cross-party&#8212;who have supported the motion in my name.

I give him one warning: he should not allow his party leader to recruit him to the parliamentary golf team, which was soundly beaten 8-0 on Saturday. Derek Brownlee should stay away from the team if he can.</p><p>Like others, I think that we should welcome the bill. All too often, we are accused of not reflecting public opinion. This is a serious piece of legislation that was launched in 2001. It has been long in coming to the Parliament, but it will genuinely make a difference not just in changing how we sell alcohol but in dealing with the most appalling <place-holder colnum=\"18180\"/> statistics, which have been the subject of great debate in the Parliament on a number of occasions. We do not always take direct action to deal with the appalling statistics that exist in my constituency and in many other parts of Scotland, but in this case, as well as talking about what we have got to do, we are taking direct action.</p><p>Bruce Crawford is being slightly disingenuous on the requirement for clarity. The committee sought further clarity, but that was no different from any other stage 1 report that has been produced in the Parliament. If there was absolute clarity, I would be concerned that the minister was not willing to show any flexibility in allowing the committee to develop what the licensing standards officers should be doing. An important part of the Parliament's work will be to develop what those officers should do. I am not here to decide what salary they should get; that issue should be developed by the civil servants. However, we should subject it to effective scrutiny.</p><p>A couple of issues, which are out there in the public domain, were the subject of great debate during the committee's evidence sessions in Glasgow and in other parts of Scotland. The first of those issues is the current police reporting mechanisms. I welcome the commitment that we will develop the police reporting role with ACPOS; however, crucial to those discussions will be our ensuring that there is absolute continuity and continued clarity with regard to how the police officers will report to the licensing committees. All too often, I hear of communities attending the licensing board or committee to be advised by the police authorities that there is nothing to report, although that has not been the local experience of the premises. There must be a standard format whereby all activities that take place in a certain premises are reported to ensure that the police report does not just say whether an offence has been detected, but creates a profile of a local facility in a community. I would welcome a commitment from the minister that whatever is developed will be developed effectively.</p><p>Another issue on which we received evidence, particularly in Glasgow, was the concern of communities about the pressures that they faced as a result of night clubs. We heard about not only the pressures that night clubs put on communities, but the pressures that they put on police authorities and council services. I do not believe that the tab should be picked up by the council tax payer, or by the taxpayer in the case of the police authorities; I think that the tab should be picked up by the night club facility or any other licensed premises that brings that additional pressure to a community. Will the minister ensure that the legislation will enable authorities to serve a levy on a night club or any other licensed premises that creates an additional requirement for services? All <place-holder colnum=\"18181\"/> too often, communities have been attacked as a result of the activities that take place and I do not see why they should pick up the tab for that. The committee received powerful evidence on that in its Glasgow session.</p><p>The issue of family-friendly premises was raised during evidence taking, particularly in the evidence that we received from Niall Stuart of the Federation of Small Businesses. I have been encouraged by the condition of a number of family-friendly premises throughout Scotland, which have developed their services very well. Niall Stuart said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"From a practical point of view, a baby can be changed without the availability of baby changing facilities.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Transport Committee</em>, 3 May 2005; c 2456.]</p><p>If I had heard that before I became a father 15 months ago, I would have said that it was a possibility. However, I can now tell Niall Stuart that that is not the case. If we are to encourage a family-friendly environment, we must have a charter that delivers a basic standard. It was crass of Niall Stuart to suggest that that can be done in any other way. If we are to bring families into the licensed environment, that must be done responsibly and with commitment. I do not welcome Niall Stuart's statement. However, I must say again that licensed premises throughout Scotland have moved in the right direction on the issue.</p><p>On the ACPOS proposal for a database of licence holders, I was surprised that we did not already have a database to collect information on licence holders. It is a serious concern that no such database is in place. A number of opportunities in relation to databases that already exist in the justice system have been talked about, but we should ensure that there is a national database that allows information to be shared. I ask the minister to ensure that funding is made available at least to develop the opportunities.</p><p>I welcome the bill, subject to changes at stage 2.

The Labour-led Executive has delivered legislation that will make a genuine difference to communities throughout Scotland. There are two main areas of enforcement of the legislation that I think require attention. One of them is youth services, to which Patrick Harvie referred and to which I will return.</p><p>However, I turn first to the police authorities and how they enforce the act. The minister and the deputy minister will know that on a number of occasions I have raised the issue of policing and the need to review how we deliver our police services. I believe that there is a need to modernise the way in which our police forces are mobilised and structured. I have been an elected representative for 11 years and the very same policing issues that were raised with me on 17 December 1993 were raised with me last night at a public meeting&#8212;issues relating to the deployment of police services. I do not think that <place-holder colnum=\"17509\"/> our police forces have moved on in the new era of closed-circuit television systems and the internet. We need to consider how we modernise the approach that our police authorities take to delivering services to deal with many of the antisocial activities that have been mentioned.</p><p>There are a number of measures that do not require additional resources. We are obsessed with increasing the number of police officers, but that will not necessarily make a difference to my constituents who call the police office only to be treated in the most appalling manner when they report incidents in their community, a number of which are not followed through effectively. I have dealt with a number of individuals over the phone who have been dealt with in an appalling manner.</p><p>Problem solving saves police resources, but I do not see enough evidence that our police forces are considering ways in which they can solve problems. It would not require additional resources to ensure that there was stability in the police force, rather than the constant turnover of senior police officers.</p><p>Our obsession with police numbers is a red herring. We have to deploy our police resources in the areas where they are needed most. That might mean that the leafy suburbs do not get the same number of police officers as do areas such as Ruchazie in my constituency. We will have to review the way in which our police resources are deployed.</p><p>I turn to youth services. It is important to acknowledge that an element of the act was to ensure that we dealt with youth disorder. Parental accountability is an important issue. Too often I attend public meetings at which it is clear that parents believe that it is our role as politicians to deliver local youth services. I see a role for parents in that process. People do not have a God-given right to be a parent; parents have to play a role in partnership with communities in delivering services for their children.</p><p>We will have to improve the youth services that we deliver and acknowledge that although many of our services are of the highest standard, they are not being promoted in the way that they should be. I call on the minister to ensure that our local authorities modernise their approach to how they promote local services. I have attended public meetings on a number of occasions and told people that we have Olympic-sized swimming pools in Glasgow that are not being used to the extent that they should be and people have appeared to be surprised. Sometimes it is convenient for parents to be surprised because they do not always want to live up to their responsibilities. We should do more to ensure that they do so and to provide a national standard that young people can expect of their local youth services.<place-holder colnum=\"17510\"/></p><p>I welcome the act but plead with the minister to ensure that we can enforce it by modernising the police force and other authorities that are involved in its enforcement to ensure that we make progress.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341191", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Antisocial Behaviour"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Individuals who seek to involve themselves in those statistics should get themselves into the real world of the hard-working individuals out there and the difficult circumstances that they face.

None of us should make any apologies for the issues that we raised in the inquiry, because the effectiveness of our bus network throughout Scotland affects many people, particularly the disadvantaged groups who depend on an effective bus network.</p><p>Many people in my constituency and throughout Scotland need a decent bus network to get them to hospitals, health centres and leisure facilities, and even to get them to work in the early hours of the morning. I do not see any evidence that, under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001, our bus <place-holder colnum=\"17406\"/> companies are motivated by the need to deliver for the social needs of our communities. They are motivated only by the need to ensure that they make a nice tidy profit from every route that they deliver. Social conscience may have nothing to do with the concerns that have been raised, but the specific issue that I want to raise is the cherry-picking process that the bus companies involve themselves in.</p><p>I ask the Minister for Transport not simply to take my word for that. I quote from the minutes of a north Glasgow FirstGroup transport liaison group meeting, at which David Robertson, the network manager of FirstGroup, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Unfortunately bus operators cannot afford to be suppliers of Social Services\",</p><p>as previously delivered by the SPT. The minister said in response to our inquiry that the bus companies should not always look at the bottom line, but should deliver social services throughout Scotland. I agree with that, but unfortunately that is not what is being played out in our communities. I find the cherry picking that goes on throughout the bus industry unacceptable, and the quality partnership and quality contract process, which was well meant in 2001, is not playing out effectively. There will have to be a process to ensure that we can regulate to deliver the social needs of our communities.</p><p>In relation to concessionary fares, we have seen significant investment by the Executive of &#163;156 million; I know that all members welcome that. However, the evidence that we received during our inquiry showed that there is no purpose to that scheme unless people can access the bus services in the first place. Once again, I must mention the need to ensure that the elderly and, in particular, the disabled can access those services. We are advised that many of the buses that are being developed will not be ready to comply with the amended regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for another 20 years. We should introduce legislation timeously to ensure that everyone can get access to bus services.</p><p>I have spoken a number of times in the chamber about the need to ensure that we deliver to many of the facilities that require bus services for people who have no alternative but to access the bus network. I welcome the minister's response on that point during stage 2 of the Transport (Scotland) Bill, when we ensured that the new regional transport partnerships will take health facilities into consideration. I believe that the minister will, at some point, have to address the need to regulate to ensure that bus companies take those issues into account.</p><p>I want to address the constant need for companies to consider a subsidy before they will <place-holder colnum=\"17407\"/> deliver a service. David Robertson, whom I quoted earlier, also said to the north Glasgow liaison group, \"Why don't you make representations to your MSP to see how that subsidy can deal with delivering some of those social services?\" FirstGroup asks us to provide funding from the public purse to deliver social services when its turnover, according to a recent announcement, has increased by 8 per cent from &#163;2.29 billion to &#163;2.47 billion. It is time for such companies to move away from the cherry picking of routes and to ensure that they deliver a cross-section of services to the people who need them in the most disadvantaged areas.

I also pay tribute to the courage and determination of Margaret Ann Cummings, who is with us this evening. Tragically, she lost her son, Mark Cummings, who was murdered by Stuart Leggate, a registered child sex offender. I commend her patient and constructive approach to ensuring that lessons are learned from the tragic murder of her son.</p><p>I want to highlight several issues. First, I will consider how the housing allocation system deals with registered child sex offenders&#8212;I stress \"registered\". There is a myth that registered sex offenders are carefully managed in the housing allocation process and that housing providers are informed of the history of such offenders. I am sorry to inform members that that is not the case. Stuart Leggate, who had served two years of a four-year sentence for sex acts against children, was able to choose to live in the Royston area of Glasgow. He was not managed through the housing allocation process and he was housed in an area that has a high population of young children, and within 100 yards of a nursery and two primary schools.</p><p>When someone has been convicted of sex acts against children, they should forgo many of the life <place-holder colnum=\"16618\"/> choices that are available to law-abiding citizens, including the choice of where to reside. We need to create a rigid and efficient environment to ensure that we manage sex offenders and that they do not manage us during the process.</p><p>The minister should ensure that legislation is introduced to establish a structure that will deliver the basic requirement of managing sex offenders through the housing allocation process while dealing with sex offenders' being able to assume aliases. It is unacceptable that both Ian Huntley and Stuart Leggate assumed aliases. Parliament should investigate a possible partnership with Westminster to consider withdrawing the right to an alias.</p><p>I will refer to sentencing policy. Stuart Leggate served two years of a four-year sentence for sex acts against young children. It is unacceptable that he should be released only two years into his sentence. Many academics and world-renowned experts on the subject tell us that dealing with registered sex offenders is a difficult and complex issue&#8212;I agree with them all. Why, in that case, should we release sex offenders halfway through their sentences?</p><p>We should significantly increase the sentencing tariffs that are available to sheriffs in respect of registered child sex offenders. Moreover, a life sentence should mean life for individuals who have shown during the process that they are not capable of being treated. I ask the minister to respond to the specific question of how we can ensure that tariffs are increased.</p><p>On neighbourhood notification, much has been said about how we notify communities of the presence of child sex offenders. A lot has also been said about vigilantes. I do not represent a community of vigilantes; I represent hard-working men and women who wish to live in harmony in their communities, and who care deeply for the safety of their young children. There have been no vigilantes in Royston. Although there are examples of vigilante action, we are dealing with people who want to work constructively with the authorities to examine ways in which they can protect their children.</p><p>I have always maintained that to take this issue forward, we, as elected members, should not be so arrogant as to dismiss any opportunity that is presented to us on the ways in which we can protect children from registered child sex offenders. The Executive should at least investigate opportunities that are available to it worldwide, and it should examine international examples of cases in which information on registered sex offenders has been shared with communities. The intention would be to use the information in a controlled and responsible <place-holder colnum=\"16619\"/> environment, in which the safety of the child is paramount.</p><p>An issue also arises in respect of how we share information, not only with communities but with authorities such as housing authorities. The fact that this gift is in the possession of only the police authorities is unacceptable. We have to consider the various authorities that deal with sex offenders, sometimes indirectly, and we must ensure that relevant and accurate information is provided to them.</p><p>We hear far too much about information-sharing partnerships and the existing partnerships that are in place. We should introduce legislation to ensure that information partnerships are established to deal with how we share information on registered sex offenders.</p><p>It is important that we learn from the experience of young Mark's death. Margaret Ann Cummings has made it very clear that she does not want a blame culture to follow Mark's death, but a culture in which all of us accept with humility that we could have got it much more right than we did. Let us show humility and introduce a \"Mark's law\" that will ensure that everything possible is done to protect our future generations.</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13339276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Managing Sex Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members who have supported my motion and the large number of organisations and individuals outwith Parliament who support the ethos of the motion.

I echo Bristow Muldoon in saying that the people of Scotland should understand that if members do not vote for the bill today, the universal concessionary fares scheme will be rejected.</p><p>I would like to deal with two aspects of the bill on which I think the minister should reflect. Members have referred to the regional transport partnerships and to the minister's proposal that we should consider business representatives or other non-elected members being involved and having voting rights in regional transport partnerships. I totally oppose such a proposal, in similar terms to those that Tommy Sheridan used in his speech. We should seriously consider the precious resource of our elected members, who represent their constituents, not shareholders. We should ensure that the status of elected members is retained and that we give them absolute priority. We should, of course, ensure that businesses are given the opportunity to form partnerships with the regional transport partnerships, but I think that it would be wrong to introduce a measure that would give them voting rights.</p><p>If we wanted to extend such a principle, why does the Parliament not give businesses voting rights in the Parliament? That would be equally wrong and I believe that we should oppose such a measure for the regional transport partnerships. <place-holder colnum=\"14879\"/></p><p>However, we should build on the existing principles of working with businesses throughout Scotland.

It would have been more fitting if Phil Gallie had been so vocal during that period, although he appears to be suffering a loss of memory in that respect today.</p><p>The most important aspect of the bill, and something that we must consider in introducing free concessionary fares, is accessibility. I raised that issue continually with the minister and other witnesses at stage 1. Organisations such as the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland advised us that there is no purpose in delivering free concessionary fares if disabled people are not able to get access to the mode of transport in question&#8212;that is unacceptable. The Parliament has been successful in raising the profile of antisocial behaviour, homelessness and other issues that affect certain groups in Scotland, but it is time that it stood up to the transport providers, who are open about the massive amounts of money that they accrue from public subsidies, to demand that they give us something back. In particular, we should demand that they give something back to disabled people by delivering accessible transport and ensuring that people are able to use public transport in comfort.</p><p>We have delivered stage 1 of the bill. There is an issue concerning the detail of stage 1, which the minister will have to work on, and he must come back with more details in respect of some of the issues that we have raised.

I do not know whether it is because I am a Glaswegian, but I think that our city faces severe and complex challenges. A large number of studies on Glasgow have been carried out by underemployed consultants. I respectfully suggest that they should consider how services in Glasgow could be delivered more effectively instead of telling us the problems of which we are all well aware. We need to examine how to tackle the problems.</p><p>Although Alasdair Morgan finds it difficult to do so, we must remind ourselves of the Tory years. I make no apologies for doing that, because the people of Glasgow suffered during those years. In 1996, a massive secondary school building project was required. That was delivered in 2004, when 29 brand new secondary schools were built in Glasgow. In 1996, there were no proposals on investment in Glasgow's housing stock. In 2004, <place-holder colnum=\"14314\"/> &#163;700 million was provided for that. In 1994, full employment was a fantasy for politicians in Glasgow, but in 2004-05 it is a reality&#8212;we can deliver full employment. In 1996&#8212;the year before Labour came to power&#8212;the increase in council tax in the Glasgow City Council area was 19 per cent; in 2004-05, the corresponding increase was 1.9 per cent. When I was preparing my speech, my researcher asked whether 19 per cent was the correct figure for this year. I had to ask that the point be put in.</p><p>Let us continue to move forwards. We must keep an eye on the Tories, who were the constant enemies of local government services. Councils strove to deliver front-line services in our communities in spite of the predatory approach that the Tories took to them during their years in Government.</p><p>The balancing act that the Minister for Finance and Public Service Reform has to perform is a serious challenge. He has committed to scrapping the bridge tolls for the 12,000 inhabitants of Skye, but when he makes such decisions, he has to take into account the fact that he is removing the opportunity to provide additional funding for Glasgow to deal with the serious challenges that it faces. I am conscious of the balancing act that the minister has to carry out, but I think that he should take into account the complex problems that Glasgow faces, such as the serious health situation that the statistics remind us of daily.</p><p>I welcome the commitment to provide an additional &#163;64 million to police forces throughout Scotland. However, on a number of occasions I have called for a top-to-bottom review of how police services are delivered in our communities. It is all very well to provide additional investment for police officers and to use the buzz words, but it is important that local elected members have a role in examining how policing is delivered. It is crucial to ensure that the investment that is made in the police force is used to best effect.</p><p>I welcome the additional &#163;227 million increase in funding for education. As I have said, I welcomed the investment that resulted in the building of 29 brand new secondary schools in Glasgow, five of which are in my constituency. That has resulted in a significant improvement in pupil and teacher morale in those schools. It is now time to consider primary school provision in Glasgow, so that we can raise educational attainment in that area. In my constituency, the number of people who leave school with no qualifications is 240 per cent above the Scottish average. We must invest in our primary school education to ensure that we deal with that issue.</p><p>The debate has been welcome. I welcome Brian Monteith's after-dinner speech, but it is unfortunate that, like the other Opposition <place-holder colnum=\"14315\"/> members, he was unable to provide proposals for alternative, more effective means of funding local government. It is time that the Opposition put up or shut up and allowed us to get on with the job of delivering for local government in our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13333313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/19)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As someone who was born and raised in the Springburn area of Glasgow, I genuinely do not fear the so-called hard-man reputation of Tom McCabe&#8212;or, for that matter, that of Tavish Scott.

As well as focusing on the areas in which the Executive's schemes must be applauded, I will&#8212;as Donald Gorrie did&#8212;highlight areas in which delivery of services to the elderly needs to be improved.</p><p>I make no apologies for applauding the Executive for its central heating programme, which has benefited 12,000 households throughout Scotland. When I was first elected as a councillor in 1993, the idea that anyone could receive a free central heating system without being means tested was unheard of. By delivering the central heating programme, the Executive has moved the debate on a great deal. However, we must develop the central heating programme. Ministers must reflect on the need to improve the criteria for access to the programme. We need a much more effective scheme to ensure that we deliver central heating systems in areas that are densely populated with elderly people. However, we have taken direct action to assist those who need central heating systems; we have not just talked about energy advice and provided glossy leaflets.</p><p>We should applaud the introduction of free concessionary fares and the progress that has been made through the decision to remove the restriction on the times at which people can use the concessionary scheme. My only concern about smart cards is that that they should say \"Free\" on them. The mass of elderly people are not concerned about what the smart cards say; they simply want free travel. However, there is no point in providing free travel if we do not have a reliable bus service to deliver it. It is time for Parliament to get tough with the bus companies&#8212;the multi-million pound plcs&#8212;that are failing to deliver services in many of our communities. We have heard many kind words from the Minister for Transport about how he will consider that issue and disabled access&#8212;about which David Davidson expressed concern&#8212;but it is time for action. I do not want to attend the Local Government and Transport Committee day in, day out to hear the minister say that he will consider the issue, or to take evidence from organisations such as the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland; I want Parliament to take direct action, given that we have the power to do so.</p><p>We should also consider the technology that is available in this day and age. I do not know about other constituencies, but even in the deprived <place-holder colnum=\"13868\"/> community of Springburn, which I represent, the number of people who communicate with me by e-mail has increased. Elderly people have taken the new technology in their stride&#8212;they often use e-mail, for example, to communicate with their families overseas. We must consider the latest broadband technology. If it is possible to provide free internet access for silver surfers, we should do so because it would present opportunities to provide information on local health services and to communicate with the large elderly population. We should never dismiss the elderly when we consider technology advances in Scotland. All too often, organisations dismiss the opportunities that technology provides in relation to elderly people.</p><p>In every debate on the elderly in which I have spoken, I have referred to the alive and kicking project in the Red Road area of my constituency, which is a one-stop shop for services for the elderly. I commend that project for the services that it provides. It has become a dating agency in Springburn&#8212;many people have married in the later years of their lives. I would welcome a visit from the Minister for Communities to the project, which provides a wide range of services in Springburn and which has allowed many people who have been isolated for many years to access services.</p><p>The \"alive and kicking\" title is one that Parliament should consider harnessing in considering the future of our elderly population. People will not have to live in cold homes, because we will deliver central heating systems; they will not have to worry about access to public transport, because we will deliver more effective, reliable and accessible public transport; and they will not have to worry about paying for personal care.

In the Parliament, we have considered what some people regard as serious restrictions of liberty, such as the banning of smoking in public places. In my view, we must consider the sale of knives in a similar fashion. When I look at many of the weapons that are sold by retail outlets such as Victor Morris in Argyle Street in Glasgow, I wonder why anyone would have to purchase them. I argue that people should have to make a case for purchasing many of the <place-holder colnum=\"13159\"/> knives and other weapons that are on sale. In common with Des McNulty, I think that we should consider more regulation, whereby someone would have to show why they needed to buy a particular weapon rather than simply have the right to buy it for whatever purpose they want.</p><p>Sandra White spoke about policing schools, which I think is the way forward. At Whitehill Secondary School in my constituency, pupils and police officers have been most impressed by the response that they have received. Such initiatives are an opportunity for police officers to make contact with young people in a way that they have never been able to before. The times when young people would not communicate with community police officers are long gone. In my experience, young people are moving on; they want to establish a dialogue with police officers in more creative ways.

The Minister for Education and Young People and the Minister for Finance and Public Services could work in partnership to consider complementing the legislation with measures to tackle unacceptable behaviour in communities. It is not just young people who become involved in attacks on firefighters and paramedics; people who belong to various age profiles give our public sector workers a hard time.</p><p>I agree with Tommy Sheridan that housing officers have a difficult time of it out there and I would not oppose attempts to explore the possibility of extending the bill to cover such workers and others who are affected in their daily lives.

I am not here today to defend Malcolm Chisholm, nor am I here to challenge him in any way. I am here today to hold the Executive to account in respect of one of the issues that affects my constituency and which Johann Lamont raised earlier. We have some of the most appalling health statistics in Scotland. Heart disease in my constituency is 173 per cent above the Scottish average, and the incidence of cancer in Glasgow Springburn is 213 per cent above the Scottish average. That sets out clearly the serious challenges that we face in this Parliament. When we talk about raising our game, those are the issues that we should be challenging.</p><p>That brings me to the serious issue that I raise today. We are trying to challenge those statistics, and with an acute site in Glasgow Springburn we have a serious opportunity to do just that. If we move acute services from the Stobhill campus, will we improve those unacceptable statistics? Will the patient experience improve as a result? The devil is in the detail. I have not received any serious information from the various consultants who have made the case for acute services to be moved from Stobhill hospital about how they will improve the patient experience or how they will attack those unacceptable statistics that we face in Glasgow Springburn. That is why I raise concerns about whether the patient experience will be improved if acute services are relocated to Glasgow royal infirmary and about whether Glasgow royal infirmary will be able to deal with that additional capacity.</p><p>In an age of creativity, we hear about modernisation and flexible working practices in many public sector areas. When the site to which we propose to relocate acute services is 3 miles away, why can we not consider the Stobhill campus as part of the acute services strategy?</p><p>Although I welcome the compromise that the minister has made in regard to the Queen Mother's hospital, with which Pauline McNeill has been involved&#8212;I also congratulate the <em>Evening Times</em> on its campaign&#8212;I ask for a compromise in relation to Stobhill hospital.

They have not been consultation exercises; they have been information processes. We have to modernise the way in which such exercises are carried out. I ask the minister to consider my member's bill, which seeks to give local communities the right of appeal to a sheriff if they feel that a consultation exercise has not been carried out properly.</p><p>We continue to face serious challenges in the form of unacceptable health statistics in Glasgow.

However, I have some sympathy with the concerns about the way in which the process has been developed, and the minister should deal with some of those points to ensure that we learn lessons from this complex process.</p><p>I will be my usual parochial self and make the case for my constituency. A number of people have already expressed self-interest. I add to that by welcoming the minister's comments on the City Park development in my constituency, which he and Andy Kerr visited recently.

In a constituency that faces serious social and economic challenges, that opportunity is most welcome.</p><p>We often hear about&#8212;and Opposition members often attack us for&#8212;the social profiles in our constituencies. This is a serious opportunity for us to attack those social profiles. Bruce Crawford raised his concerns about the opportunity for Glasgow to benefit from this relocation. However, the Executive's belief is that locating to Glasgow fits in with its economic and social policy. Glasgow fits very well with the Executive's policy of tackling social exclusion. In Glasgow, we should not make any apologies for seeking the opportunity of relocation of jobs in our area.</p><p>At the same time, the Executive must practise what it preaches. It preaches to other prospective employers that they should recruit in areas of high unemployment, and we have seen that in the new deal programme. The Executive must take up that theory, and the City Park development fits in with that.</p><p>As I said, there are lessons to be learned from the process that has been followed. I share some of the concerns that SNH staff have raised about <place-holder colnum=\"10167\"/> the way in which they were consulted. I know that several members from the Edinburgh area will raise that issue today. In Glasgow, although we welcome the relocation of jobs, we do not want to see that having a detrimental effect on other areas. The process is complex and if the Executive is to deliver its theory of relocation, and if we are to achieve the long-term aim of a much more open and transparent Scotland in which various departments are delivered to various parts of the country, difficult decisions such as the one on SNH will have to be taken, as Des McNulty said. However, that must be done in full consultation with union representatives and we must also consider investing in the process.</p><p>Fergus Ewing has now left the chamber, but I take issue with his suggestion that the policy will have a significant cost to the Executive. If we are serious about delivering the policy, we have to invest in it to make it work. If we are to create a much more effective devolved Scotland, in which employment opportunities are devolved to various areas, such as my constituency, we have to invest in at least the initial stages of the process and ensure that the opportunities are there in all our various communities.</p><p>I welcome the policy and I welcome the fact that the minister visited City Park in my constituency&#8212;I make no apologies for being parochial about that.

We should reflect on Brian Monteith's and Fiona Hyslop's comments that they did not welcome the debate and wanted the debate's time to be reduced.</p><p>I think that we should also reflect on the Procedures Committee's recommendation that we hold debates such as this. It was that committee's recommendation that the Executive instigate debates such as this and I, as a member of the Procedures Committee, opposed the recommendation because of the very thing that has resulted today: I said that the Executive would be accused of trying to avoid votes on certain issues. I say that for the <em>Official Report</em>. Members should reflect on the fact that we find ourselves holding a debate such as this because of the recommendations of the Procedures Committee.</p><p>A number of important issues have been debated today, and I think that we can helpfully intervene in a number of areas to improve the children's hearings system. We have referred to the valuable work of the volunteers who give of their time to that system, and I want to put that on record.</p><p>On parenting orders, which are being introduced in the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill, it is quite right that we have that running theme. We want to ensure that parents are more proactive in <place-holder colnum=\"8369\"/> the process of tackling antisocial behaviour, and parenting orders will provide an opportunity to hold parents to account. I say that as the new parent of a three-month-old baby. I have my responsibilities and only two hours' sleep per night as a result of them, but the role of parent should be valued. There is no God-given right to be a parent. Being a parent should have value attached to it, but we have seen that role being devalued in our society.</p><p>Ken Macintosh alluded earlier to the important role that parents play in guidance of their children. We must introduce proposals to ensure that parents value their role and to ensure that we can intervene to assist them in that process. If that means that we have to look at the difficulties that they may be experiencing with alcohol or drug addiction, we must make those interventions.</p><p>I refer to Robin Harper's point about poverty being the cause of many problems.

Poverty is not an excuse for many of the challenges that we currently face in the children's panel system. We should look to the example of previous generations who, despite challenges, turned out to be the most effective parents that people could ask for.</p><p>A multi-agency approach has been referred to on a number of occasions. Almost every glossy document that is presented to Parliament talks about the need for a joined-up approach to delivering services on a number of issues. I am not convinced that what is down on paper is actually delivered in practice. There is a requirement for a more intelligent approach to how we deal with joined-up working. It is unacceptable in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that we continue in the children's hearings system with manual filing systems to track and monitor young people. There must be a more intelligent approach to managing the system&#8212;one that will make best use of the information technologies that are available.</p><p>I would like to make a plea in respect of Glasgow. A number of members have referred to the pressures on Glasgow's children's hearings system. As a result of the local government finance review, I expect us to consider how we <place-holder colnum=\"8370\"/> can assist Glasgow with the extreme pressures that its social services are under at the moment.</p><p>Ensuring that recommendations are delivered is another issue to which a number of members have referred. As parliamentarians, we often express concerns and we would be concerned if our recommendations were not delivered. Members of the children's hearings system are no different in that respect&#8212;when they make recommendations, they expect them to be delivered. The issue is not always about resources, but about how we manage recommendations and ensure that issues are managed and effectively monitored.</p><p>An external approach to managing recommendations and delivering them is possible. It appears that our resources are focused on ensuring that particular cases are delivered to the children's hearings system, but we are not as effective in ensuring that recommendations are delivered. Therefore, there might be scope for a new approach to ensuring that we deliver and monitor recommendations so that they are delivered effectively.</p><p>I will deal with a final issue, which has been referred to. There are real frustrations out there about the number of cases that are marked \"No further action\"&#8212;Mary Mulligan touched on that issue earlier. I often hear from police authorities, using what I call the database of excuses, that issues can be referred to the children's hearings system, but that they will be marked \"No further action.\" I think that that is sometimes an excuse. Police officers have mentioned two examples to me. The first case involved a youth throwing a paving slab from a footbridge on the M8 motorway. That case was marked \"No further action\". The second case involved an attack on a police officer with a knife with a 14-inch blade, which again was marked \"No further action\". I am sure that the minister will agree that those cases should not have been marked \"No further action\" and I am sure that there are many similarly unacceptable examples.</p><p>In conclusion, the Executive has set in place a comprehensive consultation exercise. I have been impressed by the fact that the exercise is a good example of good practice in respect of how we should consult. Specific answers to questions are requested on a number of issues&#8212;I think that Robert Brown mentioned that earlier. I commend the Executive on its step in the right direction and on ensuring that a much more effective children's hearings system that supports those who take part in it will be delivered.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318195", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The point that I am making&#8212;I make it time and again in Parliament&#8212;is that poverty certainly makes lives difficult, but people from other backgrounds experience similar difficulties.

That brings me to the subject of consultation, and how we improve primary and acute care services. Many of the health boards are obsessed with consultation documents.

One of the documents from the Greater Glasgow NHS Board says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Tell us what you think about your local services.\"</p><p>That is a welcome phrase, but at the time of the acute services review in Glasgow, did the health board interrogate the views that people presented to them?</p><p>In order to improve health, particularly the acute and primary care services, we must put across the message that local views have to be considered. Consultation exercises must not become information exercises, as a number of them have been; instead they should give serious consideration to people's views and result in movement on the issues raised.</p><p>Frances Curran talked about health board representation earlier. Her point was well made, and I have made this point several times in the chamber: many of our constituents are good enough to serve on the boards of housing associations, community councils and health councils, but those same people do not have the opportunity to serve on our quango health boards. The sooner we consider Bill Butler's proposed member's bill the better.

Can we look at ways of emulating those brands' methods, so that we can find more effective ways of ensuring that young people have healthy lifestyles?

The coming of the Scottish Parliament has ensured that the people who make such decisions are more accountable and we are now able to scrutinise those decisions. Bill Aitken should cast his mind back to his good old days and reflect on the situation that pertained back then. Although Lord James Douglas-Hamilton gave us a fair hearing, little could be said of his colleagues in that regard.</p><p>Does the minister agree that, according to the legislation that was passed in 1973, a transport study should be completed in full prior to any decision being taken on hospital closures and resiting?

It appears that local people are good enough to serve on housing associations, tenants associations and community councils, but are not good enough to be part of the quango health boards.

If people can be involved in organisations such as the Glasgow Housing Association, which is dealing with a &#163;1 billion investment, surely they can be involved in parochial decisions relating to the health boards. The challenge that faces this Parliament is to make the boards accountable and ensure that people on them have an electoral mandate instead of being made up of the so-called great and the good.

We cannot be complacent in dealing with those types of crime and the effective way to tackle those problems is through sharing information. Organisations must work together to tackle crime. I was impressed when I visited the Dalmellington area of East Ayrshire at the invitation of Provost Boyd. The police and health authorities and the local authority there are based in one facility. That ensures not only that they talk about partnership, but that they live in partnership by being co-located in one multi-facility. That is an effective way of ensuring that they work together to tackle crime. We often talk about partnership, but we do not necessarily deliver it in our communities. We must ensure that we deliver partnership.</p><p>I want to talk about the gimmick that 1,000 police officers will deliver on tackling crime.

We have put in place the framework for doing that. The people of Peterhead will acknowledge that, while they continue to examine ways of improving their prison.</p><p>While the arguments were being made about Peterhead, Dr McManus raised in his evidence several issues that had to be dealt with, such as throughcare and the difficulties with Peterhead prison's location. Later, I will touch on the leadership that is required in the Scottish Prison Service to ensure that its services are delivered locally. The SPS should listen to local staff's views on Peterhead prison and on the best way to deliver throughcare. I did not agree with everything that Peter McKinlay said in evidence, but we could learn much from his experiences in his previous life as the chief executive of Scottish Homes.</p><p>We must audit the effectiveness of the service that is provided at Peterhead prison. Stewart Stevenson&#8212;rightly&#8212;gave his view several times on the effectiveness of the STOP 2000 programme. That programme has much mileage and must run for several years to allow us to clarify whether it is a success. We should acknowledge that the STOP 2000 programme is the foundation of the service and learn from that. The services that are provided at Barlinnie should also be recognised as successes.</p><p>In my last speech in a chamber debate on the subject, I raised the point that the estates review is not only about bricks and mortar. I appreciate the difficulties and challenges that the Parliament faces and the challenges that the Scottish Executive faces, but the estates review was conducted in terms of the bricks and mortar without consideration being given to the needs of the Prison Service. We must consider those needs.<place-holder colnum=\"14573\"/></p><p>During the committee's evidence-taking sessions, we were impressed by the commitment of the Scottish Prison Service staff and support staff. We need to recognise that the Prison Service is not only the prison officers and that staff in every sector of the system deliver services within the Prison Service. Michael Matheson touched on the point that morale in the Scottish Prison Service is low and we must address that because it is unacceptable for morale to be low. The Scottish Prison Service management needs to show leadership on that issue. The Minister for Justice faces a serious challenge in ensuring that the low morale that the committee detected during several evidence-taking sessions is dealt with.</p><p>In my previous speech on the subject I touched on public-private partnerships versus the private build option and said that I was not opposed to that option. I remain of that opinion. I see no difficulty on ethical grounds in building other private prisons similar to Kilmarnock prison. That said, however, my preference is for the public-private option. I believe that there is a grey area in the Executive's response in respect of its undertaking to interrogate the public-private option.</p><p>Another grey area is the large number of academics who provided information and evidence to the committee, but failed to suggest alternatives. They were quick to criticise the fact that the public-private option was not delivered by the Scottish Prison Service, but they were not as quick to propose alternatives. I also criticise Grant Thornton for its opinion that the public-private option could be delivered, but not as a guaranteed option. I welcome the Executive's commitment to the possibility of the trust option and point out that that is another example of the way in which the Executive has demonstrated that it is willing to listen to the points of view that have been raised by the wide range of political parties in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>I also welcome the Executive's record investment in the Prison Service. The Parliament should take credit for considering the ways in which to improve the Prison Service.

She pointed out that we are not just talking about emergency crews. As Bill Aitken said, housing staff are attacked daily as they try to find ways of improving local communities. We have to ensure that staff feel secure from attack and that we introduce legislation to deal with the matter. I support Margaret Smith's point that, given that an assault on a police officer is subject to the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, there is no reason why that legislation cannot be extended to cover anyone who provides a public service. The Scottish Parliament was created to consider Scottish solutions to such matters and the Criminal Justice <place-holder colnum=\"13362\"/> (Scotland) Bill might provide us with the opportunity to find out whether we can introduce legislation to deal with the problem.</p><p>We should also examine whether the tenancy agreements that are in place in many communities such as Blackhill could be used to enforce action against those who perpetrate attacks. Anyone who wants to live in and be part of a community should contribute to that community. By their actions, some of the young people involved in the attacks are simply saying that they do not want to be part of a community. Introducing proposals to take action under the terms of tenancy agreements will send out a clear message that such attacks will not be tolerated. We must introduce measures to allow housing associations to take action in that respect.</p><p>Members have referred to the crucial issue of education. It is clear that attacks on emergency crews, council services staff and people who provide valuable public services do not impact positively on local communities. Shock tactics have often been used in educating young people and we must find innovative ways of informing and educating young people to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of their actions.</p><p>I hope that the minister will tell us about any possible proposals for legislation to deal with attacks on members of staff who deliver public services.

It is important that tabloid newspapers bring this issue to the forefront and raise the debate on ways in which we can tackle the problem of loan sharks.</p><p>Elaine Smith touched on an important issue, which is to recognise the people in the credit union movement who provide credit union services on a voluntary basis. On a number of occasions, I have called them unpaid local heroes. We need to recognise that those people give up their time day in, day out to provide a valuable credit service in our local communities.</p><p>It is clear that loan sharks present a living terror in our communities. Many graphic stories about them have been told by Trish Godman and in <em>Daily Record </em>articles. Loan sharks take advantage of those in our communities who are financially weak. We must take a number of measures to tackle the issue.</p><p>One area that I would like the minister to consider is the fragmented approach to providing credit union services in our communities. The community of Sighthill in my constituency does not have a credit union facility. One would think that, being one of the most deprived communities in Scotland, Sighthill would have a credit union as a basic standard. Communities such as Red Road and Royston do not have that basic standard of financial opportunity. I suggest that the Scottish Executive should consider a framework that will ensure that communities such as Royston, Sighthill and Red Road have that guarantee of a credit union service. Such a framework would ensure that the volunteers who take the time to be involved in credit unions are supported during that process. Glasgow Housing Association also presents an opportunity for us, through local housing organisations, to develop ideas on where to locate financial services. Housing services can identify areas where loan sharks are showing a presence. We should use local housing organisations to highlight those opportunities.</p><p>Importantly, we must tackle the banking corporations. Donald Gorrie touched on that. Banks do not provide services in my constituency. <place-holder colnum=\"13115\"/></p><p>In Sighthill, Royston, Springburn and other areas, there are no banks that are willing to provide a service to people who are in financial difficulties. There is not even a cash machine in areas such as Sighthill, Royston and Red Road. How can we possibly encourage people back into the jobs market when the very basics, such as being able to access a cash machine, are not available to them in their communities? The challenge to the major banks is to ensure that they tailor services not just to suit students, the elderly or other sectors of the population, but to serve the needs of deprived people in our communities.</p><p>Loan sharks are a cancer in our communities and we must ensure that they are removed.</p>", "hdate": "2002-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13277369", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Loan Sharks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Trish Godman on securing an excellent members' business debate.

Tourism is an important part of Glasgow city's economy and it attacks the chronic unemployment in Glasgow.

That information should be made available to a local member of the Scottish Parliament and to the local community. I do not want to get into a debate about Stobhill; I just want to provide background information.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham touched on the requirement to request information in writing. Many individuals encounter bureaucracy that tells them to request their information in writing. Many members of the community have severe difficulties with that, in particular those who do not have English as their first language or who have difficulty reading and writing. Local authorities and <place-holder colnum=\"5479\"/> all other authorities that are covered by the bill should be legally obliged to assist those who request information and perhaps to provide designated areas where people can be assisted to fill in the required forms.

People should not be asked their reasons for requesting information. It is their right to access particular information. We do not need to ask their reasons for doing so.</p><p>Another issue that the committee raised during stage 1 was that of first ministerial certificates. The NUJ raised a particular concern about the First Minister having the opportunity, in exceptional circumstances, to issue a first ministerial certificate. The bill is clear that if a first ministerial certificate is applied for, that certificate should be brought before the Parliament \"as soon as practicable\".</p><p>The period of time referred to by the phrase \"as soon as practicable\" was raised with the Deputy First Minister. In his introduction today, he did not explain what the period would be. During stage 1 consideration of the bill, we asked the Deputy First Minister to define the period, because the phrase \"as soon as practicable\" can be used loosely. I would like the Deputy Minister for Justice to address that and to define what the period will be.</p><p>On many occasions, the Parliament has been given a difficult time about its effectiveness in local communities. We have shown that we have successfully interrogated all of the witnesses who came to the committee at stage 1. We considered every aspect of the bill and that is shown by the responses that we received from the various organisations, such as Friends of the Earth and the Campaign for Freedom of Information Scotland.</p><p>I believe that the bill will ensure absolute openness and fairness in Scotland.

A great deal has been written and said about Sighthill and the people who live there. Let me make it clear to the chamber that the people of Sighthill are decent people. [ <em>Applause.</em> ] For the record, we welcome asylum seekers to Sighthill and we always will.</p><p>The First Minister and the Minister for Social Justice, Jackie Baillie, who has new responsibility for asylum seekers, both visited Sighthill, as did the Minister for Justice and a number of other political leaders. Yesterday, the First Minister visited St Stephen's Primary School, where he displayed his professional football skills to the pupils, and saw for himself the integration that is taking place in that primary school, and in primary schools in other areas that are part of the dispersal programme. The media do not recognise how well our children are integrating. Many of them are learning a number of languages and are putting many of us to shame with their language skills.</p><p>The First Minister also had the opportunity to meet the real community of Sighthill. The Sighthill out-of-school care project is looking to develop an extension to improve its child care facilities. It is also looking to develop a drop-in centre for all sectors of the community, including asylum seekers. The friendship group, which has been <place-holder colnum=\"2770\"/> going for some time under the chairmanship of Charlie Riddell and Fatim Ahmed, enables asylum seekers and the local community to work together to develop support for asylum seekers.</p><p>The Springwell tenant management co-operative is managed by volunteers such as Angela Beattie, Margaret Beattie, Bill Greer and John Sweeney. All those people have worked tirelessly, as have the people of St Rollox church, which has almost been turned into a drop-in centre to support asylum seekers. Sighthill is not a community full of bigots or people who are ignorant towards asylum seekers; it is a community of people who welcome asylum seekers and have welcomed people from all parts of the world for more than 20 years under an overseas student programme.</p><p>It is time for all of us&#8212;political leaders and people from all parts of society&#8212;to create a vision with the Sighthill community and take quick and decisive action. We must learn from past mistakes. Far too often, politicians and their leaders are not willing to accept that they have made mistakes and that they must learn from them. I admit that mistakes have been made&#8212;by me and by many of us in Sighthill&#8212;but we will learn from them. That is an important part of the process.</p><p>We must consider a number of measures to ensure that action is taken in Sighthill. I ask the Minister for Social Justice, Jackie Baillie, to consider publishing an action plan that can be adopted by the Scottish Executive, the Westminster Parliament and Glasgow City Council. I ask that a number of matters be considered in producing that action plan. I will not be able to address all the issues, but I will touch on a couple.</p><p>First, it is clear that there was a lack of consultation with the community prior to 393 families arriving in Sighthill. We must reflect on that. We should set in place a protocol to ensure that local communities feel part of the process, a point that has been made by the local councillor. We are not asking for the local community to take a yes or no decision. We are asking for steps to be taken so that the local community feels part of the process. Unfortunately, the lesson that we must learn from the Sighthill experience is that the local community did not feel part of the process because it was not consulted on or informed about the programme. I ask the Minister for Social Justice to consider putting in place protocols and bureaucracies, which we are good at putting in place when it suits us.</p><p>I touch on the issue of community facilities. A great deal has been said about the lack of community facilities within Sighthill; that point has been made on a number of occasions. However, there is a Sighthill youth centre, a community <place-holder colnum=\"2771\"/> education centre and three excellent primary schools&#8212;St Kevin's Primary School, Sighthill Primary School and St Stephen's Primary School.</p><p>The genuine point to be made is that we must assist groups with their aspirations to develop local facilities. The point that was made to the First Minister and the minister with responsibility for asylum seekers is that groups must be assisted during that process.</p><p>Far too often the leafy suburbs with tennis clubs and golf clubs are successful in their applications for lottery funding because architects and surveyors assist them with that process. We should be clear that the people of Sighthill contribute to the lottery and they should expect to benefit from it.</p><p>I ask the minister to consider ways in which we can assist community groups in making applications for funding&#8212;a complicated process involving business and architectural plans and many other issues. I ask for specific funding to be put in place to deal with that.</p><p>I touch on the issue of public safety. As a number of asylum seekers and local residents have amplified, everyone wants to feel safe in Sighthill, regardless of their race. I commend Strathclyde police&#8212;I give them a difficult time in the Parliament, but I am sure that they will enjoy this statement&#8212;for introducing additional resources in the Sighthill area. It is on the record that I have called for additional resources in my constituency because of the public safety issue. I ask for that police presence to be sustained. The Minister for Justice is here and I ask him to make a representation to Strathclyde police that, for the foreseeable future, they will ensure that additional resources are deployed in the Sighthill area. That important issue has been raised a number of times by asylum seekers.</p><p>Much criticism has been levelled at Glasgow City Council. However, we must recognise a number of points. First, the dispersal scheme is complex. Secondly, if this was such a lucrative contract for the local council, why have other local authorities not formed an orderly queue outside the Scottish Executive to take part in the dispersal programme? It is important that we recognise that point. Glasgow City Council has taken part in the programme to engage with the programme's ethos, not just because there is a lucrative aspect to the contract. That is an important point to make. Glasgow City Council should be given credit and assistance for the work that it is has done so far, but it should also, as I said, learn from mistakes that have been made. We have assurances that those points will be taken on board.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I want as many members as possible to have a say in the debate, so I will <place-holder colnum=\"2772\"/> conclude. I would like to mention a number of issues, but we do not have time.</p><p>I have been impressed by the determination of the Sighthill community. I know that the various ministers and political leaders who have visited the community have been particularly impressed by its determination. In that context, I must mention an incredible young man from Sighthill, Steven McMahon, who was successful in obtaining a scholarship to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center School in New York. That was achieved despite the difficult circumstances of Steven's mother. The local community and various funding sources rallied round to ensure that Steven was able to take up his scholarship. Following the plane disaster in New York last week, I was delighted to learn from Colin McKay, my friend and journalist colleague&#8212;I do not know whether those terms go together&#8212;that Steven is safe and well. That was also reported on the ITN news.</p><p>I ask everyone concerned to give us time to improve the standard of life in Sighthill, to put the negative past behind us and to promote the real Sighthill. That, with commitment from all agencies and with the necessary resources, will allow us to build a new and healthy future for all.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13257706", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sighthill (Community Issues)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about the real Sighthill and the issues that face the area.

They are decent people. They do not deserve to be included in the soundbites, which we hear in many parts of the media, that say that Sighthill is a drug-ridden community.

We should accept the positive aspects of what has been announced today.</p><p>On a more negative note, tackling crime is not just about the allocation of additional resources. It is about the way in which those resources are managed, and I am not fully convinced that Strathclyde police make best use of the resources that are available to them. With the greatest respect to the point that Kenny Gibson made, the problems in Strathclyde will be solved not simply by having additional police officers, but by tackling the issues that our constituents raise with us.</p><p>Let me touch on the way in which police offices communicate with the public. It is unacceptable that people can wait up to 10 minutes for calls to their local police office to be answered while they are kept in queueing systems. People are lectured to at local public meetings that they must report crime but, when they take the next step of reporting crime by the use of telecommunications systems, they are not able to do so or are discouraged from doing so by the fact that they are kept in telephone queueing systems.</p><p>I have raised that issue with Strathclyde police for the past five years. I have not seen them take any significant steps towards improving their telephone system. I ask the minister to take that point on board, to ensure that we bring the telephone systems in police authorities into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, because I do not believe that that is being done.</p><p>Jim Wallace mentioned improving the information technology that is available to the police; that is welcome. The police do not currently have e-mail addresses, which are at the disposal of every major organisation throughout Scotland. We should work to improve the situation that has arisen as e-mail, which is a simple method of communication, is not available to the police.</p><p>I reiterate the point that there should be a top-to-bottom review of the policing allocation. It is unacceptable that in areas such as Blackhill in my constituency, there is one community police officer, when the leafy suburbs throughout the Strathclyde area have two local community police officers on the beat. We should be allocating police officers to the areas where crime is <place-holder colnum=\"1144\"/> committed and where crime is unacceptably high. We must examine the way in which police authorities allocate local police officers.</p><p>We must also examine the shift patterns of community police officers. Criminals do not work shift patterns; they do not decide that they are on the back shift or the early shift. We must ensure that community policing is flexible; currently it is not, as a community police officer works specific shift patterns, which do not fit in with the pattern of when crimes are being committed locally.</p><p>Pauline McNeill raised a point about liaison with local agencies. There is no evidence that agencies are working together with the police authorities. I have had to lead the way in ensuring that there is a coherent approach to working with other agencies. We must move forward.</p><p>I welcome the commitment that has been given that there will be more police officers on the beat. I look forward to a continued positive approach to the matter.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13249532", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the time available I will be able to touch on only a couple of points, so I shall start on a positive note.

While the agencies show some care, they are not providing a joined-up approach to supporting victims of stalking. I would not rule out the possibility of legislation to ensure that agencies do provide a joined-up approach. Marilyn was dealing with bureaucracy over being rehoused outwith the area in which Stuart Drury was operating and she had great difficulty being rehoused as a result of problems in police reports going to the housing department and because it was referred to as a domestic incident. We have to get away from that terminology and definition.

I would not rule out setting up a harassment and stalking unit where case workers can support victims during the very difficult period that they have to endure.

We must consider a unit being set up to ensure that someone like Marilyn, and their family, could speak to someone who could help at such a difficult time.</p><p>We have raised the issue of a stalking law.

I was unable to obtain the popular document with a picture of a toothbrush on the cover, because the information centre had run out of copies.</p><p>Delivering front-line services is an important part of the Executive's strategy. I will focus on a couple of areas in which we can make a difference. First, we can identify the young people who are suffering from dental diseases&#8212;the five-year-olds to whom the statistics refer&#8212;and the best ways of tackling the problems. I propose that we set up and pilot a database that would identify those youngsters. It is not good enough to say that north Glasgow is a deprived area; many parts of north Glasgow have been involved in regeneration strategies over the years and are not deprived. However, in other parts, such as Ruchazie and Blackhill in my constituency, there is a great deal of deprivation, and young people have particular difficulties in accessing dental services.</p><p>I ask the minister to respond to my proposal that we develop and pilot a database that would allow us to identify and track those youngsters throughout their lives, so that we can focus the limited resources&#8212;which we and any Government will always have&#8212;on assisting them in tackling dental decay. A database would also give us the opportunity to work with parents and local schools on attacking dental decay. However, I repeat that to do that we must identify where those young people are and find ways of assisting them. We can use that information to our advantage in allocating resources throughout the Greater Glasgow Health Board area.</p><p>Local health boards have shown a lack of innovation, for example in health centres, which provide an excellent opportunity to access parents when they meet their general practitioners. I am appalled at how that opportunity has always been <place-holder colnum=\"1127\"/> missed.</p><p>I suggest that the minister takes the opportunity to propose a pilot in the Greater Glasgow Health Board area, involving a multi-booking system under which parents could book a dental appointment at the local health centre at the same time as booking a visit to their general practitioner. Over the years, trends have shown that parents spend more time in health centres than they do in dental practices. We must enable parents to book dental appointments through that process. That opportunity has been missed over the years. In Glasgow, some health centre notice boards are two years out of date. We must move forward on that.</p><p>We must put greater emphasis on providing outreach staff, who can spend time in local schools and health centres. It is not good enough to provide documents that will not make sense to local parents; we must get staff in place, working with local organisations, health centres, schools and medical practices.</p><p>It is not good enough that 84 per cent of the children born in my constituency are more prone to experiencing dental decay than children in other parts of Scotland. It is up to the Parliament to present an action plan to deal with that.

If we are to regenerate Glasgow's housing successfully, we have to consider genuinely how we might improve the city. As a former Glasgow councillor, and now as a Glasgow MSP, I am forever touched by the commitment of the many communities in my constituency that are committed to their local areas, such as Sighthill, Ruchazie, Springburn and Royston. People in those areas look to us for options for improving housing in their areas.

Ministerial guidance in the past&#8212;I understand that it is still the same&#8212;has been that changes in health care should be clinically led. None of us wants to move away from that and, indeed, Margaret Smith touched on that in her speech this morning. It appals me, therefore, that the medical staff at Stobhill hospital were not consulted on the proposal for the first medium secure unit in Scotland. As at Stracathro, the staff were advised of the proposals through the media. That is appalling in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Staff want to be involved in health care and want their specialist knowledge to be taken on board.</p><p>I want also to mention the bad practices employed by Greater Glasgow Health Board, in particular in relation to consultation with the local community. Iain Gray quite rightly pointed out that we must enter into meaningful consultation. Why then were people advised in a question-and- answer session that the only consultation that would take place between Greater Glasgow Health Board and the local community on the secure unit would be through the statutory planning process? How meaningful is that?</p><p>Is it meaningful consultation when members of the local community have to drag the health board kicking and screaming to public meetings to relay the fact that they want to be involved? Is it meaningful consultation when the local health trust chief executive feels that it is inappropriate for her to attend public meetings? Of course not. Dr Simpson's report on the situation at Stobhill hospital has shown the need for condemnation of the practices used on that occasion.</p><p>The lack of statutory guidelines has been noted, but does not remove the moral obligation on health boards to engage with the local public when public concerns in local areas are identified. Injustices have clearly taken place against the local community at Stobhill. It is not good enough to say that we will learn from the experience and move on; we must correct those injustices, particularly those experienced by the local community at Stobhill. Health boards must clean up the mess that they have left. Andrew Welsh <place-holder colnum=\"728\"/> described the situation at Stracathro as a dog's breakfast. I would use similar words to describe the situation at Stobhill.</p><p>The atmosphere among the local public makes the acute services review difficult. Richard Simpson touched on that. How can the acute services review genuinely move forward, if consultation on the first secure unit in Scotland was so poor?</p><p>Finally, I want to touch on the issue of health councils, which was mentioned by the convener of the Health and Community Care Committee. It is appalling that health boards should interview applicants for health councils, which is what happened in Greater Glasgow Health Board.

The Parliament is beginning to show how effective it can be for local communities; the fact that we have been able raise this issue proves that.</p><p>I can assure members that the future of Stobhill hospital is a local issue&#8212;that has been made clear by the large amount of correspondence and telephone inquiries I have received. It is important that the Parliament is aware of the reasons for my objection to proposals to build a secure unit on a greenfield site of approximately 10 acres adjacent to the hospital.</p><p>The site that is earmarked for the secure unit is where we wanted an ambulatory care and diagnostic unit. The ACAD unit site is now a 2 acre hospital car park. That is one of the reasons for my concern. We want the ACAD unit to develop into a state-of-the-art facility that will be a benchmark for other facilities in the UK. It would receive more than a third of a million visits every year. The facility needs an opportunity to develop.</p><p>The concern in my constituency is that the facility will not have the opportunity to develop if it is overshadowed by the proposal to build a secure unit. I have been accused of being a NIMBY member of the Scottish Parliament, but I am not alone in my view.</p><p>The medical staff association and the widely respected Dr Frank Dunn recognise the importance of the secure unit, but say that they are unable to support the present proposal because it would seriously jeopardise the functioning, development and ultimate success of the ACAD unit. That is the view of the professionals&#8212;some with as many as 20 years' experience&#8212;at the hospital. It is important that we listen to their views and to the views of patients. I <place-holder colnum=\"677\"/> am concerned that those views have not been taken seriously.</p><p>One would expect the first secure unit in Scotland to be the subject of extensive consultation, but there has been no formal consultation on the proposal. The only consultation with the local community will be through the statutory obligation that results from the planning process. That reeks of arrogance and shows contempt for the community and the medical staff.</p><p>At a recent meeting, the chief executive said that if the community had been consulted, it would have opposed the secure unit. What right do highly paid officials have to tell me that they know what the community will say? Do they have a monopoly on knowledge of how a community will react to proposals?</p><p>Of course the community will have a point of view, but is not it important to listen to the community and to learn from that point of view, rather than take a decision and then speak to the community?</p><p>Some of the public meetings have been constructive. It is disappointing that decisions were made beforehand. We should discuss local communities' concerns with those communities. I am sure that the minister will agree that consultation is crucial to the health service and that we should be taking part in consultation.</p><p>Government policy is clear&#8212;hospital policy should be clinically driven. That view is shared by the former health minister, Sam Galbraith. In March 1998, he told the <i>Kirkintilloch, Bishopbriggs &amp; Springburn Herald</i> that changes at Stobhill hospital should be clinically driven and made after consultation with doctors.</p><p>I will repeat the question that I have asked on a number of occasions: why were medical staff not consulted on the revised proposals for building a secure unit at Stobhill hospital when there was such clear guidance from the then health minister that medical staff should be consulted on clinical matters?</p><p>There is a great myth that local people are NIMBYs. The same accusation has been levelled at me. Some local people might be concerned about any proposal, such as for a new supermarket, that affects the community, but they are entitled to hold and express their opinions. Our great concern about this proposal is that we have not had an opportunity to air our views.</p><p>I have had a helpful meeting with the Minister for Health and Community Care, but the Parliament has to take action to make a difference to local people's lives. There are no representatives from the local community on the local NHS trust, which <place-holder colnum=\"678\"/> is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</p><p>I want to be constructive in this debate and raise some points to which I want the minister to respond today. This Parliament should not be a talking shop&#8212;we need to take prominent action.</p><p>First, the proposal should be withdrawn from the planning process to allow for real and meaningful consultation with the local community and the medical staff. I reiterate that the medical staff and the patients are the people who matter. If we want to make progress in hospital care, we need to include those people in discussions about the future of their hospital.</p><p>There should be a comprehensive study into the effectiveness of a 2 acre ACAD unit. This is the future of hospital care. Will the unit be given a chance to develop if it is built on a 2 acre car park site where the secure unit might inhibit and overshadow it?</p><p>There should also be a comprehensive study of other possible sites for the secure unit. I understand from documents that I have received from the health board that 14 sites were appraised. I can exclusively reveal that some of those sites were being sold when they were being appraised. I want proper appraisals of those sites to be carried out. Organisations such as City of Glasgow Council and East Dunbartonshire Council, which were involved in the appraisal process, were not clear that they were appraising sites for a secure unit, but thought that they were being asked for an opinion on the sites. They did not realise that their opinion counted towards a final decision.</p><p>There is no clear medical evidence that a secure unit has to be placed next to a general hospital. That point has to be clinically proven before we place such a facility next to Stobhill hospital.</p><p>In question time a couple of weeks ago, I asked the minister to meet the medical staff association in the hospital. Unfortunately, she was not able to do that, but her visit to the hospital on Monday was much appreciated. However, I ask her again to meet the people who matter, such as representatives from the medical staff association, to discuss their concerns about the proposed secure unit. They are concerned that, as Dr Frank Dunn said, the secure unit will inhibit the ACAD unit from developing into a unit that will be able to serve the Glasgow North area.</p><p>The minister should also ensure that Glasgow North residents are included on the board of North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust. That serious flaw in the new merger of the hospital trusts needs to be addressed. Local trust officials have advised me that a place on the trust board has been available for some time now and they have asked me to give them some names.<place-holder colnum=\"679\"/></p><p>If trusts are serious about having local representation, they should reach out to local communities. They should not have to use me to reach out to local communities. They will make direct links with the community if they are serious about community consultation and representation.</p><p>I will finish now as I understand that a number of members want to speak. I live next to Stobhill hospital. I was born there, my wife was born there and almost all my family was born there. We feel a great link to Stobhill hospital. I am not taking this view in a NIMBY way. The leader of East Dunbartonshire Council is also opposed to the proposal. Some of his constituents stay 10 to 15 miles away from the facility. They are concerned about the future of the hospital and that the secure unit will inhibit any possible development of it. Our case is about the future of the hospital and how it will be affected by the proposal to build a secure unit.</p>", "hdate": "1999-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13211290", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Stobhill Hospital"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to acknowledge the fact that I am able to raise this issue in the Scottish Parliament.
