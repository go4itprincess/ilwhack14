VisitScotland, the Scottish Tourism Alliance and all the other organisations that are involved in the tourist industry should be highly commended for their work in maintaining such a vibrant sector during really difficult times, in making the most of people who go on staycations, and in encouraging people from the rest of these isles, and further afield, to make Scotland their destination when money is tight. They have done very well.</p><p>It is great to hear about other parts of Scotland, but members will not be surprised to hear that I will spend some time talking about my constituency in Dundee. Dundee is a city in transformation; it is changing from jute, jam and journalism to a vibrant city that hopes to attract tourists to our culture and innovative industries, and to the offer in our neighbourhood.</p><p>The key to the city&#8217;s transformation is very much the people of Dundee and their aspirations. That is encapsulated in the new V&amp;amp;A at Dundee, which will be one of the biggest tourist draws in Scotland and probably across Europe. However, when I talk about Dundee, and when Hanzala Malik talks about Glasgow, it is important that our various tourist offers should not be considered as individual attractions&#8212;they are much stronger if they are offered as a whole.</p><p>My colleague Graeme Dey talked about bringing tourists to see Glamis castle in his constituency on the back of the Disney Pixar film &#8220;Brave&#8221;. I hope that Dundee, too, will benefit, with those tourists spending some time in my constituency. As I look around the chamber, I see colleagues from other areas in which there are tourist attractions that Dundee can benefit from. Rod Campbell&#8217;s constituency contains some of the finest golf courses in Scotland; his constituents will benefit from the V&amp;amp;A, because people who come to get a bit of culture will also bring their golf clubs and head to St Andrews. Equally, when the V&amp;amp;A is established I hope that people who come to play golf at Scotland&#8217;s oldest golf courses will decide to come to Dundee too to see our taste of tourism and what we have to offer.</p><p>In order for that to happen, of course, we must have connections&#8212;between our cities, and between our cities and our urban areas. Our vision for Dundee, in terms of the waterfront redevelopment, is to ensure that when people come to our city&#8212;whether they come specifically as tourists to Dundee or are passing through&#8212;they get the best possible offer. However, it is crucial that we have links not only with St Andrews, Carnoustie and the other areas around Dundee, but with Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow.</p><p>Whenever more tourists come to Dundee, I genuinely believe that the rest of Scotland will benefit, too. The Ryder cup and the Commonwealth games will be of particular advantage to the area in which the event takes place, but if we can get the connections right and ensure that the offer we provide is a holistic one for the whole of Scotland, we can encourage tourists to spend much more time in Scotland, and we will all be winners.</p><p>Dundee&#8217;s transformation to ensure that it has an offer to compete with Edinburgh and Glasgow has been very much a partnership between Scottish National Party-led Dundee City Council, the Scottish Government and a host of local businesses that have worked to revitalise and revolutionise the heart of Dundee city centre. The important parts of that are not just the Victoria and Albert, but the transformation of the train station and so on. All that is very important.</p><p>It is a genuine shame that the same is not happening in Aberdeen, where the current Labour-Conservative coalition appears to be turning its back on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform that city. I hope that those councillors change their minds. Although I represent Dundee and it might seem that the proposals for Aberdeen would be very much to the advantage of Aberdeen city, a strong Aberdeen city is good for Dundee.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Visitor Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to take part in the debate, and it has been great to hear examples of Scotland&#8217;s offer for tourists.

I also recognise the input of Kezia Dugdale and Mark Griffin, who are no longer members of the committee but were involved in the early stages of the inquiry.</p><p>Our short-term inquiry into the living wage was held in December and January and we published our report on 3 February. We worked hard as a committee to achieve consensus, and I hope that our report helps to move the agenda forward in an informed way.</p><p>Usually, we would wait until we had received the Government&#8217;s response before we brought a debate on a committee report to the chamber, but we hope that today&#8217;s debate will feed into the Government&#8217;s response, as part of the Presiding Officer&#8217;s programme for change. Although we look forward to hearing what the minister has to say, we understand that that will not be the Government&#8217;s final response.</p><p>The aim of our inquiry was to consider the benefits of a living wage for individuals, families and communities. We looked at the introduction of the living wage by local authorities and explored the extent to which procurement can include criteria that are linked to payment of the living wage.</p><p>The living wage is intended to address in-work poverty by providing an income level that enables households to adequately provide for themselves. It is set at &#163;7.20 per hour, which is &#163;1.12 above the United Kingdom&#8217;s national minimum wage of &#163;6.08 per hour for adults. The figure of &#163;7.20 per hour, which equates to about &#163;14,000 a year, is not an arbitrary figure that was plucked out of thin air. The committee received evidence from Donald Hirsch of the centre for research in social policy at Loughborough University, who explained that the living wage is based on a calculation of the minimum income standard for the United Kingdom.</p><p>The minimum income standard is an estimate of the minimum income that households need in order to have a minimum acceptable standard of living as defined by members of the public. It is based on regular research on what the public think, and it is supported by expert knowledge. It is important to note that the standard covers needs and not wants. It is largely made up of necessities such as food and shelter, and not luxuries. However, it is also about people having what they need in order to have the opportunities and choices that are necessary to participate in society. Good examples are swimming lessons and birthday presents for children. Technically, they are not essential, but they are included in the calculation as the public consider them necessary for the normal upbringing of a child, and it could be argued that their absence is detrimental to a child&#8217;s development.</p><p>Some 550,000 adult employees in Scotland are paid less than the living wage. That is a lot of people who would benefit if the living wage was adopted. Although our inquiry focused on local government, it revealed that a higher percentage of employees in the private sector earn less than &#163;7.20 per hour&#8212;the figure is 28.1 per cent&#8212;compared with employees in the public sector, where the figure is 3.9 per cent. We also identified a disparity between men and women, with 22.6 per cent of women earning less than &#163;7.20 per hour compared with 14.6 per cent of men.</p><p>The committee heard that those 550,000 Scots largely work in sales and customer service positions or as labourers, cleaners or catering assistants. The Scottish Government has been at the forefront of implementing the living wage, and all Government staff, agency staff and national health service staff already receive it. About 15,000 private sector workers have already benefited from the adoption of the living wage, but that leaves about 18,000 directly employed staff in local government who earn less than &#163;7.20 per hour.</p><p>We heard that a number of local authorities are actively considering joining, or have recently made the decision to join, the seven councils that are already paying a living wage. I was pleased to learn that Dundee&#8217;s Scottish National Party administration has asked officers to examine its implementation in Dundee City Council.</p><p>As part of our inquiry, the committee also took evidence from the private sector, which, as I have said, employs the majority of those who are paid less than the living wage. It is fair to say that the witnesses were largely apprehensive about the living wage and raised concerns over its impact on jobs and over businesses becoming less competitive. The Confederation of British Industry Scotland went considerably further, claiming that the living wage would have a longer-term impact on local labour markets and on the affordability of service provision, and that it would have a disproportionately negative effect on young people. The committee was keen to hear the evidence base for that, but CBI Scotland did not accept the invitation to appear before the committee to answer questions on its written submission.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by thanking the committee clerks for their diligent work during the inquiry, which resulted in the important report&#8212;&#8220;Report on the Living Wage in Scotland&#8221;&#8212;that we are discussing today.

I defer to the member.</p><p>In fact, in the five years following the introduction of the minimum wage, the unemployment level in the UK fell from 6.3 per cent to 4.7 per cent. We all know that correlation is not causation, but the committee received no firm evidence that increasing wages has an adverse impact on jobs. One of the reasons for that is that greater disposable income for workers leads to increased growth, which is something that the committee looked at in considering the impact of the living wage on local economies. People at the lower end of the income scale tend to spend more of their disposable income than those at the higher end. In submissions that were received by the committee, it was generally argued that the benefits of the living wage would feed into local economies and benefit local businesses, as recipients would generally spend the extra income locally.</p><p>The committee received some positive comments on the living wage from the business sector. Perhaps tellingly, they came from London, where the living wage has been implemented successfully, with Greater London Authority staff receiving the living wage along with some 3,000 employees from the private sector, including employees at Unilever, JP Morgan and Barclays. People might think that, of course, people who work for Barclays would be paid more than the living wage, as bankers get paid huge amounts of money. However, I am not talking just about the folk at the top of those companies; I am talking about cleaners and catering staff in London receiving a minimum wage that is set at a higher level than in the rest of the UK. That has come about as a direct result of evidence from London that the introduction of the living wage makes business sense. The committee heard evidence from Transport for London that the living wage has had a positive impact on recruitment, retention, absenteeism and staff morale.</p><p>After looking at the impacts on businesses and communities, we turned back to the impact on the most important group: the individuals on low wages. Evidence that we gathered showed that a living wage would increase low-paid workers&#8217; disposable income, with a corresponding effect on their standard of living and morale. Questions were raised over the effectiveness of the living wage because of the possible loss of other benefits, including passported benefits such as free school meals. However, we were unable to find any evidence to suggest that the majority of recipients would not experience a positive outcome from receiving the living wage.</p><p>In fact, if we look at the correlation with the minimum wage, the same potential is there, but there is always the opportunity for continual assessment of passported benefits and so on to ensure that people benefit from the minimum wage. I think that we could do the same to ensure that people benefit from the living wage.</p><p>Another important facet of our inquiry was procurement. The committee heard that guidance on whether local authorities can specify payment of the living wage as a condition of the award of contracts under the European Union procurement directive is insufficiently clear. As a result, no local authorities that implement the living wage have managed to extend it and to impose such conditions in contracts. They have preferred to enter into voluntary arrangements, which are only partially successful.</p><p>That is why the committee welcomes the fact that the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment has written to the European Commission seeking clarification of the issue. It would be good to hear from the minister whether there has been any progress on securing a response, although I think that I know what the answer might be.</p><p>The report concludes that the living wage is a potential driver of preventative spending, which is at the heart of the Scottish Government&#8217;s public service reform. However, the committee accepts that it is not for the Scottish Government to determine wages in the private and voluntary sectors.</p><p>As far as local government is concerned, the committee accepts that local authorities are accountable to their electorates and not to the Parliament or the Scottish Government, and it is therefore for individual councils to decide whether to introduce the living wage.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I cannot remember that far back.

The strategy, which will be implemented in collaboration with our cities, is to be welcomed across the chamber.</p><p>It is important to recognise the good work that has been carried out by previous Administrations under the auspices of the cities growth fund which, although welcome, was restrictive in terms of what it could be used for. By rolling the cities growth fund into cities&#8217; allocations, John Swinney removed the strings on how that money could be used that had been applied by previous Administrations. The cities growth fund did not show the results that might have been expected across Scotland, but Dundee was an exception in that regard. The use of the fund to pay for our central waterfront was an excellent example of how money can be used to benefit not only the city but the city region. That was the result of a cross-party approach that should be welcomed.</p><p>Statistics such as the fact that 67 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s gross value added is generated in the six city regions demonstrate the importance of our cities in driving forward the economy and, given the current difficult economic situation, it is more important than ever that we support our cities and optimise economic growth and job creation. The cabinet secretary talked about Scotland&#8217;s six cities working together and building on their combined strengths to provide sustainable economic growth and attract large-scale private sector investment.</p><p>I look forward to the number of our cities increasing to seven, and I fully support the fair city, Perth, in its bid to be awarded city status as part of the diamond jubilee celebrations. Perth is just 22 miles from Dundee and we share many economic, social and cultural links, which I hope will be strengthened over the coming years, regardless of the decision on Perth&#8217;s city status. I certainly support Perth in its campaign.</p><p>A prime example of how a city can help to invigorate a region is the Victoria and Albert museum project in Dundee and our central waterfront redevelopment. The central waterfront project is expected to create at least 1,000 jobs over 10 years, to generate more than &#163;500 million of GVA for Scotland&#8217;s economy and to bring in an additional &#163;270 million of private sector investment. Members will be pleased to hear that the project is moving forward. As we speak, preparatory work is under way on the Tay river bed for the foundations of the V&amp;amp;A, which will be the centrepiece of our new waterfront. Yesterday, the old walkways to Tayside house came down as part of the redevelopment of the area around the museum site, and we look forward to Tayside house being demolished in the near future.</p><p>We heard yesterday that the non-Government-funded aspect of the V&amp;amp;A project has received a boost&#8212;the funding campaign has announced that &#163;5 million of private funding is expected to be in place by the end of the year. It is estimated that the V&amp;amp;A at Dundee will attract 500,000 people in its first year and 300,000 people a year thereafter, which it is clear will have a hugely positive impact on the city of Dundee, on Tayside and probably on Scotland as a whole.</p><p>Dundee currently has a strong economic base in the creative industries, such as the computer games industry, and it is a world leader in life sciences, but it has huge potential in another area that could result in a radical increase in the city&#8217;s economic output and skilled jobs base. This week, we had the announcement that one of the four enterprise zones that are to be created will be the low carbon/renewables east enterprise area, which will be formed by Dundee port in conjunction with the port of Leith.</p><p>Dundee port is already a key renewables site, and there is strong interest from manufacturing companies. The recent memorandum of understanding that was signed with Scottish and Southern Energy will ensure that Dundee is a key strategic location for the development of its technology. The creation of the enterprise zone will enable Dundee to offer incentives to attract private investors and to secure a great many good-quality engineering jobs and, of course, apprenticeships. People in Dundee are very proud of the way in which the city has moved forward with life sciences and video games, but there has been a feeling that its manufacturing base had been eroded over decades, so there is great excitement about the potential that the new renewables industry offers our city.</p><p>By working together, Dundee and Edinburgh can ensure that not just one city gets the benefit that enterprise zone status brings and that a hub is created that will be worth far more than would have been the case had the two areas worked separately.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agenda for Cities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members will not be surprised to hear that my speech will focus on my home city, Dundee.

I stand with teachers in Glasgow, just as I stand with teachers in Dundee.</p><p>This morning, I visited some of the picket lines in Dundee. Along with the Dundee East MP Stewart Hosie, I spent time talking to Public and Commercial Services Union members at the Department of Work and Pensions. They talked about their absolute disgust at the chancellor&#8217;s comments in yesterday&#8217;s autumn budget statement, which, rather than trying to defuse the situation and encourage further negotiation, rubbed salt into the wounds of workers who had already been at the knife edge of the UK Government&#8217;s austerity measures.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s much-lauded respect agenda was finally revealed as a farce when John Swinney received the ultimatum from Danny Alexander&#8212;which Willie Rennie keeps forgetting was ever written&#8212;to implement its pension changes or face further cuts in the Scottish block grant. There is no respect for the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish people. In its short time in Government, the coalition has failed to support families and businesses in Scotland. It has increased VAT and national insurance contributions and has allowed energy bills to soar, pushing thousands more into fuel poverty.</p><p>By stark contrast, the SNP Government is determined to support hard-working families in these tough economic times. Working with trade unions, it has been able&#8212;under the leadership of John Swinney in his position as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth&#8212;to offer a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies, thereby protecting some 10,000 jobs. Had the Scottish Government taken the same bully-boy approach that the UK Government has taken in bulldozing change through, those jobs would have been lost.</p><p>We have gone further than that. We have frozen the council tax since 2007. By 2016, that will have saved the average band D council tax payer &#163;1,200. We have abolished prescription charges. We have also kept Scottish Water in public hands, which has allowed us to freeze water bills for the next two years. If we had not done that, who knows what the charges would have been this year? Perhaps they would have spiralled as energy charges have done.</p><p>Our Government has taken action to protect the lowest-paid workers from increases, which the Conservative and Liberal parties have failed to do. The increases in contributions are theirs and theirs alone. Not one of the 250,000 public sector workers who are on strike today believes that those increases are anything other than a naked cash grab by the UK coalition.</p><p>It is not too late. I call on the Tories and Lib Dems to listen to the message that the public sector workers throughout the UK are sending, listen to the clear message that the Parliament is sending, back down and reverse their damaging plans.</p><p>I tell the Labour members who are listening on their laptops and smartphones that voting time is 5 pm.

It is disappointing that that has not been replicated across the chamber. For Mr McGrigor&#8217;s benefit, I will quote Brian Binley, who is the Conservative MP for Northampton South. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The Federation of Master Builders has long campaigned for a reduction in the rate of VAT on home repair, maintenance and improvement work, estimating that a five per cent cut could lead to a loss of revenue to the Government of between &#163;102 million and &#163;508 million, but deliver a ... stimulus to the economy of around &#163;1.4 billion in the first year alone. Their estimates also suggest that around 34,500 new jobs in the sector (and 81,500 jobs in the wider economy) would be created by such a measure by 2019. Hardly Plan B but it could be a nudge in the right direction.&#8221;</p><p>I encourage the Conservatives in Scotland to think again about their policy. Ruth Davidson has supported a different policy on computer games tax and has lobbied for what is best for Scotland. I encourage the Conservatives in Scotland to follow the rest of the Parliament and to support what is best for the Scottish economy, which is to reduce VAT on renovation and repairs.</p><p>It is vital that the architecture of a modern Scotland be visionary, bold and dynamic. I have listened to the speeches from around the chamber on how that is materialising in communities up and down Scotland.</p><p>I am sure that it will come as no surprise to members that I consider Dundee to be at the forefront of improving Scotland&#8217;s architecture. The waterfront development that is progressing there is one of the most exciting projects to be under way in Scotland. The waterfront is a leading example of how projects can be sustained in the long term, be of social and economic benefit to the community in which they are built and&#8212;the important bit&#8212;be environmentally friendly from the initial construction period through to the years of use.</p><p>Construction creates a carbon footprint, which must be addressed as part of any debate on construction. To mitigate that in Dundee, the jewel in the crown of our waterfront&#8212;the Victoria and Albert at Dundee&#8212;will be constructed as sustainably as possible. The building&#8217;s cladding will be made from eco-friendly compound stone, which is made from waste materials that are collected from quarries and from recycled industrial waste, such as ceramic, silica and glass fragments. That will add to the building&#8217;s sustainability.</p><p>It has been acknowledged that the architecture of individual buildings alone is only part of sustainable place making, but another aspect of the V&amp;amp;A at Dundee project that has captured Dundee&#8217;s imagination and aspirations is the potential to create a cultural centre in our city. Kengo Kuma&#8217;s design for the V&amp;amp;A is set to become our city&#8217;s focal point. In the architectural brief, the emphasis was on creating a building that adheres to 21st century environmental and sustainability regulations, and I believe that the design has achieved that.</p><p>Kengo Kuma&#8217;s design will give us not only a visually stunning building that will define the Dundee waterfront for years ahead, but a highly flexible building that is adaptable to many functions. Once the project is complete, we will have a sustainable and environmentally friendly building that creates a focal point for visitors and residents alike. The terraced and decked areas that will surround the building and their pedestrian-friendly links to other areas of the city will make for an excellent point of social interaction for Dundee and Dundonians.</p><p>The central waterfront project as a whole is expected to create at least 1,000 jobs over 10 years, to generate more than &#163;500 million for Scotland&#8217;s economy and to contribute an additional &#163;270 million of private sector investment in the project. It has been estimated that the V&amp;amp;A alone will attract some 500,000 visitors in its first year and that 300,000 will visit thereafter. That demonstrates the enormous economic potential for the city.</p><p>The project has been possible only because of Government support. I thank the cabinet secretary again for her personal support to ensure that the project proceeded, despite the difficult times.</p><p>The University of Dundee, the University of Abertay Dundee, Dundee City Council and Scottish Enterprise have all worked together to create a functional and practical community in the heart of Dundee&#8217;s waterfront, which has historically been separated from the rest of the city.</p><p>We have already had more than 15,000 people visiting and engaging in the initial exhibition of the plans for the V&amp;amp;A at Dundee and thousands more have taken part in the consultation online, making the V&amp;amp;A at Dundee the recognisable face of the waterfront redevelopment. That enthusiastic response to the consultation shows how engaged with the plans people are and it underlines just how important it is that place making and architecture are responsive to the needs of the population. Somebody said that architecture and planning should be done with communities, rather than to them. That is absolutely right and it is what we have managed in Dundee&#8212;the projects are moving forward with the people of Dundee.</p><p>I will finish by picking up on some of the points raised by Living Streets, to which Jamie McGrigor referred, which sent out an excellent briefing to members prior to the debate. One of the points that it raised was that we must invest in the walking environment and ensure that when we are place making, we create spaces that enable and encourage all pedestrians to get around. I will shortly launch a consultation to take forward proposals for a member&#8217;s bill that will build on the bill that Ross Finnie sponsored in the previous session and seek to prohibit obstructive parking, which can prevent pedestrians from accessing our public spaces. The debate has highlighted the importance of public spaces and I hope that my bill will help to ensure that all members of our society can access them freely.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654653", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy (Architecture and Place Making)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has raised a number of significant points that highlight the crucial role that architecture and place making have to play in Scotland&#8217;s economy and the Scottish people&#8217;s wellbeing.

We need to focus on that issue.</p><p>That said, I will focus on electricity generation. In Scotland, our renewables capacity is currently some 33 per cent of electricity consumption, rising to 58 per cent if we take into account capacity that has been consented or is being built. Although we have much further to go to achieve our targets, we must not underestimate what we have achieved. In comparison, England has managed to achieve only 5 per cent of consumption from renewables. We should recognise that this Parliament has made considerable progress.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s economic strategy has rightly placed green technology at the heart of economic recovery and aims to create 130,000 jobs in the renewables industry by 2020.</p><p>Dundee has a huge role to play in Scotland becoming a world leader in low-carbon technology. It is ideally placed to support the development and manufacturing of wind turbines for offshore wind farms, as it has a deep port and a skilled engineering base, and a number of key firms are already established in the city or plan to set up in it in the near future. Dundee already has a reputation for engineering success and research and has been identified by a number of key stakeholders in the renewables industry as an ideal location for them to establish their base in Scotland.</p><p>Steve Remp, of pioneering offshore wind firm SeaEnergy, recently expressed his desire to see Dundee become a master base for the renewables sector. He called the energy-rich waters around Dundee</p><p>&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s shop window to the world.&#8221;</p><p>Basque wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa recently reaffirmed its desire to set up a base in Dundee, with the promise of a &#163;127 million investment across the country and more than 200 jobs in Dundee alone.</p><p>We have heard positive noises from Mitsubishi, which has also identified Dundee as a preferred location. The Korean manufacturer Doosan is looking at Dundee as a potential site for a major plant, with plans to invest &#163;170 million in Scotland over the next 10 years in partnership with Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>A number of smaller projects are also in the works around Dundee.

SeaEnergy&#8217;s Inch Cape offshore wind farm project in the outer Firth of Tay could lead to the construction of 180 turbines, which would have an installed capacity of around 1,000MW&#8212;that is enough electricity to power 700,000 homes and exceeds the current output of Hunterston B.</p><p>A number of views have been expressed during the debate, but I think that most members would think that 180 turbines, with the associated opportunities for green jobs and for the economy, are a much better option for Scotland than a nuclear plant that would take billions of pounds of subsidy, with decades being required for decommissioning and centuries for monitoring the hazardous waste.</p><p>Alex Johnstone suggested that nuclear power is somehow carbon free. If a working nuclear power station appeared out of thin air, its fuel materialised at the site and it simply vanished at the end of its life, it could be argued that nuclear power was low carbon.

Systems should have been in place to identify the failings of care that led to the death of Mrs V, but a catalogue of errors led to treatment of her that was described as lacking in both dignity and respect. Such errors must never be allowed to happen again.</p><p>The national dementia strategy, which was published last year and driven forward by my Dundee City East colleague, Shona Robison, has addressed many of the issues that the case raised. Standards of dementia care in Tayside are being driven up; new procedures are now in place to identify failings in the wards. The news that all registered nurses in elderly medical wards will be required to attend nutritional care training, along with the introduction of dementia champions, is to be welcomed.</p><p>Last week, I met the chief executive and board chairman of NHS Tayside to find out what action had been taken in light of the Mental Welfare Commission report and to seek assurances that lessons had been learned and that the failings in the care that was received by Mrs V would not happen again.</p><p>The Mental Welfare Commission recommended specific staff training and education on treating dementia patients and addressing nutrition. I was pleased to hear that such training is taking place and that an advanced care planning training course, which is being piloted in Tayside, will be rolled out.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is about identifying areas where we can improve. Although this will be cold comfort to the family of Mrs V, lessons have been learned and standards of dementia care throughout Scotland, and in Tayside in particular, have improved since that terrible time in 2008, so all patients and relatives can be assured that high priority is being given to treating patients with dignity and respect.</p><p>I turn to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s new area of responsibility&#8212;cities. Not surprisingly, I want to talk about the city of Dundee in particular. The old image of Dundee has been left behind and the city is now well established as a global leader in life sciences and computer games. Those strengths are soon to be complemented by a strong manufacturing and development hub for renewable energy, as the Spanish company Gamesa has identified Dundee as the location for a manufacturing, logistics and maintenance base for the development of offshore wind farms.</p><p>In tandem with that manufacturing development comes the cultural development that is being spearheaded by the Victoria and Albert Museum at Dundee. The importance of that project should not be underestimated. The world&#8217;s greatest museum of art and design, the V&amp;amp;A, will establish a permanent presence outside London for the first time ever&#8212;and it will be in Dundee.</p><p>Funding for that project from the Scottish Government is in place. I thank Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, for her input and support for the project and for making sure that we could secure Government funding even in times of difficult financial pressures. That funding was crucial in enabling the V&amp;amp;A to go to the next stage and to have the confidence to encourage private backers across the world to support the project and ensure that it could go ahead. We have seen the next step of that with the announcement that the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has been appointed to head up the V&amp;amp;A&#8217;s design team to build an iconic building, which is set to become a national landmark and which will draw in tens of thousands of visitors to Dundee and Scotland.</p><p>The V&amp;amp;A is playing a big part in revitalising Dundee, which is already witnessing the generation of inward investment because of that project. The capital contribution from the Government has played a big part in getting the project off the ground. That is why I was surprised to hear Labour members making bizarre comments last week about the Government&#8217;s commitment to the project. The only threat that ever existed to the V&amp;amp;A project came from the Labour Party, when it refused to back the budget that contained the vital funding for it. That fact was not overlooked by the people of Dundee in the recent election. I am pleased that members have now united on the issue behind the V&amp;amp;A and that we can look forward to the culture of Dundee blossoming.</p><p>The SNP Government has made impressive progress on health and wellbeing in the past four years. Waiting times are at a record low, more nurses have been employed, and prescription charges have been abolished. Unfortunately, however, we have been unable to tackle one of the biggest threats to health and wellbeing in Scotland: alcohol. Minimum pricing will save lives and improve the quality of life for communities throughout Scotland. That is why I am pleased that the Government will once more introduce legislation to tackle Scotland&#8217;s alcohol problem. I know that some Opposition members have changed their minds on minimum pricing, and I welcome the Liberal Democrats&#8217; conversion. Their votes might not be as important as they would have been in the previous session, but what has happened is encouraging. It is important for us to try to build consensus in the chamber, and I hope that the Liberal Democrats&#8217; support and their preparedness to put aside party politics will be replicated across it. The issue is too important to play party politics with. I hope that we can unite and do what is best for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Philosophers and historians through the ages have often concluded that a society can best be measured by the respect and care that it gives to its most vulnerable citizens.

I hope that the session continues in that way.</p><p>Jobs and the economy were important issues in the recent election. The Scottish National Party stood on our record in government and on our vision for the future. The verdict of the Scottish people is plain for all to see in the make-up of the chamber. The SNP has taken Scotland forward over the past four years. In Scotland, under an SNP Government, the recession was shorter and shallower than in the rest of the UK. That was made possible because of the Scottish Government&#8217;s priority of investing in infrastructure, skills and support for business.</p><p>From 2008 to 2010, the SNP Government accelerated &#163;350 million of capital spending to boost the economy&#8212;something that was often questioned by Opposition members in the previous session. In 2010-11, we are spending &#163;3.3 billion on capital projects, which will support some 50,000 jobs throughout Scotland.</p><p>We have supported business. The small business bonus scheme has removed 1,424 businesses in Dundee from rates altogether. Hundreds more have seen their rates bills reduced. The Scottish Investment Bank, which the cabinet secretary mentioned earlier, is supporting SMEs throughout the country.</p><p>We have invested in skills. Last year, the Scottish Government delivered a record 20,000 modern apprenticeships. This year, we are going further by providing funding for some 25,000 modern apprenticeships. It should always be remembered that, in Scotland, modern apprenticeships are real apprenticeships attached to real jobs.</p><p>However, this is not the time for complacency. As the cabinet secretary has outlined, this re-elected SNP Government, with the largest mandate in the history of the Parliament, will do more in the years ahead to take Scotland forward and grow our economy. It will introduce a small business jobs plan to remove the barriers to employment. It will introduce a sustainable procurement bill that will clearly define the legal position for public procurement in Scotland and ensure that it is geared towards social and environmental benefits. The Government will deliver an improved export support package, with the aim of continuing the boost that our export industry has experienced recently and bringing about a 50 per cent increase in exports over the next six years.</p><p>As we are all too aware, ultimately much of our economic fate at present lies in the hands of Westminster. As we have seen historically with the demise of our heavy industries, that does not always result in what is best for the Scottish economy. It is still the case that Scotland is poorly served by a London-based economic strategy. An example that I have used previously in the Parliament, which I use again for the benefit of new members, is that of the computer games industry. Ten per cent of the UK&#8217;s computer games industry is based in Dundee. As a result, that industry is disproportionately more important to the Scottish economy than it is to the rest of the UK. The benefits of tax breaks for games development have long been established as a viable way of protecting and growing jobs in that sector. However, concessions have not been forthcoming from the UK Government, despite calls from this Parliament that cross party boundaries.</p><p>There is a clear majority understanding in this Parliament that tax breaks are important for the computer games industry.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be making my first contribution of this session on an issue that is extremely important and significant to constituents in Dundee.

The member makes a great point for full fiscal autonomy if not independence.</p><p>In an independent Scotland, the concerns and issues facing our industries would be addressed first and foremost in Scotland, for Scotland and by a Government elected by the people of Scotland. The SNP wants to give the people the choice of who will be in charge of their finances. We will argue that John Swinney is the best person to take forward Scotland&#8217;s finances. Others, on the Labour, Tory and Liberal benches, may very well argue that that person is George Osborne.

I thought that one manifesto commitment on which there was agreement between those on these benches and those on the Labour benches was on the council tax freeze, but Richard Baker perhaps suggests that there has been another flip-flop on that.</p><p>One area in which I am sure there is common ground is the need to work to improve youth employment. Young people must surely be at the heart of sustainable economic growth, and we must ensure that we create and support opportunities for them. The cabinet secretary mentioned the 100,000 training opportunities for young people, and we must ensure that we can carry them forward throughout the session.

The Finance Committee&#8217;s adviser made it clear that, although the saving from the council tax freeze is smaller for people in lower bands, it means much more to people who are on low incomes. Saving on average &#163;300 in council tax might not matter to Michael McMahon, but it matters to my constituents.</p><p>I will raise another point that the Labour Party has failed to recognise. The SNP Government has continued the work to improve housing across Scotland. Often, that involves taking people out of lower-band houses and putting them in higher-band houses. People in Ardler in my constituency have been affected by that. The community of Ardler village resided originally in multistorey flats, which were all band A. In the main, those people now live in band C housing association houses. Their incomes did not change when they moved house, but their council tax shot up. Some of those folk feel that it is unfair that they must pay much more just because they have decent houses. That is why it is crucial that, ultimately, we get rid of the council tax. However, until we get rid of it, it is crucial that we freeze it at least, to take the pain out of the sting.</p><p>I have argued for the council tax freeze in the Finance Committee and in the chamber for the past four years. I was slightly upset that I had failed to persuade our Labour colleagues in that time. All of a sudden, however, Iain Gray has made a statement, but it is clear that he has not persuaded other Labour members. It is clear that the U-turn was about fear of punishment at the ballot box. Anyone who speaks to their constituents knows just how important the extra little bit of help from the SNP Government&#8212;in the form of the council tax freeze&#8212;has been. In my constituency, I have found on the doorsteps huge support for the freeze&#8212;from people in large and small houses.</p><p>For the past four years, the Labour Party has missed the point that the council tax freeze is about ensuring that people&#8212;in these challenging economic times when bills are increasing&#8212;do not have their challenges compounded by spiralling council tax bills. Members should remember that under the previous Administration double-digit increases were the norm. Bills were rocketing. In Dundee, Labour put up the council tax by 15 per cent in one year. Fifteen per cent! I say to Michael McMahon that people&#8217;s incomes did not rise by 15 per cent that year. The Labour Party did not care about those households&#8212;in band A, band B, band C, band D and band E&#8212;that had to find the extra money.</p><p>For the past four years, the SNP has stood by the people of Scotland by freezing the council tax in these trying times. The average household in my constituency would have had to pay an extra &#163;150 this year if Labour had got away with stopping the council tax freeze in 2007.

As Malcolm Chisholm said, Andrew has always convened the finance committee in an entirely non-partisan manner. As a new MSP, I sometimes found that quite frustrating, but Andrew Welsh&#8217;s years of experience show that that is the correct way for a convener of a parliamentary committee to conduct his business. It has allowed us to make far more progress than we would have done if we put party before the Parliament at all times. I therefore associate myself with the words of members who have already spoken.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to take part in the debate, which follows one of the most important inquiries that the Finance Committee has conducted in my four years as a member. At the start of the inquiry, we were unanimous in thinking that the subject was important, and the inquiry has only made that clearer. It has also made it clear that not only will the current financial pressures make it more challenging for us to achieve a shift of funding into preventative projects, but it is becoming increasingly important that we face up to that challenge and overcome the barriers that Andrew Welsh mentioned in his opening remarks.</p><p>Preventative spending is not new. We recognise that a lot of progress has been made by the Scottish Government, building on the progress that was made by previous Administrations. Nevertheless, we must step up a gear in the next session. Although we heard of some proposals that could produce rapid results in as little as a year, most preventative spending will not see readily measurable outcomes for many years, often spanning several parliamentary sessions, as Derek Brownlee said. That is why it is vital that we approach the issue in as consensual a manner as possible, ensuring that all parties and civic Scotland as a whole buy into what we are doing to make that long-term progress. We achieved consensus on the committee and took the correct approach. We are now entering the heat of an election campaign, but I hope that we can quickly resume that consensual approach in the next session.</p><p>I will spend some time in outlining examples of preventative spending projects in Dundee, the first of which is the family-nurse partnership, which Mr Whitton mentioned. Earlier this year, Dundee and its surrounding towns and villages were chosen as the second pilot site for that specialist programme, which gives first-time teenage mums extra support. The project was piloted previously in NHS Lothian, where it supported 145 young families. It is based on a model that we have seen in progress for a number of years in America. The NHS Tayside pilot was launched in January by Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, at the St Andrew&#8217;s family support project in Dundee, where she met young mums with their babies and some of the staff who were leading the local pilot. Evidence from programmes that are already up and running in America and the Lothians show that the initiative is improving prenatal health, increasing employment among young mums, cutting the number of unintended pregnancies and helping to reduce child neglect.</p><p>Family nurses visit first-time mothers under the age of 19 every one to two weeks during their pregnancy and throughout the first two years of their baby&#8217;s life. The nurses offer guidance on child development, preventative health measures, parenting skills, breastfeeding and better diet as well as advice for mothers on education and employment. The project is a fantastic example of how dedicated support in the earliest stages not only supports parents, but helps to improve children&#8217;s health and long-term opportunities. It will make a real difference to the lives of almost 300 families throughout Tayside.</p><p>Another example of preventative spending is the keep well programme, which has been operating for a number of years, including in Dundee, and provides health checks in areas in which there is a high level of deprivation. The success of the keep well programme has been recognised and its funding has been extended by &#163;11 million to enable it to cover all of Scotland&#8217;s poorest communities by 2012, tackling some of the deprivation issues that Jeremy Purvis mentioned. The keep well programme has already helped thousands of people, and the additional funding will enable it to help a further 30,000 Scots a year to get the assistance and treatment that they need.</p><p>The recently announced life begins at 40 package of services, backed by nearly &#163;15 million, will help people approaching that landmark birthday&#8212;which I passed some years ago&#8212;to consider their lifestyle and take the opportunity to access health checks. Further, at the start of the year, the Scottish Government announced a four-year pilot project to explore the feasibility of introducing universal face-to-face heart MOTs for those who are aged over 40. That pilot should help 20,000 people, who will receive a check-up.</p><p>Those are only some of the most recent interventions. As I said, they build on the work of the present Scottish Government and its partners and on the work of the previous Scottish Executive. However, we must do much more in health, early years, social services and elsewhere. It will not be easy, but the tone of this debate gives us hope that, as a Parliament, we will be successful.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646049", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Report on preventative spending&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with the words of tribute for our convener, Andrew Welsh.

I hope that they will find the debate interesting.</p><p>In Scotland we are lucky to have four permanent hubs, which are dedicated to furthering engagement with and enthusiasm for science among people of all ages and in all sectors. Our science centres play an increasingly important role in Scotland. They are no longer just a day out; they are part of the curriculum for excellence, they are inspected by Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education and they provide support for teachers, trainee teachers, pupils and professional scientists.</p><p>In the limited time that I have, I will concentrate on the work of the Sensation science centre in Dundee. I am sure that members who have better local knowledge of the other three centres will update us on the good work that is going on there.</p><p>Sensation has been open since 2000 and its interactive exhibitions&#8212;which focus on the life sciences and, in particular, the senses&#8212;attracted 60,000 visitors last year. Dundee is a global hub for life science research and collaborations with the college of life sciences at the University of Dundee ensure that exhibits pique the interest of tomorrow&#8217;s researchers.</p><p>Getting young people excited about and interested in science is one of Sensation&#8217;s key roles. As part of that ambition, the centre will hold a meet-the-scientists event on 25 and 26 February. It will involve scientists from the University of Abertay Dundee and the University of Dundee explaining research processes and their latest discoveries to school-age children. Topics will range from breeding potatoes and how to make the perfect chip, to dentistry and psychology. The event will focus on the exciting aspects of scientific discovery.</p><p>The science centres aim to educate not only children; there is something for all ages. Tonight, Sensation holds a free speed-dating event as part of its reclaim series. Those who attend will chat over the glow of the Bunsen burner and perform scientific experiments while meeting new friends.</p><p>That is one example of how our science centres are constantly evolving and are committed to engaging the whole community with science. However, Dundee is taking that even further with the science learning institute run by Sensation, which is the first of its kind in Scotland.</p><p>The Dundee Science Centre science learning institute was launched in September last year as a collaborative approach to providing support and development for the many professionals who engage with learners throughout the community. The aim of the programme is to create a culture of curiosity, confidence and engagement with scientists within and across communities. In collaboration with the University of Dundee school of education, social work and community education and with Dundee College, the institute provides high-quality and interprofessional training for practising teachers and those in further and higher education, as well as research scientists, museum educators and community educators.</p><p>So far, some 200 adults have taken part in the various programmes that are on offer. Two teachers in residence have completed six-month placements and, working with science centre staff and university scientists, developed loan boxes and support materials to take back to the classroom, thereby ensuring that Tayside pupils have access to cutting-edge curriculum for excellence resources. The aim is that, by June, more than 300 adults will have taken part in the programmes.</p><p>I thank the Scottish Government for its support for Dundee Science Centre and all Scotland&#8217;s science centres.

It is easy to come up with lots of ideas about how to spend money but if we want to be credible we need to say what we would cut in its place. That is what the Labour Party has failed to do today. Perhaps that is no surprise. As Kenny Gibson pointed out earlier, two thirds of the cuts that we are having to grapple with in the budget were planned by the previous Labour Government&#8212;cuts that Alistair Darling said would be deeper and tougher than those imposed by Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>In spite of the challenges of such an unprecedented cut to funding, there is still some good news. I hope that the whole Parliament will join me in welcoming the commitment to funding for the Victoria and Albert museum at Dundee, which is a major step towards completion of the project and is crucial to securing the remaining investment and allowing the project to move forward at full speed. I hope that members have the opportunity to visit the exhibition, which is still in the Parliament&#8217;s main hall. Inward investment is already being stimulated in Dundee, where there is a positive uplift to our local economy on the back of the V and A project.</p><p>The budget also aims to continue the council tax freeze that has been so important in helping households through these challenging times. For the fourth year running, there will not be an increase of a single penny in households&#8217; council tax bills. In the first four years of the SNP Government, bills have been frozen, whereas in the last four years of the Lib-Lab Administration, bills in Dundee increased by 11 per cent.</p><p>A band D household in Dundee would be paying an extra &#163;150 this year if there was no freeze. We must remember that that saving has to be added to the money that was saved in previous years&#8212;money that the Labour Party would have us remove from the pockets of pensioners and other hard-pressed householders.</p><p>The assumption in those figures is that, without the council tax freeze, the increase would be roughly in line with inflation. We heard earlier about the 60 per cent rise throughout Scotland, but if we look back, we can see that once that can of worms is opened, the sky&#8217;s the limit when it comes to Labour&#8217;s determination to squeeze council tax payers.</p><p>Between 1997 and 2007, the council tax in Dundee went up by a staggering 51 per cent. The worst year in that period was 1997-98, when the Labour council slammed the council tax up by 14.9 per cent in one year. It is no wonder that Labour lost two thirds of its councillors in the 1999 council elections as the SNP trebled our representation.</p><p>There is one group to which a few pounds does not make a great deal of difference: the large supermarkets. As we have heard, provisional figures indicate that Tesco would be the largest contributor through the Government&#8217;s proposed increase in business rates, paying some &#163;8.5 million annually. That needs to be considered in the context of the &#163;3.4 billion pre-tax profits declared by the company last year; it does not seem unreasonable that Tesco should contribute a little bit more.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 5) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the stage 1 debate on the budget, and what we have to do today is to provide a balanced budget.

My great-great-grandfather, Thomas FitzPatrick, was an Irish immigrant who came to Scotland with his mother as a boy some time between the early 1860s and the early 1870s. My great-great-grandmother, Mary-Anne McKelvie, arrived in Dundee with both her parents from County Cavan. She met Thomas, and they were married in the city's St Andrew's Roman Catholic chapel in 1879.</p><p>Many families in Dundee share a similar story, as can be seen in the way that parts of the Lochee area of the city are affectionately known as Little Tipperary. My ancestors did not move to Lochee, however. After getting married, Thomas and Mary-Anne are reported in the 1881 census as living in West Henderson's Wynd, which is the location of Dundee's Verdant Works, the last working jute mill in Scotland. Jute mills such as the Verdant Works drew large numbers of Irish families to Dundee.</p><p>Irish immigrants started arriving in Dundee around 1825, with workers skilled in textiles arriving from Donegal, Monaghan, Sligo and Tyrone. By 1855, before my ancestors had arrived, there were already 14,000 Irish people residing in Dundee. About 71 per cent of Dundee's <place-holder colnum=\"32105\"/> Irish-born workforce was female, and it was those skilled textile workers who helped to establish Dundee as an industrial powerhouse. Close examination of the census data for 1881 and 1891 shows that that was the case with my ancestors, with Mary-Anne described first as a jute preparer and then as a jute spinner, and Thomas described as a stone-breaker. Many men in Dundee would have been described as stone-breakers; the affectionate term that a lot of women had for them was \"kettle bilers\"&#8212;in Dundee, it was the women who made the money for families, in the main.</p><p>Irish immigrants in Dundee, like in Glasgow, made a significant contribution to our city and to our country over the years. William McGonagall, Scotland's second-best-known poet, was the son of Irish parents who worked in the jute mills of Dundee. James Connolly, that great proponent of self-determination, lived in the city during 1898, and became involved in the local political scene.</p><p>The city's sports have been heavily influenced by the Irish population, Dundee United having played originally as Dundee Hibernian until 1923. My ancestors followed a different team with an Irish past, however. The local paper of Saturday 21 May 1938 records that my great-great-grandfather died aged 80, perhaps overexcited at seeing his team, the Lochee Harp, take the lead in the Telegraph cup semi-final.</p><p>The number of new Irish immigrants to Dundee has perhaps declined over the years, but Dundee is experiencing a new wave of Irish visitors, as many students from all parts of Ireland choose our city to study in. Many of them decide to stay in our city after their studies are complete.</p><p>Like many cities in Scotland, Dundee enjoys a richer culture as a result of the contribution of Irish immigrants. We are rightly proud of our heritage, and I thank Bob Doris for giving us the opportunity to put that on record tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21176028", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Irish Diaspora"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to Bob Doris on securing today's members' business debate.

This is a topic of huge importance and relevance at this time.

Nuclear weapons are designed with one purpose, which is to kill large civilian populations. We cannot hide from the fact that a nuclear weapon is a bomb, not a deterrent. They are weapons of mass destruction.<place-holder colnum=\"31432\"/></p><p>Governments have rightly argued that weapons such as landmines are immoral and should be banned under international law because of their detrimental effect on civilian populations. The international community finds unacceptable the image of a young child in Cambodia who has lost a limb as a result of a landmine, but it is apparently acceptable that the girl and her baby brother, parents and grandparents, and everyone whom the family has ever met, should be obliterated in a nuclear explosion.</p><p>As we heard from Bill Kidd, that might be the UK Government&#8217;s view, but it is certainly not the Scottish people&#8217;s view. Two-thirds of Scots oppose the renewal of Trident. The average Scot is concerned that, at a time when we face the largest cuts in public spending since the 1920s, spending &#163;100 billion on weapons of mass destruction is not just immoral, but is economically unjustifiable.</p><p>Nuclear weapons have only one purpose: to kill large numbers of civilians. They have been no use to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it could be argued that by diverting money that could have been used to support the military on the front line they potentially cause the deaths of UK soldiers.</p><p>Nuclear weapons are no use as a deterrent, as Commander Robert Green pointed out in his book, &#8220;Security Without Nuclear Deterrence&#8221;, in which he drew on his knowledge as an operator of British nuclear weapons to make the case that such weapons would not deter a nuclear first strike. The rationale of deterrence enthusiasts is that we would be safer if every state had nuclear weapons, because there would be a balance and every nation would be afraid to use its bombs, for fear of retaliation. If nuclear weapons would make the world safer, it seems odd that NATO&#8217;s nuclear powers are so concerned about the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.</p><p>The deterrence argument is nonsense; fewer weapons, not more weapons, will make the world safer. I wonder whether any member thinks that New Zealand&#8217;s decision to declare the country a nuclear weapons-free zone has made it more likely to suffer a nuclear or other attack than it would have been if it had invested in a nuclear weapons programme.</p><p>The majority of Scots are against nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. A move to register Scotland with the UN as a single-state nuclear weapons-free zone would be an important expression of Scots&#8217; views and would send a clear signal to the Westminster Government that it should not spend &#163;100 billion of our money on new nuclear weapons.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137589", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Weapons-free Zones"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bill Kidd for securing today&#8217;s debate.

However, the support today for Patricia Ferguson's bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to taking the matter further to ensure the best protection for residents. As Bob Doris said, the work that has gone into putting together the voluntary accreditation scheme will not be wasted. I hope that it will feed into Patricia Ferguson's bill at stage 2 and, perhaps, beyond.</p><p>The bill aims to improve the position of those who are dissatisfied with their factor and Patricia Ferguson must be congratulated on introducing it.</p><p>I will use an example from Dundee to demonstrate why we need to establish a system of statutory registration for all property factors and an alternative means of resolving factoring disputes. I am sure that the situation will be all too familiar to members from experiences in their constituencies.</p><p>Panmurefield village in Dundee is in the constituency of my colleague Shona Robison. It is a new-build estate of 71 properties that has its open spaces managed by a property manager. Residents were charged &#163;80 or &#163;120 a year by the factor for the upkeep of the common spaces, and it was not long before problems started to emerge, such as the lack of maintenance work or sub-standard work being done. Members will be aware that the Local Government and Communities Committee has been presented with a raft of similar complaints from across Scotland.</p><p>After repeated attempts to rectify the situation with the factor, the residents formed an association and householders united to force the property factor to give up its role of manager of the common ground. One would have thought that that would have been the end of the situation but, despite losing the contract, the property factor continued to issue bills to residents and threatened to send sheriff's officers to enforce payment. That caused great distress, particularly among elderly members of the community, and it took a civil court ruling before the demands for payment stopped.</p><p>The residents have now awarded the management contract to Dundee contract services, which has highlighted just how much they were being overcharged by the previous <place-holder colnum=\"31318\"/> factor. As most people probably know, Dundee contract services is a contracting arm of Dundee City Council. It maintains the city's open spaces and competes with the private sector to provide building services such as common ground maintenance. As a result of changing their property factor, residents in Panmurefield village have seen their annual bill fall from an average of &#163;110 to less than &#163;20 a household.</p><p>The residents of Panmurefield village were lucky that the size of their community made it less difficult to change their factor than it would have been if the common ground had been owned and maintained by a land management company such as the infamous Greenbelt Group.</p><p>The committee and other members have highlighted a number of issues that warrant further consideration at stage 2 and beyond. I hope that the consensus that has been expressed in the chamber today will continue so that the bill will be supported not only tonight, but at stage 2 and stage 3, so that it can become law.

Doing that would put at risk projects such as the &#163;1.25 billion schools for the future programme that is delivering 55 schools across Scotland, including the rebuild of Harris academy in my constituency. The education establishment in Dundee was absolutely delighted to have the intervention of the Scottish Futures Trust, which ensured that the proposals for Harris academy are now far more ambitious than had been thought possible originally. The SFT has added real value to a project that is very important to that long-standing school in my constituency.

The computer games industry is a prime example of why we in Scotland are missing out as a consequence of economic policy that must benefit the UK as a whole rather than Scotland. The industry has been highly successful in Scotland over the past two decades and is disproportionately important to the Scottish economy, with 10 per cent of the total UK industry based in Dundee.

Without it, there is a serious danger that we will lose both money and jobs, which is a particular shame.</p><p>Tax breaks for the computer games industry would be self-funding, protecting existing jobs and generating new graduate jobs and extra investment for our economy. However, despite the sector's importance to the economy, not &#163;1 of tax relief has ever been paid out, in spite of the good words that we heard from the previous Labour Government towards the end of its term.</p><p>The computer games industry in Dundee is supported by the Scottish Government in those areas where it has a remit. In particular, the Scottish Government has ensured that the industry has the best graduates in the world. Graduates from the University of Abertay Dundee are so good and well trained that companies from across the globe, especially Canada, come to Dundee to cherry pick some of the best people in the business. We need to ensure that that talent remains in Scotland and Dundee.</p><p>Members may not be surprised to hear that I also have a particular interest in the life sciences sector, which is important to Dundee and to <place-holder colnum=\"31153\"/> Scotland. The news that the UK Government is to go ahead with plans for a patent box is welcome. Scotland is truly a global leader in life sciences. I hope that the sector-specific tax break for pharmaceuticals and the biotechnology industry will have a positive effect on investment in Scotland. It is important that, when people get it right, we acknowledge that.</p><p>However, the current constitutional set-up means that sometimes people get it right and sometimes they get it wrong. We need a constitutional set-up that ensures that we make the decisions and that those decisions are always made in the interests of Scotland. The solution is straightforward: the best basis on which to make decisions for the Scottish economy is for those decisions to be made in Scotland, with Scottish interests at the forefront, rather than as an afterthought. Full fiscal powers for the Scottish Parliament would ensure that we developed Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. We look forward to the day when the Parliament has all the powers that are necessary successfully to manage and support Scotland's economy.</p><p>Dundee used to be known as the city of the three Js: jute, jam and journalism.

Due to the SNP Government's economic recovery plan, the recession has been shallower and shorter in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The total fall from peak to trough in Scotland as a result of the downturn was 5.8 per cent&#8212;lower than the comparable drop in the UK of 6.4 per cent.</p><p>The most recent figures available for the economy, from the second quarter of this year, show that the SNP's economic recovery plan is continuing to work. GDP in Scotland grew by 1.3 per cent compared with growth of 1.2 per cent in the UK. The Scottish construction sector also grew by a massive 10.4 per cent over the quarter, and there was an increase of 2.5 per cent in the production sector. Both outperformed the UK as a whole.</p><p>I am not saying that everything is rosy&#8212;it is not and these are difficult times&#8212;but our Government's decisions are clearly the correct ones and make best use of our limited powers.</p><p>In recent times, the Labour Party has been more concerned with scoring cheap political points than doing what is best for the people of Scotland. Voting the budget down is an example of that, but the latest politicking comes in the form of demanding that a budget be published within hours of the UK spending review announcement.</p><p>Originally, Labour demanded that a budget be produced even before the Scottish Government had the figures, but that was quickly changed to a demand that John Swinney should produce a budget the way that Iain Gray does, with a raft of uncosted commitments that bear no relation to reality. That is good for headlines but not for the families and businesses of Scotland. Labour might be willing to do a budget on the back of a fag packet but, thankfully, John Swinney is more meticulous.</p><p>The SNP Government has made clear some of the measures for which it will seek support: a council tax freeze; maintaining free personal care <place-holder colnum=\"29996\"/> and concessionary travel; keeping Scottish Water under public ownership; applying Barnett consequentials from health to the health service; and abolishing prescription charges.</p><p>I am hopeful that Labour will start to make amends for years of wasteful spending on trams, Trident and the private finance initiative but, if today's debate is anything to go by, we can expect it to continue peddling its negative message of doom spun together with uncosted commitments while we in the SNP continue working with the Scottish people to get through the hard times.

This year, some 435 recipes for healthy sandwiches were submitted from throughout Tayside, and 12 finalists were invited to the food festival to make their own sandwiches. Nine-year-old Lewis Walker from Pitlochry primary school took the coveted title with his creation, the Chicken Licken pitta. I am sure that we are all waiting for next year's Turkey Lurkey sequel.</p><p>As we heard from the cabinet secretary, we are on the way to growing Scotland's food and drink sector to &#163;12.5 billion per annum by 2017, and Dundee is playing its part in that.

All of Scotland has to be a part of that.</p><p>Members might not be aware of Dundee Cold Stores Ltd, which supplies locally grown vegetables to all the major brands throughout the UK and is Scotland's only large-scale frozen fruit and vegetable plant. The service that it provides, which ensures that products go from the field to the freezer within 150 minutes, is particularly important for beans and peas, and it has led to one in six of all peas that are consumed in the UK being produced in Dundee. That is thanks to a grant of more than &#163;500,000 from the Scottish Government's food processing, marketing and co-operation grants scheme.</p><p>The company is continuing to expand and it is making big inroads into frozen food markets throughout the UK. It is also taking steps to become more energy efficient and plans to reduce its carbon footprint and increase its market competitiveness by erecting an 850KW commercial-scale wind turbine at the factory. The turbine could generate 20 per cent of the company's annual energy needs. It sets a great example to food producers in the area and it will make the company's peas greener without the need to add E numbers.</p><p>It would be remiss of me to talk about food without touching on the Scottish Crop Research Institute, which, although not in my constituency, is close to it and employs a number of my constituents. The SCRI is one of the leaders of research into producing new varieties of crops and the bulk of what comes out of its research is done using non-genetic techniques to make sure that we continue with Scotland's proud record of being a GM-free food producer.</p><p>The food and drink sector plays a vital role in our economy and Scottish food and drink fortnight provides an ideal opportunity to showcase and promote the world-class produce that we have.

Transitional relief would work both ways: it would mean that businesses that have been assessed as paying too much would continue to pay too much, which cannot be right.

I, too, thank all the witnesses, the minister and our clerks, who have done a fantastic job. I was sometimes taken back to my days as a Dundee City Council councillor serving on the development quality committee. I assure everybody who has been involved in the process that all members of the Forth Crossing Bill Committee took the same quasi-judicial approach in our deliberations. We put aside party politics and constituency interests. The committee may have been small, but I hope that we addressed all the issues of concern about the building of a new Forth crossing.</p><p>As the convener of the Forth Crossing Bill Committee has stated, the evidence that we received led us to conclude that an additional Forth crossing is needed, and we supported the bill in principle. The current Forth road bridge is operating at six times its original capacity and at double its design capacity. That, coupled with cable erosion, has led to a shortening of its expected lifespan of 100 years. In the evidence sessions, we heard that the load factor of the bridge is currently 2.1, which is, of course, within the safety margins of 2.0. However, with the traffic load increasing and uncertainty remaining about the degree of deterioration in the cables, the committee heard that it may be necessary to remove heavy goods vehicles from the bridge by 2016. It was clear from that and other evidence that we received that doing nothing was not an option. Doing nothing would seriously jeopardise commerce on both sides of the Forth and throughout Scotland.</p><p>That said, we had to ensure that a balance was struck between the importance of constructing a new bridge and the disruption that doing so would cause to local residents. The committee undertook the important role of considering objections to the proposed bridge and the accompanying road infrastructure, which provided an opportunity for the public to become involved in the bill process. I thank those who made representations to the committee either orally or in writing. Given the personal nature of some of the objections, I hope <place-holder colnum=\"26566\"/> that the committee gave them the consideration that they deserve.</p><p>Many of the objections that the committee received from members of the public and local authorities concerned the code of construction practice. I am pleased that many of the committee's recommendations and concerns about that were addressed by the minister in his response to the stage 1 report. If the bill continues to the next stage, we will continue to consider the objections, and will again impartially consider evidence from objectors and the Government.</p><p>On being appointed to the committee, we learned that there would be an excursion to a construction site.

However, as we have already heard, the estimated cost of the bridge itself is just over a quarter of that, at &#163;543 million, which is roughly in line with the costs of other bridges in Europe, such as the Vasca da Gama bridge in Portugal, the &#216;resund bridge and the Storebaelt bridge.

In those discussions, the minister made clear that the total costs of the project have been factored into the &#163;2 billion estimate, so it includes VAT; the cost of capital to the Government; an allowance for risk and optimism bias; and an additional amount for a median estimate of <place-holder colnum=\"26567\"/> construction inflation. The cost of the current proposal is a substantial saving on the original estimate of &#163;3.2 billion to &#163;4.2 billion. We must commend the team that made that saving.

The choice of that model coupled with funding from the Government's capital budget is the correct one. Other funding options were examined but, when the package was being considered, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find finance for public-private partnership or non-profit-distributing models or similar contracts.

NFLA also campaigns against nuclear new-build and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p><p>I am against new nuclear power for two reasons: first, we do not need it and secondly, we cannot afford it. On the first point, last year Scotland generated about 50,000 gigawatt hours of energy. As that far exceeded demand, just under 20 per cent of that energy was exported to England and Northern Ireland. At present, 24 per cent of the electricity consumed in Scotland comes from renewables. The figure is growing year on year and we are on track to hit the Scottish Government's targets of 31 per cent by 2011 and 50 per cent by 2020.</p><p>Scotland's two working nuclear power stations generate around 30 per cent of its total electricity production. The decommissioning dates for Hunterston B and Torness are expected to be around 2016 and 2023 by which time, the figures suggest, renewables will have not only filled the gap but ensured that Scotland continues to be a net exporter. For the record, I am not suggesting that existing nuclear power stations should be closed before their natural lifespan runs out.</p><p>The figures for Scotland's renewable potential are truly staggering. For example, its potential to generate electricity from renewables has been estimated at 60GW. Given that that is more than 10 times what we need, there is huge potential to export green energy.</p><p>My second reason for not supporting new nuclear power is that we cannot afford it. We simply cannot afford to divert funds away from the progress that we are making in harnessing Scotland's renewables potential. Scotland is leading the world on measures to tackle climate change and, with our natural resources, we can be at the forefront of renewable technology and reap the benefits of exporting our expertise to the world.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will talk about subsidies later and quote the United Kingdom minister with responsibility for the area.

In my Dundee West constituency, we can see both the potential of green jobs and the threat posed by investing in nuclear power rather than renewables. Dundee port is well placed as a hub for the construction and maintenance of offshore wind turbines and the <place-holder colnum=\"25797\"/> investment that the Scottish Government is putting in to offshore renewables is providing a major opportunity for companies in the city. It is estimated that over the next 10 years more than &#163;15 billion will be spent on offshore wind turbines and the potential for companies in Dundee and throughout Scotland to supply the European market is vast. To do that, however, we must continue to keep our global lead in new technology. A shift of money and focus away from renewables to nuclear would mean missing out on the opportunity to export skills and goods to Europe and the rest of the world. We cannot afford to waste billions on new nuclear, as we are already paying the price of a costly legacy.</p><p>Nuclear is the most expensive way in which to produce electricity. To respond to the point that members of pro-nuclear parties have made, I point out that, in 2008, the then UK business secretary, John Hutton, conceded that no nuclear plant had been built anywhere in the world without public money. We must consider the full costs of nuclear plants. The cost of decommissioning alone is more than the value of the electricity that plants generate over their lifetime. The cost of the Chapelcross clean-up is estimated at &#163;1.4 billion and the site will not be available for re-use until 2128. The clean-up at Dounreay will cost more than &#163;3 billion. So we do not need it and we cannot afford it.</p><p>It is clear that Scotland's renewable potential, coupled with the Scottish people's opposition to nuclear, provides a clear mandate against new nuclear energy. The Parliament needs control over our energy policy to make the most of the potential and to reap the benefits in jobs and tax revenue from a successful renewables industry. Any investment in new nuclear would be a step backwards and would be hugely damaging to Scottish jobs and our carbon footprint.

However, from the tone of today's debate, I think that we are all clear that regeneration is a priority for communities throughout Scotland and for us as elected politicians&#8212;and that it is even more so in the challenging times of a recession.</p><p>Last year, after a slight hiccup, the Parliament came together to set up the town centre regeneration fund, through which millions of pounds have been invested in communities to help shake off the recession. We cannot overstate the benefits of regeneration at such an important time. Last August, for example, community members in Lochee in my constituency welcomed the allocation of &#163;2 million from the town centre regeneration fund to bring new life to the town's High Street. I thank the minister and his officers for that decision, which, as well as allowing structural improvements to be made, has allowed community partners to engage in new projects to rejuvenate Lochee.</p><p>More important, the money from the fund has complemented the previous efforts of active community members who had until then been constrained by a lack of financial resources. With the support of the Scottish Government and Dundee City Council, Lochee High Street is in the process of being revitalised; much-needed repairs and refurbishment are being carried out; and steps to make residential areas safer have been <place-holder colnum=\"24163\"/> introduced. Regeneration efforts in Lochee have strengthened not only the High Street's physical structures but the local community, and the emphasis on partnership working and economic, social and environmental benefits is paying big dividends.</p><p>Dundee has a long way to go before it fulfils its full potential. However, that potential is enormous, and the waterfront project aims to capitalise on that. The Scottish Government's &#163;33 million investment in the waterfront regeneration project can create 3,500 new permanent jobs and generate &#163;2.6 billion for our economy. Although the current SNP council is taking forward those ambitious plans, it is continuing the previous administration's good work and, in line with the tone of the debate, credit should go where credit is due.</p><p>The process of regenerating Dundee's waterfront started back in 1986, with the return of RRS Discovery and the launch of the city of discovery campaign, which has been quite successful in turning round the city's fortunes. In its new one city, many discoveries campaign, Dundee is looking back at its past while looking forward to the new technologies that are becoming increasingly important to its economic future.</p><p>Dundee's waterfront remains key to the city's regeneration. The jewel in the crown of the waterfront project will be the Victoria and Albert museum in Dundee, which the Scottish Government is working towards jointly with Dundee City Council, Dundee's two universities and other partners. An international competition is under way to find a design team to create an iconic building near RRS Discovery. It is hoped that that building will be set not only next to RRS Discovery, but on the Tay, and that it will be an iconic building on the waterfront for people from Fife, who will see it as they go across the bridges, as well as within the city. The Victoria and Albert museum in Dundee will potentially generate 900 jobs, and it has been estimated that it will bring in 130,000 visitors to Dundee every year. That will be a huge boost to the Scottish economy as well as to Dundee's economy. It will tie into the other cultural centres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow and really make Scotland a global cultural place to visit.</p><p>As well as investing in the waterfront, the Scottish Government has been doing a lot of other work with Dundee City Council and other partners to help Dundee to recover. There is &#163;22 million for a new swimming and leisure centre, and there are five new primary schools. The refurbishment of Harris academy in the next few years has been approved. Those things will help to protect vital construction jobs in Dundee and the surrounding area.<place-holder colnum=\"24164\"/></p><p>Communities throughout Scotland have seen job losses over the past two years because of the recession. Scotland appears to have suffered less than the rest of the UK, but our regeneration efforts must focus on job creation. The Parliament's world-leading climate change legislation represents a huge opportunity for our communities to create jobs. Forth Ports, Scottish Enterprise and Dundee City Council are working together in Dundee to take advantage of the growing renewables markets and to use the port as a location for offshore turbine manufacturing and maintenance. Such opportunities are being grasped not only in Dundee, but in several locations throughout Scotland. The prize is big enough for us all to share. With the loss of manufacturing jobs in Dundee as a result of the closure of NCR's manufacturing base, that could prove to be a real and sustainable alternative outlet for our highly skilled engineering workforce. Scottish companies in the offshore wind turbines industry have the potential to supply the European market, and the construction of renewables sector hardware in Dundee is an opportunity that must not be lost.</p><p>Regeneration must be about more than just buildings; it must be about communities, and it must provide sustainable benefits on multiple levels.</p><p>I am pleased to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20662587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The chamber has witnessed a few heated debates and it is fair to say that from time to time members have opposing views on various matters.

To put it in context, if the expenditure that is allocated for Trident's replacement were transferred to public sector jobs, Scotland's share would amount to 4,000 firefighters, 4,000 nurses and 2,000 junior doctors. Come on, what are the Labour Party's priorities: weapons of mass destruction or front-line services?</p><p>The budget that Labour is keen to see fail involves &#163;1 billion investment in Scotland's transport infrastructure; &#163;2 billion investment in higher and further education and skills, including modern apprenticeships; &#163;1.65 billion on housing and regeneration over the spending review period; the small business bonus scheme; &#163;10 million for the marine renewables sector; &#163;150 million over three years for the zero waste programme; further funding to allow councils to freeze the council tax for another year; &#163;1.5 billion through the Scottish rural development programme; and, of course, &#163;2 million for a boiler scrappage scheme for which members of the Labour Party called.</p><p>That is what new Labour would vote against. Businesses and families throughout Scotland will be relieved that not all parties hold them in contempt like the Labour Party does. I am hopeful that the rest of the Parliament will come together to face up to the financial and economic challenges and to produce a budget that will protect front-line services and assist economic recovery.

On the one hand, the leader of the Labour Party on the west coast, Steven Purcell, argues for more money for GARL. On the other, the leader of the Labour Party on the east coast, Iain Gray, yesterday called in <em>The Courier </em> for extra resources for Tayside. Andy Kerr cannot explain where the Labour Party expects to get those extra resources from, particularly when we are facing an &#163;814 million reduction in the budget that the Parliament expected.</p><p>It was only a year ago that Labour was vilified by the public for playing politics with people's livelihoods by obstructing the budget, but the party appears to have learned no lessons. We now find ourselves in a similar position to the one we were in last year, with the Labour Party still threatening to oppose a budget that it is unable or unwilling to challenge even one penny of. That is not the stuff of constructive opposition under any circumstances, let alone as we try to recover from a recession. We heard from Jeremy Purvis how the recession is impacting on real people out there in the real world.</p><p>Labour's tacit consent throughout the committee stage appears to have been forgotten&#8212;much like Andy Kerr's promise to engage constructively last <place-holder colnum=\"22886\"/> year&#8212;and again families and businesses throughout Scotland could suffer as a result.</p><p>It would, of course, be great if we had additional money. However, as Westminster has made clear, spending is being cut, and we are limited by the current devolved settlement. As Margo MacDonald alluded to, the lack of full fiscal powers leaves us fighting with one arm tied behind our back. Labour Party members must accept that they are members of the party that is imposing these cuts&#8212;a party that places more importance on weapons of mass destruction than on avoiding cuts to front-line services.</p><p>I will now address what is in the budget. It is a budget that will support our schools and hospitals and help businesses and families through the recession. Measures such as the continuation of the council tax freeze and the small business bonus will continue to support families and businesses through the recession. I am particularly pleased that this year, for the first time, not only will the council tax be frozen but people's water rates will also be frozen so that folk know exactly what they will have to pay next year. I encourage every council in Scotland to use the resources that have been made available by the cabinet secretary to freeze their council tax&#8212;that is what the people of Scotland expect.</p><p>There is an increase in the front-line education budget and a 2.7 per cent increase for health, including an extra &#163;16 million for NHS Tayside. There is funding for local government to support the business gateway and funds to support students through the recession. The budget also commits an extra &#163;10 million for renewables projects, and there is an increase of &#163;3 million in the international development budget.</p><p>This year, the public finances face major challenges, but the majority of members of the Parliament have been constructive in their approach to shaping the budget. As we move on in the next two weeks, there is still time for further debate. I understand that both the Conservative party and the Liberal party have not yet said they will support the budget at stage 3 and that they still have more i's to dot and more t's to cross, but at least they are coming forward with suggestions and proposals. The Labour Party is simply carping with a shopping list that does not accept the fiscal reality.</p><p>The people of Scotland expect members in the chamber to pull together to get the best budget&#8212;they expect nothing less of their politicians. Given the difficult circumstances, the Scottish Government and John Swinney have done the best job that they could in bringing forward this budget. They have taken difficult decisions to protect front-line services and sustain jobs. We must work collectively to agree a Scottish budget <place-holder colnum=\"22887\"/> for next year that meets the needs of the people of Scotland.

With record levels of Government debt, the only good news for the chancellor was the increase in expected North Sea revenues for 2010-11. I guess that there is a union dividend.</p><p>Historically, UK budgets have caused traditional industries in Scotland to suffer, but it is now industries that use emerging technologies, such as our successful computer games industry, that are being affected. The absence from the PBR of a vital research and development tax break for the computer games industry will stunt growth and put jobs at risk in a sector that is particularly important to my constituency in Dundee.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, virtually every industry expert has championed tax relief on research and development for computer games, but the Labour chancellor refused to take the necessary action to safeguard jobs and allow that important sector to compete on a level playing field with countries such as France and Canada. The recent report by the Independent Games Developers Association&#8212;TIGA&#8212;showed that such tax relief would create jobs and boost revenue, so its omission from the PBR is hard to fathom. TIGA's report clearly set out the benefits that would be gained by the industry from the proposed tax break, which in the case of Dundee could create 350 graduate-level jobs over the next five years and generate &#163;45 million of extra investment. The report also laid out what would happen in what we thought would be the unlikely event that no action was taken on tax breaks for the computer games industry. It indicated a potential loss of 200 jobs in Dundee over the next five years. That is a worrying possibility.</p><p>As well as protecting existing jobs and creating new opportunities, the tax measure in question was estimated to be self-funding. TIGA's figures show that, over five years, the measure would cost about &#163;192 million but would deliver &#163;415 million in extra tax receipts. Those arguments have never <place-holder colnum=\"22212\"/> been challenged by the chancellor or other UK ministers. At a time when the largest games employer in Dundee, which last year continued to employ new graduates, is considering relocating to a more favourable tax regime to ensure that it can continue to be profitable, the omission from the PBR of tax relief on research and development for computer games is extremely disappointing to the industry.</p><p>Dundee is home to some of the world's best-selling games, from Lemmings to Grand Theft Auto, and, proportionately, the industry is worth twice as much to the Scottish economy as it is to the UK economy. I am not suggesting that the chancellor is a malicious man; I am simply suggesting that the measure was not important enough at a UK level for it to be included in the PBR. There may have been another reason for not implementing such commonsense tax relief, but we have yet to hear it. I have not heard it articulated in this chamber or at Westminster.</p><p>It is not just our computer games industry that is suffering as a result of the UK PBR. The chancellor's refusal to accelerate the &#163;350 million of capital funding that the Scottish Parliament asked for&#8212;on a cross-party basis&#8212;is further proof, if it were needed, that Scotland's economic stability is hampered by the current constitutional set-up.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20460839", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pre-budget Report (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to make some progress.

Our convener, Trish Godman, and our deputy convener, Jamie Hepburn, ensured that our efforts were not wasted. We have produced a report that, in the main, is supported by all members of the committee.</p><p>The committee worked well together and we were in broad agreement on the majority of issues. However, it would be remiss of me not to concentrate for a few minutes on one of the issues that split the committee: there were three votes for and three votes against the proposed merger of Waterwatch Scotland with the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman to form an all-encompassing complaints commission. The original idea behind the SPSO was to create a one-stop shop for complaints, which would allow ease of access for the public. However, in recent years, we have departed from that original concept by creating a number of different bodies to deal with complaints.</p><p>The proposal to merge Waterwatch and the SPSO was not motivated by a desire to save money; it was about improving service for the public. Our complaints-handling system should involve less duplication and bureaucracy, which might mean fewer organisations. Some of my constituents have said that when they make a complaint they are bounced between the local authority and the water authority. Who deals with the complaint? Is it Waterwatch or the ombudsman? If the two bodies are pulled together, the system will be much cleaner and more accessible to the public.</p><p>I appreciate the concerns of some members of the committee regarding the public's need for an ombudsman that can deal with complaints fully by drawing on detailed knowledge and expertise. However, I believe that the skill that is currently deployed in the SPSO in relation to a wide range of public services is no different to that which is <place-holder colnum=\"18556\"/> deployed in the types of process that are undertaken by bodies such as Waterwatch.</p><p>I am certain that if we were to merge the functions of Waterwatch with the role of the SPSO, we would provide the public with a more straightforward, effective and efficient system without compromising service. I believe that that would be in keeping with the recommendations of Professor Crerar, Douglas Sinclair and the previous Finance Committee.</p><p>I respect the committee's decisions, but I think that this issue would benefit from further scrutiny, either at a later stage in the proposed bill or at some future review. One thing on which we are all agreed is that ours will not be the final review. The subject would benefit from consideration by fresh bodies on any future committee. Our report took us some distance; indeed, it took us as far as we could go while also maintaining consensus.

Members will be used to hearing me extol the virtues of Dundee whatever the topic of debate, and today will be no different. However, in the case of the computer games industry, there is no need for me to embellish Dundee's role at the centre of the United Kingdom market. Dundee is a world player when it comes to the computer games industry.</p><p>From the first days of computer game technology, Dundee has been at the forefront. In 1983, Timex produced the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer in Dundee, and a generation in the city grew up learning the skills that would make Dundee a global leader. One of the early successes of the Dundee computer game scene was the worldwide hit Lemmings. There were also million-plus selling titles such as Earthworm Jim and Rollercoaster Tycoon and, of course, the huge hit Grand Theft Auto, which was created in Dundee by Rockstar North. Unfortunately, the company is now based in Edinburgh, although it is still successfully working for the Scottish computer games industry.</p><p>Dundee still produces world-class games. Last year, we had the award-winning Crackdown, which was developed by Realtime Worlds and sold more than 1.5 million copies globally. The games industry in the UK employs 30,000 people and contributes &#163;1 billion to gross domestic product. Dundee is home to 10 per cent of the UK's computer games companies. It is estimated that about 3,500 people are employed in computer <place-holder colnum=\"15922\"/> games development and related industries in the Dundee area.</p><p>Dundee also leads the way on education and training. The University of Abertay Dundee has been instrumental in supporting the growth of computer games technology, and its graduates have set up companies in the city, throughout the UK and in other parts of the globe. Abertay had the UK's first undergraduate degree in computer games technology and Scotland has three quarters of the undergraduate courses that are currently available in the UK.</p><p>Despite the economic downturn, the worldwide industry is booming, with computer games sales last year overtaking DVD sales for the first time, with &#163;22 billion of global sales. However, this is not a time to rest on our laurels. Yes, Dundee and Scotland are doing well in a booming computer games market, but we must ensure that, in the years to come, the companies still exist and that the news broadcasts stories about the latest great game launch and awards, rather than the latest company closures. Timex has long since closed its doors, and last week the loss of another 250 jobs at NCR in Dundee was a stark lesson that a once-successful business can quickly become less viable in changing market conditions.</p><p>We are seeing the first signs that problems might lie ahead for the computer games industry. The UK is falling behind on games development, and the countries that are overtaking us are those that have given tax breaks for games development. Scottish and UK firms must pay tax on research and development, whereas countries such as Canada and France give rebates, which gives their companies a competitive advantage over our companies. Although in some cases it might be possible to claim tax credits here, that applies only at the end of the development process. If our computer games industry is to compete on an equal footing with companies in other countries, it needs support during the development process, which can be lengthy.</p><p>Colin Macdonald, the studio manager for Dundee-based computer games developer Realtime Worlds, recently expressed concern that, unless the playing field is levelled and UK-based companies receive a similar tax break, such as a VAT exemption for games research and development, the industry will suffer. Realtime Worlds is not alone in that view. The University of Abertay Dundee, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the computer games trade body Tiga all say the same thing: unless the playing field is levelled, we could lose out in Scotland.</p><p>Top games such as Crackdown take about five years to develop. When tax breaks of up 25 per cent are available in other countries, Scotland and the UK are simply not as competitive, which is why <place-holder colnum=\"15923\"/> the UK is falling behind in the development of new games. The industry is calling for a change to the tax regime, as there is firm evidence that easing the tax burden on games development creates jobs and grows the industry. In Canada, the introduction of a 25 per cent tax break on development has resulted in a flurry of development and increased the number of people who are employed in the games industry by 40 per cent. It has also led to extra investment of $1.5 billion in the Canadian economy. French companies were granted a 20 per cent tax break in 2007, which has proven an aggressive stimulant for the country's computer games industry. That competitive advantage has given new-found confidence to French game developers. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce and Tiga have stated that if we received a similar tax break to bring us back into line with our main competitors, it could create an extra 11,500 jobs throughout the UK and safeguard thousands more jobs in the industry.</p><p>At the end of the day, companies will go where prices are cheaper, even if development in the UK is of a higher quality. We are already hearing of Canadian headhunters targeting the wealth of talent in the Scottish computer games industry. Dundee generates 15 per cent of the UK's total computer games turnover&#8212;some &#163;150 million annually&#8212;and would therefore feel more acutely any downturn caused by a loss of competitiveness.</p><p>Holyrood does not yet have tax powers to support the industry directly, but there is much that we can do in the chamber. I welcome the steps that the Scottish Government has taken to support the industry, most notably through the funding of the University of Abertay Dundee Skillset media academy, which will specialise in computer games education and expand the university's expertise. That new academy recognises Dundee's importance as a centre for computer games development and will provide a skilled workforce to ensure that Dundee continues to lead the field.</p><p>Dundee used to make Spectrum computers and NCR used to employ thousands in the city. With cross-party support in the chamber and at Westminster, we can ensure that it will never be the case that we have to say that we used to have a computer games industry.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14855786", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Computer Games"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to introduce this debate on support for the computer games industry in Scotland.

The Labour leader of the council, Kevin Keenan, has stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I want the people of Dundee to be confident that they will not have to find any more money to pay for their council services in the coming year.\"</p><p>On a day when we have heard the worrying news that the UK economy is forecast to shrink by 4 to 6 per cent in 2009, my constituents can be reassured that they will again be spared the annual increase in council tax.</p><p>I bet that many council tax payers elsewhere in the UK wish that they had a Government with John Swinney at the helm of its finances&#8212;one that could deliver a council tax freeze. The average Dundee household will save &#163;120 next year thanks to the council tax freeze. I welcome the cabinet secretary's announcement that not a single penny will be added to council tax bills in the following year and his further commitment to work with local authorities to ensure that that continues until the end of this session of Parliament and into 2012. That positive news will be welcomed throughout Scotland.</p><p>The council tax freeze was possible only because of the co-operation of local authorities. Councils of all colours put the \"historic\" in the historic concordat when they put aside party politics for the good of the people of Scotland. Every single council signed up enthusiastically. It is a pity that Scottish Parliament colleagues cannot be as pragmatic and deliver what the people of Scotland consistently demonstrate they are in favour of at the polls: a fairer local income tax that is based on the ability to pay, rather than the hated council tax, to which the Opposition parties have no realistic alternative.<place-holder colnum=\"14920\"/></p><p>In 2007, I campaigned for the abolition of the council tax and the introduction of a fairer local income tax that is based on the ability to pay. I will be pleased to campaign for that again in 2011. The process of moving to a local income tax that is based on the ability to pay and set at 3p in the pound would represent the biggest tax cut in a generation. The decision of the Westminster Government to cut our budget by &#163;500 million per year for the next two years makes it impossible for any finance minister, even one as talented as John Swinney, to deliver such a sweeping tax cut. That, coupled with the closed-mindedness of the Labour and Tory parties, prevents the introduction of a fairer system for Scots. I look forward to a more pragmatic Parliament after the people of Scotland have passed their judgment on us in 2011.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14705327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Order 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The cost in this budget is \u00a370 million, which is in stark contrast to the \u00a3800 million that would have been required to deliver a 2p income tax cut.

The chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Liz Cameron, summed it up on Sunday when she said that every day the budget is delayed is damaging to Scotland's economy. We all have a responsibility to our parties, but we also have a responsibility to those whom we are here to represent. It is impossible to argue that Scotland and our constituents would be better off if &#163;1.8 billion of funding was delayed. As was the case last week, I am happy to add my support for the Scottish Government's budget. It meets the needs of Scotland's households and businesses at this time of economic uncertainty.</p><p>I welcome the support of the Liberal Democrats, not least because it gives me something new to say&#8212;after several debates on this year's budget, I was running out of derogatory adjectives. In all seriousness, I congratulate the Liberals on their pragmatic approach this week. They have recognised that taking a constructive approach&#8212;as the Conservatives and Margo MacDonald have done throughout&#8212;can be beneficial for all parties and those whom we represent.</p><p>I also welcome the Labour Party's support for the budget. It is unfortunate that it did not feel able to support the budget earlier, because it would have saved a lot of angst throughout Scotland. Labour and the SNP might not agree entirely on some issues, but with the consensus that we have reached on the budget today, it is clear that we agree that this is the right budget at the right time for Scotland. I hope that that wave of consensus is the start of a new approach to politics by both the <place-holder colnum=\"14663\"/> Labour and Liberal parties. If that is the case, it is the people of Scotland who will be the winners.</p><p>At the heart of the budget is an approach by the Scottish Government to make things fairer and to ease the burden on those who are most at risk from the economic downturn. The budget allocates a further &#163;70 million to allow local authorities to freeze their council tax for the second year running. In previous years, the regular round of council tax rises led to a doubling of council tax in a decade. That time is past, and I am confident that councils throughout Scotland are working hard to deliver a second historic council tax freeze this year.</p><p>Today's budget is also about support for small businesses, which are the bedrock of our economy and vital for employment in Scotland. In the economically challenging year ahead, we must ensure that we take the necessary measures to ensure their continued economic success.</p><p>Phase 2 of the small business bonus scheme will benefit 150,000 small businesses throughout Scotland. With the passing of the budget, 7,500 businesses in Dundee alone will have their rates scrapped or cut.</p><p>The budget also addresses the need to protect jobs in the current economic climate, particularly in the construction industry. I therefore welcome the &#163;230 million of capital expenditure that is being brought forward from future budgets, which will help to support 4,700 Scottish jobs.</p><p>As was the case last week, today's budget is a clear choice between supporting families and businesses in Scotland and turning our backs on the problems of our constituents. I believe that the whole Parliament acknowledges that, which is why we have seen much greater consensus this week. I hope that that consensus will result in unanimity by the end of the debate.</p><p>Throughout the budget process, and in the past few days, parties throughout the chamber have come together to ensure that we do the right thing for the people of Scotland. Be in no doubt: this Parliament let the people of Scotland down by failing to pass the budget last week. Today, we have an opportunity to make amends.

We must recognise that economic stability should be Parliament's top priority, given that it has been confirmed that the UK is in recession since we started this year's budget process. To put that in context, the International Monetary Fund announced today just how bad the recession is: in the past couple of hours, it has revised its prediction that the UK economy will contract by 2.2 per cent and now predicts that it will contract by 2.8 per cent. The worst contraction of any economy in the developed world is happening on Gordon Brown's and Labour's watch.</p><p>I will not pretend that our constituents are crowded around \"Holyrood Live\" or hanging on every word of today's debate, but we should make no mistake that what we decide today will make a huge difference to businesses and families throughout Scotland. As a result of the historic concordat with local authorities, the budget proposes a further &#163;70 million a year to ensure <place-holder colnum=\"14418\"/> that, in these tough times, families throughout Scotland will not have a single extra penny added to their council tax bills. That is a welcome change from the days when local authorities were forced to make a stark choice between cutting services and making large increases in council tax bills. With a second year of the council tax freeze, my constituents in Dundee will have saved an average of &#163;120 a year.</p><p>The alternative prospect is, of course, that the budget will be voted down. As local government budgets must be set in a little over a month, substantial increases in council tax bills would be needed to make up for the huge shortfall that will exist if we are forced to revert to last year's budget.</p><p>In Dundee, the shortfall would be over &#163;12 million, which would necessitate a 20 per cent increase in council tax for hard-pressed households. That would amount to &#163;233 on a band D property in Dundee&#8212;or, to put it another way, a &#163;20 a month Labour surcharge on council tax bills in the city, instead of the freeze that this budget proposes.</p><p>Today's budget vote is a clear choice between a real-terms cut in council tax for every household in Scotland and a potential increase of hundreds of pounds. It might have escaped the attention of Mr Purvis and the Liberal Democrats, but for all their bluster about tax cuts, his party will, if it votes against the budget, be voting for a tax increase.</p><p>The budget is good news for small businesses. Phase 2 of the small business bonus scheme is set to benefit 150,000 small businesses.

Without the budget, those 150,000 businesses will have to navigate what is predicted to be the most economically challenging year in a generation without the lifeline that the small business bonus scheme offers. It is not going too far to say that many of those might not make it to the end of the year.</p><p>In order to address the economic downturn and to ensure that Scotland comes out the other side, the cabinet secretary gave a commitment to bring forward funding where possible. As a result, the budget proposes a &#163;120 million acceleration in the affordable housing budget over this year and next.

Members such as Alex Neil and John Park have said that we need to put aside party politics and headlines as we embark on what is likely to be a period of economic decline. I am pleased that most of the parties in the chamber have, on the whole, stepped up to the plate, which has led to a constructive approach to this year's budget in the Finance Committee and in the Parliament. The sole exception is one of the fringe parties, which has abandoned all attempts at being constructive to aim for headlines with its frankly ludicrous cuts proposals. I would say that the Liberal Democrats' sums do not add up, but one actually requires figures before attempting to add them up, and the Liberals do not seem to have any. To be fair, one figure is being bandied about, although not often by the Liberals&#8212;the &#163;800 million of cuts, and even that figure has doubled from the original estimate of &#163;400 million.</p><p>A 2p tax reduction, as the Liberal Democrats have proposed, makes good headlines, but it does not make financial sense. The Liberals are forgetting the difference between a normal Government with its full range of economic levers and this Parliament with its artificial ceiling, which means that we must work within the financial constraints that are placed on us by the settlement that we receive from Westminster. To put it another way, we must work within the envelope.</p><p>Any reduction in the Scottish variable rate must be matched by cuts in spending. At every opportunity, we hear of the Liberal Democrats' proposed plan for a reduction in the SVR, but details of the cuts are always absent. Mr Purvis is not solely to blame for that covert approach to the Liberal Democrat cuts&#8212;he is only following the example of his illustrious leader Nick Clegg, who, when asked on \"Newsnight\" where the proposed &#163;20 billion of UK cuts would come from, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I'm simply not going to tell you the rest because if I did that, first, if they were a good idea the other parties would nick it.\"<place-holder colnum=\"13951\"/></p><p>There we have it: a party that is so concerned about the economic downturn that it will not tell us what it thinks should be done in case it has any good ideas.</p><p>I might be a little harsh&#8212;we have heard some proposals from the Liberals. Presumably, they are the ones that the Liberals think are so bad and so barmy that no one would think of stealing them.</p><p>As far as I can make out, the Liberal Democrats plan to scrap new quangos&#8212;creative Scotland and the SFT&#8212;which they claim would be a cut of &#163;40 million. However, creative Scotland is expected to cost &#163;7 million to set up, and the budget line for the SFT is only &#163;3.1 million, so that is about &#163;10 million, which is far short of the suggested &#163;40 million. I am not sure that everyone got the memo on that, however, as Liberal leader Tavish Scott recently proposed the creation of a new transport quango&#8212;although, again, we have heard no costings for that proposal.</p><p>The Liberals have also said that they would demutualise Scottish Water, cutting &#163;180 million from the budget. Although demutualisation might well achieve the &#163;180 million saving that they claim, it would inevitably lead to higher water rates, which would create a tax rise rather than a tax cut for Scots. In addition, it would take two years to achieve, so it would produce no savings for this year's budget.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14589364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 2) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have mentioned, this budget is particularly relevant and important, given the current economic uncertainty.

The Lib Dems could start with a couple of infrastructure cuts. Scrapping the Borders railway and the Inverness bypass would cut &#163;120 million and &#163;115 million respectively. They could save &#163;187.5 million a year by getting rid of concessionary fares. They could cut &#163;12 million from alcohol programmes, and scrapping free eye tests would save them another &#163;29 million. They <place-holder colnum=\"13952\"/> could then end the council tax freeze, which they continue to oppose. That would take &#163;70 million from the pockets of hard-pressed Scottish households. Finally, they could get rid of the central heating scheme, which costs &#163;46 million a year. However, even after all those cuts, the sums would still not add up, because the total would be only &#163;799.5 million.

I single out Susan Duffy, our clerk team leader, who is moving on to the Local Government and Communities Committee in the new year. The Finance Committee will miss her, and I am sure that we all wish her well in her new post.</p><p>The Christmas spirit may be getting the better of me, but I also praise my fellow committee members&#8212;from all parties. There was a marked difference in this year's proceedings, and it is <place-holder colnum=\"13466\"/> apparent from reading the subject committee reports that the constructive approach taken by Finance Committee members was replicated across the Parliament. That will not go unnoticed outside the Parliament, and I hope that the experience will be replicated as the budget moves forward. I understand that we will always have a bit of bluster in the chamber but, across the committees, members genuinely attempted to do what was in the interests of the people of Scotland, which is to be welcomed. There was a feeling in the committees that, given the current financial climate, it was more important than ever that we were willing to get on together to ensure that we got the most from the budget and that we were not seen to allow petty party-political differences to get in the way of our shared responsibility to serve the people of Scotland.</p><p>The Finance Committee recognises that the actions in the Government's first budget have become even more vital because of the subsequent economic downturn. The policy of putting money back into the pockets of hard-pressed Scottish families and businesses has been broadly welcomed across the country. We need to remind ourselves of some of the ways in which the money has gone back to them, such as the removal of tolls on the Tay bridge and the reduction in prescription charges, which will be further reduced next April.</p><p>As a result of the historic concordat with local authorities, a further &#163;70 million will be pledged in the budget to enable councils to freeze council tax bills again across Scotland, allowing a real-terms tax cut that will be especially welcome in these tough times. It was therefore disappointing that the Liberal Democrat members of the committee did not welcome that measure&#8212;given that it is a tax cut. This year in Bournemouth, which is similar in size to Dundee, the council tax was increased by 5 per cent. As a result of the Scottish Government's partnership with Scotland's local authorities, my constituents, like constituents across Scotland, experienced a zero per cent rise, thus avoiding an average &#163;60 increase in their bills this year. A second freeze on council tax will mean a saving equivalent to &#163;120 a year for households in Dundee and will bring us a step closer to getting rid of that unfair and hated tax forever.</p><p>Another successful initiative in this year's budget, which will be built on next year, is the small business bonus scheme. Thousands of businesses across Scotland have benefited from the scheme since its introduction in April. The benefits and support will grow when the scheme is extended, as is proposed in the 2009-10 budget. In the first half of this year, Dundee was the top city for business growth in Scotland. Despite the economic downturn, 118 new businesses started up in Dundee. The help that they will receive from <place-holder colnum=\"13467\"/> the Scottish Government will be vital in ensuring their survival in the tough times ahead. The 2009-10 budget proposes that, from April next year, just under 3,000 businesses in Dundee will have their business rates removed altogether, with rates reduced by up to 50 per cent for another 4,500. That is real help in difficult times.</p><p>I add my backing to the support that exists for the plans that have been outlined for the &#163;260 million of accelerated capital investment. Communities across Scotland will benefit from that deployment of resources, which will boost the economy when it is most needed. The &#163;7.5 million that has been brought forward this year for further and higher education will be crucial in ensuring that we weather the economic downturn. In my constituency, the University of Abertay Dundee is in line to receive &#163;0.25 million for refurbishment works to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. The acceleration of the funds will ensure that the benefits of the energy savings to the environment and to the university's finances will be enjoyed sooner. Such investment in our universities is vital to ensuring a vibrant economy. I know that members of all parties appreciate that.</p><p>The joint future thinking task force on universities published its draft report in July, in which it emphasised the universities' contribution to the Scottish economy. The report recommended that Scotland's universities should be recognised as the seventh key sector of the Scottish economy in the Government's economic strategy. Indeed, the task force stated that universities were</p><p class=\"indent\">\"explicitly recognised as a key sector of the Scottish economy\".</p><p>I welcome the fact that the minister has taken that on board.</p><p>The proposed budget for 2009-10 will build on the SNP Government's successful programme, which continues to support jobs and families across Scotland. The Opposition parties' constructive approach at committee reflects the fact that it is vital that we make the best decisions for Scotland in these tough economic times.

He is way off the mark. In Fife, a couple earning &#163;32,000 would save &#163;150 a year if they lived in a band A property; &#163;270 a year if they lived in a band B property; and nearly &#163;400 a year if they lived in a band C property.

I am sure, however, <place-holder colnum=\"11076\"/> that something important is going on that has prevented any Liberal Democrat members from being here tonight.</p><p>As Michael Matheson said, being diagnosed with cancer is a stressful enough time for sufferers and their families without the added burden of having to worry about their financial situation. Incomes plummet for people who have cancer and, as we have heard, benefits take-up is at its lowest among cancer sufferers in Scotland. The strain on finances results in nine out of 10 households with a diagnosed cancer sufferer encountering financial difficulty.</p><p>I will concentrate on one area of financial burden for people who are diagnosed with cancer: travel. In Tayside, a new case of cancer is diagnosed every four hours. As we have heard, having cancer puts a huge strain on people's finances, and even small costs can be hard to meet. From the day of diagnosis, the average cancer patient in Tayside will require 60 trips to hospital. In addition to rising fuel costs, patients who attend consultations at Ninewells hospital must pay &#163;1.60 to park there, and their family and friends must pay &#163;1.60 every time they visit. Figures show that cancer patients are, in fact, paying the highest rates for travel in the UK, at &#163;636 per year.</p><p>I welcome the action that the Government has taken to alleviate that burden by scrapping the car parking charges at hospitals throughout Scotland. Unfortunately for people who visit Dundee's Ninewells hospital, however, car parking charges will remain because of a private finance initiative contract that was signed before the establishment of this Parliament. I await the publication of the cancer care plan, and I hope that the Government will address parking at hospitals that are under PFI contracts.</p><p>As Michael Matheson said, the Macmillan benefits advice service can make a huge difference&#8212;we heard evidence of that from Falkirk. In 2009, there will be seven Macmillan advisers in Tayside working to provide financial support and advice to people who have cancer. That is to be welcomed but, as Michael Matheson said, we must ensure that people who have cancer are aware of the service. I support his and other members' calls for referral to the advice centres, including Maggie's centres, to be given at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>Parliament enjoys the trust and support of the people of Scotland because we have not turned away from the health problems that face our nation. Under the previous Administration, the Parliament proved to the people of Scotland that it cares about the health and wellbeing of the nation by introducing free personal care and the smoking ban. That commitment to putting the health of Scots at the top of the agenda has been continued <place-holder colnum=\"11077\"/> with the phasing out of prescription charges and the introduction of the human papilloma virus vaccine by the current Government.</p><p>We must continue to put the health of the nation at the forefront of whatever we do. The highlighting of the important issue of cancer poverty by Michael Matheson and other members, and the calls for the provision of financial advice to people who have been diagnosed with cancer are a continuation of what Parliament has previously stood up for.</p><p>I look forward to the publication of \"Better Cancer Care\", which I hope will go some way towards addressing cancer poverty.

I am not suggesting for a minute that anyone likes to pay tax&#8212;nobody likes to pay tax. We would all like to be tax-free and have the best services in the world. However, by basing the tax take on income, we can, at least, ensure that we have a fair system that does not disproportionately tax those who are on low and fixed incomes. The end of the council tax will see all those who are on low incomes automatically paying less, with the majority of pensioners being exempt. There will be no complicated forms that many pensioners are not prepared or not able to fill in. Under the current council tax benefit system, up to 40 per cent of eligible pensioners do not receive any help towards their bills. That is a lot of very vulnerable people.</p><p>I will give a real-life example to highlight the point, although it involves someone whom I have not identified personally. I refer to the pensioner who was identified by Iain Gray this morning. Mr Gray said&#8212;I paraphrase, as I have not seen the <em>Official Report</em>&#8212;that a pensioner with an income of &#163;8,000 would be brought into the local tax system by the introduction of a local income tax. Iain Gray was wrong on two points. He was wrong to suggest that a single pensioner on a meagre income of &#163;8,000 does not pay council tax&#8212;they do. I am not sure where Mr Gray's pensioner lives, but if they live in a band D house in my constituency they will be liable to pay council tax. Even if they have no savings and apply for council tax benefit, that benefit will not cover their council tax liabilities. Additionally, we know that about 40 per cent of entitled pensioners do not claim that benefit. In fact, for pensioners to be paying up to 30 per cent of their income in council tax is not <place-holder colnum=\"10392\"/> unusual, while Scotland's most wealthy citizens pay a fraction of that. The SNP's proposal for a fair system that is based on the ability to pay will end that inequality.</p><p>Mr Gray was also wrong to suggest that his pensioner would be liable for local income tax. The UK Treasury, to whom Mr Gray was a special adviser, has set the personal allowance for single people between the ages of 65 and 75 at &#163;9,030 for this financial year. So, any pensioner with an income of less than &#163;9,030&#8212;which, I am pleased to confirm, includes someone with an income of &#163;8,000&#8212;would pay no income tax, whether local or national. Furthermore, if the pensioner in question is over 75, their personal allowance is even higher.</p><p>Mr Gray's comments are typical of Labour members, who are happy to scaremonger without checking their facts and who offer no solutions. With the announcement that the Government's second legislative programme will include a bill to abolish the council tax, Labour's day of reckoning on local taxation has arrived. It is no longer good enough for them to criticise the proposals that are put forward by others&#8212;at least the Conservatives have some proposals&#8212;without coming up with proposals of their own. The people of Scotland have a right to examine such proposals in detail.</p><p>I understand that Labour members are in difficulty at the moment&#8212;they are rudderless without a leader and have no idea which direction they will take on any policy initiative. However, they had eight years in government, throughout which time they promised to tackle the inequalities of the council tax. That was one of many broken promises by Labour in government. The people of Scotland have a right to know where Labour members stand on the &#163;400 million that Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling want to keep from Scotland if we abolish the council tax. Will they stand up for Scotland with the SNP, or will they capitulate as they did on care charges?</p><p>This has been a good debate. I have enjoyed it, although we have not agreed on everything. There is much in the legislative programme that will bring the Parliament together in the interests of the nation as a whole, and I hope that the bills around which there are fundamental disagreements will serve to generate increased interest in the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is fairer because Mr Souter and Mr Farmer will pay more than they pay under the current system; it is fairer because Mr Foulkes will pay more than he pays under the current system; and it is fairer because the tax system will be based on people's ability to pay.

Where possible, they were transferred to the NPD model. I am confident that, in future, we will get much better value for the public pound through the Scottish futures trust.</p><p>The previous Administration had hoped that the Scottish people would never find out about the huge profits that private companies were making at the expense of the Scottish taxpayer as a result of the PFI programme. However, after the facts became available following a freedom of information request, we saw that the evidence was shocking. The <em>Sunday Herald</em> summed up the situation best when it labelled it \"The great PFI swindle\".</p><p>The evidence revealed for the first time the huge scale of the profits that were being made by private companies at the public's expense. We were told of regular profits of 1,200 per cent for private investors. That means that for every &#163;1 invested, they got back &#163;1,200. To put it another way, a modest investment of &#163;1,000 delivered a return of &#163;1 million. That is a scandal.</p><p>In 2006, the capital value of PFI projects in the NHS was &#163;600 million, but the debt created was &#163;2.4 billion. Even Labour members should be able to tell that that does not add up.</p><p>The huge sums of public money that were being handed over to private companies under PFI are a disgrace. One of the main justifications for those massive profits is the claim that, as part of PFI, risk is transferred. However, another national scandal is the projects that had to be bought out at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of millions of pounds: the Skye bridge, West Lothian College and Inverness airport. It is clear that for \"risk\" we can read \"built-in profit.\" When a PFI project goes badly wrong, the public purse has to bear the cost.</p><p>The examples of expensive PFI projects that have cost the taxpayer dearly could fill a whole month's debate. I urge all members to read the submissions to the Finance Committee's inquiry into methods of funding capital projects. In that written and oral evidence, we read and heard lots of opinion. Many comments were made in defence of PFI and against change, but it is important to look at where those comments came from. It is perfectly understandable that people with vested <place-holder colnum=\"9449\"/> interests in the current system will oppose any change that will cap excessive profits and ensure best value for the public purse. However, as well as that opinion, the Finance Committee received lots of evidence that was based on fact. The evidence speaks for itself. A damning indictment of PFI is the fact that it will leave an &#163;800 million noose around the neck of Scotland's public finances.</p><p>The Government has shown that we can move swiftly on infrastructure investment, which is so vital to the success of the economy and to the delivery of services. Since the Scottish National Party came into office, the Government has approved a raft of projects, many of which&#8212;including the Forth crossing&#8212;had suffered because of years of dithering on the part of the previous Administration. We will take no lessons on finance from the parties that presided over the scandalous PFI disaster that we have witnessed in recent years. Scotland's Government is determined and committed to achieving the best value for Scottish taxpayers, and that is exactly what it is delivering.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13727519", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Infrastructure (Investment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Government took the decision that the quickest way of moving a few of those schools forward was to continue with the existing system.

It was wrong of Jackie Baillie to say that SNP members did not support the introduction of the minimum wage. On 16 December 1997, John Swinney and Roseanna Cunningham, who are both in the chamber, voted for the National Minimum Wage Bill at second reading, along with Margaret Ewing, Alasdair Morgan and Andrew Welsh. Alasdair Morgan was a member of the committee that considered the bill and spoke in the debate at second reading. Let us have less misinformation and more facts.</p><p>I pay tribute to the previous Administration, which, in partnership with all Opposition parties, made commendable progress in tackling fuel poverty and child poverty in Scotland by using the economic powers that are available to us here at Holyrood. Our SNP Government has also taken advantage of the powers that are available to the Parliament. In the past year, it has implemented a raft of changes, which Christina McKelvie mentioned. It has moved to abolish prescription charges, scrapped the graduate endowment fee, frozen the council tax and increased payments for free personal care. Together, those changes are making most Scots better off.</p><p>Although, as has been shown, the Parliament has its hands on some of the levers of power and can make a big difference to the lives of the people of Scotland, the current constitutional set-up means that the UK budget has huge ramifications for Scots. Although there was not one mention of Scotland in the budget, it made 500,000 Scots households less well-off. The union dividend is often cited as the main argument against independence for Scotland, but it means that Scots are paying some of the highest petrol prices in the world and that our pensioners are dying of cold each year in Europe's most energy-rich country. The same union dividend cut the pay packets of a quarter of Scottish households to appease middle England in the budget.</p><p>This week there was disturbing news from the European Commission. In its latest six-monthly economic forecast, Brussels estimated that the UK's budget deficit would rise to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2008-09, which would mean that the UK was in breach of the 3 per cent limit that has been set by the EU stability and growth pact. That is not the prudent approach to the economy that Gordon Brown promised us. It comes at a time when the <place-holder colnum=\"8225\"/> UK's growth rate is expected almost to halve in the next year.</p><p>The EU is not alone in thinking that the UK economy is heading for trouble. David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, warned only yesterday that a UK recession is on the way. It is not clear whether things are as bad as he suggests, but it is clear that the situation is not good.</p><p>Last month the FTSE 100 company Shire Pharmaceuticals announced that it will relocate to Ireland, where it will join firms such as eBay and Google, which enjoy a corporate tax rate in Dublin that is less than half the UK rate. It is likely that Ireland's competitive taxation regime was a major factor in NCR's decision to locate its European headquarters in Dublin rather than in my city, Dundee.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403640", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Kingdom Budget"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is interesting that Iain Gray did not refer to the figure for the last year of the Labour-Lib Dem Executive, which was correctly stated as 10,238, compared with 14,377 under the SNP.

If there is a pot of money that we have not tapped into&#8212;some of the profits that the energy companies make could be used to provide more investment&#8212;grants for cavity wall insulation, which Jamie McGrigor mentioned, would have a much bigger impact. We should consider what more can be done to ensure that no houses in Scotland have cavity walls that are not insulated, as that is probably the easiest measure that we can take to have a big impact on fuel poverty and our CO <sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>It is a sad state of affairs when we must debate fuel poverty in Europe's most energy-rich nation. Scotland produces 10 times more oil and five times more gas than it consumes. We export 20 per cent of our electricity and have huge renewable resources, with 25 per cent of Europe's wind resources and about a quarter of Europe's tidal resources. We know that we face challenges in tapping into that huge renewable resource, but members are up for that challenge.</p><p>Despite the abundance of energy resources in Scotland, pensioners still die from cold and more than 1 million Scots live in fuel poverty. We all remember the massive price rises a couple of years ago that resulted in fuel bills rocketing. The reason for those huge increases was that the UK had become a net importer of gas, with about 5 per cent coming from overseas, despite the fact that Scotland is a net exporter. Scotland produces at least five times as much gas as the country uses, but a quarter of our households are fuel poor. That is the reality of the union dividend for the people of Scotland.</p><p>The previous Administration made a worthy effort to tackle fuel poverty&#8212;we must give credit where credit is due. The central heating programme made and still makes a big difference <place-holder colnum=\"6922\"/> to households throughout Scotland. However, as we have heard from other members, as fast as some people are being pulled out of fuel poverty, more people are becoming fuel poor as a result of rocketing prices. The Parliament lacks resources to combat fuel poverty, the rate of which is three times that in England. We need power over regulation of the energy industry and control over Scotland's oil and gas to make a real difference to the hundreds of thousands of Scots who cannot afford to heat their homes.</p><p>Communities throughout Scotland hoped for strong action from the chancellor in yesterday's budget to ensure that energy companies put some of the huge profits that they make back into combating fuel poverty. The chancellor is not one for exciting speeches, and his announcement that energy companies will be encouraged to spend &#163;150 million on social tariffs fell flat. Figures from energywatch show that the 5 million customers who have prepayment meters in the UK pay on average &#163;255 more than consumers who pay online by direct debit for the equivalent energy. That tax on the poorest in our country means that energy companies rake in an extra &#163;1.2 billion per year.</p><p>On the one hand, the chancellor talks about the energy companies spending &#163;150 million, but we should compare that with the &#163;1.2 billion a year that those companies make from the poorest energy users in society&#8212;it does not add up. The non-mandatory extra &#163;150 million that the chancellor wants energy companies to put towards social tariffs is a drop in the ocean compared with the profits that those companies make. The budget attempts to tackle fuel poverty, but it fails to address the key underlying factor in the rise in fuel poverty, which is the high prices that energy companies charge people, particularly those who have prepayment meters.</p><p>Colleagues have shown their willingness to tackle the blight of fuel poverty. I agree with the majority of Liam McArthur's comments. However, the simplest way to combat fuel poverty is surely to take control of our huge energy resources and to ensure that the people of Scotland benefit from them&#8212;that would put an end to fuel poverty once and for all.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400472", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I support grants for renewables, but if we introduced that small \u00a3100 grant, the money would have to come from somewhere, and it might come from the more reasonable grants that can pay for a third of the cost of solar installations, which makes a difference.

That is in contrast with the rest of Britain, where the number declined. Barnardo's, the Child Poverty Action Group, Save the Children and the Poverty Alliance all argue that the main areas of focus for targeting child poverty should be to support parents into work and help them to remain there, and to increase the uptake of benefits and tax credit.

The contrast is perhaps best demonstrated by comparing the tax policies of the Scottish and UK Administrations.

On the other hand, Gordon Brown and <place-holder colnum=\"5762\"/> London Labour have abolished the 10p tax rate. That is a regressive tax change. One policy will remove a heavy burden from low-income families; the other will see the poor subsidising the rich.

It is plain to see which of those two approaches to tax meets her criteria&#8212;and it is not Gordon Brown's.

Its recent report paints a damning picture of disability poverty in Scotland, with people twice as likely to live in poverty if they happen to be disabled. We cannot accept that that situation should continue. Over the past 10 years, the issue of disability poverty has been marginalised. In the case of disability poverty, instead of \"Things can only get better\", things have got worse. Figures show that, whereas 80 per cent of non-disabled Scots are in employment, only 48 per cent of disabled people are in employment.

We have heard from members about the impact of some of the cuts that Labour would have made throughout Scotland had it gained support for its budget amendments. Having failed to gain the support of any other party in the Finance Committee for its package of cuts, Labour has now brought forward an uncosted amendment, which asks the cabinet secretary, John Swinney, to do the sums for it. However, in lodging its uncosted amendment&#8212;which, without saying how, seeks to change, as we have heard, about 1 per cent of the budget&#8212;the Labour Party has eaten humble pie and accepted 99 per cent of the SNP Government's proposals. That dramatic turnaround is to be welcomed.</p><p>It is also welcome that the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament appears to have come some way and has finally caught up with Pat Watters and other Labour council leaders across Scotland. Its amendment does not seek to challenge the historic concordat between the Scottish Government and Scotland's local authorities. The concordat will reduce bureaucratic reporting and will allow more resources to be directed to front-line services, to be used to protect Scotland's most vulnerable citizens instead of time and money being wasted on ticking boxes and form filling.</p><p>I am delighted that Iain Gray listened to the comments that Tom McCabe made at the meeting of Parliament on 13 December in support of the Government's move to single outcome agreements, which will ensure that we are delivering for Scotland and not just spending Scotland's money. The concordat represents a seismic change in how Scotland is governed. To give credit where it is due, I congratulate the Labour Party and, in particular, Tom McCabe, who has gone some way in persuading the Labour Party to listen to the debate and not to oppose that important change in its amendment.</p><p>I am pleased that many important measures in the first SNP budget&#8212;the abolition of prescription charges, the removal of tolls from the Tay and Forth bridges, the provision of the funds to allow Scotland's local authorities to freeze the council tax, the restoration of free education with abolition of the graduate endowment fee and the transition from loans to grants, and the removal or reduction of business rates for about 150,000 small businesses throughout Scotland&#8212;are not being challenged by any of the amendments, despite Labour having opposed them in the past.

I will move on to a matter on which there has always been a considerable degree of cross-party agreement: the environment. There is no doubt that this is the greenest budget Scotland has ever seen, with &#163;154 million being invested to take Scotland closer to becoming a zero-waste society, &#163;127 million for flood defences, &#163;45 million for new woodland, &#163;30 million for a new sustainable development and climate change fund, &#163;2.8 billion for public transport, a &#163;2 million saltire prize to inspire innovation in renewable energy and the tripling of funding for community and microrenewables. The degree of consensus on those issues is highly significant and places Parliament in a position to be a world leader in tackling global warming.</p><p>Although the consensus on those important issues is to be welcomed, it means that much of the debate on green matters goes unreported. One such debate came about as a result of the Finance Committee's decision to focus part of its budget scrutiny on sustainability&#8212;a highly significant decision, which I think went unreported outwith Parliament. The committee had an interesting and informative question-and-answer session with some eminent experts, including Dr Dan Barlow, who is in the public gallery. That was a positive step. Although the experts recognised that the budget goes some of the way, concern was expressed that it was difficult to determine how each budget line would help sustainability. I am sure that Dr Barlow will have been delighted to hear the cabinet secretary's commitment to bring in carbon accounting by 2009-10. It is imperative that we take that step forward if we are going to make a difference.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396350", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate has highlighted the contrasts between an   SNP Government that is determined to deliver its positive vision for Scotland and a Labour Opposition that is confining itself to negative carping from the sidelines and is bereft of ideas.

I remind members of the twin 2MW turbines that are generating about one third of the energy needed by the Michelin tyre factory in Dundee. As two of the largest urban wind turbines in the world, they are a positive reminder of what can be achieved when there is a will. I encourage members to find time to visit Dundee to see the turbines for themselves.</p><p>As well as helping to reduce Dundee's carbon footprint, the turbines have shown how the technology has improved to such an extent that many fears, such as fears of noise pollution, are no longer relevant&#8212;even when we are talking about large turbines very close to housing.</p><p>I am sure that members will also be aware that Dundee is the sunniest city in Scotland&#8212;that is a fact. With a south-facing aspect, Dundee is in a position to make the most from solar energy, although it is a technology that is appropriate for other parts of Scotland as well. Solar energy&#8212;specifically solar water heating&#8212;is the most mature renewable energy, with the shortest payback time, that people can install in their homes. It is ideally suited to many urban settings and can be retrofitted to existing homes. However, in spite of a well-proven technology that can be shown to be financially advantageous to many, we are still harnessing only a tiny fraction of our solar potential in our cities and rural communities.</p><p>Traditionally, solar installations in Scotland have been exclusive to a very small, environmentally conscious, relatively affluent minority, but we have moved on in recent years. The majority of solar installations in Dundee have been in social housing, with housing associations and the council including solar renewables projects as part of new-build housing and reroofing projects. That has had an impact in tackling fuel poverty in some of the <place-holder colnum=\"5160\"/> poorest areas in Dundee, and I congratulate all those who were involved in making it happen. I know that Sarah Boyack was instrumental in the previous Executive, and I give her credit for the work that she did.</p><p>The housing associations and councils did not carry out solar energy projects just because Sarah Boyack and environmentalists said that it was a good idea. They installed the systems after rigorous cost analysis indicated that the schemes were financially beneficial as well as environmentally sound. We have made considerable progress in Dundee, and we are making progress throughout Scotland, but we are still tapping only a tiny proportion of our solar potential.</p><p>The main problem with solar energy is its seasonality and dependence on the time of day, so I want to talk briefly about another form of solar energy, which is my main source of heating&#8212;wood.</p><p>Wood is stored solar energy, and the burning of it is carbon neutral. The problem that I faced in choosing to use wood instead of gas for my space heating was that Dundee is a smokeless zone. The legislation has failed to keep up with technology. I am pleased that considerable progress has been made on that front, and I again acknowledge the work of Sarah Boyack during the previous parliamentary session. However, it cannot be right that our legislation still makes it easier to burn mineral fuel oil than use a clean-burn carbon-neutral wood fuel.</p><p>As has been mentioned by many members, Scotland has huge renewable energy potential. Each year, new developments are ensuring that Scotland moves closer to claiming the title of Europe's renewables powerhouse. One such innovation is creating biofuel from seaweed. The Scottish Association for Marine Science is currently working on converting kelp into methane and ethanol to provide clean green energy to power everything from cars to central heating systems.</p><p>The SAMS marine laboratory near Oban is at the forefront of the emerging marine biology industry in Scotland, with 60 doctors of science researching both global warming and potential sources for renewable biofuel energies. Some members may be sceptical, but using seaweed for energy is a viable option, and as long as it is not taken from the beaches around Scotland's nuclear power stations, it is a very clean fuel. In Japan, scientists are currently working on a biomass fermentation system that uses seaweed to produce fuel for generating electricity, and work to create the world's first power plant to run off seaweed has begun.<place-holder colnum=\"5161\"/></p><p>There are several advantages to using seaweed as a source of fuel. First is the growth speed: seaweed can grow from a few centimetres to a few metres in a season. With Scotland home to the majority of large kelp in the UK, we have huge potential to produce methane and ethanol for use as a biofuel. Another advantage of using seaweed is that it does not use land for biocrops&#8212;it involves harvesting from the shores and seas. Great concerns have been voiced that cultivating some soils can result in the release of carbon, meaning that the overall carbon balance of the fuel may not be neutral. That is especially significant in the carbon-rich soils to be found in north and west Scotland. Again, that problem is avoided by the use of seaweed.</p><p>Members will be aware of the issues surrounding palm oil and the associated deforestation. The use of seaweed has the potential to ensure that we are not reliant on imports to meet our biofuel targets, and I look forward to seeing the results of the SAMS research in the months to come.</p><p>I have touched on just a few of the areas in which Scotland is embracing renewables, and it is clear for all to see&#8212;with the exception perhaps of some Labour and Conservative members&#8212;that Scotland is on the way to becoming Europe's renewables powerhouse and that nuclear energy is a thing of the past.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. It will not surprise members that I will highlight some of the contributions made to Scotland's energy needs by Dundee.

Labour councillors throughout Scotland also support the reduction in ring fencing, and Scottish Labour MSPs appear to be the only ones who disagree. That has, however, not always been the case, as we heard from Christina McKelvie earlier. In the past, Labour MSPs have been clear about their support for the removal of ring fencing, and today their UK counterparts are enthusiastically moving towards financial freedom for local authorities.</p><p>Today's debate has seen Labour members at their most petty, as they have failed to grasp the issues and ignored the reassurances of Pat Watters and COSLA. They have failed to read the concordat, which clearly states the outcomes that are expected of local authorities in relation to vulnerable groups. Their message is clear: the removal of ring fencing is acceptable as long as it is proposed by Labour politicians.</p><p>One thing that is evident from today's debate and from Labour members' response over the past couple of months to the budget is their inability to give credit where credit is due. The SNP has produced a budget that will benefit the whole of Scotland, and although we do not expect Opposition parties to agree with everything in the spending review, I would have hoped that they could put party politics aside in the areas that clearly aim to improve the lives of Scots.</p><p>One such area is the commitment in the budget to delivering a healthier Scotland. In Labour's manifesto, the party called for action on tackling health inequalities in areas of multiple deprivations. That is a laudable aim, and when the spending review announced that there would be a particular focus on the areas and communities with the worst health records, with an extra &#163;12.5 million pounds a year to strengthen primary health care in the most deprived areas, it seemed that Labour would welcome such a commitment.</p><p>However, we have learned during the Labour Party's time in opposition that its members look not at the delivery of the policy, but at the party that is proposing it. For the benefit of Labour members, I remind them of what the spending <place-holder colnum=\"4906\"/> review will deliver for the health and well-being of all our communities. It will deliver &#163;350 million of new money for health improvements and better public health, including &#163;85 million to reduce harm done by alcohol, &#163;3 million a year for further action to reduce smoking and &#163;11.5 million a year to prevent obesity. There is &#163;270 million allocated to ensure that, by the end of 2011, nobody will wait longer than 18 weeks from a general practitioner's referral to treatment for routine conditions and &#163;30 million to ensure more flexible access to primary care.</p><p>Most important, there is &#163;97 million to phase out prescription charges to ensure that sick people are not financially disadvantaged. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall at the Labour group meeting when members were told that they would be voting against the scrapping of prescription charges. Any pretensions that the Labour Party had to represent the working Scots were lost forever on the day that it decided to vote in favour of a tax on ill health, which is what prescription charges are.</p><p>The Labour Party failed to listen to the people of Scotland and it paid the price at the ballot box.

That is equally true in rural and urban constituencies. Members will not be surprised that, as I am an MSP for an urban constituency, I think that green space and woodland are most valued in urban areas.</p><p>I grew up on the Dundee housing estate of Whitfield, which is in the constituency of my colleague Shona Robison. It was known in the citizens band radio community as the concrete jungle&#8212;a place where green space had been given little, if any, regard in early planning. I am pleased that we have learned much from the mistakes of the past and that describing Whitfield as a concrete jungle now would be wrong. We have a much greener new Whitfield.</p><p>The importance to health of access to good-quality green space cannot be overestimated. Not just physical health, but mental health can benefit from green space. Green space is of great benefit to people who live in cities such as Dundee. Evidence is emerging that access to high-quality green space can reduce stress, provide an opportunity for physical activity and build community spirit.</p><p>Deryck Irving, who is the senior development officer for Greenspace Scotland, has said:<place-holder colnum=\"4328\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Research has shown that access to appropriate, good quality greenspace can have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Equally, a lack of access to such greenspace can have a negative impact on mental and physical health and well-being.\"</p><p>In 1980, 12 per cent of Scotland was covered by woodland. By 2006, that figure had risen to 17 per cent. The aim is to increase that to 25 per cent, which will result in an additional 650,000 hectares of woodland throughout Scotland. I am sure that we all agree that we should aim to travel in that direction, but the placement of our new woodland must be well thought out.</p><p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has expressed concerns about that and has stressed the importance of developing new woodland, because inappropriately locating new woodland can damage wildlife. I seek reassurance from the minister that careful planning will be involved in aiming to achieve the target of increasing forestation so that it covers 25 per cent of Scotland.</p><p>A number of green space projects in Dundee have enjoyed success. The Baxter park restoration project, for example, revamped and cleaned up that park and installed urban rangers to engage with the public, and the Middleton community woodland project in my old ward has created a community woodland on an area of land adjacent to the Whitfield housing estate. That project has been successful in engaging young people from Braeview academy, local youth groups and community organisations.</p><p>One of the most successful projects in my constituency of Dundee West has been in Ardler&#8212;I refer to the Ardler in bloom project and the Ardler Environmental Group. In 2004, when the Ardler estate was newly finished, a local gardening competition was set up to encourage residents to grow their own plants and take pride in the environment. Many residents of the new village of Ardler had moved from multistorey flats that were demolished, so they had no experience of owning their own garden. The project supported those residents in their new gardens, and it has continued. The Ardler Environmental Group, which has also been supported by the urban ranger project, was established with the aim of making the area more attractive to wildlife and local communities. The people involved in such projects played a large part in Ardler estate winning a British Urban Regeneration Association award for best practice in regeneration in 2006 and the Queen's award for voluntary service this year.</p><p>Good-quality green space can be the cornerstone of the economy. Last month, I spoke about Camperdown country park, which is Dundee's top attraction. It has 400,000 visitors every year and is home to the Camperdown elm <place-holder colnum=\"4329\"/> and Scotland's last city-based red squirrel population.

We should argue for lowland Scots to be used more in the appropriate places. I hope that we can all agree on that, and I hope that the Government might take that forward.</p><p>As has been mentioned, tourism is extremely important to the economy of Scotland. Dundee is no exception to that. Each year, 780,000 tourists visit the greater Dundee area, contributing &#163;130 million to the economy. Tourism now accounts for about 7 per cent of employment in Dundee. The figure has risen recently, with the demise of Dundee's traditional manufacturing base. As we aim for a 50 per cent real-terms increase in tourism throughout Scotland by 2015, that figure is expected to grow.<place-holder colnum=\"3907\"/></p><p>Dundee was a city of jute, jam and journalism, but in the 21<sup>st</sup> century it is evolving into a vibrant, cosmopolitan destination that tourists from Scotland and further afield enjoy. The funding that is being provided by our SNP Government&#8212;which we have heard is &#163;90 million in this year alone&#8212;will help Dundee to grow as a destination for tourists.</p><p>Dundee, the city of discovery, has Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition ship at the award-winning Discovery Point and Europe's top industrial museum, the Verdant Works. It is important that Dundee has managed to tap into its industrial past as part of its tourism future. Those two attractions are good examples of that. We also have the McManus galleries, which is undergoing extensive refurbishment. It holds an art collection that is of international as well as of local importance, and I look forward to more visitors coming to Dundee to see it. Dundee is also the home of the Scottish Dance Theatre and hosts annual jazz and blues festivals. DC Thompson &amp; Co's classics the <em>The Dandy</em> and \"The Broons\" also hail from Dundee.</p><p>Dundee is developing a new image that is far removed from the run-down view that was often incorrectly associated with the city in the past. One of the most important new developments is the waterfront project. The SNP budget provides the funding to allow Dundee to complete the vital infrastructure for the central waterfront project. The waterfront project is central to the new image that Dundee will portray to its inhabitants and to the world, and the visionary project will benefit the whole of Tayside. Revamping the waterfront can boost the economy and attract tourists, as has happened in Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p><p>However, as impressive as the waterfront project will be, our best tourist attractions are our natural ones. It would be wrong not to mention the beautiful Angus glens and rural Perthshire, which Dundee finds itself nestled beside. The importance of green spaces as a draw for tourists is demonstrated by Dundee's top attraction, Camperdown country park, which in 2006 welcomed almost 400,000 visitors. I hope that the new regionally focused VisitScotland will ensure that we continue to invest in such areas to maintain popular outdoor sites.</p><p>Another major boost to tourism in the area has been delivered with the first bill of the SNP Government, which will abolish tolls on the Tay bridge. The reduction in congestion when the tolls are removed can only encourage tourists to visit the area. We want to encourage as many commuters as possible to use public transport; however, it is safe to say that all parties in Dundee&#8212;right across the political spectrum&#8212;are keen for our city to retain its reputation as a car-<place-holder colnum=\"3908\"/> friendly city. Removal of the tolls will do more than that; it will also make Dundee more welcoming to tourists in buses and will increase the niche tourist market of cyclists, who currently find Dundee city centre a nightmare to navigate when the toll congestion is at its worst.</p><p>We have heard a lot today about the year of homecoming and the celebrations to mark the 250th anniversary of our national bard's birth. Given the fact that Dundee is associated with Scotland's second-best&#8212;or, at least, second-best known&#8212;poet, William McGonagall, we should have a large part to play in the celebrations.</p><p>Evidence can be found across the globe of Dundonians who have emigrated. We see that in financial institutions such as the Dundee Bank of Canada and in the raft of places called Dundee that are to be found in South Africa, Australia and the United States of America. It is clear that Dundee's influence furth of the River Tay has spread far and wide.</p><p>The winter festival provides the perfect vehicle for a city break to Dundee. With hotel occupancy rates between St Andrew's day and Burns night currently running at less than 40 per cent, the festival period gives Dundee the greatest potential for growth.</p><p>Dundee is a growing tourism destination that has huge potential. For too long, the city has been seen, wrongly, as run down. Dundee has the potential to provide a large slice of the 50 per cent increase in tourism in Scotland to which we all aim.

The people and economies of Fife and Tayside have suffered as a result of the unfair tolls, but the Labour and Lib Dem Executive refused to remove the tolls, despite having numerous opportunities to do so during its eight long years in power. The Executive that removed tolls from the Skye bridge in 2003 and the Erskine bridge in 2006 left the people of Fife and Tayside as the only people who paid tolls.</p><p>This session of Parliament has seen a welcome&#8212;if somewhat half-hearted&#8212;U-turn by Labour and the Liberals, and I am glad that they are beginning to see the error of their ways. I welcome their support for the removal of tolls from the Forth and Tay bridges. However, it would be wrong of me not to acknowledge the role that the campaign by <em>The Courier</em> played in putting pressure on those parties to make that U-turn. It was incredible to see the U-turn spreading across the Labour and Lib Dem benches during the debate on 31 May&#8212;that was something to behold.</p><p>I will focus on the tolls on the Tay bridge, which are of most relevance to my constituents. No matter where people are trying to get to by car in Dundee, the congestion from the queues of traffic from the Tay bridge toll booths will affect them. Car and bus journeys are lengthened, and at peak times the town centre can come to a virtual standstill, with a knock-on effect on air quality. Anyone who has tried to get around Dundee in the early evening knows how bad the situation is. It is clear that the situation in Dundee is caused by cars idling in the city because they cannot reach the Tay bridge, or cannot traverse the city centre from east to west or west to east because they cannot get through the queues of traffic that are trying to get to the tolls, which often stretch right round the inner ring road.</p><p>I see that Patrick Harvie has gone, but&#8212;just to clarify&#8212;the tolls on the Tay bridge do not just slow down traffic that is crossing the bridge; they slow down traffic, including public transport, that is crossing the city. I appreciate the position of members in the Green party, but in the case of Dundee, speeding up the flow of traffic will reduce the amount of emissions that are caused by static traffic and will benefit bus users just as much as those who are travelling by car.</p><p>In 1991, when the two-way tolling was replaced by southbound-only tolling on the Tay bridge, the benefits were clear, as congestion was reduced on the south bank. On 28 March 2006, when the toll collectors were on strike, the congestion disappeared almost altogether, even in the evening. There is good evidence that congestion in Dundee is caused by tolls, and removing the tolls will alleviate that daily congestion. I assure members that the bill is warmly welcomed in my constituency, as the people anticipate an end to <place-holder colnum=\"3512\"/> the unjust tolls and, more important, the queues of traffic that they have suffered for so many years.</p><p>I also welcome the proposal in the bill that provides for central Government funding for the running of the bridges and for taking on the Tay bridge capital debt. We should remember that central Government took over the &#163;26 million Skye bridge debt, which is double the amount of the Tay bridge debt. Local councillors in Dundee, north-east Fife and Angus will also welcome the proposals to retain the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board as the body that is responsible for the day-to-day management of the bridge. There was some concern, particularly among staff, that when the tolls went the bridge board would go as well. I particularly welcome the fact that we will maintain the wealth of experience that has been built up over the years by board members, managers and&#8212;most important&#8212;members of staff.</p><p>I am pleased that the new arrangements that have been laid in place by the Tay bridge board will be arrived at with no compulsory redundancies. I hope that all members of the Parliament will welcome that, which is in stark contrast to the shoddy way in which workers were treated when the former Labour-Lib Dem Executive removed tolls from the Erskine bridge with no regard for the workers involved.</p><p>The effect on the economy was raised earlier, and it should not be underplayed. In order to benefit fully from inward investment, Dundee requires transport across the Tay bridge. North-east Fife is naturally geared towards Dundee, and we need to ensure that as much as possible of that business comes into the city centre. That will be important when the waterfront development is advanced, and we want Dundee to take maximum benefit from that&#8212;the people of north-east Fife are very welcome in our city. The removal of the burden of tolls is essential to ensure that businesses in Dundee compete on an equal footing with businesses elsewhere. The bill will remove the extra tax that the tolls add and give an extra boost to the economies of both Fife and Tayside.</p><p>We are not giving the people of Tayside and Fife anything more than what the rest of the country expects&#8212;and has, at present. There are almost 30 road crossings over tidal waters in Scotland, and tolls are charged only for the Tay and Forth bridges. There can be no argument in favour of keeping the unjust tolls, and I call on all members to support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392192", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to welcome the Scottish National Party Government's first bill, which addresses an issue of great importance to my constituents and the constituents of my colleague Shona Robison, on the other side of Dundee.

The announcements that it contains will be welcomed by communities all across Scotland, but I hope that members will forgive me for concentrating on my constituency and on why the budget is particularly good for Dundee.</p><p>I want to concentrate on three key areas. First, my constituents will be delighted to hear the Government's proposals to freeze the council tax at last year's level. The agreement with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that was signed today is historic. Since it was introduced, the council tax in Dundee has risen by an average of &#163;50 a year and has more than doubled. That increase has not been replicated in people's incomes or in our older people's pensions. With one of the highest council tax rates in Scotland, Dundonians will be particularly supportive of John Swinney's determination that the council tax be held at last year's level until we can get rid of it altogether. That will be a real-terms reduction that will provide relief to pensioners and hard-working families in Dundee and throughout Scotland.</p><p>The second point that I would like to highlight is the cabinet secretary's continued funding for Scotland's cities, by rolling up the cities growth fund, which was due to end this year. That money will allow Dundee to finish the infrastructure for the central waterfront project that is so important to my city. I was one of the councillors who were involved in agreeing to that visionary use of the cities growth fund back in 2003, so it is particularly close to my heart. The waterfront project will deliver a higher quality of life and it will improve our city's image. It will also provide new high-quality development opportunities to support economic initiatives. The economic potential of Dundee will always be held back unless the problem of our waterfront is resolved and the opportunity that it offers is realised in a visionary manner. The central waterfront project has that vision and will result in a step change not only for Dundee but for the whole city region. As I said, the allocation of money will allow for the completion of work on infrastructure. Dundee City Council is confident that the rest of the central waterfront <place-holder colnum=\"3369\"/> master plan can be self-financing as our vision is realised.</p><p>The announcement of investment will be of equal importance to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling, as well as to the greater city regions that they serve.</p><p>I said that I would concentrate on my constituency and on why the budget is particularly good news for Dundee. However, the inclusion of additional funding to enhance capacity in Dundee to support the life sciences is good news not only for Dundee&#8212;it will be welcomed by the life sciences sector across Scotland. That sector consistently punches above its weight internationally.</p><p>The University of Dundee's vision for the Scottish institute for life sciences&#8212;or SCILS&#8212;is for a new centre of excellence that is equipped and managed to the highest international standards. SCILS will attract outstanding scientists to Scotland and train the most promising young researchers to conduct world-leading biomedical research, and it will translate the outputs into new medical and commercial opportunities.</p><p>I am pleased that proposals to site the Scottish institute for life sciences in Dundee have cross-party support. We should recognise the hard work of Sir Philip Cohen in pressing the case and winning the support not only of the current First Minister but of the previous First Minister. I am delighted that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning have been able to include extra funding for life sciences in this first SNP budget.</p><p>I have focused on just three areas of the budget statement that are particularly good news for Dundee, but there are many more areas on which I could have focused. This budget is not just for Dundee but will be welcomed across Scotland. It is a historic statement that shows the implementation of the joined-up approach that previous Administrations merely talked about. The deal that is available to local government goes much further than the headline council tax freeze: it represents a sea change in the relationship between central and local government that will have a positive impact for years to come.</p><p>I want to congratulate Pat Watters and Councillor Neil Fletcher for putting the interests of local government above personal party-political interests.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391835", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Spending Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with great pleasure that I welcome the new Scottish Government's first budget.

In the past 18 months, Dundee has taken a massive jobs hit, losing more than 1,000 jobs. The labour market statistics that were published by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that, as a proportion of the resident working-age population, the claimant count&#8212;the number of people who claim jobseekers allowance&#8212;in Dundee West is 4.2 per cent, which is the highest rate in Scotland. The Scottish average is just 2.7 per cent. The unemployment rate in Dundee West is 6.7 per cent, which is above both the Scottish and the UK averages and is one of the highest rates in Scotland. Those figures provide a comparison between areas in Scotland and it is clear that my constituency is an area that needs a successful skills strategy more than most.</p><p>However, the headline figures do not tell the full story. If we flip over the question and ask how many people are working, the true extent of the problem is revealed. The employment rate in Dundee West is just 71 per cent, which is lower than the Scottish average and suggests that nearly 30 per cent of people are not in gainful employment. I acknowledge that some of those people may be on incapacity benefit or unable to work for other reasons, but the figure is still high.<place-holder colnum=\"1607\"/></p><p>The figures also fail to indicate the relatively high number of people who, although in employment, are in what most people would describe as low-paid employment, which adds to the deprivation levels in Dundee.</p><p>It is in that context that the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in Dundee in little more than a year should be considered. Tesco's decision to move its distribution depot to Livingston was followed quickly by the announcement that one of the city's biggest employers, NCR, was to shed more than 600 jobs, which was a particular blow to the city. Along with Dundee City Council, the then Executive put in place a programme to help those workers who were losing their jobs, which included the provision of help to retrain and to learn new skills that they could use to gain new employment.</p><p>Now is not the time to discuss the rights or wrongs of what happened&#8212;I pay tribute to Nicol Stephen for his involvement in trying to lessen that blow&#8212;but there was considerable disquiet among the workforce that obstacles remained in place that made it more difficult for them to access training. A number of constituents who worked for NCR have come to me for help. They wanted to work and were willing to retrain&#8212;they just wanted a chance. That is just a snapshot of what is happening in Dundee. I am sure that there are similar stories from around Scotland of people who want to get into work but who just do not have the opportunity to do so.</p><p>One of the startling statistics in the skills strategy emerged from the survey that was carried out by Futureskills Scotland, which outlines that one of the biggest challenges for many businesses is to attract appropriately skilled staff. When the survey was carried out, there were 76,700 vacancies, 30 per cent of which were skills shortage vacancies. The jobs are there; it is just that there is a mismatch in our skills base.</p><p>I remind members that, whichever figures we use, the unemployment rate in Dundee is one of the highest in Scotland. Comparison of the two sets of statistics tells us that more needs to be done to get those people who are out of work, many of whom are desperate to find a job, back into employment. We need to increase the employability of people in Scotland, by enabling them to gain new skills or to utilise and develop the skills that they have.</p><p>The most recent labour market statistics for Scotland indicate that 160,000 people who are classed as economically inactive want a job. I am pleased that in its skills strategy the Scottish Government acknowledges the importance of that wasted resource. The strategy provides a new agenda for skills and learning and will enable us to develop Scotland's skills policies in a way that addresses the country's requirements. The <place-holder colnum=\"1608\"/> strategy encompasses lifelong learning, including early years provision, schools, further and higher education, work-related learning and informal learning opportunities. The Parliament should welcome such an approach.</p><p>The 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training are of particular concern. According to the labour market statistics, 12.4 per cent of all 16 to 19-year-olds in Scotland are in the NEET group. It is imperative that those young people are not left behind and it is essential that we give them every assistance. I am pleased that the Scottish Government is developing proposals that will help those young people. It is clear that making individuals stay at school when they do not want to be there is disruptive to the kids who want to be in school.</p><p>I support the motion and I am pleased that something is being done to tackle the skills shortage in Scotland. We need more participation in learning and training if we are to increase employment and economic activity, which in turn will increase productivity and lead to economic growth, helping to tackle deprivation in my constituency and throughout Scotland. I am pleased to support the Scottish Government's proposals, which represent a valuable step in the process.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387100", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and welcome the Scottish Government's publication of its skills strategy earlier in the week.

Kate was respected for her work with groups and on committees and will be missed by many in the Parliament.

Those of us who live in cities are responsible for the overwhelming majority of energy use, whether in industry, our homes, our institutions or through transport, so we have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our energy use. Many homes in Scotland are still without proper insulation or use inefficient heating systems. I hope that the Government intends to continue to tackle that by extending grant schemes, and I hope that we will redouble our efforts to advertise them, particularly in areas where fuel poverty remains a concern.</p><p>As a Parliament that is committed across the parties to a greener Scotland, we need to determine whether there are ways that we can reduce energy consumption. One of the first things that we need to do is examine ourselves and the Parliament. I was surprised, to say the least, by the number of energy-guzzling light bulbs that we have around the Parliament. Replacing such light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs would be one of the easiest ways to save energy, and with a short payback time, so why has it not been addressed in the Parliament?</p><p>People are becoming increasingly aware of the need to be energy efficient but, in some cases, it is increasingly difficult to make choices that best serve the environment. I am talking about domestic appliances that, on the face of it, provide easy access to information on energy ratings by having such information stuck to their side. However, that information may be misleading. The energy rating system has encouraged washing machine manufacturers to move towards cold-fill-only machines to gain the maximum efficiency. Clearly, the most inefficient part of a washing machine is the heating of the water. If they use <place-holder colnum=\"660\"/> only cold water, the overall efficiency rating is driven up, so we have the strange situation whereby a washing machine that is rated AA for energy efficiency&#8212;which is high&#8212;can be less efficient than an older, inefficient washing machine that has a warm fill. We need to address that issue and ensure that we provide people with the proper information so that they can make real choices.</p><p>Although I am convinced that the biggest contribution that urban society can make towards reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is to reduce its energy consumption, I am also convinced that we can make a real contribution to green energy production. Much of the debate about renewable energy centres on harnessing the power of the wind to provide energy for our cities. That debate is often polarised as one in which people are either for or against large-scale wind farms in areas of natural beauty. I challenge that by suggesting that, with the correct support and investment, there are many possibilities for wind generation in our cities.</p><p>In Dundee, the Michelin tyre factory has successfully installed the UK's largest corporate wind energy project. The twin 2MW turbines generate around 8 million kilowatt hours of clean, green energy per year, which covers around one third of the plant's energy needs. Generating the energy on site reduces transmission costs and improves the efficiencies of the system so, as well as reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by more than 3,000 tonnes, Michelin has increased the efficiency of the Dundee factory and protected jobs in a highly competitive market.</p><p>The project required considerable investment on the part of Michelin. The turbines are close to two housing estates, and are a few hundred yards from my father's house, where I grew up. As with anything new, people were concerned. They said, \"They will be noisy, I won't be able to sleep at night and they will interfere with our television reception.\" Rather than run away in the face of public hostility, Michelin engaged with the residents of the area to win support from the vast majority of people. There will always be some people who will object to any major development, and some people remain unconvinced, although the turbines are turning and they cannot be heard above the background noise, and any problem with TV reception has been dealt with. Whether the turbines are an eyesore or a thing of beauty is a matter of opinion, but I for one am proud that Michelin has chosen to site them in Dundee and I congratulate the company on its long-sighted view. Large turbines will not be appropriate for every factory location, but Michelin has proved that an urban location is not in itself a reason to discount them.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greener Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I will take a second to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Kate Maclean.
