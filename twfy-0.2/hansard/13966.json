This is a debate that stretches beyond the chamber and I welcome the important contribution that their report makes to that wider debate as well as Barnardo&#8217;s determination to bring that public debate before Parliament.</p><p>Almost exactly a year ago, I spoke at a Holyrood child protection conference at a time when stories of abuse and exploitation of the most vulnerable members of our society were starting to be heard&#8212;stories of children and young people being exploited for their simple need for love and affection; and stories of those who could not speak to anyone about what they were suffering too often denying what was being done to them and rejecting the very support and protection that could end their misery.</p><p>As every member will have felt the first time they heard about what happened in Rotherham or Rochdale, or about what Jimmy Savile did, I felt a mixture of horror, anger and sadness and, above all, the overwhelming need to act and to act quickly. That is why I set up the ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation, with the aim of harnessing rapidly the collective need to address the issue, using the expertise of the services that work most closely with the victims of child sexual exploitation: local authorities, the Crown Office and the police, inspection bodies and key children&#8217;s organisations such as Children in Scotland, Aberlour and Barnardo&#8217;s. The group reported to ministers in December, and I have asked it to continue monitoring the work in Scotland on child sexual exploitation.</p><p>The group endorsed much of the work that is already under way in Scotland but, like the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s report, it saw that more could be done and that there was absolutely no room for complacency. Perhaps most important, the group recognised that child sexual exploitation is not a stand-alone issue that can be fixed through a series of eye-catching initiatives. Sexual exploitation is one of the most vile forms of child abuse and one of the most pernicious attacks on a child&#8217;s or young person&#8217;s wellbeing. For those reasons, we need to ensure that we have in place the strongest approach to child protection and to supporting our children&#8217;s wellbeing.</p><p>Over the past few years, that has been our ambition on child protection. We have modernised our unique children&#8217;s hearings system through new legislation. We undertook a major review of our child protection procedures and produced new child protection guidance, which we are further refreshing with a dedicated section on child sexual exploitation. We developed Scotland&#8217;s first comprehensive risk assessment toolkit to help professionals to identify signs of abuse and neglect. We are working with Barnardo&#8217;s on dedicated tools to better identify sexual exploitation.</p><p>At the same time, we are putting in place a unique and internationally lauded approach to placing children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s wellbeing at the centre of service design, planning and delivery. I am sure that I do not need to tell members about getting it right for every child, nor about how, under the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, all children and young people up to the age of 18 will have access to a named person, who will be able to pick up and act on the signs of potential abuse. For children and young people with particular needs and vulnerabilities, services will now have to plan and work together to support them through a child&#8217;s plan.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank David Stewart and all the members of the Public Petitions Committee for their comprehensive work on child sexual exploitation.

I mentioned that we have done a number of pieces of work to refresh guidance. In November 2012, we published the &#8220;National Framework for Child Protection learning and development in Scotland 2012&#8221; and the risk assessment framework. More specifically on the point about health professionals, in December 2012 we updated the pink book, which is for health professionals, on child protection issues. I hope that many of the issues that the member refers to about how we can empower and help health professionals are captured in that pink book, which was published just over a year ago.</p><p>We need to keep under review the services that directly support those who experience child sexual exploitation. We need to know which services have the best impact and how they can be sustained within a service framework that must address a wide range of child protection issues. We also need to understand why some services, not least refuges for runaways, have struggled to remain sustainable. I will therefore ask the ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation to explore how we can better understand and promote the most effective services to support children and young people. I hope that that will give some comfort to the committee and its convener, given his remarks about investigating further issues to do with refuges.</p><p>Against that background of how we are addressing the needs of children and young people overall, we have also taken a range of actions across Government to address child sexual exploitation. We have committed to understanding the issue better because, like the committee, we recognise the gaps in our knowledge of such abuse. We commissioned the University of Bedfordshire to examine the scale and nature of child sexual exploitation in Scotland. We have also supported work, which is currently being piloted in Forth valley, to improve ways of identifying and collating information on child sexual exploitation cases at a local level. Other areas might require more research, and we will continue to review such research needs.</p><p>We are working to ensure that all local areas have procedures and protocols in place to address child sexual exploitation. In the national child protection guidance, we will set out our expectations that every local area has such a protocol and will develop a national good practice model.</p><p>Schools also have a particularly important role in identifying and preventing child sexual exploitation. National work is helping to support that. Children and young people receive education on topics such as developing appropriate relationships, protection from abuse and keeping themselves safe from harm from early on in their education right up until they leave school.</p><p>In that context, the work on improving internet safety among children and young people is critical. In early December, the Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland&#8217;s Languages and I chaired a summit on internet safety, which drew in experts from education, the third sector, the private sector and law-enforcement bodies. The members of that summit also included Jackie Brock, who is involved with the ministerial working group, to ensure that there is a sequencing of knowledge about what action we need to take. They made a set of recommendations that I have asked the Scottish stakeholder group on internet safety to develop into a series of practical actions that will be reported back to ministers before the end of the year.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Margaret Mitchell for the clear interest that she takes in working to ensure that some of the issues that we are discussing are dealt with adequately.

It is a great tool&#8212;it is a wonderful thing to have access to&#8212;but we need to ensure that safety is paramount for young people and that parents know a wee bit more about what their children and young people are doing.</p><p>Child sexual exploitation is also a crime&#8212;one that cannot be tolerated&#8212;and it is important that we do all that we can to ensure that the perpetrators of these terrible crimes are brought to justice and that the risk is properly managed in custody and in the community. A critical element of that is our new single police force. Protecting the public&#8212;in particular, the most vulnerable in Scotland&#8217;s communities&#8212;is a key priority for Police Scotland.</p><p>Another essential element is having the right legal framework to pursue the crimes. We have strengthened the law on sex crimes by introducing the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009. That modernised the law and replaced a confusing and complex patchwork of common-law and statutory offences that had developed over many decades with the single statutory framework.</p><p>We have also improved Scotland&#8217;s sexual offences prevention order and risk of sexual harm order regimes by expanding the range of conditions that a court may attach to an order. Such orders are available to assist with the management of sex offenders and individuals without a relevant conviction who are assessed as posing a risk of sexual harm.</p><p>In addition, the Crown Office has developed a team of expert prosecutors in the national sexual crimes unit specialising in the investigation and prosecution of serious sexual crimes.</p><p>We understand the frustration of those who want to do more on that difficult area of crime detection and prosecution. A single, dedicated police force and a Crown Office with specialist expertise can build on our robust legal framework and make important strides in disrupting such crimes in the future, but we will continue to review how the laws are being used and how practice can be improved.</p><p>I turn to whether we need a national child sexual exploitation strategy. If that means yet another time-consuming review of what we have done, I do not think that we do need one. We have had a review of what we are doing and I believe that we know what needs to be done. What we must do is act upon that knowledge. I will ask the ministerial working group to corral that collective effort within a national action plan&#8212;a document that will be focused on the real and practical things that we are doing and must continue to do in this area.</p><p>Once again, I thank David Stewart and the Public Petitions Committee for their work.

A number of valuable points have been raised and there is agreement that child sexual exploitation is an issue that needs to be tackled, as Clare Adamson and many other members have stated.</p><p>There should be absolutely no complacency about child sexual exploitation. Indeed, that is recognised in our 2010 child protection guidance, which has been revised to cover key areas of child sexual exploitation, including online grooming and child trafficking. We had already decided to refresh our national guidance further, but I thank the committee for its work and contributions on the issue.</p><p>Members have raised a number of points and I hope to cover most of those mentioned. David Stewart spoke about the need to have a better definition of child sexual exploitation to aid understanding of what that is. Liam McArthur and others also made that point. We have worked with Barnado&#8217;s to update the definition. That will feature in the new section on child sexual exploitation, which will be published in the coming months in the newly refreshed national child protection guidance. I hope that that gives some comfort to those who have sought that better and much more widely understood definition.</p><p>Another theme was the need for a new national strategy. As I said in my opening speech, we need action. However, I am glad that Jackson Carlaw shares my concerns that a further review could risk delaying action to tackle what is a pernicious, vile but also highly complex crime.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s briefing states that a national action plan would set out the actions that we need and bring together the good work done. Many members have spoken about the good work and practices that are under way. A plan could also include the recommendations from the ministerial working group and the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>Aberlour&#8217;s briefing highlighted that a national strategy might also necessitate a prolonged period of further consultation and delay measures that need to be taken. Jamie Hepburn made that point. Nevertheless, the good recommendations that came from the report will be considered thoroughly by me and the rest of the Government.</p><p>Many members mentioned Aberlour&#8217;s decision to close its young runaway refuge. We need to bottom out and better understand why services have struggled to remain sustainable. Indeed, Jayne Baxter made the point that we must understand properly why such services have not been as widely used as we would perhaps have liked or hoped that they would be.</p><p>On the Parliament&#8217;s behalf, I will ask the expert group that has just reviewed child sexual exploitation to review the committee&#8217;s recommendations. I will also ensure that the review includes a better understanding of what services are needed and works with local areas on their own provision.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw talked about risk of sexual harm orders. I said in my opening remarks that the Scottish Government has strengthened the laws around sex crimes. I am confident that Police Scotland shares our commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens and that it will consider carefully the committee&#8217;s recommendations around risk of sexual harm orders, including any improvements that can be made. We are also considering whether there is scope more generally to extend the protection that is offered by such orders.</p><p>As others have mentioned, Graeme Pearson&#8217;s comments and expertise on the issue were very useful in the debate. I agree that Mr Gwynne&#8217;s role in CEOP offers us opportunities in Scotland.</p><p>Education has been a substantial theme in the debate. Graeme Pearson raised the issue of online safety, and Angus MacDonald and Jamie Hepburn mentioned concerns about that in their speeches. The recent summit on internet safety that I mentioned in an intervention on Graeme Pearson identified that better information sharing between professionals, parents and young people is key to improving online safety, and the Scottish stakeholder group on child internet safety will take forward the recommendations of the summit this year.</p><p>Respectme and ChildLine are Government funded and are working hard with others to help people to tackle bullying behaviour in all forms and to deal with its consequences, while our schools will talk to children and young people about broader online risks. In relation to looked-after children, respectme is working with local authorities and residential care establishments to build the capacity and confidence to deal with all bullying. That is aligned to our much broader national approach.</p><p>Advice has been given to schools on how to encourage safe and responsible use of personal mobile technology in school and beyond, which is designed to protect staff, children and young people from harassment and abuse. That includes advice on the dangers of uploading indecent images, which can arise from the misuse of such technology. Nevertheless, an important balance needs to be struck. We must not overdramatise the safe use of the internet and push young people into being more secretive about their internet use. If we are to get the action absolutely right, young people&#8217;s voices must be heard, and a key point that has come through is that we should not overdramatise internet safety and risk more young people being pushed into unsafe practices.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have heard some powerful speeches in a very constructive debate and I thank the members for their positive contributions.

I also thank David Torrance for bringing the debate to the chamber and congratulate him on doing so. Like Liz Smith, I remember his celebration debate that welcomed 25 years of Fife Gingerbread. I thank the other members who have shown their support for this excellent organisation. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the families who are supported by Fife Gingerbread when I launched its gateway project back in May 2013. I am delighted that the organisation is extending its reach even further and is developing its innovative approach. I congratulate the group on its award.</p><p>Our aspiration is to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up in and to make Scotland a fairer country for all children to thrive in. We want a child-friendly country that possesses a culture that is supportive of all parents and carers and that values their crucial and important role. Fife Gingerbread is helping us to achieve that vision. I think that everyone agrees that families need to feel supported, not only by our public services but by their families and communities. Organisations such as Gingerbread play a crucial role in supporting our parents, carers and families right across Scotland.</p><p>As I have said, I have heard about and seen at first hand the good work that Fife Gingerbread is doing. I remain impressed by the passion and dedication of Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s team. David Torrance described how they go above and beyond to help the families they work with. The quotes that Annabelle Ewing gave about the caring staff, the great activities that go on and the teen parent project being the highlight of the week speak volumes about the high regard in which the project and Fife Gingerbread are held.</p><p>Liz Smith, Rod Campbell and Claire Baker rightly praised the group. They talked about the help that it has provided to the 340 families who have received the one-to-one service and the important preventative work that the talented Gingerbread staff do. Claire Baker also referred to the fact that the teen project is an age-appropriate group. I know from speaking to many teenage parents that they sometimes feel intimidated about going to groups, so it is great that Gingerbread has an age-appropriate group where people can get the support that they need. The fact that so many Fife politicians have talked passionately about the project shows how important it is right across the region.</p><p>I welcome the investment in the teen parent project by the Big Lottery Fund. Claire Baker and others have noted how big an achievement that award has been. Although parenting can be a wonderful life-enhancing experience for many young people, it can be a real struggle for others. As the mother of a very lively wee three-year-old who had his first day at nursery school today, I know that being a parent is a great privilege but can also be a real challenge.</p><p>The Government recognises without question the importance of ensuring that parents, whatever their age, feel empowered, valued, supported and confident in their ability to care for their children. That is why, in October 2012, we published the national parenting strategy, with more than 80 commitments to strengthen, help and support parents throughout Scotland. We want parents, carers and families to know that, whatever their needs and wherever they live, practical support is available.</p><p>That parenting strategy was backed up with &#163;18 million-worth of investment to better co-ordinate information and access to advice and support wherever they are needed. Good parenting is every child&#8217;s right and every parent&#8217;s responsibility. We want to embed those rights and responsibilities in everyday life.</p><p>All parents and carers can feel vulnerable and unsure at times but our teenage parents, who sometimes lack the confidence to seek support, often feel that vulnerability most. Sometimes, those feelings of uncertainty can be resolved easily by good advice. However, for others, the challenges are more complex and longer term.</p><p>Either way, we want to support all parents, families and communities to build better lives for themselves and their children to ensure that every child has the best start in life. That is why our parenting strategy is important, as is investment in family support.</p><p>The Fife Gingerbread teen parent project shares the same goals as us. Its work focuses on giving teenage mothers and fathers the support that they need to establish their parenting skills, and it works closely with other services that are already available within communities to complement and promote their use. Such informal but personal support is one of the things that teen parents need most in their lives and it can really help them to adjust to their new roles.</p><p>David Torrance spoke about how the project works in collaboration with the other services that I mentioned and across the third sector. That collaborative work is paying dividends for families throughout Fife. However, unfortunately, many young mums and dads face additional stresses and strains in their lives. David Torrance and Mary Fee described poverty, deprivation and the low self-esteem that it is necessary for us to try to tackle. Annabelle Ewing described the impact of welfare reform.</p><p>Stigma, isolation and the lack of age-appropriate information have the potential to disenfranchise many teenage parents. Projects such as the Fife Gingerbread teen parent project ensure that they are not left alone to face the challenges of caring for their children and help them to be the best that they can be. I am pleased to hear from David Torrance about the evaluation of the project, which has enhanced the ability of parents to parent well.</p><p>The project will also complement the good work of the family nurse partnerships in Fife. I have also visited those partnerships and heard about the benefits that they are providing for new young parents. I very much welcome the recent announcement from the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Alex Neil, that that programme will be rolled out across Scotland to help many more young parents who need a bit of support and advice.</p><p>In addition to that support for families, our vision for childcare is ambitious. It includes the expansion of childcare to a minimum of 600 flexible hours a year for all three and four-year-olds and for two-year-olds who are looked after or are under a kinship care order. Those proposals are set out in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill that Liz Smith rightly points out is going through stage 2.</p><p>I am also delighted that the debate follows the one in which the First Minister announced a further expansion in childcare provision for our most vulnerable two-year-olds. Coupled with the proposals that are already in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, that means that we will provide childcare for around 15 per cent of two-year-olds from 2014 and 27 per cent from 2015.</p><p>We are also committed to extending the offer of 600 hours of funded early learning and childcare further in the long term. As we set out in &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland&#8221;, we plan to provide 1,140 hours to all children from age one to starting school. That is our commitment to build a high-quality, universal system for all children.</p><p>All those commitments will build on the legacy that we have and the good work to help to support families that our partners throughout Scotland, including Fife Gingerbread, are already doing to help us to move towards making Scotland the best place in the world to grow up in.</p><p>I thank David Torrance and others who have contributed to tonight&#8217;s debate. I am only sorry that he did not manage to sing tonight, although he has the offer of a duet and I look forward to any YouTube evidence that might come from that.</p><p>I wish Fife Gingerbread teen parent project all the very best for the future and thank David Torrance again for raising the matter in the Parliament.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:44.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22825495", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As this is the first debate that I have been involved in this year, I wish everyone a happy new year.

All those who contributed yesterday recognised how important it is to give time, commitment and care to helping our young people to live the most fulfilled lives that they can, and to reach their full potential. That is the essence of good youth work: the focused and passionate commitment to giving young people the chance to make the most of their lives.</p><p>I am therefore grateful that Alex Johnstone has brought the example of the Arbroath CAFE project to the attention of Parliament. In his opening speech, he gave us a vivid picture of the project&#8217;s work and its impact on the young people who benefit from the project, and on the wider community. It is also good to learn about a Scottish football success in a world cup, which is unusual and something that we should celebrate.</p><p>The breadth of activities that the CAFE provides is impressive. It provides that all-important drop-in centre that gives young people a safe and welcoming environment in the community, and is the basis for a number of projects that provide real development opportunities, particularly for those youngsters who face some difficulties or serious challenges in their lives. As Graeme Dey said, it is clear that the project is very dear to Arbroath&#8217;s heart. The number of people that it helps is impressive.</p><p>It also provides the basis for connections into the wider community by hosting other projects such as the mother and toddler group, and an employability drop-in service in conjunction with the local jobcentre. Those connections are considerable. According to the local Evening Telegraph, the project works with health visitors, social workers, criminal justice offender services, nurses, police, firefighters, parents, carers, teachers, Angus Council community learning and development, Angus Council recreational team for people with disability, the jobcentre, local businesses, the Round Table, the Rotary clubs, the Royal British Legion, and churches, to name just a few. In that way, projects such as the Arbroath CAFE project embody many of the principles that we talk about in abstract terms here in the chamber and in wider political discourse.</p><p>We often talk about prevention and early intervention. Projects such as the Arbroath CAFE project are perfect examples of prevention and early intervention in practice. As Anne McTaggart said, by providing positive channels for the energy and enthusiasm of young people, such projects divert them from finding less constructive activities, even where the temptations and opportunities to do so are strong.</p><p>Richard Baker, Alex Johnstone and Graeme Dey described the passion and leadership of the founder of the project, former sheriff Norrie Stein. Judging by their comments, he has clearly left a mark on all of them. Norrie Stein said:</p><p>&#8220;The CAF&#201; Project has changed people&#8217;s lives, there&#8217;s no question about that. It was very rare to see anybody with a connection to the CAF&#201; Project appear in court&#8212;thereby breaking a family tradition in some cases.&#8221;</p><p>We know that early intervention and diversion works. The whole-systems approach to youth justice has played a major contribution in the significant decline in youth offending in the past few years. It appears that the Arbroath CAFE project is well and truly doing that in practice.</p><p>We talk about the idea of wellbeing. I know that Angus Council has developed the wellbeing web, which is being used throughout Scotland. It is a good time for us to stop and reflect on how many of the safe, healthy, achieving, nurtured, active, respected, responsible and included&#8212;or SHANARRI&#8212;wellbeing indicators a project such as the Arbroath CAFE project achieves. It provides a safe environment, free from some of the more corrupting and destructive influences that can bear on young people as they reach their teenage years. It promotes healthy and active living, seeking to harness young people&#8217;s energy through sports-related activities. By providing services for the more disadvantaged youngsters and promoting volunteering, it is all about nurture, responsibility and inclusion. Such projects thrive on the respect that they afford young people and the respect that they get in return.</p><p>We often talk in the chamber about an assets-based approach. We know that the best way to secure the long-term improvements in life chances that we want to see is through the building up and strengthening of people and their local communities. In the long run, it is not about treating young people&#8217;s needs but about giving them and their families the strength, resilience and opportunity to tackle life&#8217;s challenges. That is true of communities, too. Locally-based initiatives designed to meet local needs and drawing on the inspiration and commitment of local people are at the core of that approach.</p><p>We often talk about multi-agency collaboration. The list of those with whom the project works is clear evidence that all the agencies involved in helping and supporting young people work best when they are brought together and work together.</p><p>I understand that there are issues of funding uncertainty. That has been clear in reports in the local press. I am aware that the project has just secured funding of &#163;3,000 from the Bank of Scotland community fund, which should secure the project&#8217;s continuation until July next year. However, I am told that Angus Council has since been offering the project financial and other sorts of advice to help it to become more sustainable and look for funding from a range of sources. I know that a number of potential funding organisations are willing to discuss the future with the organisation and also that the project has launched a public appeal. I wish the project well in its efforts and hope that Graeme Dey takes part in the bag pack that he described.</p><p>As a Government, we are keen to see that projects that contribute to the wellbeing of young people and to local communities can be sustained as far as possible. In yesterday&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate, I referred to the range of support that the Government provides to youth work organisations and to the range of funding mechanisms by which they can seek support. That includes cashback for communities, which is an example of a funding opportunity that the Arbroath CAFE project should definitely pursue.</p><p>Again, I am sincerely grateful to Alex Johnstone for bringing to the chamber the Arbroath CAFE project, both as an example of the huge range and wealth of youth work projects across the country, and as a reminder of the challenges that we face in difficult times in maintaining the support that our young people need and deserve.</p><p>It has been clear from the passionate contributions from Richard Baker, Graeme Dey and Anne McTaggart that we need to sing loudly about the contribution of youth workers to our country, their talent and commitment, and the support that they give to our young people to enable them to go on to lead fulfilling lives. The Arbroath CAFE project is undoubtedly a good example of such work. The respect that it has gathered from right across the political spectrum is testament to the work that it puts in to ensure that young people in Arbroath are given all the opportunities that they need and deserve in life.

Its members use their skills as youth workers to help young people to realise their own talents in many ways, including through music, as Kezia Dugdale pointed out when she talked about her experience of working with the Canongate Youth Project.</p><p>YouthLink&#8217;s most recent survey highlighted that national voluntary youth work organisations work with a phenomenal 390,000 young people approximately at any one time. When we add the wider voluntary youth work sector and local authorities, the numbers are even greater.</p><p>Youth work represents great value and embodies the ethos of preventative spending and early intervention that is a hallmark of this Government. It helps young people to make positive choices in their transition to adulthood and it builds capacity and skills for further learning and employability.</p><p>It also enriches childhood and adolescence. The young-at-heart Stewart Stevenson talked about burning baked potatoes at the scouts instead of chasing girls. My experience of youth work includes being a member of the Girls Brigade. My mum and others ran the local club, supported by Youth Scotland, which was then Youth Club Scotland. I also attended a couple of young farmers club meetings, so while Stewart Stevenson burns the baked tatties, I can help with the stock judging, if he wants me to.</p><p>It is important that we recognise the importance of the uniformed groups that were mentioned by Stewart Stevenson and Kezia Dugdale, who highlighted the phenomenal work of the girl guides.</p><p>Members have enjoyed talking about youth work in their own constituencies. Youth work and community learning and development happen in almost every city, town, village and community in Scotland. I am grateful to George Adam for highlighting excellent practice in his constituency. Despite being a St Johnstone fan, I am happy to endorse the work that St Mirren Football Club carries out in his area.</p><p>I am delighted that we have been able to support in some way the three groups that George Adam&#8217;s motion refers to. We are supporting Renfrew YMCA, which is creating an exciting social enterprise project that is being developed and led by young people. We are supporting the 20th and 74th Renfrewshire scout groups to provide activity weekends for about 30 young people, who will learn new skills and gain qualifications in various outdoor challenges. The play the game initiative in Paisley has also received funding to develop the skills of vulnerable young people through a range of theatre-related activities. That is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the innovation, creativity and passion in the youth work and CLD sector, as supported by YouthLink.</p><p>During my time in my ministerial role, I have never ceased to be amazed by the talent of the sector and its ability to enhance young people&#8217;s outcomes. In my constituency, I have seen first hand the excellent work of the universal connections programme, the uniformed groups, the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s award scheme, Covey Befriending and Biggar Youth Project, which deliver services that contribute to young people&#8217;s wellbeing, confidence and life chances.</p><p>Let us not forget&#8212;from the comments that members have made this evening, I do not think that we will&#8212;that such opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s young people are often delivered by a talented army of volunteers, who give up their precious time to support and nurture our young people. Some of those volunteers are young people who are supporting their peers and giving back to their communities. Mary Scanlon noted the importance of highlighting such work through our yearly celebration at the youth work awards.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to helping youth work and CLD to thrive. Over the next two years, we are providing grants that total about &#163;6.9&#160;million to national youth work organisations. That will support them to build capacity and improve outcomes for young people.</p><p>Since 2007, the cashback for communities programme has invested more than &#163;74&#160;million in projects and facilities for young people and the communities that they live in. More than &#163;10.9&#160;million of that has been channelled to youth work through YouthLink Scotland and Youth Scotland.</p><p>This year, the young start fund has allocated more than &#163;3&#160;million to youth projects from an indicative budget of &#163;5.5&#160;million. We continue to work with the youth work sector to deliver programmes such as active girls, stand up to sectarianism, the no knives, better lives campaign and activity agreements. Education Scotland also distributes small grants for implementation of the CLD strategic guidance for community planning partnerships to a range of organisations, including those that deliver youth work.</p><p>At the heart of the draft youth work strategy, which will be published this week, is a desire to empower young people&#8212;such as those in Maud who were engaging in the planning process and whom Stewart Stevenson mentioned&#8212;as well as to respect, recognise and promote children&#8217;s rights and to get things right for every child and young person. The launch will mark the beginning of a national discussion on the strategy&#8217;s implementation with the youth work and CLD sector and&#8212;importantly&#8212;with young people.</p><p>The strategy will determine how best to realise our ambitions to maximise young people&#8217;s life chances, to harness the value of youth work and to demonstrate how it contributes to the national outcomes and many policies across the Government. The strategy recognises youth work as a key and distinctive component of our present and future agendas for young people. The Government recognises that universal youth work and more targeted specific programmes have equal validity and importance.</p><p>We recognise that&#8212;in line with the Christie commission recommendations&#8212;more and more youth services are being delivered through partnership. As George Adam pointed out, in recognition of YouthLink&#8217;s national role, I have asked it to lead the national discussion, in partnership with Education Scotland and the Government, and to work with us to develop an implementation plan.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s future and the future of its young people are bright. We are introducing new legislation to strengthen services for children and young people. We have a raft of exciting events next year to inspire and engage young people, such as the homecoming, the Commonwealth games, the Ryder cup and, of course, the referendum on our future, in which young people who are aged 16 and 17 will for the first time be able to vote.</p><p>We have a strong and imaginative youth work and CLD sector that supports and empowers young people. One of its leaders is YouthLink, and I congratulate Jim Sweeney and the entire YouthLink team on their recent Education Scotland review.</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to lend my whole-hearted support to the motion and, in doing so, to recognise the invaluable contribution that YouthLink Scotland and youth work more generally make to the wellbeing and prosperity of Scotland&#8217;s young people.

Our putting getting it right for every child on a statutory footing will provide a mechanism for early and effective intervention. GIRFEC&#8217;s principles underpin everything that we do and they place children at the heart of the design and delivery of services, aid improvement in permanence planning and delivery and, importantly, value the voice of the child.</p><p>There are encouraging signs that outcomes are improving gradually across almost all indicators. The main findings in the most recent publication on Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children show that looked-after young people who leave school are increasingly entering positive destinations. Some 75 per cent of looked-after young people who left school during 2011-12 were in a positive destination three months after they left school. The children&#8217;s social work statistics show that the rate of increase in the total number of looked-after children continues to slow, but that earlier and more frequent interventions can result in more children coming into care and, in particular, to their becoming looked after at home. The challenges around improving outcomes for that group are well known. Therefore, the partner policy aim here is early permanence.</p><p>Both early intervention and early permanence are needed if we are to meet our aims of reducing the number of children on long-term supervision requirements and increasing the numbers who find secure legal permanence. A focus on those two areas in the years ahead will enable us to achieve an effective, affordable and swift system of intervention and substitute care that wraps around the child. The benefits of investing in early intervention are fully realised when quality services are provided. We know all about the positive societal, emotional, educational and health impacts of early intervention, and there is economic evidence that every &#163;1 that is invested in cause can save &#163;9 in cure.</p><p>We are seeing a trend of children becoming looked after younger, which shows that social workers are acting more quickly to assess and intervene. We believe that social workers are right to take early decisions about children becoming looked after. We know from our work with the sector, including through the practice exchange workshops that the centre for excellence for looked-after children in Scotland has held, that social workers are feeling increasingly confident about using relevant evidence from previous interventions with families to hasten timescales for subsequent children. We support that approach; we want families to thrive, not just survive.</p><p>We are also making progress on permanence, with the number of children who are adopted from care increasing and the number of permanence orders rising year on year since their introduction.</p><p>However, too many children still remain on supervision for far too long, with all the uncertainty and distress that goes with that. To reflect our commitment to permanence, we will in the coming months publish a care and permanence strategy that will set out the strategic framework for our work. It will recognise that far-reaching improvements in delivering early permanence for children can be made only by taking a whole-system approach that involves all those who contribute to the permanence process, including social work, wider community planning partnerships, children&#8217;s hearings and the courts. It will also include the voice of the child.</p><p>In addition, we will launch a permanence and care excellence&#8212;PACE&#8212;programme, which will work in two geographical areas and will use improvement science to develop improvement projects that look at all aspects of a child&#8217;s journey to permanence. It will focus on the child&#8217;s experience and will bring together local authorities, children&#8217;s hearings and the courts to identify barriers and delays, and to develop and test solutions. Those programmes will provide a powerful opportunity to deliver real improvement on the ground. By bringing the relevant partners together, the projects will address the interactions between systems in delivering permanence and will enable us to share learning across Scotland.</p><p>I turn my focus to the workforce. The Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to improving the quality of children&#8217;s social services centres on the needs of the child and the support that is given to professionals to make good judgments, and on continuously learning from what works. The Scottish Government fully realises the importance of developing a competent, confident and valued workforce, as is evidenced through the work of the Scottish Social Services Council and the investment that we make in other organisations, such as the Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services and CELCIS.</p><p>The SSSC provides various means of support to the sector and is, in partnership with a range of stakeholders, taking forward two further strands of activity to progress and support workforce development. That work will see the development of a national learning strategy for all practitioners, which will provide a framework for learning at qualifying and post-qualifying levels, and a career development pathway to support learning and skills throughout a career. In addition, a review will be carried out of the social work degree to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of students and employers now and in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, along with the chief social work adviser, I have established a social work strategic forum, which brings together partners from academia, the unions, the regulators and the Association of Directors of Social Work. It will allow us to move the sector forward strategically, and its work will include workforce support and continued engagement with front-line practitioners, among other things.</p><p>The inquiry also highlighted the need for more detailed information to be collected in order to provide a fuller picture of looked-after children&#8217;s outcomes, and to allow judgments to be made on whether interventions have been successful. The Scottish Government is currently working to review CLAS&#8212;children looked after statistics&#8212;data so that we can ensure that the data that we collect can be analysed to inform practitioners and policy making. The review is to be completed by the end of the year and should contribute to our understanding of service delivery and help us to articulate and anticipate financial implications for service providers.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s attention and report have been incredibly useful in ensuring that we do not take the foot off the gas when it comes to ensuring the very best for our looked-after children and young people. The committee has indicated&#8212;as the convener has done&#8212;that the systems and policies that we have should not be abolished. However, I believe that we must allow our approaches time to gain ground and to achieve the desired culture change and associated improvements. The challenge is about mobilising our combined efforts and resources more effectively, and directing more of them at families earlier to make it easier for practitioners to deliver involved family support.</p><p>GIRFEC is the policy and strategic framework that overlays our approach to all children who are in need or at risk. A range of interactions take place between concerned agencies, but what should unite them is the fundamental belief that every child has the right to expect the best start in life.</p><p>This is a difficult and complex subject area, but I do not doubt the passion and commitment of everyone in the chamber and across the relevant sectors to do our utmost to inculcate change and demand improvement. The issue is too important to get wrong, and we cannot be content with mediocrity. I look forward to the debate and to continuing to work with the committee on the journey to do our very best for our looked-after children.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Neil Findlay needs to consider his tone during this debate, which is about trying to work constructively together on this important issue.

I do not wish to rehearse previous debates about the named person, but I want to correct some members&#8217; misunderstanding of the issue. It is not a scheme for a social worker for every child and it will not dilute the role of the parent. It is about a support network for parents that will have a light touch, and will knit together information about a child to ensure that appropriate interventions can be made. As has been proven in the Highlands, the results have shown a reduction in inappropriate referrals to reporters, a greater ability to target resources at the most vulnerable, and the ability to redeploy saved resource into bolstering services. If that holistic approach is delivered throughout Scotland, it will have a hugely positive impact for children, particularly those whom we are talking about today.</p><p>That leads me on to talk about the voice of the child, which has been a strong theme. Colin Beattie, Jayne Baxter, Clare Adamson, the committee convener, Joan McAlpine and George Adam all mentioned the importance of hearing the voice of the child, and it has had a profound impact on members who have had the privilege of listening to our looked-after young people. Those real-life stories add poignancy to the crude statistics and remind us of the impact of our decisions on young people. It is always impressive to hear from young people who have been through the care system about how keen they are to put something back into the system that will make improvements so that other young people do not have to suffer the same problems that they have had to deal with.</p><p>I want to mention two young people to whom I listened at a recent LACSIG event at which we launched the staying put guidance for young looked-after people who are going through aftercare. I heard about two different experiences of the care journey, one of which was less positive and one of which was very positive indeed. That shows that we can get things right for people. We need that good practice to become the norm as opposed to the exception.</p><p>Joan McAlpine talked about the children&#8217;s hearings system, and I agree that the new national system gives an opportunity&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am always happy to take interventions from members who have contributed to the debate.

It is apt to note that, given the topic of the debate.</p><p>I thank everyone who has contributed to developing the bill so far, not least the members of the Education and Culture Committee for their work and their comprehensive stage 1 report. I also thank the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and the Finance Committee for their consideration of aspects of the bill.</p><p>I thank everyone who commented on the bill, especially the 2,400 children and young people and the 1,500 parents who provided their views. A range of opinions have been expressed. Many have been constructive and probing. That can only ensure that such a landmark bill will be examined, be improved and, ultimately, have the profound positive impact on children and young people that we all want it to have.</p><p>Today is an opportunity to take an overview of what the Parliament wishes the bill to achieve. I will start by discussing the principles that lie at the heart of not only the bill but our approach to improving the lives of children and young people.</p><p>The bill rests on five simple principles. First, it declares our collective commitment to making Scotland the best place in the world in which to grow up. It will establish in statute our shared responsibility for ensuring that our children have the best start in life and access to what they need to succeed as they grow and develop. Through its focus on what has been tried and on what we know works in our getting it right for every child approach, the bill builds on our renowned Scottish tradition of putting children at the centre of services and ensuring that their rights are upheld.</p><p>Next year is the 50th anniversary of the Kilbrandon report, which set the foundation for our children&#8217;s hearings system. I can think of no more fitting way of commemorating that than by passing a bill that so thoroughly embodies the principles of Kilbrandon.</p><p>The second principle is that shared responsibility should be achieved by working with parents and carers to provide the caring and supportive environments that our children should have. The bill aims to make public services more responsive to needs and sensitive to working with families. Our children deserve nothing less.</p><p>That will require a change in culture, systems and practice. The framework for that change is GIRFEC, which has been repeatedly endorsed by the Parliament, most recently in September. GIRFEC has been tested; it works. As the committee found in its evidence, the benefits to children and families are clear in those parts of Scotland that are furthest along with its implementation. As Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland said in its submission to the committee:</p><p>&#8220;We ... welcome the proposals to put elements of GIRFEC into law. GIRFEC has been a great success where it has been fully implemented and it is right that the Bill should seek to secure its wider adoption.&#8221;</p><p>The third principle in the bill is acknowledgement that we must continue to improve how we support our most vulnerable children and young people. The challenge that the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s report of its inquiry into taking children into care has set is one that none of us takes lightly. The bill rises to that challenge by making it easier for children who need to be looked after to stay in their families through the kinship care order; by extending the support that is available to care leavers; and by ensuring that the wider public sector understands our shared corporate duty in relation to those who have been in care.</p><p>Moreover, the bill recognises that, for some children, we need to respond more quickly to the terrible risk of abuse and neglect. We are all familiar with the tragic stories in the media of children who were below the radar, the signals on whom were not picked up or acted on, and in relation to whom the need to act would have been apparent only to someone who had access to all the relevant information, which was spread among a number of different organisations. As I said on 25 September, the recent tragic case of Daniel Pelka highlights the importance of professionals putting the child&#8217;s interests at the heart of what they do and communicating their concerns. We can never prevent every case of abuse and neglect, but our bill will ensure that our services are better placed to identify and act on any concerns before those cases, too, become tragedies.</p><p>The fourth principle is the very simple idea that services to support our children and young people are better when they are planned jointly. That idea underpins our proposals for joint planning of services by local authorities and health boards, and it is equally well planted in the planning that we expect to be done for individual children who need additional support from services. We do not need scores of unco-ordinated plans across different services and professionals. Children need services that work together with one another and with their families.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to open the debate on the general principles of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.

We must ensure that those services meet the needs and wishes of families. With the resources and powers that we have now, we have made a start on transforming childcare.

That first step should be recognised. We can look at what Reform Scotland has said, which will contribute to the wider debate that we must have in this country about how we transform childcare.</p><p>Those are the principles that steer our proposals. I am pleased that in its report the committee agreed that the bill&#8217;s principles are sound, and I am pleased that the bill will set our country on a path towards becoming the best place in the world in which to grow up&#8212;a Scotland that takes active and shared responsibility for the wellbeing of our children and young people and that recognises the continuing challenges and is never complacent.

We agree with Ken Norrie, who said:</p><p>&#8220;to incorporate the convention into the domestic legal system of Scotland would be bad policy, bad practice and bad law.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 3 September 2013; c 2682.]</p><p>We recognise that the committee feels that there is scope for the current ministerial duties to be strengthened.

I note the committee&#8217;s comments about areas in which the practical implementation of GIRFEC needs further clarification and support from the Scottish Government. We will seek to clarify, through guidance in many cases, many of the issues that are raised in the report. On resources, we have set out our estimate of costs in the financial memorandum, but we recognise that costs will need to be monitored as implementation goes forward.

If we are a country that truly wants to become the best place to grow up in, we need to become a nation that values play as a life-enhancing daily experience for all our children and young people in their homes, nurseries, schools and communities. Despite our political differences across the chamber, I know that we all share that ambition.</p><p>Our aims for our children and young people in Scotland are stretching and aspirational but, as I have said, when it comes to our nation&#8217;s future, we should never shy away from ambition. I say that as the Minister for Children and Young People and as a parent to my wee boy, Angus.</p><p>Play is the universal language of childhood. The activity exists for its own sake but it also has a fundamental role. All children and young people should have the opportunity to play every day, which is why we published Scotland&#8217;s first national play strategy in June and the action plan, which sets out how we will achieve that vision, on Monday.</p><p>I was particularly pleased to launch the action plan at the Yard&#8212;Edinburgh&#8217;s fantastic and inspirational purpose-built indoor and outdoor play centre for children with additional needs. I want that to send a strong signal that the strategy is for each and every child across Scotland; I appreciate the Conservative amendment, which highlights the need to focus on children with additional needs.</p><p>The strategy articulates the critical importance of play, as well as our obligation to protect our children&#8217;s ability to play. It sets Scotland on the right course for achieving the best for all our children and it draws together many strands of work that are happening across the Government, such as the work that planning colleagues are doing to highlight best practice in recognising the importance of play spaces when designing places and the work that my colleague Shona Robison is doing in her sport portfolio and her development of a youth sport strategy.</p><p>The perfect illustration of the links between play and sport is Judy Murray&#8217;s set4sport initiative, in which she outlines the games that she played with Andy and Jamie Murray. That shows the importance of laying firm foundations with play in the earliest years to the pursuit of success in elite sport later. We in Scotland are lucky to have a play ambassador in Judy Murray.</p><p>The action plan sets out specific actions and timescales and it gives details on who is responsible for delivering elements of the plan, which include: the provision of information to parents on how to access cost-effective materials for play; building and showcasing examples of effective play practices in schools; publishing a resource on children&#8217;s rights for the education sector; delivering the strategic planning for play award; and supporting innovative projects. Work is under way to develop an implementation plan to take forward the action plan.</p><p>The motion congratulates the play sector on its work&#8212;we could never have developed the strategy without it. I take the opportunity to thank all those who worked tirelessly to develop the strategy and the plan and those who will have a key role in implementation. Many of the people involved are in the public gallery, and I thank them for their on-going passion for and commitment to play.</p><p>The word &#8220;play&#8221; belies the topic&#8217;s seriousness and its crucial importance to the fabric of society. It is not airy-fairy or frivolous&#8212;it is a fundamental part of childhood and it is crucial for the positive outcomes of our nation&#8217;s future. Play helps children to make sense of the world and helps their cognitive development. It helps them to develop problem-solving skills and to express their thoughts and feelings, and it helps with literacy and numeracy. We must never forget that play is also about fun.</p><p>Play is an essential part of childhood. It takes place in the home from birth, through formal and informal learning and in community settings through the use of public spaces and services. Our role as parents, carers and service providers is to enable and facilitate play. As politicians, policy makers, planners and practitioners, our role is to embed play at the heart of decision making throughout our society and to provide the catalyst for cultural change.</p><p>Play comes in many forms. It can be active, passive, solitary, independent, assisted, social, exploratory, educational or just fun. It can happen indoors and outdoors; it can be structured, creative and messy; and it can be entirely facilitated by the imagination or involve using the latest gadget. What is important is that children and young people have the freedom to choose how and when they play and that it does not always have to be led by adults.</p><p>Play remains important for all ages and stages and abilities. It is important throughout infancy, childhood, the teenage years through adolescence, and beyond into adulthood. As George Bernard Shaw said:</p><p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.&#8221;</p><p>The importance of play in children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s daily lives and to healthy development has become increasingly recognised in recent years. A growing body of evidence supports the view that playing throughout childhood is more than an innate behaviour; it also contributes to quality of life and a sense of wellbeing.</p><p>Children&#8217;s play is also crucial to Scotland&#8217;s wellbeing&#8212;socially, economically and environmentally. Our people are our greatest resource, and the early years of life set the pattern for children&#8217;s future development. Research tells us that early childhood experiences shape developing brain architecture and whether our children grow into healthy and productive members of society.</p><p>Our early experiences have a much greater lasting effect than most of us would assume, and play, as a first step in learning, delivers economic benefits by helping children to develop the skills that they need for learning. The potential for savings of up to &#163;9 per &#163;1 invested shows that our commitment to play is right for children and our economy. Scotland&#8217;s chief medical officer has also made very clear the importance of play, stating:</p><p>&#8220;Investing in children&#8217;s play is one of the most important things we can do to improve children&#8217;s health and wellbeing in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>Play is also important in forming healthy attachments in the earliest years. One of the best ways to connect emotionally and physically with children is through play.</p><p>For all those reasons, we have developed and continue to develop our award-winning play, talk, read campaign, which articulates the importance of people playing, talking and reading with their wee one from day 1, and empowers parents with hints and tips of things to do with their bairns.</p><p>Seeing the difference that play can make in a child&#8217;s development is delightful and wonderful, and it benefits the whole family through supporting bonding and building relationships. I am the mother of a lively and active two-year-old, and it is a sheer joy to watch his development though playing. Numerous studies, including the growing up in Scotland study, show that play is a crucial factor in a child&#8217;s educational achievement. The benefits from playing and having fun should not be underestimated.</p><p>The play, talk, read campaign is in full flow, and we could not let a debate pass in the Parliament about play on 31 October without mentioning Hallowe&#8217;en. The &#8220;30 things to do at Halloween before you&#8217;re 3&#8221; list is proving as popular as ever, with tips on how to get messy, read spooky books with mum or dad, carve turnip lanterns and, of course, go dooking for apples.</p><p>On a more serious note, I have seen play being used to great effect in prisons. For example, the Scottish Pre-School Play Association&#8217;s work in Dumfries prison enables and strengthens relationships and builds attachments and bonds beyond the prison walls between parents and their children. The fathers who I saw appreciated the chance that they got to be with their child and to interact with them in a positive way. They are being given skills in parenting that they possibly never experienced when they were growing up. That builds up their confidence and self-esteem, and the children get the benefit of being with their parent in a normal setting, which means that they are not unnecessarily punished for their parent&#8217;s wrongdoing. Play is a simple tool, but it has a profound and long-lasting impact when used in that way.</p><p>I have described how play is a child&#8217;s job, but it is also a child&#8217;s absolute right. Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child has the right</p><p>&#8220;to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.&#8221;</p><p>Scotland warmly welcomes the UN general comment on article 31, which was adopted by the UN committee in 2013. The general comment provides interpretation of the article in detail, and it aims to raise awareness of its importance, to promote a richer understanding of the content and to provide guidance for its implementation. The general comment also provides a really useful and tangible example of the importance of the UNCRC and making rights real.</p><p>The general comments act to stimulate debate, and they help to identify some of the key aspects of policy and practice that must be considered when working to improve the lives of our children and young people.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Maria Montessori said that play is the work of the child.

As generations pass and the years roll by, play evolves and changes. I am sure that many of us remember playing outside around our homes and communities, and I am sure that many of us also recognise that children play outdoors less and less. Children&#8217;s natural range has shrunk over the past few generations, with many venturing no further than their back gardens unsupervised. Moreover, we live in a digital age. TV, computers, tablets and a range of other technological advances increasingly see children playing inside on their own. That is not wholly bad, but we need to be alert to the consequences.</p><p>Through the play strategy and action plan, I want to see children play outside more often. We need to encourage our children to get outside and to start exploring the often wild open spaces that Scotland has in abundance. We must change the culture of the perception of children as a problem in public spaces, characterised by the &#8220;No ball games&#8221; signs we still see in communities, and we must reinforce the message that children have the same right to use public spaces as every other member of society.</p><p>We must also recognise play within the built environment. The quality of our surroundings has a fundamental influence on how we behave, and we must work to create places that provide the opportunities for active and healthy lifestyles&#8212;places that are safe, welcoming, attractive and pleasant; places where we respond positively to our surroundings and to each other. That is encapsulated in our policy statement on architecture and play, &#8220;Creating Places&#8221;, which was published in June.</p><p>The Government also places significant emphasis on the importance of the quality of our streets and spaces. &#8220;Designing Streets&#8221; is the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy on street design, which is aimed at refocusing the role of our streets and places to serve people first and allow children to have access to safe and vibrant streets where there is ample opportunity and incentive to play and engage with their surroundings, whether in structured or informal situations. The play strategy brings together developments in planning and architecture and shows that play is not just about the play sector, but part and parcel of what many different portfolios, departments, agencies and professions need to consider as part of their work.</p><p>It is also important that we dispel some of the myths around outdoor play and promote the long-term benefits of exposure to risk, both to physical health and to developing resilience and mental wellbeing. Parents&#8217; perception of risks is often higher than the reality, and that should be weighed against the benefits of outdoor play.</p><p>In my role as minister I have seen some of the very real benefits of outdoor play. That includes schools that have greened up their playing spaces, such as Rigside primary in my constituency and many other schools, and have witnessed a subsequent improvement in pupil behaviour, and organisations that have got children climbing trees, digging for beasties and jumping in puddles, such as the Jeely Piece Club in Castlemilk and many others across Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Education and Culture Committee has taken a lot of evidence on that, and the process will be on-going through the stages of the bill.

The study states that half of all UK seven-year-olds do not get enough exercise and that girls are far less active than boys.</p><p>Play should also be seen through a preventative and early intervention lens. By getting more children out to play, we can reduce and reverse negative health impacts. It is important to remember that we are not starting from scratch; we have a professional and vibrant play sector that supports and delivers quality play to children every day. As I said, it has contributed to our national strategy.</p><p>The previous &#163;4 million go play fund developed an outcome evaluation framework to allow play providers to clearly articulate the benefits of play. The framework is now widely used and recognised, and it has been successful in securing significant additional funding for the delivery of play projects.</p><p>We have further supported play through our &#163;3 million go2play fund, which supports community-based free play, development of innovative projects and the transformation of 30 school playgrounds into natural play spaces.

We all want Scotland to be the best place to grow up and we all want our children to have the best start in life. We have debated today the fundamental role that play has in contributing to that vision.</p><p>Jayne Baxter outlined the multiple hats that she wears as a spokesperson for Labour, an MSP and, more important, as granny to her grandchildren, who enjoy the muddy puddles. She outlined the importance that play has in ensuring that we give all our children the very best start in life.</p><p>We also got an image of a young George Adam playing on the Gleniffer braes getting a skint knee but growing into the strong and resilient MSP we know today. I thank him for that image. Mary Scanlon revealed a hidden talent for tying knots.</p><p>Many members raised the issue of funding and the challenges that exist across the country. I will outline some of the Scottish Government&#8217;s investment in play. We have invested over &#163;7 million in play over the past five years through our go play and go2play programmes. That investment has built capacity in the play sector and given it tools to evaluate and articulate the benefits of play. That is about leaving a sustainable legacy.</p><p>At the halfway point of the current go2play programme, 12,500 children have experienced quality play supported by play rangers and 150 volunteers&#8212;mostly parents&#8212;who have been involved in building community links and taking individual steps on the pathway to employment. That programme has also attracted an additional quarter of a million pounds to support play.</p><p>This is an important statistic on which to reflect, given some of the comments that have been made. Of the children supported through go2play, 60 per cent live in the 15 per cent most deprived areas; 17 per cent have additional support needs; and 12 per cent are from black and minority ethnic groups. Go2play opportunities delivered by many other practitioners show that the approach is inclusive. By building on that we can ensure that many more children can participate in and benefit from play.</p><p>On that note, as I said in my opening remarks, I appreciate the Conservative amendment and the comments from Mark McDonald, who talked about the innovative approaches of Kool Kidz, SensationALL and other facilities that host special requirements sessions. Those interesting ideas and innovative approaches can be shared. He also described eloquently the very real challenges facing families who have a child with additional support needs. We need to work hard to deliver on that strategy for those families.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell was correct to point out the excellent work that goes on in the Isobel Mair school, which I have visited. I visited it just before it opened and I know that it is a truly fantastic and phenomenal facility. The debate allows us to talk about such good practice much more openly.</p><p>A big theme today has been that play often does not need significant resources, but rather what is needed is a change in culture. Ken Macintosh used the example of the Wendy house and the tree house to show that children do not necessarily need expensive toys and that we should never just assume that we know what children want. We need to engage with children and understand what their needs are.</p><p>During my time as planning minister, I was impressed by the charrette process that took place throughout different communities in Scotland. That process, which included children, involved engaging deeply and meaningfully with communities to get them to imagine what their communities could and should look like. Others such as Planning Aid for Scotland are also important partners in changing culture to ensure that our places have spaces for children to use and enjoy.</p><p>I really liked what Fiona McLeod said about her son coming home. If he was dirty, she knew that he had had a good time&#8212;the dirtier the better, she said. Other members have spoken about jumping in puddles, and Christian Allard spoke about his time in rural France. Free outdoor play has been mentioned.</p><p>James Dornan spoke about the social inequalities that exist in some of our most deprived communities. The message that play does not need to be expensive is important and highlights the significance of our play talk read campaign. James Dornan mentioned the Jeely Piece Club and we have other partners across Scotland&#8212;including the Scottish Out of School Care Network, the Scottish Pre-school Play Association and PEEK&#8212;who are doing fantastic things to support families and build up parents&#8217; self-esteem. What matters is not how much money a parent has but what they do with their children.</p><p>Fiona McLeod talked about intergenerational mixing, and other members have spoken about their own childhood experiences. During the time that I spent at the youth club that my mum ran, we had to perform pantomimes for the local residential group. That was a valuable and enriching experience not only for us, as young people, but for the older residents who watched our performances&#8212;even though they might have been a bit ropey at times.</p><p>George Adam and Richard Lyle spoke about the power of play to bring families together. Whether it involves the games in the picture from 1560&#8212;I think that that is what Stewart Maxwell said&#8212;or a Nintendo Wii, as suggested by George Adam, play is never static. Mary Fee and Richard Lyle also talked about the positive impacts of play on our communities.</p><p>Clare Adamson made some interesting points about the work that she carries out in connection with ROSPA and the fantastic work that is going on in Wishaw and throughout her constituency.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned the good work that is carried out in hospital in relation to play. In response to some of the points that she made about the Care Inspectorate, I advise her that we intend to include the Care Inspectorate in the implementation of our strategy.</p><p>A helpful development in changing the culture across Scotland is the new professional development award in strategic planning for play, which aims to start that process. The Scottish Qualifications Authority is aiming it at wider communities and policy makers who have an impact on children&#8217;s play, including architects, planners, health workers and local authorities. That professional development opportunity can help to make play a reality for more children, families and communities and is a helpful response to people who want the play strategy to be about more than just the play sector.</p><p>As part of the go2play investment, a play strategy implementation fund of &#163;90,000 will be available to charities and play projects between January 2014 and April 2015 to support implementation of the action plan through practical and innovative approaches to play. In addition, the Big Lottery Fund is a key investor in and supporter of play through a number of its programmes.</p><p>Liz Smith said that we should not forget Scotland&#8217;s fantastic older young people in the strategy. I absolutely agree with that. Youth work and community learning and development organisations and services are making a huge contribution to young people&#8217;s access to play and leisure activities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am genuinely pleased that we have had this opportunity to debate play and its contribution to childhood and the wellbeing of Scotland.

We have heard some well-deserved praise for Roxburgh and Berwickshire Citizens Advice Bureau&#8217;s project to support young people. I would like to add to that chorus of appreciation my voice and the voices of members of the Scottish Youth Parliament from the Borders, whom I met earlier: Nicola Pringle, Finlay Duff and Scott Redmond all spoke positively about the work that the CAB does in the Borders and about the effective collaborative work that is happening in that area. I also reiterate the welcome that we have all given to the people from the CAB who are in the gallery.</p><p>The Scottish Government is behind Scotland&#8217;s young people, and fantastic initiatives such as the one that we are discussing show what can be done in communities to boost young people&#8217;s chances as they begin adulthood and find their way in the world. We are clear that the future of our nation rests in our young people&#8217;s hands, which is why we are doing everything in our power to give them the chance to flourish and to have positive and successful futures.</p><p>We make no apologies for having high aspirations for young Scots; we want them to aim high and we know that with the right opportunities and openings there is no limit to what they can go on to achieve. Projects such as the one in the Scottish Borders that Jim Hume has highlighted make a valuable contribution to that drive. By showing young people that they are not alone, by giving them help and support and by involving them in such community projects we can make a real and meaningful difference to their lives.</p><p>The project is another example of the sterling work that citizens advice bureaux carry out in communities across Scotland. We have heard today about many wonderful local initiatives from members, and I want to plug the Clydesdale Citizens Advice Bureau in my constituency, which gives valuable advice that I have seen first-hand. Such advice centres help families and people in need&#8212;often some of the most vulnerable people in our society&#8212;to address complex and difficult issues every day. Whether it is on debt, housing problems or benefits issues, the support that is given often prevents situations from spiralling into crises. That is part and parcel of CAS&#8217;s work over the decades, which Jim Hume outlined. He mentioned that that work has evolved from ration book advice to embrace social media and all the other modern technologies that can be used to get the right messages through to people who are in need.</p><p>As Alison Johnstone, Jackie Baillie and Christine Grahame correctly noted, we know that more and more people are going to bureaux for help all the time; it would be remiss of me not to point out that much of that is down to the harsh UK Government&#8217;s welfare reform measures, including the widely condemned bedroom tax. The Scottish Government has made abundantly clear its opposition to those measures, which are being imposed on hard-pressed families across Scotland. Such drastic welfare cuts can only exacerbate problems including child poverty and disadvantage, which afflict the lives of too many young Scots, as Malcolm Chisholm pointed out.</p><p>We are doing what we can to mitigate those problems&#8217; impact, which is why we have committed &#163;7.9&#160;million of additional funding for advice and support services to help address the effects of welfare reform. That includes &#163;2.5&#160;million that is being channelled directly to Citizens Advice Scotland to fund a range of services to help people on the ground, while bureaux across the country are receiving additional allocations from the wider funding pot.</p><p>By strengthening those vital services in that way, we can allow them to expand and undertake new and innovative projects; the youth initiative in Roxburgh and Berwickshire CAB shows us that there is no shortage of ideas. People in the age group that the venture focuses on&#8212;16 to 25-year-olds&#8212;face a period of huge transition in their lives, which can often lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty, which Christine Grahame mentioned as a theme in her speech.</p><p>I understand that the project gives advice on a range of issues, such as study, work, health, money management and housing&#8212;areas in which many young people will require a helping hand to steer them in the right direction. The project has two members of staff and has successfully recruited 31 young volunteers. As Jim Hume said, to date 3,806 students have taken part in its workshops. That is a phenomenal result, which shows the excellent impact that volunteers can have in our communities.</p><p>The fruitful links that the project has built up with high schools in Roxburgh and Berwickshire, as well as with Borders College, are very much in keeping with the kind of local collaboration that the Government is promoting between our education establishments and organisations in the wider community. It was great to hear this morning from members of the Scottish Youth Parliament about how that collaborative approach is bearing fruit.</p><p>Under curriculum for excellence, which is transforming learning for Scotland&#8217;s children and young people in an effort to improve their life chances, community learning and development has a key role to play. I have seen some fantastic examples of that across the Borders.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s national youth information and citizenship organisation, Young Scot, is also undertaking excellent work to support young people through key transitions in their lives. Young Scot&#8217;s vision is for young people to take responsibility for changing our world and tackling social issues, so that they can grow up in a Scotland that promotes aspiration, enterprise, opportunity, inclusion and wellbeing. I think that all members who are present will share Young Scot&#8217;s inspiring vision. This year, the Scottish Government has committed more than &#163;1 million to the organisation to support its work. As well as helping young people to become informed and active citizens who are engaged with their communities, Young Scot delivers its hugely successful national entitlement card, which is now held by more than half a million young people in Scotland. The card is the result of a hugely positive partnership between Young Scot, the Scottish Government, the Improvement Service, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and all 32 local authorities.</p><p>Just as Young Scot and the citizens advice project that brings us here today are, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that our young people are at the heart of everything we do. We want Scotland to be the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up. That is why we are breaking down the barriers that hold them back, including poverty, disadvantage and lack of opportunity. Through our getting it right for every child approach and key social policy frameworks such as the child poverty strategy, achieving our potential, equally well and the early years framework, we are driving a focus on early intervention and prevention to give our young people the best start in life.</p><p>As Alison Johnstone noted, curriculum for excellence is helping to ensure that all young folk can be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens, and their needs are, of course, at the very core of our Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>Moreover, we invest more than &#163;2.5&#160;billion a year in post-16 education, training and student support. We have retained the education maintenance allowance, which has been scrapped for students in England. We have invested about &#163;5&#160;billion in colleges since 2007.

Anne Houston of Children 1st said:</p><p>&#8220;Deaths like Daniel&#8217;s remind us why the principle behind the named person ... is a sound one as it aims to prevent children slipping through the net.&#8221;</p><p>I am not claiming that the existence of a named person would necessarily prevent such tragedies, but as Ruth Wishart said in her excellent article in The Herald:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unrealistic to suppose we can stop every incident of child abuse, identify every perpetrator, always intervene in time to prevent tragedy. But we can make a big difference.&#8221;</p><p>Issues have been raised around information sharing, and such cases highlight the importance of sharing information where it is required in order to protect a child&#8217;s wellbeing. Any sharing of information under the bill must take place fully within the framework that is set by the Data Protection Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. A preventative approach means that action should be taken before things get serious, and the named person provides a structure for doing that.</p><p>Issues have been raised around the cost of GIRFEC, but of course it is not always just about costs; we know that the GIRFEC approach is making savings. We know from the Highland pilot the kind of savings that have been made: reductions in social work case loads of 50 per cent, reductions in referrals to the children&#8217;s reporter of 70 per cent and reductions in the number of children who have been accommodated. We know that the areas that are the furthest advanced in implementing GIRFEC have had similar findings.</p><p>Over the years, Parliament has repeatedly endorsed the GIRFEC approach and I hope that at the end of today&#8217;s business we will be able to do so again.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-07783.2, to leave out from &#8220;notes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;reaffirms its ambition that Scotland should be the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up; considers that the protection of children from harm and the promotion of their wellbeing is of paramount importance; recognises the critical role in achieving that of the Getting It Right for Every Child approach, which has been successfully developed in Scotland ever since its inception during the first administration after devolution; understands that the named person has been developed and implemented as an essential element of that approach, as a means of making appropriate and proportionate support available to children and families in a coordinated and collaborative way, reducing bureaucracy and making the best use of public resources, and welcomes the opportunity provided by the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill to secure the protection, nurture and support that children and their families need to flourish&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697561", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Named Persons)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps there is a bit of inconsistency from the Conservatives.

First, next week is refugee week. This year&#8217;s theme celebrates the diverse cultures and heritage that make Scotland the place that it is today&#8212;I will touch on that theme later. Secondly, today&#8217;s Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations awards ceremony has the Scottish guardianship service shortlisted for a partnership award. Thirdly, yesterday the Joint Committee on Human Rights recognised the lessons that can be learned, across the UK, from this Scottish service unique to these islands.</p><p>I am proud to lead a debate that I know will gain the support of us all, across the chamber, on a service that shows Scotland at its best, leading the way, and our ambition for Scotland to be the best place to grow up extends to those who make Scotland their home.</p><p>I want to put on record my thanks to all those who have worked tirelessly for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children: the Refugee Council; Aberlour, which manages the guardianship project; Barnardo&#8217;s; the Mungo Foundation; and many others across Scotland, including Glasgow City Council&#8217;s social work department.</p><p>So, what is the system all about? The service allocates guardians to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who find themselves in Scotland. Let us pause for a moment to reflect on how scary, frightening and daunting it is for someone to arrive in a country that they probably know nothing about and whose language they may not even speak, where all the while they are on their own. On top of that, they then need to embrace the policies and laws governing asylum and immigration.</p><p>The guardians help children and young people to make sense of the complex and often overwhelming systems and processes around asylum and welfare that they have to face immediately upon arrival in this country. They form a single point of contact where information can be pulled together; the roles of the different agencies working with the child can be explained; and all that can be repeated until the child fully understands what is going on. The guardians do that in a way that gains the child&#8217;s trust, gratitude and friendship. They provide a voice for the young person until they are empowered enough to speak for themselves.</p><p>That is in sharp contrast to the situation that was highlighted in 2005 by Kathleen Marshall, who was Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People at the time. She noted that there was a lack of support or of robust systems in place to cope with the emerging presence of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Glasgow, alongside the emotive issues around the detention of children for immigration purposes and dawn raids.</p><p>I have had the pleasure of meeting and listening to some of the young people who have been helped by the guardians. Although they have now made Scotland their home, it is still painful to learn about what some people have had to endure during their young lives. Through one of the therapeutic art projects that they had participated in, they conveyed to me their aspirations to become a mechanic, a professional football player&#8212;even a politician, of all things&#8212;as well as many other dreams and aspirations that had been made possible because of the guardianship service.</p><p>I want to take a wee moment to share with members Paul&#8217;s story. He came to this country when he was 16 and was allocated a guardian. Initially, Paul was very confused and scared and found it difficult to speak about his experiences. It took a long time to build trust with people, and that was not helped by a difficult age assessment. Paul now has a great relationship with his guardian and continues to come for advice on a vast range of different subjects. He has become a good role model for other young people in the service, and is clearly a very popular young man. The change that the guardians have observed in Paul is striking: he is now confident, articulate and very motivated to make something of his life. To illustrate that point, he co-hosted a recent Scottish guardianship service conference that I attended and spoke incredibly well. He has now got a place at the University of Strathclyde to study product design and will have much to offer to Scotland. What a talent and what an asset for Scotland.</p><p>Such stories about the help that young people receive from the SGS are robustly backed up by the very positive and independent evaluation by Professors Ravi Kohli and Heaven Crawley of the model of guardianship that the service has used. The evaluation finds that the Scottish model of guardianship is well established, as</p><p>&#8220;reflected in good communication and information sharing&#8221;</p><p>between the service and referral agencies. The guardians are described as knowledgeable and competent. Most important, the guardians were found to be</p><p>&#8220;committed to young people in terms of safe and sustaining relationships&#8221;.</p><p>The evaluators found clear evidence that outcomes were improved for the unaccompanied asylum-seeking young people as a result of the service. They identified the added value of guardianship, which lies in its ability to work across the three domains of asylum, wellbeing and social networks. It is all too easy to forget the real sense of contentment and self-worth that we derive from the most basic aspects of our lives when things are going well: a place we are happy to call home; interaction with our families, friends and wider communities; consistent provision of appropriate healthcare; and access to education.</p><p>The guardians have made time and taken time to explain and to listen to the children who are referred to them. The guardians have not only helped those young people cope with the obstacles that they faced on their arrival and provided day-to-day support with other issues such as health, housing and education; they have actively encouraged the young people to improve their wellbeing by creating wider social networks, so that they can participate in Scottish life and meet others of their own age groups.</p><p>The guardians have helped the young people to begin to feel like any other young citizens of Scotland. That is particularly important, according to the evaluators, who noted that the work that the guardians undertake in one domain has an impact on the young people&#8217;s capacity to deal with issues in other areas of their lives. In other words, it builds on their assets and builds their resilience so that they can overcome other challenges. The evaluators found that a young person&#8217;s capacity to deal with issues in relation to his or her asylum claim is often contingent on their general sense of wellbeing and on feeling socially embedded and connected. On the topic of wellness, resilience and connectedness, I heartily recommend the work and the words of Dr Larry Brendtro, whom I had the pleasure of listening to yesterday at an event on residential childcare, as he explains the psychological importance of all those things.</p><p>The well-developed trust between the children and their guardians has resulted in more information being made available to UK Border Agency case owners, who are able to make better decisions earlier in children&#8217;s lives. A large increase has been observed in the number of young people who are granted refugee status or humanitarian protection at an early stage since the service came into being.</p><p>The evaluators highlighted the circumstances in Scotland that have helped the non-statutory guardianship service to flourish, which include the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that the children&#8217;s rights that are set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are recognised and that children&#8217;s voices are heard, and the positive influence of our getting it right for every child programme. All of us in the Parliament can be proud of GIRFEC, which keeps the child at the centre of every decision that affects them. It involves everyone who works with children and it expects that they will co-operate in providing co-ordinated, holistic support for those children no matter who they are, where they live or what their circumstances require.</p><p>The Scottish guardianship service mirrors that approach, and the learning from the scheme has fed directly into wider policy that affects vulnerable Scottish children and young people&#8212;particularly young people who are looked after at home&#8212;with the development of the long-term mentoring scheme by Susan Elsley through her work as a member of the looked-after children strategic implementation group.</p><p>As Minister for Children and Young People, I am determined that all of Scotland&#8217;s children get the support that they need to become healthy, confident and responsible members of their communities&#8212;to be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. Every child and young person has that potential and deserves that opportunity and I want to ensure that we get it right for all of them, regardless of how Scotland came to be their home.</p><p>These young people just want to lead normal, stable, secure lives and to have access to the same opportunities as their peers. The Scottish guardianship service can help them to achieve that goal, and in many instances it has already done so. I know how much the young people value the support and friendship that they have received in the absence of their families and I am determined that that support will be available in the future so that others who may find their way to our shores receive the same welcome and the same standards of care and assistance and go on to the same success. That is why we have committed funding to continue this excellent service for a further three years.</p><p>Scotland has a long history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers. That was the case even prior to the 1951 UN refugee convention. Migrants from various parts of Europe, Asia and Africa have been coming to Scotland for centuries, and we want to continue to be a welcoming country. We have a large, established migrant community and we welcome the contribution, colour and vibrancy that new Scots bring to our economy and society. I wish the Scottish Refugee Council all the best for next week&#8217;s refugee week, which seeks to ensure that there is a greater understanding and appreciation of the culture and diversity that immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees bring to Scotland, making a positive impact on our lives and our society.</p><p>With the guardians, I have witnessed enthusiasm and a desire to help. The lessons that we have learned from this unique Scottish service can be shared with the rest of the UK and the service has attracted interest from Europe. Sometimes, that is not the case. It is time that we became proud of the fact that Scotland has a lot to contribute to public policy, particularly in this area. We should share our learning as well as learning from others around the world.</p><p>It is often said that one of the measures of a civilised society is how well it looks after its most vulnerable members. These children are some of the most vulnerable members of our society. They come here in distress, needing help and looking for an opportunity to rebuild their lives and contribute to their new home.</p><p>I am proud that Scotland has shown that we can accept and support young people from all over the world. In return, young people from all over the world have shown how willing they are to learn about and contribute to Scotland, enriching all our lives. I had the opportunity to meet such young people and I encourage members to do so, because they might be inspired by the stories that the young people tell.</p><p>In such a policy area, challenges will always lie ahead and there will always be far more that we can do. This debate is about recognising the efforts of the people who have made the project a success and getting the Parliament to give its backing to the important work that continues to put Scotland at the vanguard of this policy area.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that 17 to 23 June is Refugee Week 2013; welcomes the success of the Scottish Guardianship Service in supporting more than 100 unaccompanied young people going through the asylum system; further welcomes the positive evaluation of this unique Scottish service and the help that it has delivered to vulnerable young people, and commends the Aberlour Childcare Trust and Scottish Refugee Council for operating the service.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693870", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Guardianship Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate about the Scottish guardianship service for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and young people, which is leading in its model of guardianship in the United Kingdom and across large parts of Europe, is timely for three reasons.

The debate has been constructive, and there has been a healthy amount of consensus about the topic.</p><p>No wonder. How could any of us fail to support work that helps frightened, daunted and possibly persecuted young people who arrive on our shores without the support of their family? John Mason put his 15-year-old self in the shoes of a young person who has arrived in Scotland without any family support, and Stewart Maxwell spoke about those young people&#8217;s lives through the prism of his own young daughter&#8217;s life. Those approaches give us a greater emotional appreciation of the important work that the guardianship service does. I think that all of us largely agree that supporting these frightened young individuals who arrive in Scotland is simply the right thing to do.</p><p>The debate&#8217;s tone has been correct. As Murdo Fraser has said, this is a sensitive issue. I appreciate the comments that have been made from across the chamber. Members have been appreciative of the quality of the work, which has been acknowledged by the independent evaluation of Professor Ravi Kohli and Professor Heaven Crawley. John Mason acknowledged that high-level research and evaluation when he referred to standards 7, 8 and 9 in the evaluation of the guardianship pilot. His point about the need to learn lessons and apply them across the broader suite of policies on children and young people is correct. In an intervention on John Mason, I mentioned the national mentoring scheme for young looked-after people. That very much concentrates on those young people having a stable relationship with a trusted adult, and views that as being extremely important for their long-term wellbeing and positive future outcomes.</p><p>Paul Brannigan is the star of the film &#8220;The Angel&#8217;s Share&#8221;, which was out last year. Speaking at the first learning session of the early years collaborative, he talked about his way out of the personally destructive lifestyle that he had been following. He got out through the support of his prison officer, who helped him to get through that. It was to do with more than support; it was about the stickability of that relationship, and the trust that he had in that prison officer. John Mason spoke about the importance of that sort of stable relationship with an adult, and that is what is so important about the guardianship service. Of course, it is important to apply lessons that are learned across other social policy initiatives in Scotland.</p><p>It is important to remember that the guardianship service has flourished because of the current framework for dealing with the young children and young people through GIRFEC. I recently discussed with Dr Bruce Perry another approach that has generated international interest. He said to me that he believed that progressive social policy would come from small countries. I think that the GIRFEC approach and the guardianship service show that statement to be true.</p><p>Neil Bibby made a valid point about the interplay between this issue and the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. The bill of course covers all looked-after children, including those who are voluntarily looked after, such as unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.</p><p>I will happily get back to Neil Bibby to furnish him with more information on interfaith and racial bullying, but the Government takes bullying very seriously regardless of the motive behind it. I am happy to have dialogue with him on that issue.</p><p>Christina McKelvie, Malcolm Chisholm, Neil Bibby and others raised the issue of trafficking. The Government is committed to improving the identification of trafficking and the prosecution of those who commit trafficking offences. In Scotland, we have firmly embedded the issue of child trafficking in our national child protection guidance, and the Scottish guardianship service has been instrumental in helping to identify child trafficking. That important issue is being considered in the on-going work of the anti-human trafficking summit, which is being led by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill. The summit is due to reconvene early next year, but there is a progress group meeting next month. I am sure that some of the points that have been raised in the debate will feed into that meeting.</p><p>Independent living arrangements as opposed to supported living arrangements for unaccompanied children have a risk attached to them. We have identified that they enhance the possibility of asylum-seeking children who have been trafficked being drawn back into the influence of the traffickers and being retrafficked. I am keen to look at ways of ensuring that appropriate accommodation for that group of children and young people remains available. I want local areas to have protocols on child trafficking in place, which all staff should be aware of, by the end of 2013. Of course, trafficking is a disgusting and criminal act, and we must do all that we can to support work on it. That work links to the work of a newly established working group, which I have tasked with looking at child sexual exploitation and ensuring that those connections are readily made.</p><p>The issue of age assessment was raised in the debate. We recognise the difficulties in establishing the age of undocumented young people and we believe that it is best done through a fair and transparent assessment that is carried out sensitively and takes a holistic look at a young person&#8217;s needs as well as likely age. Sandra White&#8217;s example highlighted the need for the holistic approach. The Scottish Refugee Council&#8217;s age assessment practice guidance has filled a gap in the area, and the Government has provided &#163;5,000 for training on that age assessment toolkit, which I think will be welcomed by many members who have contributed to the debate.</p><p>John Mason, Christina McKelvie, Dave Thompson and Malcolm Chisholm noted the international element of the issues of asylum and immigration. The fundamental cause of the issue that we are discussing is, frankly, that people arrive on our shores because they are often fleeing from instability in their own country. In that context, John Mason and Dave Thompson rightly talked about the effect of the UK&#8217;s foreign policy footprint over a number of years. We need to remember the possibly devastating impact on children and young people now living in Scotland of hearing news reports about what is happening in their country. I think that we all agree across the chamber that a fairer and more peaceful world is possible. If we strive for that approach, that will stymie some of the issues that we have heard about in the debate of people arriving on our shores because of persecution and instability in their countries.</p><p>Christina McKelvie has a long-held interest in and knowledge of this topic and she is to be admired for the tenacity with which she has pursued the wellbeing of asylum-seeking children and young people and adults. She rightly addressed why trafficking should be an issue for child protection committees, and we will continue to take cognizance of that point. She and Annabelle Ewing also raised the issue of the UKBA&#8217;s restructuring, and I agree that we need to be alert to the impact of those changes. I will continue to ensure that Scottish interests are safeguarded, particularly as we forge our own path in dealing with immigration. Sandra White raised the frustrating issue of members of the Scottish Parliament not being treated with parity by the UKBA. Stewart Maxwell asked how we can paint a more accurate national picture through better-organised data. We will look at that issue and get back to him on it in due course.</p><p>The Scottish Government is proud of the guardianship service but, of course, as always, we need to do more to ensure that Scotland can be the nurturing country that we want it to be, especially for the children and young people who, for a number of reasons, arrive on our shores and who are very vulnerable indeed. If we want to create the best place in the world to grow up, it needs to be so for each and every child who makes Scotland their home. We must never take our foot off the gas on this important issue.</p><p>We were right to debate the topic today. It sounds as though many people did not know about this unique Scottish service, so it has been good to be able to raise awareness. The debate has also been a nice introduction to Scottish refugee week and has helped to ensure that we fully appreciate the positive contribution that refugees across Scotland make to our society and our country.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693870", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Guardianship Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank everyone who has participated in this positive debate, in which there have been many heartfelt contributions.

I also welcome Labour&#8217;s desire to work across party lines on the further extension of childcare, and I recognise that Johann Lamont is to meet the First Minister in the near future to discuss childcare.</p><p>We all recognise that high-quality early learning and childcare has a vital role to play for social, emotional and cognitive development and for parents who seek to balance their childcare responsibilities with work, education or training. The issue has profound implications for Scotland&#8217;s economy now and in the future.</p><p>Our provisions in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill to increase free early learning and childcare for three and four-year-olds, as well as the most vulnerable two-year-olds, to a minimum of 600 hours per year represent a significant step towards our longer-term aim of achieving a transformational shift in childcare to build a high-quality, universal system of early learning and childcare that meets the needs of all children, their parents and their families. Our commitment to legislate for 600 hours of provision represents significant progress since we took office in 2007. That progress is an important component of our committed efforts to maximise household budgets through a social wage to benefit and improve the economic and social wellbeing of Scottish citizens.</p><p>Our efforts will benefit around 121,000 children and their families, who, since 2007, have made savings equivalent to around &#163;700 in childcare bills. We will add 188 hours of free early learning and childcare and&#8212;crucially&#8212;will increase flexibility to ensure that high-quality early learning and childcare is delivered in response to local needs and choices for parents. That will improve consistency and lead to better outcomes for children, and it will better meet the needs of parents, particularly those mothers who want to go back to work or into education or training.</p><p>We are also on a journey of improving the provision of help and support for the most vulnerable in our society. That is exemplified by the extension of the childcare entitlement to two-year-olds who are looked after and those who are under a kinship care order whom we can prevent from becoming or remaining looked after.</p><p>We recognise that looked-after children have some of the poorest outcomes in society and believe that it is essential that we focus our efforts where we can make a real and positive difference. Much has been said in the chamber about the benefits of extending the funded entitlement to a wider group of disadvantaged two-year-olds, and I know that the Opposition has cited the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s commitment to extend entitlement to the most vulnerable 40 per cent of two-year-olds. My reply is that this Government is absolutely committed to building a high-quality universal system of early learning and childcare for all children to benefit the most vulnerable in our society.</p><p>However, we must do that in a manageable and sustainable way, and must be guided by the getting it right for every child approach, which has been designed to secure better outcomes for every child in our land. Failure to move forward on manageable and sustainable terms would compromise the quality of provision for our youngest children. Quite frankly, it is not acceptable to this Government to run the risk of there being adverse impacts on our youngest children.</p><p>It is becoming clear that, in England, many experts have serious doubts about the affordability, practicality and effectiveness of expanding the funded entitlement so far and so fast. Only yesterday, the BBC reported that there was a potential shortage of 55,000 places for disadvantaged two-year-olds. Naomi Eisenstadt, who is a respected academic and former director of the sure start unit in England, is visiting Scotland tomorrow, and I hope to meet her. Professor Cathy Nutbrown, who is the academic who carried out the review that informed the UK Government&#8217;s &#8220;More great childcare&#8221; strategy, has now criticised that strategy. She was recently quoted as saying that</p><p>&#8220;Trading staff-to-child ratios for higher-qualified staff is nonsense. Watering down ratios will threaten quality. Childcare may be cheaper, but children will be footing the bill.&#8221;</p><p>This Government will not compromise on quality. We must get things absolutely right. To that end, the First Minister has asked the Council of Economic Advisers to look at the best models of delivery and funding for a system of childcare in an independent Scotland and, in doing so, to be informed by what other countries are doing. As I am sure that all members are aware, a range of models of provision and funding exist, but our concern at all times must be what is right for Scotland and our people.</p><p>Therefore, I am delighted to announce our early learning and childcare strategic funding partnerships with the National Day Nurseries Association and the Care and Learning Alliance. We have allocated &#163;155,000 in addition to the &#163;1.5&#160;million that has already been allocated by the Big Lottery Fund to early learning and childcare third sector partners through the third sector early intervention fund.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690403", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by welcoming the fact that the Labour motion welcomes our plans in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill to increase the funded entitlement to early learning and childcare to a minimum of 600 hours per year.

Like other members, I congratulate Dads Rock and pay tribute to all that it has achieved in the past year. It is good to see the representatives of Dads Rock in the public gallery. I am pleased that, following a debate on the Dads Rock Twitter account, David Marshall has chosen to wear his Dads Rock T-shirt rather than the suit that he thought might be more appropriate. It is a good T-shirt.</p><p>Encouraging and supporting fathers to play an active role in their child&#8217;s upbringing is key if we are to improve the health, wellbeing and life chances of Scotland&#8217;s children and young people. Through the national parenting strategy, which we published in October, we are determined to ensure that parents get the support that they need when they need it, so that they can do their very best for their children.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration for children and young people is simple but ambitious: we want Scotland to be the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up in. We want Scotland to be a more child-friendly country and to have a culture that supports all parents and carers. We want a country that recognises that dads do indeed rock.</p><p>No parent should feel isolated or alone. Alison Johnstone rightly pointed out that families need to feel supported not only by public services but by their families and communities. Groups such as Dads Rock play a crucial role in offering fun activities for dads and their children, but they also provide a place for dads to speak to others about being a dad. That kind of local peer support is empowering and will benefit fathers and their children in many healthy and positive ways.</p><p>It is right for us to focus on fathers, because dads are often cut out of the picture, albeit sometimes unintentionally, and that needs to change. In a modern, successful Scotland, we want to encourage and support both parents to play an active role in their children&#8217;s upbringing. As Gordon MacDonald and Gavin Brown noted, with Dads Rock, two dads found that there was little support in their area and decided to do something about it, so they set up their own fun musical playgroup for dads and their children in Sighthill in Edinburgh. I admire and applaud their work and achievement, and the work of the volunteers who help to deliver the playgroups. Without their passion, many of the dads who attend would feel isolated. I agree with Gavin Brown that many lessons can be learned from the group&#8217;s proactive approach.</p><p>Last year, along with my husband and our wee boy, I had the pleasure of visiting Dads Rock when it opened its new musical group in Granton. My son enjoyed playing the drum kit and my husband, who is a stay-at-home dad, also enjoyed the experience and got a lot out of meeting other fathers. He liked singing in a key that he could reach at the end of the night, rather than some of the keys that he sings in at mother and toddler groups. I promise Gavin Brown that my speech will not feature me singing &#8220;We Will Rock You&#8221;, for which members should be thankful. Visiting Dads Rock was a great experience, and I hope that many more dads and their children will take part in and enjoy it. I thoroughly recommend it to Malcolm Chisholm and I encourage him to take his grandchildren along and prove that granddads can rock, too.</p><p>I am delighted to hear about the plans that Gordon MacDonald and Malcolm Chisholm outlined to open a new playgroup in Dunfermline and to hear that the group is looking to establish a Dads Rock academy that aims to provide a year&#8217;s free music tuition to children and dads in the Sighthill area.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s aspiration is to make this country the best place in the world to grow up in. The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced in Parliament last month, is a step on the journey towards fulfilling our ambition. However, legislation is only part of the answer.</p><p>We know that the early years of a child&#8217;s life are crucial and set the pattern for their future development. We need to improve outcomes and reduce inequalities for all babies, children, mothers, fathers and families across Scotland to ensure that all children have the very best start in life and are ready to succeed. That is the ambition of our early years collaborative, which is a multi-agency local quality improvement programme that is delivered at a national scale and is taking forward the vision and priorities of the early years task force.</p><p>A second learning session will take place at the end of this month. It will provide an opportunity for teaching improvement methodology and for community planning partnerships to share learning. I am really pleased to hear about that work and I want to highlight it, because Dads Rock will speak at the learning session. That shows the high regard in which Government and our partners hold the organisation.</p><p>Last year, I launched the parenting strategy, which is an articulation of the importance of parenting that aims to strengthen the help and support that are on offer to parents. Dads Rock assisted with our engagement with parents in developing the strategy, and I thank it sincerely for that. Last year, we engaged with more than 1,500 parents and carers. About 500 of them were dads, and many of them told us that they feel that mums get offered support but dads are expected just to get on with things. Gordon MacDonald and David Torrance articulated some of those feelings.</p><p>Many of those dads referred to mother and toddler groups. That shows that, as Graeme Dey noted, even the turns of phrase that are used can often make dads feel unwelcome. As a working mum whose wee boy is cared for by her husband, I and my family are really careful to call the local groups baby and toddler groups.</p><p>The views that we received from all parents and carers were critical in shaping our national parenting strategy and really helped to identify the kind of commitments that we needed to include. We have now set up a fathers national advisory panel to help us to consider how our policies, services and communities can become much more dad friendly. I hope that that move will reassure David Torrance and Gordon MacDonald.</p><p>In September, the First Minister announced the early years task force commitment of &#163;18 million over three years to improve the provision of family support throughout Scotland. The fathers national advisory panel will help to ensure that that family support also addresses fathers&#8217; needs.</p><p>We recognise the range of important work that the third sector does to support families. That is why we are investing &#163;20 million through the third sector early intervention fund plus directing an additional &#163;10 million towards third sector strategic funding partnerships. I am delighted to say that Families Need Fathers Scotland and Fathers Network Scotland are two of the strategic funding partnerships that, along with the successful organisations that will receive funding through the third sector early intervention fund, will help us to improve the support for fathers throughout Scotland.</p><p>Investing in parents is good not only for children and young people but for our communities and for the cohesion and productivity of our country. Working hard to remove the barriers that prevent dads from playing their part can only be good for ensuring positive outcomes for our children and young people.</p><p>We have made a good start, which we are determined to build on, and we look forward to working with colleagues across the chamber, Dads Rock and other partners to help us to achieve that. I thank Gordon MacDonald for bringing the debate to the chamber and congratulate Dads Rock, the volunteers and all the other dads who take part. I wish them well and wish them every success for the future.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:37.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690297", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dads Rock"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Gordon MacDonald for bringing this positive debate to the chamber.

It is bold and ambitious, but we should never shy away from ambition when it comes to our nation&#8217;s children and young people.</p><p>We believe that all children and young people in Scotland should be safe, happy and healthy, and supported throughout their childhoods and young adulthoods to be confident and healthy individuals who are ready to succeed. The Government cannot achieve that on its own, which is why the motion celebrates partnership working across the parties in the Parliament and with our partners in the public and third sectors, because despite any differences we may have, ultimately we are all united by the desire to ensure that each and every child in Scotland has the best start in life.</p><p>We want all children and young people to become achieving, responsible adults who are ambitious for themselves, for their neighbours and for their country. Parents, families and carers want to do their best for their children, as do the professionals who support them. We in Government must do our best too, to help create a society where the wellbeing of every child is safeguarded and supported, and where no child is left behind.</p><p>The evidence that links early intervention and investing in the crucial early years to the achievement of positive outcomes in later life is incontrovertible. However, early intervention does not equate to acting only in the earliest years and as the minister who is also responsible for Scotland&#8217;s fantastic older young people, I am keen that we focus on the whole life course of children who are growing up in Scotland.</p><p>Overarching all our work for children and young people is the getting it right for every child approach. It is important to remember that the E in GIRFEC stands for &#8220;every&#8221;. GIRFEC is for every child&#8212;for each and every baby, toddler, primary school pupil and teenager in Scotland.</p><p>GIRFEC is a personalised approach. It considers all the needs and risks of individuals and what is going on in their lives. It expects professionals to engage with children and young people and their families, to discuss what might help improve their wellbeing and their outcomes. It applies equally to all our children and young people. In some cases, that means getting it right for children who need extra help and support&#8212;for instance, ensuring that we support our young carers and children with additional and complex needs.</p><p>We must ensure that, as corporate parents, we are giving the right support to children who are under our care. As part of the wider work on child protection, we will be looking at how services respond to protection issues and circumstances that are faced by vulnerable young people. Work on that will be taken forward by the ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation.</p><p>The whole system approach in youth justice exemplifies how multidiscipline partnership working improves outcomes for young people as well as for victims and communities. That approach works across all systems and agencies, bringing together the Government&#8217;s key policy frameworks into one holistic approach for young people who offend. Through early intervention and robust community alternatives, many can be diverted from statutory measures, prosecution and custody.</p><p>Working alongside our GIRFEC approach are our educational ambitions for all children and young people, as set out in the curriculum for excellence, which provides a coherent, more flexible and enriched curriculum from the ages of three to 18 and improves standards and attainment for all children and young people. Both GIRFEC and the curriculum for excellence are policy approaches that we should have pride in in Scotland.</p><p>The early years framework was published by the Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in 2008. It was an important milestone, setting out a shared commitment to the early years and to the importance of preventative spending. To step up the pace of change, the early years task force was established and it is leading on the development of an early years collaborative. It is the first time in the world that such a quality improvement approach has been tried in a multi-agency context, attracting international attention and interest.</p><p>The objectives are to deliver tangible improvement in outcomes and to reduce inequalities for Scotland&#8217;s vulnerable children; to put Scotland on course to shifting the balance of public services towards early intervention and prevention by 2016; and to sustain this change to 2018 and beyond.</p><p>It is clear that we have the commitment and the will to deliver, and a strong evidence base about what works to make improvements. Up until now, we have lacked a method to scale up the pockets of excellent practice across Scotland. A few months ago, I had the pleasure and privilege of speaking to Bruce Perry from the Child Trauma Academy, who pointed out that small developed nations such as Scotland have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of progressive social policy. This collaborative will give us the platform to collectively drive the transformational change that we need and make it much easier for partners to learn from one another.</p><p>Community planning partnerships will be the main vehicle for delivering this, because the real change will happen at local level. The collaborative&#8217;s first learning session, which was held in January, brought together more than 700 people from Scotland&#8217;s 32 CPPs and demonstrated that, as a small developed nation, Scotland is extremely well positioned to enable all relevant stakeholders, motivated by the collective will to do things better, to come together in one room and work together to do just that.</p><p>Although the work of our dedicated professionals is critical, we know that parents are the greatest influence on children. I want to ensure that all parents feel empowered, valued and supported; indeed, that is the main aim of the national parenting strategy, which covers the parenting of children and young people of all ages, starting with preconception, and anyone else in a parenting role including kinship carers and the corporate parent of children who are looked after by the state. The views of parents lie at the heart of the strategy, which aims to champion the importance of Scotland&#8217;s parents, highlight the positive difference that they can make and strengthen the help and support that are on offer to them.</p><p>We have already announced funding of &#163;18 million from the early years change fund to help local authorities work with partners to provide access to high-quality, co-ordinated family support. Linked to that is the family nurse partnership, an early intervention programme that provides support to first-time teenage mothers and is making a valuable difference for vulnerable children in six health board areas. Indeed, the First Minister has announced an additional &#163;11 million over the next two years to continue rolling out the programme across Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We want to make Scotland the best place to grow up.

It is a very welcome move.</p><p>If we want Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up, we need to work to increase opportunities for children to play. After all, play is fundamental to a happy, healthy childhood and we are investing &#163;3 million over three years in outdoor play opportunities to help children have fun, be physically active, learn to assess risk and foster links to their local environments and communities. I had the pleasure of listening to Dundee-based academic Suzanne Zeedyk, whose comments about babies being relationship-ready illustrate how crucial it is for parents to interact positively and to play with their babies from birth onwards.</p><p>Evidence shows that 75 per cent of brain growth happens and 50 per cent of language gets put in place in the first three years of a child&#8217;s life, and we have been promoting such messages through our successful play talk read campaign, to which I am delighted to say we have committed &#163;1 million per year over three years for its further development. That investment in play will help to provide a platform for our national play strategy, which will be published this year and will articulate the seriousness of play as a fundamental right for all children and young people.</p><p>I have outlined some of the significant non-legislative work that is under way across Scotland to help to ensure that every child has the best start. I have also outlined the critical role of partnership working in realising our ambition. The children and young people bill, which will be introduced this year, provides a legislative framework to accelerate that change and ensure consistency. Through the bill, we aim to embed in legislation key elements of GIRFEC by defining the meaning of wellbeing; to reflect the important role of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in influencing policy, practice and legislation through a series of new duties on ministers and the public sector; to ensure better permanence planning for looked-after children; and to increase early support for children, parents and families by expanding the amount&#8212;and, in turn, flexibility&#8212;of early learning and childcare to 600 hours per annum. That signals an increase of 45 per cent in Scotland since 2007, and we will also extend that access to our most vulnerable two-year-olds. Last year&#8217;s consultation on the bill drew 300 responses from a diverse range of stakeholders, and our programme of engagement included activities with 2,400 children and young people. Feedback and analysis indicate broad support for the proposed changes.</p><p>I turn briefly to some of the challenges that we face in our pursuit of creating the kind of country that we want our children to grow up in and the opportunities that they deserve. One of the greatest barriers is poverty. Research shows that family disadvantage, in terms of income, education and area deprivation, can have a negative impact on children&#8217;s health and cognitive, social and behavioural development. However, research shows that a rich home learning environment, positive relationships, good communication and family meals can act as protective factors, counteracting some of the negative outcomes that are associated with a disadvantaged background. It is, therefore, clear that we must do everything that we can to resist the poverty trap.</p><p>Sadly, poverty undermines parents&#8217; efforts, so the poverty trap is no easy challenge to overcome. This Government firmly believes that children in Scotland deserve the best possible start in life. We do not want to see any child, never mind 17 per cent of them, born into or condemned to live a life of poverty. Unfortunately, poverty also undermines our best efforts to support parents and families. The current levels of poverty in Scotland, particularly among children, are unacceptable. We know the damage that poverty causes and none of us should be content to allow it to continue.</p><p>The Scottish Government is doing everything that it can to tackle poverty and inequality in Scotland with the devolved powers and resources that it has at its disposal. Only last week, the Deputy First Minister outlined her vision for a fairer and more equal Scotland. Against the backdrop of a recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, she articulated this Government&#8217;s aspiration to go beyond softening the blows of punishing welfare reforms from London and to gain the powers to prevent the blows in the first place. It will never be easy to tackle the headline poverty figures while personal taxation and welfare benefits policies are reserved to the United Kingdom Government. We want a welfare system that is simpler, that makes work pay and that lifts families out of poverty. For us, on the Scottish National Party benches, it is clear where the solution lies: our Parliament should have control over such matters for the benefit of families and communities in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to provide the member with that detail, but nevertheless we should recognise the improved outcomes for the teenage mothers who are already benefiting from the partnerships&#8217; early intervention approach and celebrate the fact that we in Scotland will be rolling that out across the rest of the health boards in the next two years.

I hope that that gives Anne McTaggart some comfort that the strategy is truly for all parents and those in a parenting role, including the corporate parent.</p><p>It is right for us to focus on what that means for fathers. Sometimes when we talk about parents, we tend to mean mums and, perhaps unintentionally, we cut dads out of the picture. That needs to change, as I think everyone would agree. In a modern and successful Scotland, we want to encourage and support fathers in playing a much more active role in their children&#8217;s upbringing and, as Mark McDonald says, to view fathers in a much more modern way.</p><p>During our work to develop the parenting strategy, we engaged with more than 1,500 parents and carers. About 500 of them were dads, many of whom were living apart from their children. We are acutely aware of the issues that fathers face, and I thank them for giving us their time to help us develop the strategy.</p><p>In response, we have set up a fathers national advisory panel to help us consider how our policies, services and communities can become more dad friendly. That is a proactive move to provide a platform for fathers to input directly into policy. In answer to Sandra White, that group will help to dad-proof policies, and its members will include practitioners, academics and policy makers. Referring to what Mark McDonald said, we will also invite a representative with knowledge of disability and additional needs. I am delighted that Ian Maxwell from Families Need Fathers has agreed to sit on our fathers national advisory panel to ensure that we do not lose sight of the needs of fathers who do not live with their children.</p><p>I strongly believe that both parents should be involved in their child&#8217;s upbringing, as long as that is safe, practical and in the interests of the child. Generally, it is best if parents can agree on what is best for their children.

The national parenting strategy commits us to updating it in 2014 and to publicising it more. We will certainly involve Families Need Fathers when we update it, and my officials will talk to Families Need Fathers shortly to discuss what we can do now to publicise it more. The debate is timely in relation to that dialogue.</p><p>This year we have provided funding to Families Need Fathers for a project that provides information and support to fathers and other family members facing contact problems after separation. It is also working to improve understanding of existing legal rights and to promote involvement of non-resident fathers in their children&#8217;s education.</p><p>I know how difficult some non-resident fathers can find it to be fully involved in their children&#8217;s lives. Indeed, many members mentioned that in their contributions. Contact cases can be very difficult for all concerned.</p><p>John Mason referred to article 9(3) of the UNCRC, which provides:</p><p>&#8220;States Parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</p><p>As John Mason, Malcolm Chisholm and Bob Doris mentioned, the key is the &#8220;best interests&#8221; of the child.</p><p>The relevant Scottish legislation&#8212;section 11 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995&#8212;provides that in cases such as contact and residence, the court</p><p>&#8220;shall regard the welfare of the child concerned as its paramount consideration&#8221;.</p><p>We are not planning any amendments to section 11 that could have an adverse impact. We believe that, where it is possible and safe, both parents should be involved in the upbringing of their children, but the child must always be at the centre.</p><p>Sandra White mentioned courts and Christine Grahame gave a very factual and knowledgeable account of her experience in the legal field. I reiterate that I am happy to follow up any of the points that she wants to be covered. We are taking steps to improve the court system. Kenny MacAskill today launched a consultation on a bill to reform the civil courts, so the issue is very much live. That bill will address inefficiencies in Scotland&#8217;s civil courts and rebalance the system so that more cases will be heard in local sheriff courts. We hope that that move will find more user-friendly ways of dealing with family disputes.</p><p>At another level, we have established a working group on bar reporters, on which Families Need Fathers is represented. Bar reporters provide reports to sheriffs in contact cases. Moreover, members who were unable to participate in today&#8217;s debate have raised with me the practical problems that can arise when a child is relocated in the UK. We will continue to work with the UK Government to raise awareness of the practical issues of child relocation in the UK.</p><p>Bringing up children is a hugely rewarding job&#8212;none of us wants to forget that point, which was raised in members&#8217; speeches&#8212;for dads as well as mums, but it can also be the hardest job that there is. If we are serious about improving outcomes for our children and young people, we need to ensure that all parents and carers get the support that they need, when they need it, and we need to ensure that dads are supported to play their full part. I am glad that Nanette Milne welcomed the work that we have done with the national parenting strategy to address some of the issues that fathers raised.</p><p>As the First Minister announced in September, the early years task force has committed &#163;18 million over three years to improve the provision of family support across Scotland. I am glad that Anne McTaggart welcomed that, given her experience of groups in Glasgow. Indeed, I visited the Parent Network Scotland in Greenock and I very much understand its good work. Family support will be influenced by the fathers national advisory panel and we will ensure that family support meets the needs of fathers across Scotland.</p><p>It is important to recognise that we are not starting from scratch. Many members mentioned the dads rock musical playgroup that is run by dads for dads. I had the pleasure of meeting those dads a couple of times and I recognise the work that they do, which Mark McDonald and Malcolm Chisholm mentioned.</p><p>Removing the barriers that prevent dads from playing their part is one of the most effective ways that we can improve the health, wellbeing, opportunities and life chances of our children and young people. Investing in parents&#8212;by that I mean dads as well as mums&#8212;is good for not only children and young people but our communities and the cohesion and productivity of our country. That is something that we should not forget.</p><p>We have made a start and we are determined to build on that. We look forward to working with colleagues across the chamber and partners such as Families Need Fathers to achieve more.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:48.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families Need Fathers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will consider that point, and Christine Grahame and I can continue a dialogue on it.

I, too, welcome our friends from Gingerbread, some of whom I think I had the pleasure of meeting at a Save the Children event in the Parliament before Christmas. If those folk are not in the chamber, I certainly want to welcome those whom I have not met, and perhaps we will get a chance to meet sometime soon.</p><p>Like others, I pay tribute to Gingerbread for supporting families in Scotland and congratulate the Fife branch on its wonderful work over the past 25 years. It has been great to hear David Torrance&#8217;s fantastic description of what Fife Gingerbread does in its local communities.</p><p>Despite Malcolm Chisholm stealing my thunder, I am delighted that Fife Gingerbread has been awarded &#163;10,000 from the Scottish Government&#8217;s community and families fund to run a pilot playgroup in Dunfermline for dads with children under five and an interest in music, which will build on the success of&#8212;as Malcolm Chisholm rightly noted&#8212;the two dads rock playgroups in Edinburgh. Dads rock is another wonderful organisation; it recently celebrated its first birthday, so it is a wee bit younger than the Fife Gingerbread group.</p><p>The Scottish Government's aspiration for children and young people is a simple but ambitious one: we want Scotland to be the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up. We want Scotland to be a more child-friendly country, and to have a culture that supports all parents and carers&#8212;including those raising children on their own&#8212;and values their role.</p><p>We believe strongly that families need to feel supported not only by our public services but by their own families and communities. Gingerbread, One Parent Families Scotland and many other organisations play a crucial role in supporting lone-parent families.</p><p>Jayne Baxter asked that we do more to support parents. I am pleased that the Government has shown its commitment to Scotland&#8217;s parents by ensuring that they are supported when they need it in order to do what can be&#8212;I am speaking as a mother of a two-year-old&#8212;a difficult job and to do it well.</p><p>In the national parenting strategy that we published last year, we have recognised the particular pressures that lone parents face. We consulted 1,500 parents from all backgrounds in that consultation. It was a pleasure to meet so many wonderful people whose contribution culminated in the publication of our strategy.</p><p>The main aim of the strategy is to strengthen the help and support on offer to parents. We want parents, carers and families to know that, whatever their needs and wherever they live, practical support is available. As David Torrance said, that could be to overcome self-esteem and confidence issues.</p><p>As the First Minister announced in September last year, the early years task force is committing &#163;18 million over three years to improve the provision of family support across Scotland. Malcolm Chisholm is a member of that task force; I thank him for his work on that and his deep interest in the area. In addition, we will continue to provide specialist information, advice and support services tailored to meet the needs of lone-parent families and the practitioners who work with them. That includes telephone support, telephone mentoring, benefits and money advice, online information for lone parents, and training and material for practitioners.</p><p>I am particularly proud of the tradition of community-based projects in Scotland, including those, such as Fife Gingerbread, that rely on volunteers to deliver sustainable support for local communities, drawn from the communities themselves&#8212;a truly asset-based approach. They provide a wide variety of services to lone parents in local communities, including early intervention and support for families who have a range of multiple and complex needs. It is right that we celebrate their work, the holistic approach that they take, and the volunteers who make all that happen.</p><p>I would like to touch on the support that lone parents in Fife get from Fife Gingerbread and, much more generally, on the challenges that lone parents face. The issue is an extremely important one, because almost one in four children live in one-parent households and the figure is projected to rise significantly.</p><p>Nine out of 10 lone parents are women, but I have met a number of lone fathers who face a number of different challenges. That shows us that, as Annabelle Ewing and Liz Smith said, we should scratch beneath the stereotypes; we should certainly not stigmatise lone parents. Liz Smith gave us personal testimony of why we should be careful of stereotyping.</p><p>We know from the latest growing up in Scotland findings&#8212;David Torrance and Jayne Baxter mentioned this, too&#8212;that lone parents are less comfortable engaging with formal services and less likely to attend baby and toddler groups, so the support that they get from services such as Gingerbread and One Parent Families Scotland can make all the difference.</p><p>Whether children have always had only one parent, or whether their parents have divorced, they were never married or one of their parents has died, there is no evidence to suggest that being brought up by one parent rather than two automatically leads to worse outcomes. It is important to avoid discriminating attributions and assumptions that relate to perceived links between lone parenthood and social problems. Loudly and clearly, I pay tribute to the many lone parents in Scotland who do an amazing job in raising children without the support of a partner, which they often do while living in particularly difficult circumstances.</p><p>However, it is also important to recognise, as many members have, that just under half of the children who live with one parent are poor, compared with 24 per cent of children who live in couple families. As Roderick Campbell pointed out, Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s recent report, &#8220;Surviving Poverty&#8212;The Impact of Lone Parenthood&#8221;, powerfully highlights the many challenges that lone parents face. As organisations such as One Parent Families Scotland, the Poverty Alliance and the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland tell us, our best efforts to support Scotland&#8217;s parents are undermined by poverty.</p><p>This Government firmly believes that children in Scotland deserve the best possible start in life. We do not want any child to be born into, or condemned to, a life of poverty. It is simply morally unacceptable that 17 per cent of our children still live in relative poverty. We are doing all that we can to tackle poverty and inequality in Scotland within the limited powers and resources that we have, for example through our commitment to increase the offer of early learning and childcare for three and four-year-olds to 600 hours and through the work of the early years task force and the early years change fund.</p><p>Although I know that there is constitutional disagreement, this Government&#8217;s point of view is that we need the powers over personal taxation and welfare benefits that are currently reserved to the UK Government. We all want a welfare system that is simpler, that makes work pay and that lifts people out of poverty, but I believe that the solution is for this Parliament to have control over such matters, so that we can devise policies for the benefit of the Scottish people.</p><p>I end by thanking Fife Gingerbread and its team of volunteers and other projects in Scotland that provide crucial support to lone-parent families and help parents to do the best job that they can. I wish Fife Gingerbread and the families that it works with every success for the future.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;18:08.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685011", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread (Support for Lone Parents)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank David Torrance for securing the debate.

Those benefits improve the life chances not only of children, but of adoptive parents. This year&#8217;s theme is rule yourself in, a call to encourage people to think of themselves as possible adopters as opposed to ruling themselves out because, for example, they think that they may be too old, they live in the wrong place, they are single or they have a partner of the same sex. It is a simple campaign to get folk to realise that they can make come true the dreams of children and young people who are in need of a family who love them.</p><p>Parents are the biggest influence and the most important educators in a child&#8217;s life. Children who experience a secure, loving and nurturing home environment are far better able to withstand life&#8217;s challenges and achieve their full potential. Getting it right for every child means that every child deserves that environment, regardless of their circumstances. Our challenge is to achieve that for the children who, for whatever reason, cannot be looked after by their birth parents.</p><p>The Parliament has consistently and correctly put aside party politics on this agenda. Together, we have learned of the importance of the early years, of secure attachments and of play and touch. We have also learned the value of strong and plentiful relationships in developing the self-control, risk awareness and resilience to cope with setbacks that we all need to help us through life. This time a year ago, the then minister, Angela Constance, told Parliament about the Government&#8217;s commitment to improve the timescales and quality of decision making for children who are looked after by local authorities. The report on care and permanence planning by the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration focused minds when it revealed that the longest that it took for a child to be placed with an adoptive family was 10 years and 10 months&#8212;an unacceptable figure, but at the extreme end of the scale.</p><p>In response, we stated our intention to do what we could to shorten the length of time that it takes to find a permanent home for a child. We said that we would do that in partnership with the looked-after children strategic implementation group&#8212;LACSIG&#8212;and other partner organisations through a shift in care planning towards fewer placements for children, an early permanence decision for every child and a system that puts the child at the centre of service design and delivery. It was clear to us that that is a long-term ambition that we need to get right, which means ensuring that the pace of change is correct to avoid driving forward a change process that unintentionally creates dangerous consequences for our most vulnerable children and young people.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate allows me to outline the distance travelled since last year&#8217;s national adoption week in the Government&#8217;s activity and allows the Parliament to do our bit to raise awareness of adoption. Last year, LACSIG hit the ground running by identifying the need for better planning and decision making for children in care. Through its care planning hub, LACSIG co-ordinates the activities that are detailed in the Scottish Government&#8217;s care and permanence plan, which was published in 2011, all of which are designed to support the agencies that are responsible for care planning. The care and permanence plan seeks to build a system that is proactive, identifying and responding to the needs of children as early in their lives as possible. It is a system in which multiple agencies work together to support and sustain placements, reduce disruption and keep placement moves to a minimum.</p><p>Many other organisations and professionals are involved in making timely and considered placements for children&#8212;it is not just the domain of social workers. We rely on the children&#8217;s hearings system and panel members, lawyers and sheriffs, court officers, health professionals and the many voluntary organisations that work with children. Therefore, to bring about the improvements that we all want to see, a range of approaches will be required and we will need everyone who is involved in the system to commit to that change.</p><p>I will outline the progress that has been made so far on care and permanence planning. The Scottish Government-funded centre of excellence for looked-after children in Scotland is now just over a year old. CELSIS has a dedicated care and permanence team and is staffed by a range of experienced professionals from the social work, research and legal sectors. Their job is simple: they work closely with the individual local authorities and their partners to make improvements to the local decision-making systems. The team is focused on practical, on-the-ground change, trouble-shooting when things go wrong and, more important, supporting comprehensive redesign of the care system one area at a time. With all that we know about what works with regard to early intervention, concurrent planning and the need for speedy decisions, the team is uniquely placed to offer the sort of intensive, system-wide support that is needed to bring all that together and to help transform the care experience of every child.</p><p>I am pleased to report that the team is already in place and that it is working with seven local authorities on a range of specific improvement projects. For example, the team has successfully engaged with a local authority on managing contact. In addition, the team has concentrated its efforts on working with professionals such as social workers and their managers, panel members and so on through focus groups.</p><p>So that others can benefit from what is learned during each project, the team holds regular regional permanence events for practitioners and leaders. Six events have already been held to allow professionals from different regions to meet and to help us to focus efforts on what will really make a difference. We have listened carefully to the valuable and often candid feedback from those events, and it is helping us to shape what we and the permanence team do next. The team has identified good examples of best practice, which it intends to highlight and promote in practice exchange events.</p><p>In addition, children&#8217;s panel members, social workers, lawyers and voluntary organisation workers have told us what the guiding principles should be for policy and practice concerning our looked-after children. Collectively, we should have much more ambition for our looked-after children, and should always strive for permanence for older children and those who have disabilities, are in sibling groups or are from minority ethnic communities. We should intervene in a child&#8217;s life at the right and earliest point, and should ensure that what is offered to them is the best support that they can get to enable them to stay in their family when and if that is possible. We need to work hard to provide the right support for practitioners to help them to make what are often extremely difficult decisions confidently. We must work to create a shared understanding of what putting a child at the centre of service design and delivery means for social workers, panel members and the judiciary.</p><p>Perhaps the most consistent and overriding request is for strong leadership at all levels of public life and across the wider corporate family. Since coming to my current post nearly a year ago, I have taken my responsibility as a corporate parent very seriously. In this chamber, we are all corporate parents and have an opportunity, not least in today&#8217;s debate, to provide national leadership from Scotland&#8217;s Parliament to ensure that we do things better for our looked-after children. I hope that members from across the chamber will engage with the corporate parenting training that is available next week.</p><p>If we are to achieve our ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world for a child to grow up, our children must feel loved and special in order to have a sense of trust and confidence in themselves. We know that secure attachments are necessary for a child to thrive, and that a child with secure attachments will do better at school and is likely to be good at making friends, forming relationships later in life and coping with life&#8217;s events. That is an essential component of our work on the early years. One of the biggest risks to the wellbeing of any child, especially our most vulnerable children, is the impact of insecure attachments. After all, a poorly attached child becomes a poorly attached adult, whose footprint on public services throughout their life will be large and expensive.</p><p>It is timely that CELCIS, having been commissioned by LACSIG, will shortly publish Scotland&#8217;s first comprehensive study into how attachment theory is taught and used in practice to assess and plan the care of looked-after children. We intend that to have a direct impact on practice across Scotland, by sharing the lessons of projects such as the Jeely Piece Club in Castlemilk, Change is a Must in Perth and Kinross, and Seamab School in Kinross-shire. We need to be in a position in which every teacher, social worker and health professional understands attachment.</p><p>Another part of our ambitious plan was the launch of Scotland&#8217;s first national adoption register. We did that during adoption week last year in partnership with the British Association for Adoption and Fostering. The register provides opportunities for children to be matched with families from across Scotland rather than just with families in their local area. So far, 19 local authorities and all four voluntary adoption agencies are referring children and approved adopters to the register. Ideally, referrals are being made no more than three months after a child&#8217;s plan for adoption has been agreed.</p><p>Over the short life of the register so far, 135 children and 139 families have been referred to the linking service. Currently, we have 82 children who have been linked to 47 families. Fourteen children have already been matched for adoption by the register. That is 14 more than would otherwise have found a safe, stable, nurturing and permanent home. While that is a modest start, the register is nevertheless becoming an important tool to achieve early permanence for those who are referred to it.</p><p>I would like all local authorities to use the register. The children and young people bill proposes that agencies are required to make referrals for any child who is not found a home after three months. However, there is a need to do more to ensure that the approved families and children on the register are a match for each other. It is important to consider that children who are referred to the linking service find it much more difficult to find a family by virtue of their age, medical needs or developmental uncertainty, and some need to be placed with their siblings. Those issues all present challenges to the chances of a child finding a permanent home. That is why the work of the register has been expanded to help manage the expectations of prospective adopters and help them see the real child who can benefit from adoption.</p><p>I look forward to meeting tomorrow some of the 75 families who attended Scotland&#8217;s first two national adoption exchange days, which BAAF organised. The exchange days are events at which prospective adopters are invited to come along and learn more about the children in their areas who could be adopted. I understand that the events have been a real eye-opener for those taking part, who have valued the opportunity to speak directly to social workers and foster carers who know the children well. I also understand that more such events will be held.</p><p>However, the register can do only so much, and it can support only families who have already been approved to adopt. If we are going to provide secure homes for more children, we badly need to find more adopters. The Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 introduced more opportunities to adopt, particularly for single people and same-sex couples, but we are not seeing significantly more people coming forward.</p><p>A key aim is to spread the word to those people who may not see themselves as prospective adopters and encourage them to rule themselves in. The main criterion for people to adopt in Scotland is the ability to provide a safe, loving and nurturing home in which a child can flourish and maximise their future life chances. I urge anyone who can offer such a home to contact their local authority or local voluntary adoption agency this week, and I urge all members in the chamber to do what we can to spread the message across our constituencies.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is national adoption week, and the British Association for Adoption and Fostering is running its 15th annual campaign to raise awareness of the benefits that come with adoption.

I understand Liam McArthur&#8217;s point, but we need to balance that view with the need to ensure that the child is at the centre of the policies and processes that we put in place.</p><p>As part of what we outlined in the debate last year, we asked local authorities to submit their adoption service plans earlier this year. The plans outline how adoption services are planned and delivered, and should evidence that every authority has a clear plan to raise the number of young people afforded permanence or adoption. Two themes emerged: that adoption activity has increased over the past few years and a number of local authorities are taking steps to improve permanence planning; and that Scotland as a whole could recruit more adoptive parents.</p><p>A number of research studies have found that personal qualities such as emotional resilience and positive, realistic motivation are more likely to predict successful adoptive parenting than age or family structure. Despite that, many authorities have maintained age-based criteria, with the upper age limit for adopters of young children ranging between 40 and 45. We also discovered divergences in the way in which plans were prepared. I will work to find the best and most constructive way in which to work with local authorities around achieving consistency, while respecting local decision making and looking at delivery and improvement. Some authorities are doing better than others, and I want to ensure that we learn from the best and support those authorities that need a bit of assistance.</p><p>As I have said, each and every member in the chamber is a corporate parent to more than 16,000 children and young people who are looked after by local authorities. Through no fault of their own, they find themselves in a position whereby their birth family could not care for them unsupported. They are Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable children and they are the responsibility of all of us. We should care for those children and have the same expectations for them as if they were our own. I have had the pleasure of meeting many looked-after children and young people, who are inspirational, resilient and articulate. We should all be proud of them and what they can offer to our country. It is up to us to ensure that they can always realise that potential.</p><p>I am confident about the work that we are doing to implement this agenda. It is moving in the right direction.

Contributions from members have been considered and thoughtful, and most of all they have highlighted that we all want the best for our looked-after children. Indeed, as corporate parents ourselves, we want all our children to experience a safe, stable, nurturing and permanent home. That is the best way in which to ensure that they are equipped with the confidence and self-esteem that they need to help them withstand life&#8217;s challenges.</p><p>It has been heartening to hear that there is recognition across the chamber that it does not matter where children live or whether their parents are single, a couple, or older than those of their peers. The important thing is that our children feel loved and secure.</p><p>As we have heard, we cannot pretend that achieving that is an easy task&#8212;everyone has recognised that it is no easy thing to achieve. It is not without its challenges and we can sometimes feel frustrated at the length of time that it can take to find a permanent home for our children and young people. Many members have cited legal issues or issues around professional capacity, but nevertheless we understand that the time that it takes to find a permanent home can be frustrating. However, we have also heard&#8212;in particular from Gil Paterson in his personal account and from Mark McDonald&#8212;about how doing that too fast can have adverse effects and we must always remember to put the child at the centre of all care planning decisions.</p><p>Let me put on record that the Scottish Government is working hard to improve the life chances of our looked-after children. I, like everyone here, am a corporate parent and I am determined to focus on those things that will make the biggest difference and to support our partners across the sector such as BAAF, the independent adoption agencies and every one of our local authorities so that each child is found a permanent home as quickly as possible.</p><p>I am confident that we have the right policies and the right approach, but we need to remain vigilant and keep those things under review. Our approach is to support those at the front lines who do the heavy lifting. We are doing that effectively through our key initiatives such as the national parenting strategy, getting it right for every child, the corporate parenting agenda, the looked-after children strategic implementation group care and permanence plan, the national adoption register and, of course, the proposals that we set out in the children and young people bill. Those initiatives are already delivering positive change and positive differences to many children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s lives across Scotland.</p><p>Despite there being 16,000 looked-after children that we know about, often the reason for that is that children are staying in care for longer. There are also fewer children coming into care. In addition, the numbers are showing encouraging upward trends in adoption so there is modest improvement and we are definitely travelling in the right direction, which gives us all a bit of confidence that we are making the right decisions.</p><p>I turn to some of the remarks that colleagues have made. Neil Bibby made a thoughtful and compelling speech, which acknowledged the need for us all to work together to move the agenda forward in a way that always recognises that the child should be at the centre of service delivery and design. Neil Bibby also acknowledged the need to support our social workers and to thank them for their work; so too did Hanzala Malik and Kevin Stewart. I absolutely agree with that. Social workers do fantastic, often unsung work and they often need to make challenging and difficult decisions, so it is right that we ensure that social workers feel confident.</p><p>We recognise the need to ensure consistency in decision making. Lack of consistency has been raised by many members, including Stewart Stevenson&#8212;I apologise; I meant Stewart Maxwell&#8212;and Joan McAlpine. I recognise that that is an issue. The Scottish Government has set standards that are expected from child protection services in national child protection guidance and we are creating a national framework for child protection learning and development to support the developmental needs of a multi-agency workforce. However, we know that we always need to do more.</p><p>We also recognise the need to show leadership and to ensure that we work with local government in recognising local needs, while recognising the need for national consistency.</p><p>Liam McArthur thoughtfully and constructively made the point about the need for earlier and better permanence planning. That proved to be a theme in many members&#8217; speeches. I take that point seriously, because it is crucial that we get the right decisions made for every child as quickly as we can. That is why we will continue to help local authorities to address their current case load by providing a consultative permanence team and disseminating good practice. We have already commissioned a project to look into delays and we will continue to raise awareness of the need to get things done quickly.</p><p>Related to the theme of early permanence is the issue of preventative spending and child development. The earliest years of a child&#8217;s life are the most important for their outcomes in later life, cognitively, emotionally and socially. Children cannot be expected to cope with multiple placements and I would not expect that of them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many members have mentioned, the debate has provided a timely opportunity to raise awareness of and reinforce our collective commitment to issues around looked-after children and young people&#8212;in particular, issues around permanence and adoption.

There can never be too many Aileens in life.</p><p>I, too, warmly congratulate David Torrance on securing the debate and thank him for drawing to our intention the achievements of the 5th Fife scout group, which is not an easy name to say. It is a bit like that old score, East Fife 4, Forfar 5; it is a bit of a tongue twister. I thought that it was the 5th Kirkcaldy scout group, but maybe I am wrong. Nevertheless, the 5th Fife scout group deserves our recognition.</p><p>The motion has given us the opportunity to debate the contribution that young people are making in their communities and to society. It is good to hear that the chamber is united in support of the motion. I am pleased and privileged to close the debate.</p><p>I congratulate the 5th Fife scout group on becoming the Scottish champions, having won the Black&#8217;s of Greenock national camping competition this year. David Torrance laid out very well the challenges that the scouts undertook to win the award. I bet that, despite the challenges, it was a lot of fun. That is what Richard Lyle was alluding to when he said that fun is fundamental to the scouting movement. I am sure that the scouts have a lot of stories to tell, which they might share with us later on.</p><p>It was nice to meet the scouts in the garden lobby earlier and see them being shown round our Parliament.</p><p>I pay tribute to Clare Adamson for her intervention, which was useful in highlighting the fantastic work that the scout movement does around the country.</p><p>Like others in the debate, I want to name the scouts involved: Jenny Ritchie, Reagan McLauchlan, Chloe Whyte, Kiah McIntosh, Robbie Swanson and Olivia Ewan. Their talents, hard work and tenacity contributed significantly to the scout group winning the award, so well done to everyone involved. Well done, too, to the 9th Airdrie scout group and the 4th Arbroath and Montrose scout group, who were the runners-up in that challenging competition.</p><p>I also welcome to the chamber James Duffy, the chief executive of the Scouts Association; Carol Lindsay, the Kirkcaldy scout group leader; Duncan Clark, the chairman of the association&#8217;s Scottish board; Alex Duncan, the association&#8217;s commissioner of the East Scotland region; and others who are involved in youth work.</p><p>It is good to know that other uniformed groups and cadets are represented in the public gallery. Over the summer months, I enjoyed meeting the Boys Brigade, the girl guides and the cadets at the Edinburgh military tattoo. Like Stuart McMillan, I had to make an admission about my background. At the Girl Guides event that I spoke at, I had to admit that I was a member of the Girls Brigade. Nonetheless, I recognise the support that each of the uniformed groups give to one another.</p><p>Like Duncan McNeil, I take the opportunity to thank Black&#8217;s of Greenock for its support over the past four years for the Scout Association in Scotland. It is partnerships such as that that help to forge communities, enhance society and make a real and lasting difference to young people&#8217;s lives. I wish his grandson all the best at his first scout meeting tonight.</p><p>The Government wants Scotland to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. Youth work organisations, such as the scouts, are helping our young people to be the successful, confident, effective and responsible individuals that our nation needs.</p><p>David Torrance provided a useful historical overview of the development of the scout movement over the years, and it is good to know that Dennis Robertson&#8217;s positive and happy memories of the scouts have had a lasting legacy.</p><p>As Anne McTaggart stated, youth work is making a significant contribution to young people&#8217;s health, wellbeing and learning. It supports delivery across all the national outcomes and it contributes to key policies such as curriculum for excellence, opportunities for all and getting it right for every child.</p><p>The youth work sector has a vital role to play in implementing curriculum for excellence. There are important delivery partners in the sector that offer young people valuable opportunities for learning and personal development both in and out of school. Young people learn in different ways, and youth work gives them the chance to flourish in a wide range of learning contexts. Curriculum for excellence recognises that not all learning takes place in schools, and activities such as the scouts can play an important role in young people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>In informal and fun settings across the country, youth work organisations are helping young people to develop confidence, learn to problem solve and work well with others. Employers are calling out for those skills and our young people need them to succeed in the modern world&#8212;Claire Baker made a point about how important it is for people applying for jobs to have such skills in their r&#233;sum&#233;s.</p><p>In particular, as other members did, I want to highlight the valuable role that the thousands of volunteers play across Scotland. Without volunteers, it would be impossible to deliver the activities that organisations such as the scouts provide. A recent snapshot survey by YouthLink Scotland estimates that more than 73,000 adults are volunteering with national voluntary youth work organisations. In my constituency, the Biggar youth project, street level with universal connections, and many others including the local uniformed groups are providing positive activities for our young people. Volunteers make that happen, and it is right that we acknowledge their time commitment towards ensuring that young people have activities in their communities.</p><p>Indeed, Scouts Scotland is a volunteer-led movement. Its programmes for young people are delivered with the support of almost 7,000 adult volunteer members, not to mention the countless number of parents and other supporters. In addition to that, more than 2,000 young scout members regularly volunteer their time to support their younger peers.

As Anne McTaggart said, this is far above party politics.

I am delighted that it continues to be committed to services for children and families through the roll-out of its new initiative to support parents and tackle issues of neglect. I am always interested to learn more about the outcomes, as members have asked me to.</p><p>I recognise collectively all the other third sector organisations for their contribution to services for children and families across the country. Earlier today, I visited St Eunan&#8217;s primary school in Clydebank with Save the Children to learn more about its families and schools together&#8212;FAST&#8212;programme. I believe that Neil Bibby has seen that project and I encourage others who are interested to engage with Save the Children on it.</p><p>Liam McArthur, Jamie Hepburn and others mentioned innovative and good practice in their areas. In my constituency, Healthy Valleys provides local support to parents and families in Clydesdale.</p><p>Anne McTaggart made points about the New Orleans project&#8212;I, too, have met Matt Forde to discuss it. I am interested in that work, which will be of particular interest to the Education and Culture Committee, given its investigations into looked-after children.</p><p>As many of us know from personal experience or from having family members who have children, being a parent is the most rewarding and the most challenging role that we will ever take on. We all want to give our children the best start in life, so that they can develop into healthy, happy, confident and successful individuals who are ready and equipped for the challenges of adult life.</p><p>However, I am aware of the difficulties that are faced by some families and children throughout Scotland. As the Minister for Children and Young People, as an MSP and as a mother, I am committed to ensuring that we are getting it right for all children, young people and families by tackling those persistent issues head-on.</p><p>As members have noted, neglect remains one of the most insidious child protection problems in Scottish society. The recent study that we commissioned from the University of Stirling showed the scale and nature of neglect, and highlighted that it remains one of the biggest challenges that face our children&#8217;s services.</p><p>There is no single simple initiative that will resolve those problems, but a variety of actions taken together can make a huge difference for families and for children who are experiencing neglect. Neglect can arise from a range of different factors and can take an enormous number of different guises, as members have highlighted. It often involves substance misuse, poverty and a range of risk factors that can undermine the ability of parents and families to cope. Anne McTaggart, Mary Fee and Jamie Hepburn outlined some of the stark figures in relation to the subject.</p><p>We are taking a holistic approach to addressing neglect, which is based on collaborative working. That approach lies behind our forthcoming national parenting strategy and underpins the work that we have done with stakeholders to improve the tools, guidance and support around child protection in recent years. We have piloted a risk assessment toolkit to help professionals to protect vulnerable children, and it will be launched soon.</p><p>Liam McArthur mentioned that the debate is pertinent to the work of the Education and Culture Committee, but it is also pertinent to and timely for the work that the Government is doing. Next week, we will launch our national parenting strategy, which aims to ensure that parents get the support that they need when they need it so that they can do their very best for their children. We want parents to feel empowered, valued, supported and confident in their ability to care for their children.</p><p>We are clear that the national parenting strategy will articulate the importance of parenting and of parents, because they are the single biggest influences in their child&#8217;s life. We will focus on ways in which we can work together to support parents and carers to do their job well.</p><p>As part of the strategy, we engaged with more than 1,500 parents throughout Scotland, and we have received strong messages about the support that they need. In response to Mary Fee&#8217;s comment about the need to look not only at the early years but at the whole life course of a child, we will also reflect on the needs of parents with adolescent children. That is an important point, as we cannot simply equate early intervention with early years. Our strategy will be a welcome articulation of the real respect that parents need.</p><p>We recognise that&#8212;as Liz Smith, Mary Fee and others pointed out&#8212;poverty has a huge impact on families and children. I certainly do not want any child to be born into or condemned to a life of poverty, and it is not acceptable that 17 per cent of our children still live in relative poverty. We are doing all that we can with the powers that we have to try to tackle some of those issues. Our child poverty strategy for Scotland expresses our commitment to focusing on the need to tackle the long-term drivers of poverty through early intervention and prevention partnerships and holistic services.</p><p>We have all coalesced around the idea that we need to use preventative measures and early intervention, and that is a hallmark of what the Government is trying to do. The earlier we can spot the signs of neglect, the better chance we have of taking steps that will prevent the problems from escalating. The message that we received from our engagement with parents around the country was that they need support and help before a problem becomes a crisis.</p><p>The early intervention approach is embedded in our getting it right for every child strategy, and we are proposing legislation to ensure that early intervention is mainstreamed across public services in Scotland. That approach will underpin what we want to achieve through the children and young people bill. The consultation on the bill, which closed last week, gathered views from the public and wider stakeholders throughout Scotland.</p><p>We hope that that legislation, along with our parenting strategy and our collaborative work with the third sector and others, will ensure that we go on to make Scotland the best country in the world in which to grow up. That will take a lot of work, and it is not an easy challenge to face, but everyone wants to see that happen.</p><p>I congratulate Neil Bibby, Hugh Henry and the NSPCC on the work that they are doing to ensure that we can take some small steps towards achieving that greater aim.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the debate.

We want all our children to have the best start in life so that they can develop into healthy, happy, confident and successful individuals who are ready and equipped for the challenges of adult life. That aspiration is shared across the chamber.</p><p>I am delighted to talk about the Government&#8217;s national parenting strategy, which aims to set out a cohesive and compelling narrative about the value and importance of parenting and how it contributes to improving outcomes for children and young people. I also look forward to hearing constructive thoughts and views from representatives across the chamber, which will enable the debate to contribute to the strategy.</p><p>Parents and carers are the greatest influences on their bairns&#8217; lives, so we must ensure that they get the support that they need when they need it. I want a parental culture in Scotland in which it is completely normal and never a failure for parents to ask for help or advice to enable them to grow in their role. I want parents to feel empowered, valued, supported and confident in their ability to care for their children. A national parenting strategy will bring the necessary leadership, co-ordination and momentum to this crucial issue and will ensure that, across the public sector and wider Scottish society, we focus on ways in which we can all work together to support parents and carers to do their important job well.</p><p>Many of us know that being a parent is both the most rewarding and most challenging role that we ever take on. The strategy will be aimed at all parents, because parents in all circumstances can find parenting difficult. We must ensure that more targeted intensive support is available for families who need it most. The strategy will be relevant not only to mums and dads, but to anyone who is involved in bringing up children&#8212;not least grandparents, who play a hugely important role in childcare and provide additional practical and emotional support to their wider families. It is crucial that the parenting strategy recognises and supports the roles that grandparents and other family members play in bringing up children.</p><p>The strategy will also include the vital role of kinship carers, adoptive and foster parents&#8212;whom it is particularly important to mention during fostering fortnight&#8212;and corporate parents, including all of us in the chamber, who have a duty of care and responsibility for our looked-after children. Whenever I refer to parents, I refer to all kinds of parents.</p><p>The early years framework that was published in 2008 highlighted the strong influence that parents have on their babies and very young children. The work of the chief medical officer, Sir Harry Burns, has taught us about attachment behaviour, the importance of consistent parenting to help children right from birth to make sense of the world, and the impact that environmental and biological influences have on the development of babies during pregnancy. However, parents often struggle with older children and teenagers&#8212;in fact, around a third of all calls to parentline Scotland are from parents of teenagers. For that reason, the parenting strategy will cover the widest possible age group, from pre-conception to adulthood. It will also consider how we can prepare our children and young people to be confident parents of the future.</p><p>The strategy must make a practical difference to parents, so it is important that it will have the views of parents at its heart. Over the past few months, we have gathered the views of more than 1,500 parents from throughout Scotland. I say a huge thank you to the many organisations that hosted discussion groups on our behalf. I also record my heartfelt thanks to the parents who took the time to tell us about their experiences. I have had the privilege of meeting some inspirational characters and brave families who have told me&#8212;through tears, smiles and laughter&#8212;what they believe we need to do. Their views will help to shape our approach.</p><p>We asked what would make a real practical difference to them as, for example, disabled parents, teenage parents, grandparents or parents who are affected by imprisonment, substance misuse, alcohol or domestic abuse. We also asked what the best things are about being a parent, because the strategy will also aim to celebrate parenting and to demonstrate the positive value that we must place on parents and carers for the role that they play in improving outcomes for children and young people.</p><p>I am delighted that our approach has won praise from Children 1st&#8217;s chief executive Anne Houston, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Children 1st welcomed the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to develop a national parenting strategy for all parents and carers. We welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to seeking views from such a wide range of people with a parenting role, many of whose voices are not normally heard.&#8221;</p><p>We will publish a report of parents&#8217; views in June. I have met some of the groups of parents and seen some of the early feedback, so I know that it will be a thought-provoking report.</p><p>When we talk about parents, many of us tend to think about mums, so I want to talk about fathers. I am pleased to see a number of dads in the chamber and will be interested to hear what they say during the debate. In our consultations, we have had a lot of feedback from dads, who often tell us that they want to be more involved in their children&#8217;s lives but are sometimes made to feel unwelcome or excluded.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration is for Scotland to be the best place for children and young people to grow up in.

We will certainly reflect the wider views of dads in our parenting strategy.</p><p>We want to change how we see and respond to fatherhood. In a modern successful Scotland, we want to encourage and support fathers to play a more active role in their children&#8217;s upbringing. The strategy will consider how services and communities can become more dad friendly and at how employers can encourage dads and mums to balance the worlds of work and parenthood.</p><p>There is no doubt that the agenda is huge and challenging and that change cannot be achieved overnight, which is why we are taking a phased approach. As a starting point, in September we will set out our aspirations for parents and for children and young people throughout Scotland. The position statement will help us to sharpen our focus on parenting, to place higher value on the role of parents, to articulate the benefits of supporting parents and to make the case for parents across a range of services and sectors, while ensuring that appropriate support is tailored to meet need. It will also reflect what parents have told us would make a practical difference, and will set out more detailed plans for later phases of work.</p><p>On the basis of meetings that I have had with parents, I anticipate that the next phase of our work, which will kick off later this year, will focus on three strands: parenting in the early years, parenting of older children through to adulthood, and preparing our children and young people to be the parents of the future.</p><p>I have set out what is planned for later this year, but we should not forget that a huge amount of excellent work is going on to support parents in Scotland. At national level we have a continuum of support from universal provision to specialist targeted support, which can be shaped to meet the particular needs of children and families at different stages of their lives. At local level, I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of projects and hearing at first hand from the parents who have benefited from their work.</p><p>The getting it right for every child approach is making a practical difference by ensuring that our key policies and services are child centred. We want to continue to build on that approach. As the motion says, a number of excellent initiatives are helping to support parents throughout Scotland, including the highly successful play, talk, read campaign, which encourages positive interaction between parents and their wee ones. This year the campaign has a bespoke bus, which is travelling to some of our most deprived and isolated communities.</p><p>The family-nurse partnership programme is a preventative, intensive home-visiting programme, which is delivered exclusively to teenage first-time mothers. The programme will be expanded so that by the end of 2013 it will support three times as many families as it currently supports.</p><p>A key and recurring theme that parents raise is childcare, which has been the subject of intense debate in Parliament. We know that high-quality early learning and childcare are vital in improving outcomes for children, and in enabling parents to participate in the labour market, so we are putting in place a range of measures to increase the amount of flexible affordable provision.</p><p>The forthcoming children and young people bill will increase the flexibility of early learning and childcare provision by increasing entitlement from 475 hours per annum to 600 hours per annum of early learning and childcare for three and four-year-olds and looked-after two-year-olds. This financial year we committed &#163;4.5&#160;million from the early years change fund to support local authorities in providing early learning and childcare for our most vulnerable two-year-olds, and we have established a &#163;4.5&#160;million communities and families fund to support community-based solutions for family support and childcare.</p><p>We will develop public-social partnerships to pilot early learning and childcare services in areas of particular or unmet need, and we will hold a national summit in June to explore new ways of working with the private sector to promote more flexible working and family-friendly practices. In addition, we are establishing a sub-group of the early years task force to consider how we might develop high-quality integrated and co-ordinated family centres and early learning and childcare services.</p><p>In conclusion, I say that I am very excited about the parenting strategy and the role that it can play in improving lives in families across Scotland. I know that we all recognise the importance of supporting parents as a way of improving outcomes for children and young people, and I will sincerely welcome constructive views from colleagues across the chamber on the approach that I have set out.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament supports the Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration to making Scotland the best place in the world for children to grow up; acknowledges that the vast majority of parents in Scotland already provide excellent support for their children; recognises the vital role that parents and carers play, not only in improving outcomes for children and young people in their care, but also in creating stronger communities and a more positive future for all; agrees that all parents need support at times and that parents and carers bringing up children in difficult circumstances may need additional support; welcomes the development of a national parenting strategy as a way of driving forward the shared ambition for improving outcomes for children and young people across Scotland; supports the approach taken to gathering the views of a diverse range of 1,500 parents whose voices are not normally heard and using this as a foundation for the national parenting strategy; thanks the many organisations that have hosted discussion groups with parents on the Scottish Government&#8217;s behalf, and welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to continued working in partnership with parents and a wide range of partner agencies to develop the detail of the work.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mark McDonald has made a valid point.

I thank all colleagues for their largely helpful contributions. In particular, I congratulate Clare Adamson, who became a stepgranny recently. I assure members that the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that all families in Scotland receive appropriate, timely support that is based on their needs.</p><p>We all acknowledge that bringing up children is a hugely rewarding job and we heard many people talk about their own first-hand experiences as parents, but we also accept that it can be the hardest job that there is. If we are serious about improving outcomes for our children and young people, we need to ensure that parents and carers get the support that they need, when they need it.</p><p>I am disappointed that some speakers felt that having an opportunity to help to shape a national strategy was a negative approach. I imagine that if I had published a strategy that they had not been able to feed into, they would have grumbled about that as well. Nevertheless, we all agree that investing in parents is a good thing&#8212;not only for children and young people, but for our communities and for the cohesion and productivity of our country. It is part of building a better future for us all.</p><p>We have made a good start. We accept&#8212;I accept as Minister for Children and Young People&#8212;that we have a lot of ground to make up. We need to do more, but we are determined to build on that good start as we move forward, because supporting parents to be the best that they can be and to do the best that they can is one of the most effective ways of improving the health, wellbeing, opportunities and life chances of children and young people.</p><p>We also recognise that supporting parents can help to prevent difficult circumstances from escalating or even arising&#8212;by making sure that we listen to parents and act on what they tell us. That is one of the key themes that has come through from some of the discussions that I have had with parents. Parents want to feel valued and they need to feel that their voices are being heard.</p><p>If parents are equipped and able to nurture their children and give them the love, support and guidance that they need as they grow up, that can help to reduce a whole range of negative outcomes. For that reason, we see our commitment to support for parents as part of our work on prevention and early intervention.</p><p>We have plenty of evidence about the importance of parents in reducing crime and offending behaviour. Parents have a key role in developing self-control, reducing the risk of and building resilience to trauma, building strong social bonds and setting appropriate boundaries for behaviour. By improving our support for parents we expect to see positive impacts across a range of outcomes. Supporting parents is good for Scotland, as we all stand to gain, whether or not we have children ourselves.</p><p>I turn to specific comments from members, who made valuable contributions to the debate. Clare Adamson made the important point that there is a need to articulate parents&#8217; value to society. I agree absolutely, and I am determined to ensure that the strategy will do that and make us all value parents&#8217; contribution to society a whole lot more.</p><p>In an informed speech, Nanette Milne referred to the growing up in Scotland study and the need to tackle some persistent intergenerational problems. We recognise that we need to make sure that there is much more mixing up of society, so that people experience life alongside older people and so that we break the cycle of poverty. We must make sure that parents who, as children, did not have the best start in life are given more tuition to be responsible parents themselves. They can then go on to be good parents and ensure that the persistent cycle of intergenerational social problems is broken. We have an opportunity to do that with the forthcoming children&#8217;s bill and with this parenting strategy. I am glad that Nanette Milne made that important point.</p><p>Nanette Milne also mentioned the importance of schools for the strategy. I agree absolutely. I note that the curriculum for excellence covers the responsibilities of parenthood. I take on board her points, but I also recognise that teachers now have much more well-rounded training so that, when they have completed their registration, they are able to identify additional needs.</p><p>Maureen Watt spoke about the isolation that many new mums feel. The groups that I have met all note the importance of building up networks, making new friends and finding others with common interest. She also spoke of the need to build resilience, which is essential if we want to enable and equip families and communities to find their own solutions.</p><p>Dennis Robertson spoke about being a proud Aberdonian, about getting a two-for-one deal when he had his twins and about being a modern man and helping with the nappies. His serious points about coping and normalising the seeking of help were an important part of the debate.</p><p>Mark McDonald raised specific issues about post-natal depression and the importance of early diagnosis. Having gone through childbirth myself, I know how difficult it is to have a newborn child and I can only imagine the difficulties that are faced by women who have post-natal depression. We must ensure that we get things absolutely right. He also made points about parental leave. I will happily discuss those issues with him and will factor the nuanced points that he made about parental leave into the strategy and other pieces of work that I am undertaking.</p><p>Liam McArthur noted the need for almost a culture change in the way that we view parents and what we must do to ensure that we value good parenting. Along with Hugh Henry, Jamie McGrigor, Malcolm Chisholm and others, he highlighted the real work that we need to do to make sure that we get things right for looked-after children. I do not think that any of us can look at the current statistics without realising that we need to do a lot more. The Education and Culture Committee and others are undertaking good work to articulate the importance of focusing on that group of children.</p><p>Nanette Milne made a related point about looked-after children who have not had a good experience of being looked after by the corporate parent. She said that we must ensure that they are able to be good parents themselves when they have families.</p><p>Graeme Dey made an important point when he observed that our value as parents is not who we are or what we have, but what we do. Playing and cuddles do not cost anything, and we must get right some of the simple things that we do.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm noted some specific parenting strategies that are on-going throughout Scotland, including the positive parenting programme, the incredible years programme and family-nurse partnerships. He also highlighted the importance of speeding up adoption placements. I agree with that. We all know that, for that particular group of children, better outcomes can be achieved if we can get permanent placements for them earlier.</p><p>We are not starting from scratch. As we have heard, lots of really innovative and effective work is already under way throughout Scotland to support some of our most vulnerable parents. Siobhan McMahon and Neil Bibby cited some good practices in their local areas, and Neil Bibby also mentioned Save the Children&#8217;s FAST project. I have seen at first hand some great examples of different agencies working in partnership to support parents through schools and prisons, for example. Many of those projects live in the vibrant and vital third sector, to which I pay tribute for the hugely important role that it plays in supporting families throughout Scotland.</p><p>Hugh Henry wanted me to mention play specifically. We have taken forward the hugely successful play talk read campaign. I do not know whether he has had an opportunity to visit the campaign bus, but I recommend that he do so. We have also announced money through go play, and support has been provided through grounds for learning to ensure that children have much more access to play opportunities. Given that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child specifically notes a child&#8217;s right to play, a rights-based approach is a fundamental part of how we approach this agenda.</p><p>Hugh Henry also wanted me to talk about kinship carers. I gently remind him that no Administration has done more than the current one to recognise kinship carers formally. We will continue to work hard to ensure that they are supported and will continue to lobby Westminster to make sure that it recognises their specific and unique parenting role, just as the Scottish Government has recognised it.</p><p>As I said at the start of the debate, it is the Government&#8217;s ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world for children to grow up in. I am sure that that ambition is shared by everyone here today. However, it is a journey&#8212;we know that we are not there yet and we must create the type of Scotland that we want our children to grow up and flourish in.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Hugh Henry&#8217;s closing remarks were certainly quite a challenge&#8212;I do not want to disappoint him.

I will go on to explain why Labour has kind of missed the point in the debate.</p><p>The current situation is based on three and four-year-olds being entitled to 475 hours of pre-school education a year. However, as Bronwen Cohen said in an article in The Scotsman last week,</p><p>&#8220;In the early years, care and education are indivisible.&#8221;</p><p>She is right, which is why we must legislate to break down the current barriers. We need to ensure that all three and four-year-olds, as well as looked-after two-year-olds, receive flexible, high-quality early learning and childcare that meets their developmental needs and the needs of working parents. We need to move beyond the rigidity of a system that is wholly tied to schooldays and terms. Increased hours are important, but the bigger prize is the flexibility that we can achieve through primary legislation.</p><p>Parents and families tell us that they require flexibility. We need to support them if we want Scotland to thrive and grow. We are legislating not to tinker round the edges but to bring about a fundamental and positive shift that delivers for families and for the children of Scotland. As the First Minister said when he announced our intentions, that is</p><p>&#8220;a statement of faith and commitment to the future.&#8221;</p><p>Last week, Labour spoke of a need for a Scottish model of childcare, which is what we seek to develop. However, we need to do it properly and we need to get it right. Primary legislation is vital to deal with the fundamental and complex issues of flexibility. By taking forward the issue through the children&#8217;s services bill, we will provide the necessary long-term focus that the children of Scotland deserve.</p><p>To deliver the fundamental change that is needed, we must engage with the people who will deliver and use the services. We will have a full and proper discussion during the consultation process and will develop our plans accordingly. We will engage with local authorities to develop a system that offers the increased entitlement and, crucially, a system that is more flexible and better integrated across early learning and childcare. At the core of our thinking will be the role of parents and the home environment.</p><p>Our proposals to legislate are bold and exciting but, in the here and now, there is much that we are doing and will do to make progress. From April, we will deliver increased early learning and childcare provision for our most vulnerable two-year-olds and their parents and carers. This year, we will deliver community-based early learning and childcare solutions in the shape of the &#163;4.5 million communities and families fund. As I outlined in the debate last week, we will develop a series of public-social partnerships&#8212;PSPs&#8212;that will cover a range of early learning and childcare issues to meet parents&#8217; needs. Those include the issues of parents who are on low incomes and/or who are in poverty; parents and carers who work shifts; out-of-school care, including holiday clubs; parents and families living in rural areas; and outdoor or nature kindergartens.</p><p>I am also aware of the important role for employers in providing flexibility for parents. As John Park highlighted in last week&#8217;s debate, a lack of flexible working and childcare opportunities can impact on the ability of families to engage economically&#8212;the economic arguments in the debate should not be ignored. That is why, as I also announced last week, we will hold a national business summit in June to explore new ways of incentivising and encouraging more flexible working in the private sector, including the promotion of childcare vouchers. That is action that the Government is taking now to address childcare needs.</p><p>Our early years task force will play a critical role in taking forward our aspiration for transformational change in and through the early years. It brings together experts from across civic Scotland, including health professionals, police and our partners in local government. That body disregards political boundaries, and I am pleased that Malcolm Chisholm is a member of it, because the early years are far more important than party politics. The task force has agreed its vision and priorities, which were published on the Scottish Government&#8217;s website and issued to key local delivery partners last week. The paper builds on some of the priorities in the early years framework and restates our commitment to key strands of work including the parenting strategy, the play talk read campaign and the further development of family support, early learning and childcare provision.</p><p>The task force met on Tuesday to discuss increasing early learning and childcare provision and our commitment to expand that to 600 hours. The task force members were supportive of that, but they were very clear that flexibility in the delivery of additional provision is vital if we are to achieve the impacts that we seek. Julie Wild of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, who is also a member of the early years task force, said:</p><p>&#8220;We welcome the increase in hours, but we especially welcome the added flexibility that the new proposals will bring for children and their parents. Flexibility is crucial to enabling parents to have a good work/life balance and to ensuring that services can be tailored towards individual circumstances. That is what families in Scotland need.&#8221;</p><p>Those are words that all members should take notice of.</p><p>We have within our grasp the opportunity to make an enormous positive difference for families in Scotland. I hope that, despite some of the comments that have been made so far, we can work together to put the needs of the children and families of our nation to the fore as we continue to strive towards making Scotland the very best place for children to grow up in.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-02430.1, to leave out from &#8220;there is no need&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;, to provide a statutory right to more flexible early learning, primary legislation is required; welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to provide this through the Children&#8217;s Services Bill to be introduced next year, and further recognises the importance of developing early learning and childcare by working in partnership with local authorities, nursery and childcare providers to ensure that both the developmental needs of Scotland&#8217;s children and the varied needs of parents are met.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663809", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The First Minister also said in his conference speech that the system must be &#8220;flexible in its delivery&#8221;.

Key to our ambition of implementing a transformational change in Scotland&#8217;s delivery of early learning and childcare is flexibility. We want to ensure that provision can be accessed in ways that meet the needs of parents and families. We are heading on an ambitious and bold journey, and local government and other partners will have important parts to play as we work together to deliver our vision for high-quality, flexible and affordable childcare across the nation.</p><p>In addition to the offer of extended early learning and childcare provision, we will work with the early years task force and we will use its wisdom and expert knowledge to build a clear picture of current provision and to identify any gaps. I am happy to confirm that we will go further: in June 2012, we will convene a national business summit to explore new ways, including the promotion of childcare vouchers, of incentivising and encouraging more flexible working in the private sector to make it easier for parents with young children. We will develop a series of public-social partnerships, or PSPs, which will cover a range of specific childcare issues on which I believe more action is required. Those issues include parents who are on low incomes and/or in poverty; parents and carers who work shifts; out-of-school care, including holiday clubs; families who live in rural areas; and outdoor and nature kindergartens. PSPs represent a partnership approach to service development once an issue, such as childcare for shift workers, has been identified. PSPs will give all partners an opportunity to test new services and to evaluate them before tendering for delivery. The Scottish Government is promoting the PSP approach through the sector generally and we will, in the coming weeks, discuss with our local partners the best way to progress PSPs. I am sure that that approach will bring huge benefits to design and planning of local childcare provision in the specific areas that I have mentioned.</p><p>The Daycare Trust and Children in Scotland report &#8220;The Scottish Childcare Lottery&#8221; has made a significant contribution to the childcare debate. Although the report highlights that costs in Scotland are high, I emphasise that they are not the highest in the UK and that, in many cases, increases in costs in Scotland have been smaller than those south of the border. I also acknowledge the report&#8217;s raising of issues to do with the sufficiency of childcare and variation in costs across Scotland. I will ensure that those issues are investigated by our early years task force and local partners.</p><p>The Government will not rest on its laurels when it comes to taking action to improve the lives of Scotland&#8217;s children and families, and we are setting out the steps and actions that we need to take to improve early learning and childcare provision in Scotland in order that we match the best in Europe. High-quality early learning and childcare are vital for parents and children. For parents, they can provide a route out of worklessness and an opportunity for increased access to rewarding careers, and there is a wealth of evidence relating to babies and young children, perhaps most notably the effective provision of pre-school education&#8212;or EPPE&#8212;study to tell us about the benefits of high-quality early learning experiences. That is why the Government is committed to increasing the range of flexible and affordable high-quality early learning and childcare provision.</p><p>We have already announced an additional &#163;4.5&#160;million to provide early learning and childcare for all looked-after two-year-olds in Scotland, and a further &#163;4.5&#160;million to promote community-based solutions to family support and childcare from April this year.</p><p>I have outlined the range of work that we are undertaking to develop flexible and affordable childcare provision, but there are limits to what we can achieve to support parents with the costs of childcare while most of the levers for doing so remain reserved. We should contrast the Scottish Government&#8217;s actions and aspiration for a Scotland that is the best place to grow up in with the regressive welfare reforms by the coalition in London. I have huge concerns about the impacts that those reforms will have on our children and families.</p><p>We think that it is right that people should be supported into work, but the coalition&#8217;s welfare reform agenda is leading to a number of arbitrary budget cuts that will have damaging impacts on individuals and families in Scotland. As Malcolm Chisholm mentioned, the UK coalition Government reduced the cap for the childcare element of the working tax credit from 80 to 70 per cent in April last year. &#8220;The Scottish Childcare Lottery&#8221; report cites Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs data that estimate that that represents an average cut of &#163;531 per year for families in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are committed to making improvements to the life chances of children across Scotland and to introducing potential legislation next year.

There will also be changes to child tax credit from April this year: the income threshold will be lower for most people. The changes mean that 84,900 families with children in Scotland will no longer be eligible for child tax credit. That will affect 118,700 children across Scotland. We are taking action to benefit 120,000 children across Scotland, but the Tory Government, supported by its Lib Dem coalition partners, is introducing cuts that will impact negatively on 120,000 children across Scotland.</p><p>Ordinarily, I would welcome the fact that the Lib Dems&#8217; motion suggests that they are concerned about childcare, but unfortunately I cannot forget their failure to stand up for children and families in Scotland.

That message has been shared by everyone who has contributed to this constructive debate.</p><p>The Scottish Government takes very seriously all areas of trafficking, including child trafficking. As Minister for Children and Young People, I am committed to improving the life chances of all children and young people in Scotland: there is no more important role for us than keeping all children safe and well. Along with colleagues, I will do all that I can to create a society that leaves no one, especially the most vulnerable people, behind&#8212;a place where every child, regardless of how they got here, gets the best start in life. Sadly, a number of children are trafficked for the purposes of exploitation or abuse, so I will set out some of the issues that affect children.</p><p>Our work on child trafficking is grounded in our commitment to working together with partners at local and UK levels. I welcome any work that helps to highlight and to reduce the risks to our children. Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People helped to publicise the hidden crime of child trafficking through last year&#8217;s report on it, which highlighted the complex issues that are connected to child trafficking, from the various modes of trafficking to the heightened vulnerabilities of the child victims&#8212;which Mary Fee raised and in which I know she takes a great interest. The report contains recommendations that are aimed at helping all the relevant partners to identify and support children who have been trafficked. I urge all those who are involved to act on the report&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>Christina McKelvie noted that although immigration processes are reserved, we are responsible for the welfare of children in Scotland, and this Government is committed to ensuring that when trafficked children are uncovered, they are supported appropriately. John Finnie and Rod Campbell spoke about the number of children who are involved. We are working closely with the police and other agencies to combat the trafficking of children, and we will continue to do so.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to child trafficking is set in the context of our wider approach to child protection. We have embedded child trafficking firmly in our national guidance on child protection. The guidance contains a dedicated section on the subject that makes it clear that when child trafficking is suspected, it is essential that timely and decisive action be taken. The guidance also sets a national framework to help to shape local practices and procedures, which many members have called for. It aims to improve the way in which all professionals and organisations work together to give all children the protection that they need quickly, effectively and at the earliest possible stage.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662015", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with the points that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice made in opening the debate.

The toolkit is being piloted and will be published in spring 2012. In addition, my officials are working with the west of Scotland child protection sub-group on child trafficking to explore how the tools that the London Safeguarding Children Board has developed can best help local authorities in Scotland. I hope that that provides further reassurance to Lewis Macdonald.</p><p>Following the recommendations in the commissioner&#8217;s report, the Scottish Government will explore local protocols for child trafficking with the Scottish child protection committee chairs forum at its next meeting in March. I believe that it would be beneficial to encourage awareness raising among children of the dangers of child trafficking, as the commissioner has mentioned. My officials intend to work with key stakeholders over the course of 2012 to explore how that can be achieved. Many members have called for such awareness raising work to be done.</p><p>I highlight the promising results from the first annual evaluation of the Scottish guardianship project, which is provided by Aberlour and the Scottish Refugee Council, and is supported by funding from the Scottish Government. It is a pioneering project that has the aim of helping unaccompanied asylum-seeking and trafficked children to navigate their way through the complex welfare and immigration processes. Since it was set up in the autumn of 2010, it has helped to match more than 60 unaccompanied children with guardians. It is the first service of its kind in the UK, and it demonstrates the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that all children in Scotland get the help that they need when they need it.</p><p>I turn to some of the points that were raised in the debate. Malcolm Chisholm, John Finnie, Gil Paterson and Margaret McDougall reminded us that trafficking is not a Glasgow-only problem.

They are the responsibility of us all. I look forward to closing the kinship care conference in Perth on Monday.</p><p>The Scottish Government moved quickly in 2007 to publish our strategy, &#8220;Getting it right for every child in kinship and foster care&#8221;. In 2009 we introduced legislation that recognised kinship care and kinship carers for the first time, offering the chance of a safe, stable, nurturing home with the wider family. The introduction of permanence orders under the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 enhanced the chance of a child finding a permanent home with the wider family.</p><p>We should acknowledge that kinship carers are unique. They do what they do for love, not money. We recognise their incredible efforts and remain committed to doing all that we can do for them and for their children, and we understand the financial challenges that they experience. By working with our partners in local government we have made progress, and all local authorities are financially supporting kinship carers. We have also worked with the third sector on the provision of support and guidance for kinship carers.</p><p>The Government has made progress, but despite positive changes, in discussion with councils and the United Kingdom Government, we have not yet achieved enough. Despite our Government&#8217;s formal recognition of kinship carers, our efforts have been constrained by a UK benefits system that does not recognise kinship carers&#8217; parenting role and even claws back existing benefits when allowances are received.</p><p>The Scottish Government secured changes in 2010 to mitigate that effect. Kinship carers can now be confident of receiving housing benefit and council tax benefit without any deduction. Allowances are now tax free, and some kinship carers are up to &#163;50 a week better off. However, those are sticking plasters compared with giving kinship carers access to all benefits that are available to parents, such as child benefit and child tax credit.</p><p>Since 2007, the number of children in kinship care has grown more than expected. That is a concern for local authorities throughout Scotland. However, we know that kinship care is an effective care placement that offers scope for councils to provide a safe, supportive and nurturing environment for children and young people. To get the best from kinship care, we need to continue to invest.</p><p>Family support is fundamentally about supporting children and their parents, which is why we are developing a national parenting strategy. The strategy will be for not only mums and dads but grandparents and the wider family, as well as foster, kinship and adoptive parents. In other words, it will be for anyone who is involved in bringing up children. It will cover parenting of children of all ages, from the pre-conception stage, through early childhood, school years and adolescence to adulthood.</p><p>At the heart of our strategy will be recognition that all parents might need support from time to time, which will vary according to their circumstances. Our highly successful play, talk, read campaign is an example of action that we are taking to provide advice and support for all parents. The campaign&#8217;s aim is to promote the importance of positive interaction between young children and their parents or carers, from the very start.</p><p>Some parents will require more intensive support. It is vital that they receive such support, so that we can avoid negative cycles in which poor outcomes are perpetuated across generations. For young first-time parents who are particularly vulnerable, we have piloted the family-nurse partnership, which is a preventative, intensive home-visiting programme that is delivered by highly trained nurses.</p><p>The programme, which is being delivered exclusively to teenage first-time mothers, begins at the early pregnancy stage and lasts until the child reaches two. It takes a holistic approach to the family, focusing on different aspects at different points, based on the age and stage of the mother and the baby. The programme is based on a deep, therapeutic relationship between the mother and the nurse, leading to long-term positive outcomes for the family.</p><p>The Scottish Government has also shown its commitment to moving towards an early intervention approach through the creation of the early years task force, which comprises key children&#8217;s champions across Scotland. That important group will identify how best to drive further forward our key priorities on parenting, family support, play and early learning and childcare. We have announced funding to support care provision for looked after two-year-olds.</p><p>I take very seriously the concerns that kinship carers have raised.

I congratulate the convener and committee on their work so far and look forward to hearing their views in this important debate. I also welcome the new Labour education team, whom I met for the first time at yesterday&#8217;s committee meeting.</p><p>As Minister for Children and Young People and as a corporate parent, I take the educational attainment of looked-after children very seriously. It is vital that we do all that we can to raise attainment and give these children the best possible start in life. This Government&#8217;s ambition for our looked-after children is no different from our ambition for all children in Scotland&#8212;and is absolutely no different from my ambitions for my own son. We want children to be safe, healthy and loved, to enjoy their childhood, to achieve their full potential and to grow into responsible adults who are capable of making positive contributions to our society.</p><p>We know that the educational attainment of our looked-after children and young people remains persistently poor. As the latest statistics show, looked-after children are absent or excluded from school more often and leave school earlier with fewer qualifications than those who are not looked after. They are also less likely to go on to education or employment after school. They are among Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable children, and the reasons why they do not reach their full potential are various, complex and interrelated. I have no doubt that the committee will have heard about some of the reasons during its inquiry.</p><p>Given that&#8212;as Stewart Maxwell noted&#8212;looked-after children and young people face additional barriers in accessing education, they require additional support from all who are involved in their care. Indeed, this Government and the previous Executive have worked to provide that support.</p><p>We will continue to ensure that the needs of looked-after children, young people and care leavers are embedded in wider work to improve outcomes, including getting it right for every child, curriculum for excellence, additional support for learning and the more choice, more chances strategy. We have strengthened the additional support for learning legislation; all looked-after children and young people are now automatically deemed to be in need of additional support at school unless the local authority determines specifically that they are not. Therefore, educational authorities and schools have a duty to assess each looked-after child or young person and to plan for and provide any additional support that they might need. We will continue to monitor how that legislation is being implemented.</p><p>The ministerial report, &#8220;Looked After Children and Young People: We Can and Must Do Better&#8221;, which was published in January 2007, set out an action plan to improve the life outcomes of looked-after children and young people and recognised that education cannot be seen in isolation. That report and the accompanying training materials will now be updated in line with current legislation and with the getting it right for every child and young person policy.</p><p>The role of designated manager for looked-after children and young people in schools was established following the publication in 2001 of the report, &#8220;Learning with Care: The Education of Children Looked After Away from Home by Local Authorities&#8221;. There being designated managers in educational establishments and the development of a reciprocal role in residential care establishments are central to the improvement of educational outcomes. Our looked-after children and young people need someone in their school and in their home setting who understands their issues and supports their educational attainment. In September 2008, we published &#8220;Core tasks for Designated Managers in Educational and Residential Establishments in Scotland&#8221;, which clarifies the role and responsibilities of the people who undertake that important role. We will continue to monitor that work and are committed to strengthening the role of designated manager so that looked-after children get the support that they need.</p><p>To be able to learn, children need safe, stable, nurturing and permanent homes. That is why this Government is focusing on ensuring that looked-after children experience as few placements as possible. Our ambition is that children experience only one placement so that a child&#8217;s first placement is their only placement, from which they will return home or go on to permanence. Timescales for reaching decisions about permanence and adoption should be reduced.</p><p>This Government believes that, by properly embedding corporate parenting principles, we will be able to meet the needs and aspirations of each looked-after child. We have seen the role of corporate parent evolve and improve over the years, but more needs to be done. We are working in partnership with Who Cares? Scotland to deliver a national training programme so that those who care for looked-after children and young people are the best-possible substitute parents. We will build on the success of that programme by continuing to work with the corporate family to ensure that our looked-after children receive the support that they deserve.</p><p>In addition, children cannot be successful learners if their health needs are not identified and met. Local health services must take on a much more engaged role as corporate parents and provide health assessments within four weeks of a child&#8217;s coming into care, and must share information with councils and make access to services easier. We are totally committed to a partnership approach. Along with Stewart Maxwell and the rest of the committee, I want to see professional boundaries being overcome and everyone working together to drive forward improvements.</p><p>We know that, during the first three years of life, children&#8217;s brains complete 75 per cent of their growth and that, by the age of three, they have learned 50 per cent of their language skills. We know that what happens, or fails to happen, in the early years has a significant impact on an individual&#8217;s capacity for learning and attainment. We have a particular focus on the early years; we are committed to increasing the quality of early learning and childcare opportunities as part of our wider drive to improve the future life chances of all Scotland&#8217;s children by giving them the best start in life. That is why I recently announced that we will fund additional early learning and childcare and work with parents for all looked-after two-year-olds. Over the next three years, we will make available &#163;1.5&#160;million a year to local authorities for their role as corporate parents.</p><p>It has been shown that children whose parents or carers talk and read to them and play with them have better language skills. Our play, talk, read campaigns encourage mums, dads, grandparents and carers to find simple fun ways to help their children&#8217;s brains to develop, and to give them the best chances in later life. We are also focusing on even earlier interventions so that children who are at risk of coming into care are provided with support in their family environment in order to allow them to go on to lead positive lives without coming into care.</p><p>Support for parents is key to improving outcomes for looked-after children and young people. We want parents to be positively and proactively involved in their children&#8217;s development. Parenting&#8212;in whatever shape or form&#8212;is the most important job that anyone can take on, and we all know that it comes with many challenges. That is why we are committed to developing a national parenting strategy. I want to highlight the importance and value of parenting in the context of the life chances of our children and young people, and I want the strategy to help to ensure that parents and families get the help that they need, when they need it.</p><p>The educational attainment of children who are looked after at home is particularly poor. The Scottish Government recognises the need to provide better support for that cohort of looked-after children, which the committee identified, and for their parents.</p><p>We also acknowledge that leaver destinations for looked-after young people and care leavers are significantly poorer than those of their peers, so we are prioritising support for that group to access learning and jobs.</p><p>We continue to improve throughcare and aftercare services for young people in the care system, so that they can effectively access learning and jobs.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to take part in today&#8217;s debate.

As I outlined in opening the debate, it is the responsibility of us all, as corporate parents, to work together to support our looked-after children, young people and care leavers to become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. I am greatly encouraged by the cross-party support for tackling this issue, and by hearing the examples of good practice from across the country. We would all agree that more needs to be done. In the words of the 2001 report,</p><p>&#8220;we can and must do better&#8221;.</p><p>A number of points have been raised during the debate and I would like to take time to address some of them. Mary Scanlon noted the need to work in partnership&#8212;whether between the health authorities and the council, or within the council and across professions. Indeed, many members&#8212;Liam McArthur, Dennis Robertson and Claudia Beamish&#8212;have spoken about the need for working in partnership, and I absolutely agree. In my role as Minister for Children and Young People&#8212;and, indeed across the Government&#8212;collaborative working, and the need to disrespect boundaries and place the child at the centre of all that we do, are fundamental to driving forward improvements. That is why we launched the corporate parenting national training programme. Change will also be driven by the new inspection regime that is being developed by the care inspectorate and which is based around children&#8217;s experiences.</p><p>Many members have spoken about the need to ca canny with additional strategies, and the Government is taking action, working with the looked-after children strategic implementation group and with CELCIS.</p><p>I welcome the comments from Joan McAlpine, Christine Grahame and others who linked the issue of looked-after children and young people with the issue of offending. In the previous session of Parliament, my work on what the children&#8217;s commissioner termed the innocent victims of crime&#8212;meaning, the children of prisoners&#8212;has given me a huge interest in the subject. We need to break the cycle of being in care and then offending. That is why the Government is committed to intervening in the earliest years and to providing safe, stable, permanent and nurturing homes.</p><p>Christine Grahame asked whether CELCIS would work with academics and others to prevent young people in care from offending. The answer is yes&#8212;work is going on just now. I hope that that provides Christine Grahame with some assurance.</p><p>Jean Urquhart urged that we should listen to professionals. I assure her that that happens through CELCIS, LACSIG and others, as we try to drive forward good policy.</p><p>Anne McTaggart, Claudia Beamish and Alison Johnstone shared their valuable professional experience, adding a great deal to the debate. Anne McTaggart made a passionate case for ensuring that looked-after children and young people are not forgotten in welfare reforms. The point was well made.</p><p>Adam Ingram spoke about the importance of parenting and of the need to close the gap in attainment between looked-after young people and other young people. Correctly, he noted the need to act early, before permanent damage is done. He noted the need for speed in decisions on permanence. The Scottish Government is committed to improving the care journey for children, and to creating a national parenting strategy. I thank Adam Ingram very much for his points.</p><p>Hanzala Malik made specific points about the need to support Punjabi-speaking families and service users, and about issues surrounding Punjabi language and the SQA. My colleague Alasdair Allan has said that he will speak to the member to see what can be done.</p><p>Neil Bibby, Neil Findlay, Hanzala Malik and others made good points about the excellent work of behavioural support staff. The 2011 figures that I have show a slight increase and I commend the local authorities that are doing everything to support the important work that behavioural support staff do.</p><p>Kevin Stewart, Mark McDonald and Neil Bibby spoke about innovative practice and positive stories that surround the issue, and highlighted the good work that is being done in their local areas. We need to hear such news, and the committee will appreciate the opportunity that the debate has given it to add it into its report. When we hear positive stories, we should learn from them and ensure that good outcomes are passed on and that we learn from best practice.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In my new role as Minister for Children and Young People, I have been pleased to hear members&#8217; views in this important debate.

As Mr Swinney set out at the start of the debate, we recognise and are taking action on the importance of public sector reform. We are not shying away from the many challenges with which we are presented and which are made even more challenging by the financial constraints that have been placed on us by the UK Government, one half of which&#8212;the Lib Dems&#8212;was not here today to participate in this important debate, the subject of which is affecting many people across Scotland. The UK Government appears to be incapable of considering the economic damage that its policies are causing, or of changing its course.</p><p>We believe that such challenges are best faced in partnership and collaboration wherever possible&#8212;a point that Chic Brodie made. The best way to get the best results is by engaging and showing respect, not by diktat. On partnership working, we agree with what Richard Baker and Hugh Henry said in their opening remarks. Another area where we find agreement with Richard Baker is in his welcoming of the Scottish Government not doing to local government what the UK Government has done to us regarding local government pensions. That is welcome&#8212;it is better late than never, given the comments that his colleague Paul Martin made yesterday.</p><p>What we need&#8212;rather than a piecemeal approach&#8212;is a measured and coherent approach to public sector pension reform. That is the best approach for achieving potential once-in-a-generation changes.</p><p>Let me be clear: the Scottish Government is committed to public sector pensions that are affordable, sustainable and fair to public sector workers and taxpayers alike. We recognise that a case has been made for longer-term reform and we will consider that once we have greater clarity on the UK Government&#8217;s proposed reforms and their impact on Scotland. However, we will do that to a timetable that suits Scotland&#8217;s interests rather than those of the UK Government.</p><p>We think that it is wrong to increase public sector workers&#8217; contributions to their pension schemes at this time and in this way. It is a naked cash grab that is geared towards reducing the UK deficit and will do nothing to address the sustainability or fairness of pensions over the longer term. We have made abundantly clear our principled opposition to the UK Government policy of increasing employee contributions at a time when public sector workers face pay freezes, significant increases in national insurance contributions, higher VAT and rising inflation and fuel costs.</p><p>In response, the Scottish Government is taking a number of positive steps to address the challenges: the living wage, no compulsory redundancies, the council tax freeze and the abolition of prescription charges are all policies to protect families and provide security at a time of uncertainty.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655002", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank colleagues for a lively debate on an important issue and I extend my welcome to Mary Scanlon in her new role.

Danny Alexander&#8217;s letter of 5 September confirmed that if the Scottish Government does not implement the increase in pension contributions, he will cut the Scottish budget by more than &#163;100&#160;million in 2012-13 alone, which is not a sustainable position. That would have a knock-on effect on Scottish public services, thereby making the necessary reforms much harder to achieve. Therefore, and regretfully, unless the UK Government can be made to think again we will implement the increases in pension scheme contributions for 2012-13 for the NHS, teachers, police and firefighters schemes.</p><p>Despite the announcement by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury of an improved pension reform offer on 2 November, we are concerned that the UK Government is taking a piecemeal approach to this significant issue. Not only has it introduced short-term contribution increases in a way that has contaminated discussions about longer-term reforms, but it also appears to be realising its policy proposals bit by bit. That is either a deliberate way of stifling debate, or it is evidence that the UK Government&#8217;s proposals are simply being made on the hoof. Indeed, if we look at the various twists and turns in the UK Government&#8217;s short-term proposals, it is possible to see a pattern that begins with a set of principles that are subsequently abandoned in favour of the bottom line.</p><p>In a very impressive speech, Marco Biagi noted that the approach that is being taken by the UK Government&#8212;its lack of meaningful engagement with others in terms of using the opportunity to look at pensions in the round&#8212;represents an opportunity lost.</p><p>Rod Campbell helpfully pointed out the gender concerns with regard to the pensions issue.

I, too, met Mr and Mrs Hansen yesterday, who spoke movingly about the tragic loss of their daughter as a result of carbon monoxide and highlighted their campaign, which has been so successful in New York. They have brought their ideas to Scotland and I believe that today they are taking them to the National Assembly for Wales.</p><p>For most home owners, a house is a home rather than an asset. That said, it is usually their most important asset. Planned maintenance is the best way to avoid major repairs, and owners must be able to find reputable traders. That is why the nail the rogues campaign is to be thoroughly commended. There are many reputable traders in Scotland and there is support to help people to find them, too. The Scottish Government encourages owners to use traders who are members of trade associations. Services such as the Federation of Master Builders&#8217; find a builder service, the construction licensing executive&#8217;s reference service, the buy with confidence scheme that is currently being introduced in South Lanarkshire, which I am sure James Kelly will be aware of, and other local authority trusted trader schemes are to be commended for helping home owners to find reputable traders. James Kelly and Graeme Pearson mentioned the police in that regard as well.</p><p>Low bids might tempt some home owners to use rogue traders, but the lesson from tonight&#8217;s debate is that they should be warned that an offer that sounds too good to be true probably is. Again, advice is available from local authority private sector housing teams and trading standards officers.</p><p>Along with the Federation of Master Builders, the Scottish Government has called on the UK Government to reduce the rate of VAT from 20 to 5 per cent on home repair and maintenance works. We believe that that would not only stimulate the economy by providing an incentive for home owners to carry out essential repair works, but be a useful tool in tackling the prevalence of rogue traders by helping to make reputable firms more competitive in the repair and maintenance sector. Many members have spoken about the importance of that.</p><p>The Scottish Government is prioritising support for small businesses. Many in the construction sector form that cohort of important businesses and are benefiting from the support that the Scottish Government is giving. In addition to continuing with the small business bonus scheme, we are taking forward a range of policies to help small and medium-sized enterprises to grow and, through Skills Development Scotland, make it easier for SMEs to hire staff and take on apprentices&#8212;Graeme Pearson made the point that one of the benefits of having good traders is that they bring with them apprenticeship opportunities and contribute to the wider economy in that way. We should not lose sight of that.</p><p>The role of trading standards in local authorities is crucial in helping to protect citizens and ensuring a fair market in which business can flourish. I thank trading standards officers for their important contribution to combating rogue traders in a range of sectors. Fiona McLeod mentioned specifically the East Dunbartonshire trading standards officers and their innovative approach to highlighting their work.</p><p>As Bob Doris mentioned, we should recognise that consumer matters and trading standards are reserved and that the UK Government is planning to change the delivery landscape.</p><p>I particularly welcome Dave Thompson&#8217;s points about the challenges facing trading standards, which have arisen as a result of the UK&#8217;s work in this area. He is particularly well placed to offer an expert perspective on the matter. I welcome his views on what we might do to make trading standards services much more effective if the relevant powers were devolved to this Parliament. The UK Government has published plans to restructure the consumer landscape, and the Scottish Government is keen to negotiate a transfer of powers and funding&#8212;the two are inextricably linked. For now, however, we await a response from the UK Government. If that is positive, we will work with all stakeholders and examine all the options to devise an efficient and effective structural model that delivers for Scotland&#8217;s consumers and for Scotland as a whole.</p><p>In terms of devolved powers, we should acknowledge how the Scottish building standards system protects the public interest. Home maintenance can include repairs but can also entail significant alterations and building work. A home owner must ensure that work that is done to their house meets building regulations and that, when required, a building warrant is granted. Competent people, such as approved certifiers of design or construction, provide the owner with assurance that work is done properly.</p><p>Cutting the cost of doing work might cause structural defects and increase the risk of fire and electric shocks. It can also lead to poor air quality, creating an unhealthy living environment. The Scottish building standards system sets minimum standards for building work and local authority verifiers check that building designs are compliant and are inspected during construction and on completion. However, the home owner must still ensure that the work is being properly done.</p><p>With regard to the protection of the most vulnerable members of our community, particularly the elderly, Bob Doris, James Kelly and Ruth Davidson mentioned the need to get references and mentioned that the most vulnerable suffer at the hands of hard-nosed salespeople as well as the rogue traders whom we have been discussing.</p><p>The Government is keen to do all that it can to support legitimate businesses in the construction sector. That is why ministers continue to engage with this core sector of the economy. I recently heard from local businesses in Inverness when I attended the north of Scotland construction summit and, last week, I met the Chartered Institute of Building to discuss a broad range of issues, many of which have been mirrored in the debate.</p><p>In these challenging economic times, the ideal would be for legitimate businesses to secure these contracts and prosper, because that is what is good for the economy as a whole and such businesses will provide families and householders with the quality building services that they need.</p><p>The debate will continue to raise awareness of the dangers of using rogue traders and of the efforts being undertaken to drive those people out of business. I again congratulate James Kelly on securing the debate and thank members for all the other very positive contributions that have been made. I am pleased that consensus has broken out across the chamber at the end of the parliamentary week.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:50.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654189", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rogue Traders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like everyone else, I congratulate James Kelly on securing the debate.

I apologise in advance for needing to nip out to a prior meeting after making my speech.</p><p>The Parliament referred the bill to the committee not long before I moved to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, which meant that, unfortunately, I was unable to take part in any of the deliberations on the bill as introduced. Certainly, taking best care of Scotland's diverse and hugely important historical environment was never far from the committee's cultural considerations. I welcome the opportunity the chamber has today to move the bill forward.</p><p>It is literally a year and a day since the Scottish Government hosted Scotland's first ever summit for the historic and built environment. I am sure that the summit helped to inform some of the process that has resulted in the bill that is before us today. We know that the roots of the bill can be found in the discussion paper that the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland produced on the need for a review of existing legislation, which arose from wider discussion on the three main acts that the Government is seeking to build on with the bill. We might call that process the bill's legislative heritage.</p><p>By taking steps to harmonise some of the processes that are involved in protecting scheduled monuments and listed buildings, the bill will help to simplify the bureaucracy for developers, planning authorities and, perhaps most important, the voluntary preservation and historical societies that have an interest in protecting their local heritage. Many voluntary groups in the South of Scotland and, no doubt, across the whole of the country&#8212;we have heard about some of them today&#8212;want to take more action to preserve and protect much-loved local buildings. However, they often find that they lack the capacity or resources to do so, particularly when they are up against corporate developers or a determined local authority.</p><p>I have spoken in the chamber previously about the High mill in Clydesdale. It is a B-listed structure, which Historic Scotland defines as being</p><p class=\"indent\">\"of regional or more than local importance, or a major example of some particular period, style or building type which may have been altered.\"</p><p>In its listing of the building, Historic Scotland states that it was built in 1797 and remains the most complete surviving windmill in Scotland. Sadly, it also remains at risk of collapse, despite a <place-holder colnum=\"30086\"/> concerted campaign by the Clydesdale mills society.</p><p>In recent months, South Lanarkshire Council has undertaken a desk exercise to review options for the mill. The council continues to encounter difficulties in enforcing a compulsory works notice. I am sure that the Clydesdale mills society and others will be interested to learn more about the powers in the bill to allow the Scottish Government to offer further grants for work to be undertaken on an ancient monument even when the owner has not requested such action. The increased scope for awarding grants to a wider range of initiatives that promote understanding of our historic, cultural, architectural, artistic or archaeological heritage is very welcome.</p><p>The bill contains provisions to strengthen statutory protection and lower the bar for criminal responsibility in terms of the offence of disturbing a scheduled monument. Historic Scotland lists more than 8,000 scheduled monuments in its register, ranging from mottes and baileys, such as those found on Carnwath golf course and north of Abington, to industrial sites, such as New Lanark and the Wilsontown ironworks. Many of those locations are remote or isolated, and it is difficult to supervise them continually. It is therefore welcome that the bill will make it easier to prosecute anyone who mistreats such sites.</p><p>Historic Scotland also holds scheduled properties in care for the Scottish ministers&#8212;for example, the Whithorn priory and museum, St Ninian's chapel and St Ninian's cave, all of which are in the South of Scotland region. I am sure that interest in the two St Ninian sites will have increased following the recent visit to Scotland of Pope Benedict and the celebration of St Ninian's day on 16 September. Protecting our historic sites effectively means that, when new opportunities arise to appreciate them or to view their significance from a different perspective, we can do so with confidence. As other members have said, doing so also promotes tourism.</p><p>The bill will clarify and extend the grounds on which an area can be designated to include</p><p class=\"indent\">\"any site that comprises any thing, or group of things, that evidence previous human activity\".</p><p>That means that areas where there may not have been any clearly defined structure can still be protected, such as a site where scattered flint tools have been found. Members may recall that one such site that may benefit from the provisions of the bill is outside of Elsrickle, near Biggar, where the Biggar archaeology group discovered the remains of the oldest human settlement ever discovered in Scotland, which the group excavated with the co-operation of the landowner. The discovery, which was made during the year of <place-holder colnum=\"30087\"/> homecoming, was a tremendous achievement for the organisation, which is a voluntary group. Members may recall the recent display of the group's work that I sponsored in the Parliament.</p><p>I was interested to hear Karen Whitefield's comments about concerns that have been raised about that aspect of the bill. Although as a history graduate I am interested in finding out about our past and celebrating our history, I recognise that there are sometimes conflicts when we do so. For example, the archaeological and historical studies at the site of Crawfordjohn primary school have resulted in a delay in information getting to the parents about the future of the school, as the children have been decanted to another local school with no timescale given for the completion of the studies. That uncertainty is worrying for parents, and I hope that a decision on that can be sped up.</p><p>However, improving opportunities for designation may also help groups such as Lanark community council, which is currently urgently seeking protection for the old Lanark grammar school building on Albany Drive in the town. Many local residents would wish that historic building to be retained&#8212;perhaps adapted for modern use, such as flats, but keeping the building's fa&#231;ade, which many know and love. Sadly, it appears that South Lanarkshire Council is minded to allow the building to be demolished, and the community council is urgently seeking advice from Historic Scotland on what options for designation may exist. I have written to Historic Scotland to add my support to those efforts.</p><p>The bill will clarify and strengthen the protection of Scotland's historic environment. One of the successes of devolution in the past 11 years has been the opportunity to explore policy areas such as our heritage, refine them, allow far greater democratic scrutiny of them, put them at the forefront of our thoughts and rectify past decisions that relegated our history and culture to an afterthought.</p><p>I wish the committee all the best for the progression of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21055678", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my former colleagues on the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee for the work that they have undertaken thus far on the bill.

However, clearly that is not evident in the approach of the Liberal Democrats, who continue to attempt to whip up unnecessary fear and confusion among small businesses in Scotland. They appear not to have learned from our previous debates on the issue. The fact is that the majority of businesses&#8212;nearly 60 per cent&#8212;have seen their rates fall or remain the same following revaluation.</p><p>Transitional relief schemes are not free. The cost must be met from somewhere, and in the scheme that the Lib Dems propose, the businesses that would gain the most from the revaluation would be forced to give up those gains to offset the rises elsewhere. In effect, the Lib Dems' scheme would lead to small and medium-sized businesses throughout Scotland subsidising public sector rate payers and larger businesses. Alternatively, the costs could be met from the Scottish Government's budget, but they could be some &#163;195 million this year alone. I do not see any mention in the Liberal Democrats' motion of how they would fund their proposal. Do they want the smallest businesses, which have benefited from the revaluation, to lose out, or do they propose further cuts to public spending from elsewhere in the devolved budget?</p><p>Support for business does not simply have to come in the shape of rates relief, and the Scottish Government has taken many other practical steps since 2007 to provide assistance to our small business sector.

It is perhaps not the most meaty debate on the Calman commission, given that it is about the procedures and technicalities for operating recommendations but, as other members have noted, it is important.</p><p>It was important that the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee had the chance to scrutinise the commission's recommendations. That said, it is clear from the committee's report that the time that the committee was given to scrutinise the proposals was curtailed. I say with a brief nod to Macmillan's \"Events, dear boy, events\" that the election of the new coalition Government in May, complete with a renewed effort to implement the Calman commission's proposals, meant that the committee had to truncate its original timescale for consideration and reflection before producing the report that we are discussing. That was unfortunate, because it means that the committee's recommendations might not be as full as many of us had hoped. It also means that much work will still have to be done when the proposed bill is introduced this autumn.<place-holder colnum=\"29040\"/></p><p>The task has been a challenge. I put on record my thanks to the clerks and the committee support team, who have done a wonderful job in pulling together our thoughts, which were often varied and contradictory. They have taken on board our worries and concerns and produced a useful document that will help with implementing the Calman commission's processes and procedures.</p><p>It is fair to say that the thoughts on Calman were wide and varied. It will come as no surprise to my non-SNP colleagues on the committee that we in the SNP want the full restoration of powers to the Parliament and that we want Scotland to be independent. That is not what other parties want to happen. Despite the deep ideological differences that we all have, the process of working together on the committee, having the chance to air our thoughts together and seeking consensus was not too painful&#8212;in fact, it was even enjoyable sometimes.</p><p>The committee had to set strict parameters for itself and not stray into the Calman commission's more controversial policy proposals. As other members have said, the committee considered relations between parliamentary committees, relations between the Parliament and MEPs, legislative consent motions, intergovernmental and interparliamentary relations, a procedural review of the Scotland Act 1998 and members' interests. Fiscal powers, firearms, airguns and borrowing powers were not discussed&#8212;if those items had been included, the debate would have been much less congenial.</p><p>The tenor of the committee's response is about how greater understanding and co-operation can be better facilitated and better approached. After personal reflection, I think that Calman's report perhaps sees some problems where none exists and does not give due recognition to good practice that goes on between Parliaments, parliamentarians and Governments.</p><p>For example, Calman's recommendation 4.10 was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Either the Scottish Parliament or either House of the UK Parliament should be able, when it has considered an issue where its responsibilities interact with the other Parliament's, to pass a motion seeking a response from the UK or Scottish Government\",</p><p>because the commission considered that a formal mechanism should be available for occasions when the Scottish Parliament wished to convey views to the UK Government, or the UK Parliament wished to convey views to the Scottish Government. The commission's report said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We would not envisage this mechanism being subject to frequent use, and an appropriate threshold to activate it would need to be developed.\"<place-holder colnum=\"29041\"/></p><p>Our committee and the Scottish Government did not support that recommendation, as is right. No Government should have to justify itself to a Parliament to which it is not accountable. I do not believe that that happens in any other jurisdiction. The proposal fails to note the ways and means for obtaining input from other Parliaments without putting in place formal structures. It also fails to note that a simple letter from an MSP is one way to convey an opinion to the UK Parliament or UK Government and that such letters are sent and have been sent since Scotland's Parliament was reconvened.</p><p>Another recommendation in that vein is recommendation 4.8, which suggested that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Secretary of State for Scotland ... should be invited to appear before the Scottish Parliament to discuss the legislative programme\".</p><p>Again, our committee felt that a formal procedure was not necessary and, likewise, the Government felt that a formal process such as that would blur boundaries and had the potential to cause confusion.</p><p>Recommendation 4.8 seems to stem from a lack of awareness of current good practice. As in many other walks of life, the positive attributes are overlooked and the negatives concentrated on. That said, if things can be improved I am sure that no one will want to do anything other than welcome proposals and engage meaningfully in discussion, debate and co-operation, if that is in the interests of the people who we were all elected to serve. I hope that there will be no unintended consequences of trying to foster, almost artificially, greater dialogue than that which exists already and goes on quietly for the greater good.</p><p>The debate on Scotland's constitutional future is a healthy one to have and I hope that many people will participate in it. If the Scottish Parliament is to get more powers, we will undoubtedly have to examine the ways in which it can cope with those powers. We will need to ensure that the Parliament continues to function efficiently. I make no apology for stating that my preferred option is for all powers to be returned to our Parliament. Given the frank and adult discussion of the issues that we are having, I hope that that position is at least respected and listened to, just as I respect others and their opinions. We do not need to agree, but we should be able, in our democracy, to ensure that all voices and opinions are heard.</p><p>Falling short of outright independence, MSPs on the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee have a duty to ensure that we flag up any concerns and potential pitfalls that may arise when changes are made to our Parliament. It is therefore a little disappointing that the committee's time in looking at the proposals <place-holder colnum=\"29042\"/> was shortened and that fuller and franker debate and discussion was not allowed to flourish.</p><p>I record my thanks to the clerks, convener and deputy convener for their work in producing the report.

They will be familiar to the chamber, because I also quoted them during the stage 1 debate on the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, stage 3 of which we have just completed. The words form part of the landmark ruling in S v M in 2007, in which the Constitutional Court of South Africa set out the importance of taking into account the effect of any sentence that is passed on an offender on any children of that offender. In the S v M case, the court decided to pass a non-custodial sentence on the offender, a woman convicted of fraud, because of the negative effect that a custodial sentence would have had on her four children.</p><p>The report that is the subject of my motion, \"Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison\", lays out in detail the experience and effects of parental imprisonment on a child. Scotland's present Commissioner for <place-holder colnum=\"28021\"/> Children and Young People commissioned the report to provide further evidence and understanding of issues that were first raised in a report by the previous commissioner in 2008. That report, \"Not seen. Not heard. Not guilty. The rights and status of the children of prisoners in Scotland\", argued that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the children of prisoners are the invisible victims of crime and of our penal system\".</p><p>The report estimated that, at that time, 13,500 children were affected every year by the imprisonment of a parent. The figure has since been revised up to 16,500, some of whom&#8212;as my motion notes&#8212;live in the South of Scotland region.</p><p>Together, the two reports present a picture of a situation in which children whose parents are locked up can become trapped in a spiral of instability, leading to stress, trauma and, ultimately, patterns of antisocial behaviour and offending. I make it clear, as I have done on many occasions when raising the issue, that I am not suggesting that offenders who pose a threat to society or who have committed serious offences should not be imprisoned or that having children is some sort of get-out-of-jail-free card. What I am arguing for&#8212;as I have since the publication of the 2008 report&#8212;is a mechanism that allows judges to take into account the whole circumstances of an offender's situation and to consider what sentences would have the best outcome for society as a whole.</p><p>A non-custodial sentence that prevents the placing of children in care saves the taxpayer money both in the short term and in the longer term, if it reduces the likelihood of antisocial behaviour and offending by the children. Even the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Justice recognises that. He is quoted in today's edition of <em>The Guardian</em> as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is virtually impossible to do anything productive with offenders on short sentences. And many of them end up losing their jobs, their homes and their families during their short time inside.\"</p><p>The perspectives report from Families Outside and the children's commissioner deals in some detail with the effects of a custodial sentence on a prisoner's family. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 individuals&#8212;children, young people, carers and one adult who as a child experienced parental imprisonment&#8212;the report presents findings and case studies that are both moving and concerning.</p><p>According to the report, a carer who is a grandmother said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"everything changed in her grandson's life because previously the 'father was everything, now he is not, I am'.\"</p><p>Another boy was described as losing all interest in playing computer games and football, which were <place-holder colnum=\"28022\"/> pastimes that he had enjoyed with his father before his father was sent to prison.</p><p>The report's author found that children and carers who are directly affected agree that it is important that the court should take children's views into account. Six of the children who were interviewed</p><p class=\"indent\">\"clearly believed that expressing their feelings to the judge would make a difference to the sentence\".</p><p>Members will be aware of the considerable work that is being done to raise awareness of the issue by the children's commissioner and interest groups such as Families Outside, Action for Children, Children in Scotland and Barnardo's. I thank the representatives of those organisations who have provided information, support and their perspectives and suggestions on how to move the issue forward. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice has taken time to meet and correspond with me and those organisations, so he is aware of the issue.</p><p>Families Outside, in particular, has brought depth to consideration of the issue. Through its direct work with families, the organisation can highlight people's stories, the stresses and strains and the worries and concerns, which does more than simple statistics can do to illustrate the human suffering that children and families throughout Scotland experience. I recently chaired a conference for Families Outside and I do not think that there was a dry eye in the hall when we heard some of those moving stories at first hand. That is why the perspectives report is so important. It details and examines the human impact on innocent victims of crime.</p><p>It does not have to be like that. The example of S v M in South Africa shows that justice can be served without judicial decisions necessarily having a negative impact on an offender's dependent children. New Zealand does not use the same mechanisms as South Africa uses, but its sentencing guidelines provide that a court</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must take into account the offender's personal, family, whanau, community, and cultural background in imposing a sentence or other means of dealing with the offender with a partly or wholly rehabilitative purpose\".</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20874988", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decision Time: \"Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members who have stayed behind for the debate and who supported the motion.

Scotland has a long and proud independent legal tradition and I hope that international examples will help to inform our courts and, in due course, the Scottish sentencing council. I look forward to hearing what the minister will say on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p><p>The current mechanisms do not always work in the way that they were intended to work. Social inquiry reports, which have been used in arguments about caring duties that have been made at the point of sentencing, are not required in most cases and are not always requested by sentencers. Even when they are requested, such reports contain little information about an offender's family. Reports concentrate on issues to do with criminal justice and focus on the needs of the offender. Indeed, a social inquiry report might be prepared while a person is in custody on remand.</p><p>Families Outside is supporting a family in which four young children were taken into care while their mother served just one month in custody for breach of a community penalty for a driving offence. The sentence of one month was enough to make the children and their mum lose their home, and two years later the family has still not been reunited. That is a drastic but real example of how damaging custodial sentences can be for the wider family. It shows that the issue needs attention and that we need to put aside political differences so that we can figure out how to address it.</p><p>I welcome the cross-party support for the motion, which I hope indicates a willingness to work together to take the issue forward, to ensure that in future, as the motion says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the rights of the children of offenders, who are often the innocent and forgotten victims of crime, are respected in the legal system.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20874988", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decision Time: \"Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Mary Scanlon for her intervention, which was useful and appropriate.

Both activities can fulfil all three of those purposes at the same time&#8212;a walk to work is a form of transport, but it is also exercise and can be much more relaxing than ending up stuck in a traffic jam.</p><p>The committee's report notes early on the evidence from one witness who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Active travel ticks almost every policy box that Government would like to see ticked.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee</em>, 1 December 2009; c 2343.]</p><p>That much is certainly clear from the rest of the report and from the experience of many of us in our daily lives.</p><p>If we want Scotland to be greener, active travel cuts down carbon emissions. If we want Scotland to be wealthier and fairer, active travel is a social leveller, and fit and healthy workforces are more <place-holder colnum=\"27101\"/> economically productive. If Scotland is to be safer and stronger, huge community benefits will come from having more pedestrians and cyclists out and about. We can create a smarter Scotland if people learn more about the environment and the world around them as they travel by bike or on foot. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that more people cycling and walking will help to deliver a healthier Scotland.</p><p>Consensus exists about the many and varied benefits of active travel, but it is clear from the report that good words and intentions are not enough. Practical action that is backed by leadership and appropriate funding needs to be taken to get more people walking and cycling. It is agreed that the Scottish Government's proposed target of a 10 per cent modal share for cycling in Scotland's transport profile is ambitious but worth aiming for. An ambitious target helps to focus minds and reminds us of the importance of getting this right.</p><p>It is clear that we need a better culture that translates general awareness that walking is good for people into a habit that allows individuals to make a positive choice for active travel that is not swayed by the vagaries of Scotland's weather, which we have perhaps experienced in the past few days. I welcome the submission from NHS Ayrshire and Arran, which covers a large part of the South of Scotland region. It said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"High levels of walking and cycling can only be achieved when the nation views walking and cycling as the foremost means of local transport playing a central role in everyday travel activity.\"</p><p>The wider population are willing to become more active travellers but, as the committee outlines, that needs to be supported properly. The right infrastructure and support could help us to reach a critical mass of individuals who are seen and keen, which makes involvement all the more easy for others.</p><p>Throughout the South of Scotland, I have worked with constituents who want to become more active travellers but who find barriers in their way. Often, imagination and political will are needed more than hard cash is to overcome those barriers. For example, cyclists who want to travel between Biggar, Symington and Thankerton face a dilemma. They can choose to cycle on the main road, which is heavy with fast-moving traffic, or they can take the designated cycle route, which is longer, narrow, twisty, more remote and often poorly maintained. In effect, they must choose between the worst of both worlds.</p><p>I was struck by the committee's finding that mothers have an important role to play in encouraging their children to walk or cycle to school. A Thankerton mother raised the cycle route issue with me, just as a mother in Lanark <place-holder colnum=\"27102\"/> raised with me South Lanarkshire Council's decision to remove lollipop people, which acts as a disincentive to walk to school. Many children travel between the communities that I mentioned to go to and from school and many end up in cars because neither route for cycling is acceptable to their parents.</p><p>The committee's report talks of the need to join up policies and to take proper account of active travel in planning statements and decisions. Sorting out such issues throughout the country, for which a more joined-up policy approach can be effective, does not have to take extra funding&#8212;just common sense and imagination.</p><p>Innovative use of existing or third-party resources can make a difference. Just a few weeks ago, the Heritage Lottery Fund gave a first-round pass to a &#163;2 million bid for funding by South Lanarkshire Council and a range of partners for a project to conserve the area of great landscape value designation from Chatelherault to New Lanark, following the Clyde valley national tourist route and the Clyde walkway. I wish that partnership success in securing the funding in the final round. Maintaining and developing areas that might be used for recreational walking can provide an inspiration for people to walk more regularly as part of an active lifestyle. I certainly found that when I joined Biggar ramblers on one of their organised walks a year or so ago and when I walked the west Highland way and Perthshire's cateran trail.</p><p>Building active travel considerations into policy decisions at an early stage can save on the need for costly investments later or the appearance of barriers that could otherwise have been avoided. The minister might be aware of concerns that new rolling stock on the North Berwick line, which runs through East Lothian in the South of Scotland region, has insufficient space for bikes. That problem is not dissimilar to the one that was discussed previously in relation to buses, and it probably affects train routes other than the North Berwick line. Some people would argue, probably with some legitimacy, that space for bikes on trains has been a problem ever since guard's vans were done away with in Scotland. However, that is not the fault of the current Scottish Government; sadly, nor can it be tackled without full control over all aspects of our railway system.</p><p>The Cyclists Touring Club Scotland noted in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee that the main barrier to cycling has been the lack of finance over many years. The problem is historical. The report recognises that funding must be secure for the long term and targeted at measures that produce results. We live in difficult economic times. Nowhere does the report suggest that growing the <place-holder colnum=\"27103\"/> Parliament's fiscal responsibility and powers might help to provide some of the financial flexibility that is needed for investment in issues such as active travel. The report cites international examples such as the Netherlands and Denmark. I remind members that those are both independent countries and, dare I say it, free to prioritise walking over nuclear weapons, or cycling over servicing massive public finance initiative debts.</p><p>That aside, active travel ticks all the boxes. The committee is right to say that it deserves support and a joined-up approach.

It serves to remind us of the distinctive banking tradition in Scotland and the principles on which many banks were founded. Perhaps we have lost sight of some of those principles in recent years&#8212;members discussed that in more detail yesterday. Prudence and balance gave way to the impulse to make a quick buck, and serving wider society gave way to the quest for never-ending growth. Perhaps it is even more appropriate in the context of the financial crisis that we should find a way to commemorate the life and work of Robert Owen and the role that the co-operatives can and do play in society. Featuring Robert Owen on a Scottish banknote can serve those purposes, and I hope that one or more of Scotland's banks can be persuaded to take up the challenge. Of course, as taxpayers, we already hold an 84 per cent share in the Royal Bank of Scotland and a 40 per cent share in Lloyds Banking Group, so there should be more ways to persuade those banks other than through petitions and parliamentary debates. The United Kingdom Government has been reluctant to get involved in their day-to-day running, but perhaps it could make an exception in this case at least.</p><p>To mark the year of homecoming last year, the Clydesdale Bank launched a series of banknotes, which included a &#163;20 note that featured an image of New Lanark on its reverse side. Our four other world heritage sites featured on the remaining denominations. Those notes are still in circulation and have attracted a lot of interest from residents in and visitors to Scotland.</p><p>New Lanark is in the South of Scotland region, which I represent. It contributes much to the economy and culture of the area. Even without world heritage status, it would be a wonderful tourist attraction in its own right. The UNESCO designation has helped to raise its profile; it has also raised its ability to attract support and to develop to preserve, protect and enhance its unique historical features for future generations.</p><p>I was delighted that, a few weeks ago, the Minister for Culture and External Affairs was able to visit New Lanark and see Robert Owen's legacy at first hand. As Bill Butler mentioned, the Scottish Government's decision to include the site in the <place-holder colnum=\"27036\"/> educational travel scheme will allow hundreds, if not thousands, of children to visit the site each year. Giving young people the chance at an early age to learn about the co-operative movement and to see for themselves what co-operative principles meant to earlier generations should inspire them to learn more and help to take forward such principles and practices into the future.</p><p>Robert Owen was the founding father of the co-operative movement and New Lanark was its trail-blazer, but the legacy continues today, and that has proven to be as rich a heritage as the physical walls and buildings of the village of New Lanark.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20818703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Robert Owen"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Bill Butler on securing the debate.

Here we are again on a Thursday morning, and I am again happy to put on record my support for the education system in Scotland and the role that it plays in making our country the best that it can be. I know that members from across the Parliament all support that sentiment.</p><p>However, no matter how good we know much of Scotland's education system is, we can never rest on our laurels. The SNP is well known for its outward-looking and internationalist approach to policy matters, so it is right for us to have a full and frank debate about what works, what does not work and what is worthy of further exploration.<place-holder colnum=\"24474\"/></p><p>As I said, the SNP has always sought to learn from other countries that are comparable in terms of population size, geography and economy. I will not disappoint colleagues by pointing out that more often than not, the said countries enjoy the normal status of being independent. As we noted in last week's debate on global education, countries such as Finland, the Netherlands and New Zealand have recently been ranked above Scotland in the OECD's programme for international student assessment for science, maths and reading. As has been mentioned, it is interesting that in those OECD rankings, Sweden lies below Scotland for maths and science. Nevertheless, the Swedish model has caught the eye of the Tories, and it has become the foundation of the education policy that they announced earlier this month.</p><p>Although I admire the proactive nature of the Tories' input to policy discussion and debate, I think that we should be cautious about some elements of the Swedish system that may not fit in well with Scotland's culture, traditions and history, and which may fail to be adaptable to Scotland's unique circumstances. In that vein, it might be useful for the debate to highlight elements of the Swedish model that may seem counterintuitive to the Conservatives and their political ideologies.</p><p>In Sweden, fewer headteachers&#8212;just 5 per cent&#8212;reported that businesses had an influence on the curriculum, whereas in the UK as a whole, 15 per cent of headteachers reported that business and industry had a considerable influence on the curriculum. There is less emphasis in Sweden on keeping siblings together through school place allocations and, on the whole, entry to schools is less residentially based, which means that schools have less of a community character. Given how supportive politicians were of our recent legislation to protect rural schools, I cannot imagine that anyone would wish to erode the important community function that they fulfil by copying that aspect of the Swedish model.</p><p>The Conservatives' motion refers to East Lothian Council, and I am sure that they recognise that the community trust model that that council has put forward is simply one of a number of options for the future of education in the area. I understand that the models that it has proposed would ensure that there was no selection of intake and no private funding. Membership of the trusts would consist of community representatives, teachers, parents, councillors and lay experts, and could include representatives from health, community learning, social work and local enterprises. East Lothian Council has proceeded in that way because it is having to deal with financial pressures. All councils are finding that they will need to think more creatively about how <place-holder colnum=\"24475\"/> they deliver services in the face of the cuts that Scotland faces.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has usefully stated that he is open to suggestions from all sides about how to take education policy forward, and that same sentiment of seeking more dialogue and debate is, I feel, echoed in the Lib Dem amendment, the Conservative motion and even the position of the Labour Party. We should be open to investigating other systems and seeking inspiration not only from Sweden, but from New Zealand, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands and Portugal, where academic performance is good. Education commentators appreciate politicians and policy makers taking that approach, which is why many of them have been so interested in and welcoming of East Lothian Council's approach to thinking out of the box.</p><p>In the spirit of consensual dialogue and allowing space for debate, we might also do well to heed opinions that might not always be as palatable, but which nevertheless need to addressed, such as whether, if headteachers are given more responsibility, we can guarantee that they will always do the right thing. I have certainly heard from teachers who work under heads and do not think that that is the case. Peter Peacock made a similar point. Another such view is that of the parents who simply think that children should go to the school that they live near, regardless of parental choice, and that striving to ensure that the local school attains good results and improves should be what is concentrated on.</p><p>I hope that colleagues understand that I raise such issues because I think that they are important considerations to take on board, and so that we can all hone our arguments in a consensual manner in an effort to drive policy forward together. Education policy is one of those unfortunate topics that everyone knows is important but on which we are probably all far too guilty of dismissing ideas before we have given them a proper airing. That does the Parliament and the topic that we all care so passionately about a disservice.</p><p>Whatever model East Lothian Council or any other council chooses to adopt, I hope that the Parliament can agree that there are some principled lines that we do not want to cross. For example, we do not want to return to academic selection in Scotland's schools or have a voucher system that provides direct state support to independent schools, and the idea of an internal market in education is totally at odds with the principles that have been the foundation of our school system in Scotland for centuries.</p><p>Despite our many lively debates on education, the Parliament's record since 2007 has been to find common ground and consensus in many <place-holder colnum=\"24476\"/> areas. The Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010 and the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 were passed without division, and both will have a beneficial effect on the education of schoolchildren in Scotland. In addition, the Parliament has given its support to the curriculum for excellence on many occasions.</p><p>Scotland can and will learn from other parts of the world, just as, in years gone by, other countries looked to Scotland for all their ideas and inspiration. It is in the interests not just of the Parliament but of all those who play a part in our education system in Scotland to defend those principles and to concentrate on delivering the best possible results for our children and young people.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20683045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Management)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Three weeks ago, I said: \"Members have heard many times, often in education debates and often on a Thursday morning, about the importance of equipping our younger generations with the skills and knowledge that they need to succeed personally and contribute to the wellbeing of our society.\"&#8212;[Official Report, 25 February 2010; c 23976.] Murdo Fraser told us during last week's education...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Aileen", "last_name": "Campbell", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80294", "house": "4", "member_id": "80294", "person_id": "13966", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South of Scotland"}, "section_id": "20683045", "hpos": "58", "gid": "2010-03-11.24473.0", "epobject_id": "20683100", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2010-03-11.24449.1&amp;s=speaker%3A13966+section%3Asp#g24473.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "10:17:00", "speaker_id": "80294"}, {"body": "<p>If the member celebrates those principles, why does she want to delete them from the motion that we are debating?</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20666304", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education and Skills"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If the member celebrates those principles, why does she want to delete them from the motion that we are debating?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Aileen", "last_name": "Campbell", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80294", "house": "4", "member_id": "80294", "person_id": "13966", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South of Scotland"}, "section_id": "20666304", "hpos": "312", "gid": "2010-03-04.24328.1", "epobject_id": "20666342", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2010-03-04.24305.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13966+section%3Asp#g24328.1", "minor": "0", "htime": "15:51:00", "speaker_id": "80294"}, {"body": "<p> Global citizenship and international perspectives on education have never been more important.

In my area, I think of Larkhall academy and the group of sixth year pupils who developed a unite Scotland initiative to celebrate diversity within Scotland and the contribution that people from other countries and cultures make when they come here. As part of that project, the group aimed to raise more than &#163;20,000 through the Prince's Trust scholars challenge, which ran during the academic year 2008-2009.</p><p>However, the aim of international education, and the aim of the Government's motion, is to ensure not just that those in education learn about other countries and societies but that we learn from them. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is right to look at best practice around the world, especially in those countries that tend to perform better than Scotland in OECD and other assessments of our educational performance. Where other countries are getting things right, it simply makes sense for us to consider how their ideas might be applied to Scotland. Other members have made that point.</p><p>From that perspective, it is easy to understand the importance that the Liberal Democrats' amendment attaches to modern languages. All too often, native speakers of English take it for granted that they will be understood by people from other parts of the world. That can lead to complacency in the uptake of and commitment to the study of other languages. Learning other languages has benefits beyond simply being able to communicate with people from different countries. To truly understand a language means also to understand the culture that has shaped and formed it. It is also a skill that promotes and improves learning and cognitive functions in other parts of the curriculum and daily life, especially in the early years.</p><p>It is unfortunate that Labour is not as constructive in its amendment. The Parliament rightly debated the curriculum for excellence just last week, when it supported</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the full and effective implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence\",</p><p>agreeing that it should be introduced within a timescale that meets the recommendations of the management board. Like the cabinet secretary, I believe it is unfortunate that the Labour amendment for today's debate removes from the Government's motion so much that is positive about Scottish education.</p><p>It is not just the Government's responsibility to promote international perspectives on education. I <place-holder colnum=\"24322\"/> note the range of organisations that exist to help schools to integrate global citizenship as effectively as possible into the curriculum. The Scottish Development Education Centre and the International Development Education Association of Scotland do hugely important work in that regard. Both are supported by the Government, but they bring together a wide range of individuals who have experience of international development and education.</p><p>Another such organisation is the British Council, which, along with the United Nations refugee programme, Scottish Screen and others, has helped to sponsor the reel festivals series of international film screenings in Edinburgh. I have been proud to support the reel Iraq and reel Afghanistan festivals in the past two years. Although some of the material that was screened might be beyond what would usually be shown to school pupils, the festivals are another demonstration of Scotland's willingness to reach out to the wider world. They are organised by the Edinburgh University Settlement charity, whose stated goals are to enhance public provision for individuals who are disadvantaged through circumstance or disability. It aims to help local people in and around Edinburgh to bring about social change and regeneration for their communities. Many such causes are founded by people who are products of Scotland's education system and who have learned through their education in Scotland the values of citizenship and responsibility and our obligations to our neighbours at home and abroad.</p><p>The motion states that young people must be given the opportunity to learn</p><p class=\"indent\">\"about Scotland and its place in the world\".</p><p>For that reason, the Government is once again to be commended for making the Scotland's history website available not just to schools but to everyone who has access to the internet, wherever they are in the world. Far from having a narrow perspective on our nation, the website is in the proud tradition of internationalism that has always been found in people from Scotland, including those of us who believe in independence.</p><p>This Saturday, teachers and members of the public from across Scotland will gather to protest against cuts to our education system. As I said in the chamber last week, I firmly believe that we should invest in teachers and not in Trident submarines. Global citizenship education will do more to bring about peace and reconciliation and sustainable economic development than weapons of mass destruction on the Clyde ever will.</p><p>I congratulate the Government on its motion and its vision of a positive way forward for Scotland's <place-holder colnum=\"24323\"/> education system that builds on good practice and, of course, internationalism.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20666304", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education and Skills"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I defer to Margo MacDonald's knowledge of that.

I understand that my Westminster colleague Pete Wishart lodged a similar early day <place-holder colnum=\"24120\"/> motion at Westminster a couple of months back. I also pay tribute to the work of the Lord Lieutenant, Brigadier Melville Jameson, and that of Provost John Hulbert, who is in the gallery. He has been supported by Pete Wishart, the constituency MSPs Roseanna Cunningham, John Swinney and Murdo Fraser, and many people from other parties, who have done much work in promoting Perth 800 and building the case for restoring Perth's city status. That work is important.</p><p>Members may wonder why, as a South of Scotland MSP, I am speaking in a debate about Perth. The reason is that I grew up in Perthshire, I have family who still live there and I went to school in what I hope will soon be the city of Perth. I echo the sentiments in Murdo Fraser's and Pete Wishart's motions, which note that Perth and Perthshire are among many great places to live, visit and do business in, among other things. There are also many places in the South of Scotland that are great places in which to live and work, including my new home town of Biggar.</p><p>I was born in Perth royal infirmary in 1980. Around five years earlier, Perth's city status was removed. That was an unfortunate decision. Although Perth is called the fair city, that is not the same as its being formally recognised as a city. That is why I support the bid to make it a city. I hope that the momentum that is built up during the year-long celebrations of Perth's 800<sup>th</sup> birthday are rewarded by the long-overdue restoration of its city status in 2012. That would make the fair city title ring true once again.</p><p>There certainly has been a lot of momentum. The First Minister passed the baton of celebration on to Perth when the curtain came down on the year of homecoming on St Andrew's day last year. The celebrations for 2010 are the perfect way, I hope, to make the city bid a success and to ensure that the philosophy and popularity of homecoming does not end. I believe that the First Minister also signed a declaration of support earlier today. A successful celebratory dinner was hosted by Pete Wishart in Westminster, which allowed people who are involved with the campaign to put their case to members of Parliament and the House of Lords.</p><p>The bid is impressive. The brochure that has been presented to members who supported Murdo Fraser's motion is fantastic and gives a wonderful journey through Perth's history right up to the here and now. It showcases what a modern and dynamic place Perth has become, with art trails, excellent shopping, great architecture and, of course, the wonderful concert hall. It is good to see mention of another royal burgh, Lanark, in the fair city guide, because 2010 is also a special year for Lanark, as it marks the centenary of aviation week. That was Scotland's first air show, and was <place-holder colnum=\"24121\"/> held in Lanark. I have been working with organisers in Lanark&#8212;Ed Archer and Sylvia Russell&#8212;who hope to mark that occasion in Lanark. However, because of the absence of an airfield there, they have been working with the aerodrome in Perth. The drome will be home to the centenary show, which makes up part of the Perth 800 celebrations. The 1910 version of the air show had a huge impact in Lanark, so I look forward to enjoying the show and celebrations when they happen in Perth and Lanark.</p><p>Although I have not lived in Perthshire for some time, it still holds a dear place in my heart. Browsing through the brochure has rekindled fond memories: summers spent berry picking in the soft fruit capital of Scotland; going to Perth academy, which celebrates its 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year; playing sport in Bell's sports centre; being dragged through McEwens by my mum; Murray's pies; playing in concerts at St John's kirk; and, of course, attending fitba matches at McDiarmid Park. I hasten to add that those latter memories are not all fond.</p><p>I am impressed by the events that have been drawn together to showcase Perth and Perthshire, which illustrate how modern and forward-thinking Perth is. I see that my old classmate the incredibly talented Alasdair Beatson is performing several concerts as part of the programme of events. I am sure that 2010 will be an exciting year for Perth. No doubt, the whole place will have a buzz about it and the events will entice many visitors from throughout Scotland and the world. I hope that the icing on the cake will be success in the bid for city status.</p><p>The work that has been put into the campaign by many people is to be commended. The campaign acts as a useful blueprint for what other local authorities can do if they choose to be proactive in the same way. I hope to highlight the project to local authorities in the South of Scotland region to show them what can be achieved to boost tourism and profile. I wish everyone in Perth and Perthshire all the best for Perth 800 and I hope to pop up the road soon to enjoy some of what is on offer.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649099", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Perth 800"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Murdo Fraser on securing the debate.

Schools have already been provided with an additional year for implementation, and I know that the Government will always take advice from the curriculum for excellence management board in implementing changes, as the motion suggests.

Local newspapers are about more than just public information notices. To be honest, I am not entirely surprised that only about 2 per cent of people get their public information from such notices. People buy their local newspapers for a variety of reasons: to get the football results and local sports round-ups, to find out about their local groups and organisations, to see who has been in court and, generally, to find out what the craic is in the towns and villages that they live in. However, there is absolutely no denying that the newspapers' relative decline is worthy of discussion, investigation and concern.</p><p>The Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee thought the same, and took evidence on the issue just last week. The session was illuminating and I encourage members to have a look at the <em>Official Report</em>. The evidence painted a <place-holder colnum=\"23222\"/> picture that was much broader than the stark terms of associating the potential folding of local titles with a decline in advertising money from public information notices. Of particular note was the evidence from David Hutchison, visiting professor in media policy at Glasgow Caledonian University, who told us:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"even in these difficult times, if you look at the percentage of revenue that goes to profits, you will see that the chain newspaper companies are doing not too badly. Only a few years ago, 30 per cent of revenue was profit. Marks and Spencer had a very good year three years ago when 9 per cent of its revenue was profit. Even today, the latest figures that I have seen suggest that some of the companies, some of whose representatives you have spoken to, are still making rather good returns.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 20 January 2010; c 3064.]</p><p>Newspaper sales might be declining, but it seems that a healthy profit can still be made. Stuart McMillan mentioned the dilemma that the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee faced following questions from Ken Macintosh. We heard about profits, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, about the desperate need for local efficiency savings. That is a valid point. While newspapers are still in receipt of advertising revenues at the moment, journalists are being laid off, journalist posts are being scaled back and sales are still declining.

They were devastating blows to the communities that the post offices served. Many people relied on their nearest post office to get their pensions or child benefits, and many small businesses relied on them, too. In addition, people valued their post office as a venue in which to meet friends and neighbours for a blether. It was no surprise that, when I conducted a survey among constituents who had been affected by the closure of post office branches in Lesmahagow, Lanark, New Lanark, Larkhall, Irvine, Stevenston and Kilwinning, an average of more than 98 per cent of respondents said that they disagreed with the proposals.</p><p>The post office is important because it has a social value that many groups, businesses and organisations can only dream of. It is a widely recognised brand that, in today's credit crunch times, is trusted and respected, as members have said. It is also a place where customers are served by someone face to face. I agree with Cathy Jamieson that the post office is as far removed as possible from the emotionlessness of direct debits, distant call centres and annoying automated responses that tell people, \"Press 1 for advice or 2 for assistance.\" To tell the truth, the only really annoying thing about post offices is their extra-long queues, but not everything is perfect and the fact that the services are in such high demand suggests, in itself, that post offices are doing something right.</p><p>Of course, there is a serious and commercial side to the post office. According to the National Federation of SubPostmasters, for every &#163;1 transacted in the UK, 14p is handled through the post office network. The Federation of Small Businesses said that small businesses are heavily reliant on post offices, with nearly nine in 10 small businesspeople visiting a post office to buy stamps and send mail and 25 per cent depositing cash, collecting change and using the banking service at the post office.</p><p>The importance of the post office network cannot be overstated, which is why we need to think imaginatively about its future. My South of Scotland colleague, Christine Grahame, recently hosted an event in Parliament on behalf of the National Federation of SubPostmasters, which outlined its six steps to a sustainable post office network proposals. Those proposals highlight the actions that all levels of government can take to increase the viability of the network, including making better use of post offices and considering ways of creating a post bank. Those are exactly the kind of initiatives that a post office diversification fund could help to support. Indeed, the FSB's report highlights the impact that the <place-holder colnum=\"23182\"/> diversification fund in Wales has had since its implementation. Although we all recognise the severe pressures on the budgets of the Scottish Government and local authorities, I hope that some consideration can be given to ways of supporting the sustainability and diversification of our post offices.</p><p>Of particular interest to me was the idea of encouraging the sharing of post office facilities with tourist information services or with facilities by which people could access the services of local authorities and organisations such as credit unions. Given that the post office network has an unrivalled geographical spread and that not every part of Scotland has tourist information centres or access to credit unions, those combinations could be marriages made in heaven. Support to develop such important services could help to provide a boost to local economies during this time of recession. If there are ways of providing tourism spin-offs and giving people access to banking facilities that they can trust while retaining important and much-loved post offices across Scotland, it seems sensible for all levels of government to consider those possibilities.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20529042", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post Offices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join other members in congratulating Christine Grahame on securing the debate on a topic that is of increasing importance to people throughout the country, but particularly, as the motion states, those in the Scottish Borders and the wider South of Scotland region that I represent.

It was launched in Perth a year or so ago. At the launch, several of the aforementioned charities attended, as did the local MSP, Roseanna Cunningham, and other interested MSPs, including Mary Scanlon. More important, many of the young people who were to benefit from the scheme were present. It was good to hear from them their stories and their excitement about and enthusiasm for an online network that would allow them to connect with other young people who were going through similar experiences.</p><p>The young people's stories were incredibly moving. Young cancer survivors spoke about the difficulties that they faced, the physical and mental effects of treatment programmes, the loneliness and isolation that illness can cause and the social and educational impacts of missing school. One speaker, who had lost his young sister to the disease, told a deeply emotional story about the impact on him of her illness and death. That highlighted an issue about cancer in young people that I had not previously considered&#8212;the impact on the siblings. Mary Scanlon mentioned that, too. That young person spoke about how their education suffered and how they struggled to come to terms with the devastating impact that the disease had on his wee sister. It pained him to admit it, but he said that he was also a bit jealous of the focus on his wee sister and the attention that she got. He was very brave to be so candid and he showed that those helping and supporting a cancer sufferer should not forget that the brothers and sisters suffer, too.<place-holder colnum=\"23089\"/></p><p>Behind the tears and the tragic tales, there was an uplifting energy in the way in which the young people spoke at the forum's launch. They were absolutely committed to making a success of a youth-led network that provides peer support. It is that youth-led approach that makes the network so special. The young people who are behind the scheme want to help others and to provide a bit of normality for youngsters who are suffering from cancer, when otherwise they would be stuck in their bed and unable to go out or interact with other people their age, as Nanette Milne pointed out. Those youngsters know what it is like to have their lives limited by cancer and to be scared about what the future holds. They know how it feels physically when going through treatment. Instead of just thinking about it, they have used modern technology proactively so that other young sufferers can go online and find a ready-made support network.</p><p>I thank Nanette Milne for raising what is an incredibly important topic that is definitely worthy of debate and discussion.

The hall is geographically and symbolically at the centre of the community, and the fight to save it has been one of the most significant local campaigns in which I have been involved since being elected in May 2007. I am proud to have the opportunity to bring the issue to the Scottish Parliament chamber today.</p><p>The issue of the role and future of community halls throughout Scotland is not unfamiliar to the chamber. Indeed, in 2006, my colleague Andrew Welsh led a members' business debate on the challenges that are faced by village community halls. Many members will be aware of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations halls for all campaign and petition to the Parliament following the 2007 election.</p><p>The points that have been made on those and other occasions about the role of community halls in general apply specifically to the situation of the Jubilee hall in Lesmahagow. Local halls provide a focus and location for all kinds of events and services that give an area its character and sense of community. Indeed, my recent wedding reception was held in a village hall, which provided a characterful backdrop to my celebrations.</p><p>The Jubilee hall is no different, and the huge range of groups and societies that use and meet in the hall include the young farmers group, the mother and toddler group, the badminton club, the <place-holder colnum=\"22853\"/> drama group Class Act and the male voice choir, to name but a few.</p><p>In mid-2008, South Lanarkshire Council undertook a review of all its community facilities. As a result of that review, the council's executive committee decided to declare the Jubilee hall surplus to requirements and invest instead in the nearby Fountain hall, which has lain mothballed since before it was acquired by the council at a cost of more than &#163;500,000.</p><p>As far as I am aware, the council's review made little or no effort to discuss with community groups in Lesmahagow and users of the Jubilee hall their requirements or their opinions about the future of facilities in their town. Many of the user groups that I have spoken to since feel that way. Given the long list of groups that currently use their local facility, I am sure that members appreciate why the community and I find the council's conclusion that the hall is surplus to requirements a bit odd.</p><p>It was at a concert by Lesmahagow's male voice choir in March 2009 that the impact of the hall's closure began to hit home. The choir genuinely feared that their performance, which had been held annually in the Jubilee hall and enhanced by its wonderful acoustics for many years, would be the last to take place in the venue. As a result of the growing sense of unease among the various user groups and the community council about the hall's future, I decided to carry out a survey of local opinion on the proposals.</p><p>The results were overwhelming in every sense of the word. Out of 2,071 surveys that were distributed, 361 were returned&#8212;a rate of more than 17 per cent, which can be considered very good for that type of exercise. Eight-five per cent of respondents said that they disagreed with the proposal to close the hall, and 86 per cent said that they did not believe that the Fountain hall was a suitable replacement.</p><p>Perhaps the most important responses to my survey were the individual comments and memories that more than 200 respondents took the time to share with me. Those testimonies demonstrated not only the affection in which the hall is currently held but the role that it has played throughout the town's history.</p><p>One respondent had memories of using the hall on various occasions stretching back over 55 years. It has been the scene of wedding receptions and anniversary celebrations, dances and parties, and sports tournaments and village shows. Some of the respondents responded with comments such as these:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The council will leave a huge void if the closure goes ahead\"; \"please do not tear the heart out of our community\";<place-holder colnum=\"22854\"/> \"my mother and father held their wedding in the Jubilee in 1982\"; \"the Jube is a huge part of this village and I don't feel it is up to the council to disregard the villagers' feelings on this matter\";</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"closing the Jubilee Hall could threaten the very existence of the Male Voice Choir\".</p><p>That is emotional stuff&#8212;and no wonder, because members of the community feel helpless, ignored and upset that the hall that they use and love is deemed to be surplus to requirements.</p><p>Perhaps one reason why the hall occupies such a special place in the hearts of so many people is that, although legally the hall is owned by the council, many feel that it belongs to the village. However, the Jubilee hall is different from the many community halls that are in the hands of trusts or charities in that it is owned by the local authority. That ownership is what has led to the current predicament. Although constructed in the mid-1800s, the hall was to all intents and purposes gifted to the village in the 1950s. A freedom of information disclosure to my office from South Lanarkshire Council confirms that the trustees of Lesmahagow public hall&#8212;as it was then known&#8212;gave part of the site to the district council of number 2 district of the county of Lanark on 1 January 1951, with provisions in the title and previous deeds requiring the site to be used as a public hall. Irrespective of whether those deeds are still legally enforceable, South Lanarkshire Council has a moral duty to respect what is an important part of the town's heritage.</p><p>When the town's amateur dramatics group, Class Act, brought down the final curtain of its annual pantomime show late last year, there were tears both on stage and in the hall as many realised that that could literally be the final curtain if the closure goes ahead in the next few months. The hall's stage, lighting and back-stage facilities are much valued by all the groups that use it as a performance space. There is no guarantee that viable alternatives exist. It would be a tragedy if a hall that is so well used was closed, essentially on a whim, at a time when such facilities are so badly needed and are lacking in many other parts of the country.</p><p>Indeed, in recent months, the hall has been the venue for an informal football academy that has been set up by a young local man with coaching skills who was otherwise unemployed. Ironically, he struggled to find evenings to fit in his football academy, as the hall was so busy. He is providing recreation and exercise for local young people that keeps them off the streets and keeps his own skills in top condition while he looks for more permanent work.<place-holder colnum=\"22855\"/></p><p>It is only fair to acknowledge that 13 per cent of respondents to my survey agreed with the council's proposal to close the hall. They expressed concerns about the accessibility of the hall and its current state of repair. However, I believe that neither of those problems is insurmountable. A solution is certainly well within the funds that are currently spent or budgeted for the proposed alternative facility.</p><p>My motion refers to the fun day that was organised on Hallowe'en last year. That was a superb event that provided another example of how well used and loved the hall is, and it served as an opportunity to raise further awareness among local groups about the closure plans. During the day, each of the different user groups ran a stall or activity, which was attended by families and individuals of all ages. I was delighted to spend some time talking to the folk at the event and to hear at first hand some of the stories and memories that were reflected in my survey responses.</p><p>I know that it can be difficult for other members to participate in members' business debates when the motion refers to such a local and particular issue, but I believe that the story of the Jubilee hall contains lessons for the maintenance and development of community halls throughout Scotland. I hope that the future of the hall is not settled and that South Lanarkshire Council can be persuaded to rethink its decision to close the hall. If not, I hope that, at the very least, the community will be given the opportunity to see whether it can play some role in the hall's future, whether through a community buyout or some other alternative. It would, I repeat, be a tragedy if the facility was lost, especially if the building was demolished or converted for another use beyond recognition.</p><p>The middle of a recession during a property slump is not the time to dispose of such an impressive asset, but the building is more than simply an asset. It was a gift to the council. Although the council might believe that it has the legal right to sell the building, it certainly has no moral right to do anything other than maintain the site for its original purpose: a community hall that is still at the geographic, social and cultural heart of the community that it serves.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20498112", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lesmahagow Jubilee Hall"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Many folk from Lesmahagow have been unable to get to Edinburgh today because of the snow, but they are watching the debate online.

However, as the Scottish Parliament was founded, the talk was of finding Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and there can be no doubt that illiteracy is a problem in Scotland. The extent of the problem and the challenges that we face as a result are made clear in the literacy commission's report, and I am happy to join members in welcoming the publication of the report and the initiative that led to it.</p><p>As members on my side of the chamber will know only too well, Opposition is about more than simply saying no and disagreeing with everything proposed by the Government of the day. Constructive policy development and seeking to find consensus in the best interests of the people who have sent us here are part and parcel of the role, and the fact that we can unite today to support the work of the literacy commission is an example of that.</p><p>The report deals with issues surrounding the definition and measurement of literacy, especially identifying the functional or basic levels of literacy that will enable an individual to function in an adult society. It is worth noting that it is not only the Scottish Government that uses a range of indicators rather than one strict definition to measure illiteracy; that is true internationally and in countries where different cultural and linguistic traditions have an impact. We should also recognise that the Scottish survey on attainment will now measure literacy performance every two years, which will allow a much clearer picture to be <place-holder colnum=\"22743\"/> built up of the state of literacy in schools in coming years.</p><p>It is clear, however, from the report and the wide range of source material upon which it draws that Scotland can and must do better in raising literacy rates. We owe it to the individuals who struggle with poor literacy to give them the best opportunities in life, and to Scotland as a whole, which stands to benefit from an active, confident and literate society that contributes to our economy and culture.</p><p>We must therefore examine how best to tackle illiteracy and cultural disadvantage at all levels of society, including in the family unit. The concept of a zero-tolerance approach, which is suggested in the report, demonstrates the kind of focus and effort that will be required to achieve the goal of eradicating avoidable or unnecessary illiteracy.</p><p>In its programme for government and key strategies, the Scottish Government does not shy away from the challenge of tackling low literacy rates. Indeed, reducing the number of working-age people who have severe literacy and numeracy problems is a key national indicator. That is also recognised in the curriculum for excellence, which seeks to embed the fundamental principles of literacy and numeracy across the curriculum and in all aspects of learning. That means that all teachers are responsible for literacy, because, as the report recognises, literacy is acquired not just in English classes but in interaction with others and through applying cognition and communication skills in a range of situations and environments.</p><p>The Scottish Government has also recognised that with the big plus adult literacy programme. Last year, footballers from every team in the Scottish Premier League&#8212;although before my team, St Johnstone, secured its place in the SPL&#8212;selected their favourite adult and children's books, which were made available in libraries and learning centres to inspire a love of reading among adults and children, especially those who might not naturally pick up a book for leisure or enjoyment.</p><p>Familiarity with books and literature can only help to build a more literate and fluent society. The cabinet secretary will know that I am very supportive of an Edinburgh Napier University project that gives third year publishing students the opportunity to manage the process of publishing by printing new editions of Scottish classics that are out of copyright. The books are then given free to secondary schools, so that great Scottish literature is made more available to pupils. It is a wonderfully simple scheme, and it can only help to promote reading and familiarity with Scottish literature among the younger <place-holder colnum=\"22744\"/> generations. It will go some way to filling the libraries that Kenneth Gibson spoke about.</p><p>This year's publication is James Hogg's \"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\", which the cabinet secretary described last week as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"one of the ... great unfilmed books in Scotland\",</p><p>although I recently heard that a screenplay has almost been completed. As he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If it is read by a much wider audience in Scotland, there will be a much better understanding of our dual nature in Scotland.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 7 January 2010; c 22564.]</p><p>Next year's publication, complete with a foreword from the First Minister and Christopher Harvie, is \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\", and I am sure that it will go on to inspire a new set of youngsters to pick up a good book.</p><p>While at university, I did a bit of studying on bothy ballads, which provided a huge insight into just how important a good story and song have been to Scotland over the centuries. It is no wonder that this small but multiform and infinite country has produced far more than its fair share of literary greats, but with that talent comes responsibility. The literacy commission's report has focused the mind on Scotland's poor literacy rates, and it is the responsibility of us all to ensure that we give every young person the tools to appreciate our history, culture and literature, and to spread their wings to appreciate those same things in other countries around the world.</p><p>Later this month, people throughout the world will celebrate the life and work of Robert Burns, one of the greatest literary talents ever to emerge from Scotland or anywhere else. The literacy commission considered in detail the impact of socioeconomic circumstances on literacy and educational attainment, so it is perhaps worth bearing in mind the humble background from which Burns came and the relatively youthful age at which he produced his works. Burns received little formal education but was taught by his father, who was self-educated. That speaks of a belief in the power of education and learning to improve one's sense of fulfilment and wellbeing.</p><p>Today, 251 years after the death of Robert Burns, and in the spirit of our bard, who despised unfairness and sought equality, it is our turn to tackle head-on the scourge of illiteracy, inequality and poverty that has plagued Scotland for far too long. I know that the cabinet secretary and the Scottish Government have been doing all that they can to ensure that that happens and will continue to do so.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20497705", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Literacy Commission"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sometimes we politicians like to use words or language in a way that softens the difficulties we face; we talk of concerns instead of complaints, and of challenges instead of problems.

No matter what we agree or disagree on in the course of this morning's debate, we must keep in mind that that must be our aim. We need to get it right for every single child at every point where people rely on local or central Government, whether that is in social care, in the justice system or in education.</p><p>The Scottish Government has said that, with the appointment of a new cabinet secretary for education, it wants to introduce a fresh perspective on school education and to find ways of working with local government and all the relevant stakeholders&#8212;including the Opposition parties&#8212;to deliver the best possible outcomes for children in Scotland. It has been suggested that the Government is considering centralisation of school education services. What the Government in fact said in the light of the statistics&#8212;which we all recognise are unacceptable&#8212;is that all options should be on the table. That means that greater decentralisation within education authorities is an option as well as greater Government intervention.</p><p>It remains the case that the concordat with local government includes a commitment to year-on-year progress towards lower class sizes, on the maintenance of teacher numbers and on the delivery of free school meals. Real progress has been made in some areas. East Ayrshire Council, part of whose area falls within the South of Scotland region, has increased teacher numbers and delivered an average class size of below 18. That shows that, where there is a political will, a way can be found to make such goals a reality.</p><p>Of course, in other areas there has been less progress, and everyone involved&#8212;both local government and national Government&#8212;must ask themselves why. For example, why have local authorities saved &#163;110 million as a result of falling teacher numbers? What has that money been spent on? Why are both the Scottish Government and local authorities burdened with massive private finance initiative and public-private partnership payments because of poorly negotiated contracts from before 2007? Why have the previous Administration's predictions on teacher retirements failed to materialise?</p><p>The sky did not fall in on Scotland's education system on 4 May 2007. First mandated by the pre-union Parliament in 1633, Scotland's school education eventually became renowned as being among the best in the world, and we should be proud that we continue to measure our progress against, and constantly strive to achieve, that standard. We are now two and a half years into Scotland's first minority Government and, despite our minority status, we have achieved a <place-holder colnum=\"21838\"/> remarkable degree of stability, consistency and delivery in the education sector.</p><p>Within its first two years, the Government has announced a new school building programme, whereas it took Labour six years, under the Scottish Office and then under devolution, before it even looked at the school estate. The fact remains that the SNP Government is building more schools&#8212;we have lifted 100,000 pupils out of unsatisfactory school accommodation. Since May 2007, 236 school projects have been completed, so we are well on track to complete 250 projects over the parliamentary session. In its last four years, Labour completed just 205 school projects. In the South of Scotland, Carluke high school enjoyed its official opening ceremony just this week and Larkhall academy will be officially opened in the not too distant future.</p><p>At the end of the day, new schools belong not to any political party but to the communities that they serve. The schools are paid for by those communities through their taxes. Thanks to the SNP, people are getting better value for money wherever alternatives to the discredited PFI/PPP system can be found.</p><p>A fortnight ago, the Parliament united to pass the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill, which will be vital legislation in protecting school communities especially&#8212;but not only&#8212;in rural areas. During that debate, I said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Parents, local businesses and community members can play a hugely positive role in such schools and ensure that they are more than just bricks and mortar.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-11-19.21428.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 19 November 2009; c 21429.]</citation></p><p>I stand by that comment. Schools are the incubators of the next generation of citizens and leaders. The young people whom we educate today will become the innovators, scientists and business leaders&#8212;and even the teachers and politicians&#8212;of tomorrow. We owe it to them to ensure that they have the best possible start in life. Indeed, we owe that to ourselves, because we will depend on those nurses, doctors, mechanics and builders in years to come.</p><p>We should start by setting the best possible example in the way we debate education policy.

I welcome the wide-ranging consultation by the Scottish Government on the various aspects of the bill and the thorough scrutiny that was carried out by the Justice Committee. I made submissions to both the Government and the committee on aspects related to the legislation and will return to that shortly.</p><p>I endorse the general principles of the bill, as well as the wide range of specific measures that will help to tackle so much of the crime and its consequences that blight too many of our communities.</p><p>I am particularly interested in how the bill will affect the youngest members of our society. The Government is right to use the bill to reinforce the importance of ensuring that younger children who offend will continue to be dealt with in the hearings system and will be held, when that is necessary, in secure accommodation and not in adult courts or prisons. The approach is important, because it protects the rights of young people and meets their needs appropriately. It also has the effect of minimising contact with adult criminals and thereby reducing the risk of reoffending.</p><p>However, it is not just young offenders who are affected by the justice system. The children of adults who commit offences are also affected by sentencing decisions. Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People published the report \"Not Seen. Not Heard. Not Guilty: the Rights and Status of the Children of Prisoners in Scotland\" in February 2008, and in June that year the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee discussed issues that were raised in the report with the then commissioner, Kathleen <place-holder colnum=\"21601\"/> Marshall. In the report, the children of offenders were described as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the innocent victims of their parent's offending\".</p><p>That sums up the situation in which so many of those children find themselves.</p><p>In 2002, a report by the Scottish Prison Service, \"Making a Difference\", revealed that about 13,500 children in Scotland had a parent in prison. Families Outside, a Scottish charity that works with families who are affected by imprisonment, points out that, given the rise in the prison population since 2002, the current number is likely to be significantly higher. Kathleen Marshall said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At least as many children are affected by the imprisonment of a parent as are looked-after children in Scotland\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 25 June 2008; c 1257.]</p><p>Each case gives rise to costs of alternative care arrangements, problems for the parent when they try to get their children back after serving a custodial sentence and wider societal costs of depriving a child of a parent. Children who have a parent or primary carer in prison often exhibit regressive behaviour, such as bed wetting, or display emotional and behavioural problems. Families Outside noted that even having a parent who is remanded in custody can have a disproportionate and negative impact on a child.</p><p>The SCCYP has highlighted a ruling by the Constitutional Court in South Africa, which introduced child impact assessments, to be carried out by lower courts at the point of sentencing. Earlier this year, I was privileged to hear more about the system when I attended a moving lecture by one of the members of the court, Justice Albie Sachs. I congratulate Tam Baillie, the current children's commissioner, on organising the lecture, which made a powerful impression on everyone who attended. Justice Sachs quoted from the judgment that he had given in the case S v M, in which a woman who would otherwise have been jailed was kept out of jail because of consideration of the rights of her three sons. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every child has his or her own dignity. If a child is to be constitutionally imagined as an individual with a distinct personality, and not merely as a miniature adult waiting to reach full size, he or she cannot be treated as a mere extension of his or her parents, umbilically destined to sink or swim with them ... the sins and traumas of fathers and mothers should not be visited on their children.\"</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is familiar with the issue, because he kindly met me and other interested parties to discuss it. Other members will be aware of the issue, thanks to the helpful briefings that Action for Children and others provided in advance of the debate.</p><p>I make it clear that I am not advocating that convicted criminals who are also primary care <place-holder colnum=\"21602\"/> givers should not be properly punished. Any person who poses a threat to the public should be incarcerated, whether or not they have children. Nor am I suggesting that it is always in a child's best interests not to lock up their parent or carer. In my submission to the Justice Committee, I argued that imprisoning low-level offenders who have children has a wider social impact as families are broken up. If we punish such offenders in the community, justice will be served and Scottish society will not have to deal with the long-term social consequences of family breakdown. I hope that the approach will also break the cycle whereby the children of prisoners are more likely to offend.</p><p>The presumption against short-term sentences will help to achieve that outcome to some extent, but there might also be a role for the Scottish sentencing council, which the bill will establish. In my submission to the Government's consultation on the sentencing council, I suggested that, when the council is established, it might review the effectiveness of social inquiry reports, which can be carried out as part of the sentencing process, and consider whether a specific family impact assessment should be carried out whenever an offender has caring responsibilities for children or other dependants. I hope that the cabinet secretary and the Government will consider my suggestion as the bill continues through the parliamentary process.</p><p>I hope that there will be support for the bill in the Parliament and I look forward to supporting it at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410761", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill gives the Parliament an opportunity to take Scotland closer to being the safer, fairer country that we all want to live in.

The Christmas break is now on the horizon and I am pleased by the speedy progress made in taking the bill through its final stages.</p><p>Once again, I thank the wide range of organisations that gave evidence to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, the ministerial team for its helpful contributions at all stages and my fellow committee members for the constructive and consensual way in which we have engaged with and progressed the bill. Murdo Fraser and Karen Whitefield have already alluded to the fact that we do not often use \"consensual\" and \"Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee\" in the same sentence.</p><p>In the few short months since the stage 1 debate, the bill has become even more important and necessary. The impact of the recession and budget cuts are being felt across Scotland, and there is a danger that many local authorities could look to their school estates for what might seem like quick and easy ways to reduce overall spending and institute a school closure and consolidation programme.</p><p>We have already heard in the debate&#8212;and will no doubt hear more&#8212;about closures that are planned or have happened across the country. Education authorities should be aware that, although they do not yet have the force of law, the bills' principles represent a high standard of good practice, and communities affected by school closure proposals should rightly expect councils to make every effort to meet such standards. As Ken Macintosh pointed out and as the committee made clear in its stage 1 report, some education authorities do follow these standards; however, we must avoid the perception of councils rushing through closure programmes to escape the added protections of and principles behind this legislation.</p><p>In my South of Scotland area, parents, pupils and teachers in Coulter and Lamington primary schools are waiting to hear the outcome of a consultation on the future of the two sites and the possibility of a merger. Throughout the consultation period, I encouraged South Lanarkshire Council to bear in mind the principles behind the bill, even if it is not yet law. The council is well known for being quite inclusive in its approach to any school consolidation or closure programme and I welcome the steps that it has <place-holder colnum=\"21429\"/> taken to consult widely on this proposal. I hope that it will thoroughly consider the responses to its consultation&#8212;and the principles of this legislation&#8212;before reaching a final decision.</p><p>That said, the most worrying aspect for parents is the uncertainty of a school's future, along with the Chinese whispers that can sweep through communities as speculation and rumours run riot and further fuel the panic. If the legislation can stop any unnecessary anxiety and strain, it can only be welcomed.</p><p>The importance of rural schools to their local communities and economies has been discussed at length during the bill's passage and in the debate and I warmly welcome the strong protection that the legislation will provide for such schools and the communities that they service. Like other members, I benefited from early education in a small rural school&#8212;which is still going strong and achieving very good HMIE reports&#8212;and have first-hand experience of such schools' valuable contribution to rural Scotland and the country as a whole.</p><p>After all, we should note not only the good quality education that small rural schools can provide, but the added extras that often allow them to give an enhanced educational experience. Parents, local businesses and community members can play a hugely positive role in such schools and ensure that they are more than just bricks and mortar.</p><p>Some aspects of the bill are particularly welcome, such as the requirement for the consultation period to include at least 30 days of the school term, and the importance of consulting the pupils as part of the process. The right to be heard is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the bill ensures that that right will be recognised if a school is threatened with closure. Of course, we should always try to find appropriate and sympathetic ways, taking their age into account, of engaging with children and young people about the future of their school.</p><p>The bill is just one aspect of the Government's ambitions for Scotland's education system. When it is combined with the legislation to reduce the legal maximum class size in the early years, and make progress towards class sizes of 18 in primaries 1 to 3, as well as the introduction of free school meals for the early years, we can see the importance that the Government attaches to every young person in Scotland and that it wants to enable them to achieve the best possible start in life. Regardless of the political parties that we represent, I am sure that we all share that aspiration. Those ambitions are good for the individual child and for the country as a whole <place-holder colnum=\"21430\"/> because these young people are the leaders and innovators of tomorrow.</p><p>As has been said, there will sadly be times when a school closure is unavoidable, but I believe that the bill will help to reduce those occasions to a minimum. However, when it is necessary, I hope that the bill will help with the process of understanding and acceptance among the affected communities. Full transparency, genuine consultation, and a willingness to respond are the hallmarks that will help to ensure that any final decision is made in the best possible interests of the pupils whose education is at stake, and all those who interact with the school in any way.</p><p>I hope that the bill will attract support across the chamber when we come to decision time because, at its heart, it is about strengthening Scotland's education system and recognising that schools are more than just their buildings. They are often at the heart of the communities that they serve, and they deserve all the support that we can give them.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the stage 1 debate, I pointed out that it had not been long since the summer holidays.

One chap in Lesmahagow who realised that there was no football coaching in the area, and who had a coaching badge, decided to set up some coaching there&#8212;and 60 kids from Lesmahagow showed up one night to play football. They used a local hall and facilities, and it was a success.

People have shown up to take part and be taught how to play and how to display good sportsmanship. When parents take responsibility, they will travel far afield to enable their children to take part in sports.</p><p>An issue sprung up for me not long ago when a youngster approached me because she wanted to get access to skating rinks. Because she was not one of the top three skaters in the country, she could not access local authority initiatives that would have helped her to get access to rinks in the area. She could not break into the top three because the national governing body for skating is UK based. Youngsters in Scotland can have a difficult time trying to break through to UK level. Perhaps we should consider having a Scottish arm of governing bodies, so that youngsters can get the access to facilities that they need and become the best that they can be in their sport.<place-holder colnum=\"21307\"/></p><p>I know that all members, regardless of their political party, want to ensure that people in Scotland become a wee bit healthier and more active.

It is a welcome demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that people in Scotland have the opportunity to learn about and learn from our history and to understand the importance of preserving our heritage for future generations.</p><p>The built and historic environment summit, to which the motion refers, was an historic first: it was the first event of its kind to be organised by a devolved Scottish Government, but it is not likely to be the last. I declare an interest, as I am one of the people for whom the minister said that Bute hall holds many memories. Some are good, and others&#8212;sitting my final exams&#8212;are not so good, but it is testament to the foresight of previous generations and of the university authorities that the building has been so well developed and maintained that it can still be used for such wide and varied purposes.</p><p>Each of us, representing our constituencies and regions, has done well in the debate to highlight historic landmarks and locations that demonstrate what the motion calls \"the valuable resource\" that our heritage provides to our country's people and our economy. In the South of Scotland, we are lucky enough to have one of this country's five world heritage sites, in Robert Owen's model village of New Lanark, as Karen Gillon mentioned&#8212;I agree with a lot of what she said. We pay tribute to those who have been involved in decades of painstaking restoration work to make the village a source of pride for the wider area and an important tourist attraction, as well as a thriving, working, living community in its own right.<place-holder colnum=\"21073\"/></p><p>As a world heritage site, the village sums up many different aspects of the role of heritage, which the motion touches on. The buildings of New Lanark are there not simply to be looked at; they are there to be lived in, worked in, visited and explored. Inside the public spaces it is possible to learn about the ideals of Robert Owen and the co-operative movement, the emphasis on education for the young and the fair treatment of workers. Those ideas are as much a part of the heritage that New Lanark helps to protect and preserve as the buildings or factory workings.</p><p>It is fitting, during the year of homecoming, that New Lanark and the country's other world heritage sites were chosen to appear on Clydesdale Bank notes, along with important figures and trail-blazers from Scotland's past.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20370795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Historic Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Our history and heritage are hugely important not only because of what they tell us about the past, but because we can learn lessons to help build a better future.

I was fascinated recently to hear about a new project that is being developed at Edinburgh Napier University in conjunction with local authorities, to seek out and record examples of aspects of our society's history that are difficult to preserve in a traditional museum setting. The aim is ultimately to tie the records into the efforts of the United Nations to record and preserve global examples of intangible cultural heritage. Throughout the south of Scotland there are many important traditions, such as the Lanimer procession through the county town of Lanark, the annual whuppity scoorie event and the galas and marchings that take place in towns and villages. I hope that the Edinburgh Napier University project is a success and can be rolled out throughout Scotland, and that communities throughout the country participate enthusiastically, to ensure that local traditions are recorded and preserved.</p><p>Sometimes, buildings and places are an important link with the past. For example, in Carluke stands the best-preserved historic windmill in Scotland. It is perhaps no coincidence <place-holder colnum=\"21074\"/> that from the site of the Carluke high mill visitors can see modern windmills harnessing the power of the natural environment to provide clean, green energy for our homes and businesses. The high mill, sadly, remains at risk, and I commend the work of South Lanarkshire Council and a range of local interest groups to secure a future for the building. There must be the potential to link the wonderful old mill with the modern wind power that is generating electricity and jobs in the area.</p><p>I recently visited the remains of the Wilsontown ironworks near Forth in South Lanarkshire. The site is a link with the area's past, and children from the local primary school have been helping with preservation work. At that site and at the Carluke high mill there are problems to do with private ownership. Landlords' lack of sympathy for the cultural significance of what they own can be a barrier to people who want to preserve the built heritage, as Christine Grahame said. How such interests can be reconciled is worthy of further investigation, so that buildings do not fall into such disrepair that there is little point in saving them and they are lost for ever.</p><p>Monument watch is an innovative scheme to protect historic buildings that has worked in a number of European countries. I have written to the minister about that scheme, which is aimed at owners not just of heritage buildings but of tenements and small houses such as Ted Brocklebank talked about. The aim of the scheme is to survey properties and provide guidance on how to maintain them appropriately and engage with reputable contractors. When I discussed the scheme with people who are involved in it, they told me that the lack of Scotland-sourced stone and slate, due to a decrease in the number of quarries, is a problem. I am not saying that we should open up quarries, but we should consider how we maintain and renovate our historic buildings by sympathetically using materials, so that new stonework and slates match existing materials and weather in the same way.</p><p>It is worth mentioning the campaign to reduce VAT on repairs and maintenance, especially for listed and historic buildings. Because new buildings are exempt from VAT, it can be cheaper to demolish an old building and build afresh than to preserve and protect historic architecture. The European Union recently allowed national Governments to reduce VAT on repairs and maintenance to 5 per cent, but it will be for the UK Government to implement such a change until the Scottish Parliament regains the power over the financial controls that it needs.</p><p>The debate has allowed us to focus on the importance of Scotland's historic environment to our economy and society. Whether we are talking about things that we can see and touch, such as <place-holder colnum=\"21075\"/> places, buildings and monuments, or about things that we cannot see, such as ideas, arguments and memories, our heritage is undoubtedly the foundation on which future generations will build.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20370795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Historic Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree and I thank the member for saving it.

I commend the committee for its thorough report and the Scottish Government for its equally robust response. It is encouraging that there are many areas of agreement and that, in other areas, the Government is prepared to enter into dialogue and discussion with the committee.</p><p>Appropriate housing in rural areas&#8212;what the Government calls</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the right type and tenure in the right places\"&#8212;</p><p>is a key piece of the jigsaw that makes up life in rural communities across Scotland today. The committee and the Government agree that there is no doubt that many more houses need to be built in rural Scotland, if many communities are to be sustainable in the long term. Attractive and affordable homes are an important factor in encouraging people to settle in the countryside. That is why I welcome the steps that the Government is taking to increase housing supply and the support that it is providing to local authorities and registered social landlords. The fact that the Government's pilot programme to fund the construction of new rural homes for rent was so heavily oversubscribed is surely a vote of confidence in its methods. Although that means that some areas are necessarily left disappointed at this stage, I am pleased that the project is delivering &#163;5 million to provide 75 new properties in rural Scotland. As Elaine Murray said, some of those will be in the South of Scotland region.</p><p>I welcome the Government's commitment to ending the right to buy for new-build social housing, which will improve availability of housing stock in both urban and rural areas. The Government is also consulting on ending the right to buy for new tenants entering the social rented sector and on reforming pressured area status, which has the potential to make it easier for housing authorities to plan with confidence for the future. For the first time since devolution began, the Government is investing serious money in the construction of council houses. In the South of Scotland region, East Lothian, North Ayrshire and <place-holder colnum=\"20330\"/> South Lanarkshire are all set to benefit from that investment. In total, those areas will receive more than &#163;5 million, with the construction of 201 new houses.</p><p>There are a number of exciting and ambitious proposals in the South of Scotland region that could help to boost housing supply. Particularly interesting is the proposal to develop a brand new community in rural South Lanarkshire, Owenstown, named after Robert Owen, the founder of New Lanark. Now a world heritage site, as well as a thriving community in its own right where people continue to live and work, New Lanark was an innovative model village when it was first established in 1785. More than two centuries later, it is proposed that Owenstown, too, be developed on co-operative principles, as a model of a sustainable, eco-aware settlement for others to learn from and to imitate. I look forward to seeing how the proposals develop in the future and wish the Owenstown Co-operative Society well in developing its ideas.</p><p>A range of factors, beyond simply cash and numbers, influences the availability and quality of rural housing. The committee has dealt with a number of those in its report. I was particularly interested to read its recommendations on support for unplugged housing and facilitating connections to the national grid and mains supplies, where appropriate. I was interested in the points that were made on the issue; the committee was correct to highlight the need for it to be addressed. As Rob Gibson explained, for many people in the South of Scotland, lack of mains connections to electricity, gas, sewerage systems and, sometimes, even water supply is not an uncommon experience. A parliamentary question that I lodged back in May revealed that, after the Highlands and the north-east, the South of Scotland region has the highest number of domestic fuel oil users, each paying an average of &#163;900 in the years between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>The other day, answers to parliamentary questions lodged by my colleague Maureen Watt, the convener of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, revealed the staggeringly high cost of transmission charges for use of the national grid in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Such prices are hardly an incentive for companies that may wish to invest in and, therefore, attract jobs and housing demand to our rural areas.</p><p>The committee also dealt with the issue of renovation, maintenance and repair of rural homes. I join the Scottish Government in highlighting the need to support landlords who want to expand or maintain their range of properties. There is an on-going campaign for reductions in VAT for repair and maintenance charges. Like Alex Neil and Christine Grahame, I <place-holder colnum=\"20331\"/> hope that, until such time as the Parliament acquires the full fiscal powers that it needs to make a difference in those areas, the UK Government will listen to the committee, our ministers and all who support that campaign.</p><p>There is an important cultural aspect to preserving and developing rural buildings. That is recognised by a scheme called monument watch, whose work I would like briefly to highlight. Monument watch exists to ensure that old historic buildings are maintained and preserved properly by people being trained in traditional methods and traditional materials being used. That is important for the long-term stability of older buildings. If old country houses or hospitals can be transformed into multiple dwellings in a sensitive and appropriate manner, that is surely to be encouraged. The committee's report notes that, and highlights the importance of getting planning guidance right in the areas concerned.</p><p>I was interested to read that the committee believes that there is something of an inherent conservatism, and often a presumption against development on the part of rural planning authorities. That might come as a surprise to residents of Douglas in South Lanarkshire, who face the development of a new opencast quarry in their area, and to the residents of Biggar, Lamington and the surrounding area, who are trying to stop plans for a sand-and-gravel quarry at Overburns farm on the banks of the Clyde.</p><p>There is scepticism about the number of jobs that such developments will generate, and there is genuine concern about the impact not just on the environment and the landscape, but on health, the roads and other infrastructure in the area. If too many such developments put people off the idea of moving to the countryside, or make rural areas less attractive places to live, then all the good work that is being done to improve housing supply will come to very little.</p><p>The point about appropriate infrastructure is worth developing. A few weeks ago, I spoke in the state 1 debate on the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill, and I highlighted the importance of small rural schools to the communities that they serve, not simply through the education that they provide to the next generation, but as the focus for community events and facilities. If we are to increase and improve the housing supply in rural areas, we must ensure that the necessary amenities and facilities are there. Good-quality, attractive local schools make the possibility of setting up a home in the country much more manageable for young families. Therefore, I once again welcome the steps that the Government is taking to protect rural schools from inappropriate closures and mergers, and I encourage local authorities that are consulting on plans for <place-holder colnum=\"20332\"/> closures and mergers to bear in mind the wider impact that such decisions can have.</p><p>The future of rural housing is crucial to the future of our rural communities, and indeed to that of the country as a whole. I therefore commend the work of the committee and its recommendations&#8212;and the interesting debate that the committee's report has prompted.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20206413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Everyone agrees that today's debate has been a useful opportunity to examine in the round some of the challenges and possible options for the future that face rural housing in Scotland.

It takes four years to complete a bachelor of education course and one year to complete a postgraduate diploma in education course.

Although we may debate some specifics in the report's recommendations, I am sure that we all agree with the broad themes and overall aim of getting young people active.

In Scotland, it is rare to see women's fitba mentioned on the back pages of the papers that we all are so keen to read. We have to do more to promote role models and success stories to make sport more attractive to girls.</p><p>It is important that we get this right. Even if every school meets the two-hour target&#8212;which we all want&#8212;the impact will be small if children continue to particulate reluctantly in classes or feel that they are being forced into something they do not want to do. We can also take a positive outlook. Progress has been made towards the target of two hours of good quality physical education every week and we should welcome the fact that the target is included within the curriculum for excellence. Indeed, a number of local authorities have chosen to include it in their single outcome agreements with the Government. For example, North Ayrshire Council, in the South of Scotland region, aims to have 80 per cent of primary schools and 82 per cent of secondary schools providing two hours of PE per week by 2012, with an eventual target of 100 per cent. Under the terms of the historic concordat, it is right that each authority should decide how it wants work towards the target.</p><p>We should also remember that the target was inherited by the present Scottish Government and that the previous Administration accepted that it would take time to achieve. Important though the target is, Government policies will not, by themselves, bring about the culture shift that is needed to get Scotland active. If children are to learn at school how to get active, PE lessons will need to be easy and attractive; children should <place-holder colnum=\"19615\"/> want to put into practise outside of school the skills that they learn in school.</p><p>At the weekend, I spent time at the Biggar Rugby Football Club's annual mini-tournament, where teams from primary schools across Scotland came to compete against each other over the course of a day. What makes the tournament such a success is the crucial role that parents and guardians play in supporting the teams and helping the event to run smoothly. Such parental involvement is essential. Engagement of the whole family and activation of parental responsibility are very important in getting kids active. Jamie McGrigor may be interested to know that Biggar RFC has a successful programme in which it reaches out to the primary schools that feed the area's secondaries, including Biggar high school and Lanark grammar school. The programme helps to raise the profile of the game and to create teams of youngsters, some of whom may eventually go on into the first XV. I am pleased to say that Biggar RFC received funding from the Scottish Government's cashback for communities programme&#8212;funding that helped it to establish midnight rugby leagues for young people in some of the more deprived areas of the county. The investment of well-targeted cashback for communities funding shows what can be achieved with relatively modest amounts of money.</p><p>Burnbraes park in Biggar has been transformed in recent years thanks to the work of Janet Moxley and other community activists, who have won grants from a range of sources to maintain the park and to install new play equipment that is suitable for, and attractive to, different age groups. Other areas could learn from their work. I have passed on information about it to Lanark play parks action group. In a recent survey by the group, 60 per cent of respondents rated the condition of the town's play parks as \"very poor\".</p><p>Even the nicest play park can seem miserable on a cold, dark winter's evening, so we must ensure that Scotland has the facilities to enable people to take part in sport all year round. When preparing for this debate, I was reminded of a report that was published by my colleague Kenny MacAskill back in 2005, which showed the massive success of Norway in investing in all-weather pitches throughout the country. In recent months, we in Scotland have learned only too well the effects of Norway's investment in sport. Of course, the fundamental difference between Norway&#8212;which has a surplus of $70 billion and is not facing &#163;500 million-worth of cuts&#8212;and Scotland will not be lost on my SNP colleagues.</p><p>I was interested to see that the committee report mentions the lack of ice rinks. From my work in Cunninghame South, I know that parents are <place-holder colnum=\"19616\"/> concerned about the closure of the Magnum leisure centre in Irvine.</p><p>Ultimately, if we want Scotland to do well in sport at international level, we must get it right for youngsters at the earliest opportunity. For as long as I can remember, we have been scratching our heads about how to improve Scotland's international footballing performance, although I remember that years ago the question was why we had not made into the later rounds of the tournament, not why we had not got there in the first place.</p><p>The committee's report is useful as we move forward, outlines many of the challenges that we face and suggests a range of solutions.

No doubt many schoolchildren are writing up their reports and essays on what they did during their holidays. In Parliament, however, we have the opportunity to look at what we hope to achieve in the coming parliamentary year.</p><p>I am glad that among the various important topics that Parliament is discussing this week we have this chance to debate the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill at stage 1. We might disagree on some of the other business that is before us, but I hope that we can reach a consensus on the importance of consulting communities on decisions about the future of schools.</p><p>As far as the bill is concerned, a constructive spirit has certainly been evident in the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, of which I am a member. I, too, thank the wide range of organisations and individuals who gave evidence to the committee as we began our deliberations. In particular, the Scottish rural schools network's submissions were very helpful, and I congratulate the group on its efforts over many years to bring a grass-roots perspective to the debate on the future of our rural schools.</p><p>The bill sets out procedures that urban and rural local authorities should follow in considering the possible closure of schools in their areas. Bob Doris has already told us about the devastating impact of the poorly handled consultation and brutal closure programme that has affected so many of his constituents in Glasgow. However, as a representative of the largely rural South of <place-holder colnum=\"19128\"/> Scotland region, I want to highlight the impact that the bill will have on rural schools.</p><p>I should declare an interest, in that I am a product of a rural school system. My primary school, in Collace in Perthshire, was a very small school with a maximum roll of no more than 30 in the time that I was there. I am glad that the school is still there, playing an important role in the community. The community role of schools, both urban and rural, is often the most important role, but it is perhaps often the most overlooked aspect when a closure programme is implemented.</p><p>Rural schools are centres of education, and it is often very good education that produces well-rounded and high-achieving children. The schools prepare our young children for the future, while helping them to learn about and maintain respect for the environment and the communities of which they are part. The schools form part of the community, as meeting and function places and as social hubs for the areas that they serve. Therefore, when a rural community's school is threatened with closure, the concern is not just about the loss of an educational facility and the hassle and disruption of moving children to an alternative establishment; there is a real concern about the loss of a community hub, and the coffee mornings, after-school clubs, social events and meeting places that rural schools provides. Not just the teachers and pupils and their parents or guardians but the whole local population and the local economy are affected.</p><p>The issue is not a new one for the Parliament&#8212;we have discussed it many times&#8212;but the bill gives us the opportunity to do something to help protect schools and the communities that they serve. The bill will provide protection for schools by demanding that local authorities show the educational benefits of proposed changes and by ensuring that authorities go through a much more rigorous process than currently happens in some areas. That process will include the local community scrutinising the basis of decisions, which I hope will mean that if, at the end of the process, a school, sadly, has to close, the trauma and difficulties will be lessened as a result of the process of consultation and scrutiny.</p><p>One key aspect of the consultation proposals is the introduction of an adequate amount of time for consultation with the whole community, even those who do not have a child at the school. The consultation will have to take place over at least six weeks of term time, so it will not be possible to sneak it through during a holiday period, when people might be away or their attention might be elsewhere. That will help to mitigate the effect of whispers and rumours, which in themselves can be disruptive and unsettling for the community.<place-holder colnum=\"19129\"/></p><p>I have direct experience of that in the South of Scotland region. Last winter, word started spreading among schools in the upper ward area of Clydesdale that South Lanarkshire Council was considering closing or merging a number of small primary schools. I raised the issue in Parliament and held several special surgeries to listen to the concerns of parents, so that I could pass them on to the local authority. Because the council raised the issue only informally with some parent councils, many local people felt that they were not getting the full story about what the local authority had in mind. The council has now announced that it plans to undertake a full formal statutory consultation on options for Coulter and Lamington primary schools. As Malcolm Chisholm and others have said, I hope that, in doing so, the council will adhere to the best practice that is outlined in the bill, even if it is not yet law.</p><p>As the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee convener did, I welcome the proposal in the bill to ensure that children who would be affected by a closure are involved in the consultation process. I raised that issue in the committee. Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People is keen to raise awareness about the importance of consulting children in an age-appropriate manner. As the commissioner has pointed out, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines a child's right to be heard in all decisions that affect their life. The convention also includes a right to education and states that the child's best interests must be a primary consideration in decisions that affect them. I am glad that the cabinet secretary has given that evidence a sympathetic response in the bill.</p><p>We are at an early stage in the legislative process so, no doubt, further refinements will be made to the bill before it becomes law. However, given the debates that we have had and the evidence that we have heard in the committee, and given the broad welcome for the principles of the bill from across the chamber, I believe that we can reach a consensus decision at the end of the process. If we get the legislation right, in future, when children come back from their summer holidays, perhaps fewer of them will do so in a new or merged school, and more will be able to write about how their local school continues to benefit their education and the wider community that it serves.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173748", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has not been long since Scottish schools came back from their summer holidays, and now we, too, are back from our summer recess.

Often, they are literally and geographically central to an area and provide an economic and social focus for local activity. With the right support, our high streets and town centres can help Scotland to find its way to economic recovery. For that reason, I am grateful both to the members who have given their support to allow us to debate the motion tonight and to those members who have stayed behind to participate in the debate.</p><p>I am pleased to welcome a journalist from the local newspapers that serve the towns of Lanark, Carluke and Biggar in the South of Scotland region who is following our debate from the media gallery. I will focus on the South of Scotland region tonight, although the issues that I will raise are, of course, relevant to the country as a whole.</p><p>Since being elected to Parliament in 2007, I have made my home in Biggar. As anyone who has read some of my recent motions will know, Biggar is a town full of good news stories. Its High Street benefits from the presence of an award-winning chippie, an ice-cream shop and an Indian restaurant. The town's youth project, which is supported by the cashback for communities fund, provides healthy lunches and a safe environment for local schoolchildren. The town is thriving with many small independent shops, where folk can meet for a coffee and a chat. Biggar is a place that people are proud to be part of and to do their bit to maintain. Biggar demonstrates the positive contribution that town centres can make to our economy and society during the economic downturn.<place-holder colnum=\"18228\"/></p><p>Like many towns in rural South Lanarkshire, this very week Biggar is celebrating its annual gala, with traditional ridings and marches. The town's Fleming queen is a local primary school pupil by the name of Aileen Campbell&#8212;I wish her the best of luck. Tomorrow, the county town of Lanark celebrates its Lanimers festival. I look forward to joining the crowds on Lanark High Street and I hope that the sun shines for all. The Lanimers procession shows the High Street at its very best: full of young families cheering the lorries as they go past and demonstrating a civic pride that media commentators often think is lost nowadays.</p><p>Although I have no doubt that Lanimers provides a boost to the local economy, I want to work with colleagues to ensure that, for the other 364 days of the year, Lanark town centre gets the help and support that it needs. I understand that the community council and the local council-led town group have put aside their differences to examine how best they can apply to the Scottish Government's town centre regeneration fund. That is very much to be welcomed.</p><p>Indeed, the Scottish Government's town centre regeneration fund itself is to be welcomed. The fund has been welcomed by members from across the parties, as is evidenced by the many motions and parliamentary questions on the fund since it was announced. Members on all sides recognise the importance and significance of the Government's finding &#163;60 million to invest in our town centres just as the downturn begins seriously to take hold.</p><p>Despite the examples that I have given, there is no question but that many of our high streets are struggling. The most obvious example is the closure of Woolworths. It is not uncommon to see people shaking their heads sadly as they walk past a closed and forlorn-looking former branch of Woolworths on their high street. Lanark, Irvine, Ayr and Dumfries are just some of the towns in the South of Scotland that lost a Woolworths branch. Such closures can have a knock-on effect on the rest of the town centre, as smaller shops lose passing trade and boarded-up shopfronts deter visitors&#8212;as, perhaps, do the takeaways that are open at night but closed during the day.</p><p>Many constituents have contacted me about the perilous state of other town centres in the region, plenty of which never had a Woolworths. For example, Carluke has been hit by various closures in recent times and a number of its residents have expressed concern about the possibility of a new supermarket development outside the town's traditional central shopping area. Instead of being downbeat, however, plenty of local residents and businesses have positive ideas about how to develop the town centre. I have met representatives of the town's development trust <place-holder colnum=\"18229\"/> who are interested in finding ways of making the town centre regeneration fund work for Carluke. Local entrepreneurs have also enthusiastically outlined their plans for a children's activity centre that would entertain younger residents while their parents made the most of the town's shopping facilities.</p><p>Many similarly imaginative initiatives are taking place across the United Kingdom. For example, England's Local Government Association has called for artists and other community projects to be allowed to take over disused shop spaces. Even simple steps like that can help to brighten up an area and keep a town centre attractive during the downturn.</p><p>Another successful initiative from which we in Scotland can learn is the renaissance town movement. The movement places local empowerment at the heart of work to redesign and improve town centres. Towns in East Renfrewshire have been exploring the possibilities that are offered by that idea. In doing so, they have been supported by Architecture and Design Scotland, which is funded by the Scottish Government and is a partner in the initiative. A conference to discuss the ideas involved will be held on 25 June. I hope that many local authorities will participate and learn more about how those creative ideas can be applied to their areas. Such ideas help to give local residents and visitors a reason to spend time&#8212;and to enjoy doing so&#8212;in their local high streets and, importantly, to have a say in what their town looks like.</p><p>During this year of homecoming, we can also be creative about how we raise the profile and tourism value of our town centres. Recently, I was delighted to be contacted by the civic government of Irvine, California, which suggested that the city establish formal friendship city ties with its namesake in Ayrshire. I am actively pursuing the suggestion with the local council, as it is exactly the sort of shot in the arm from which many of our smaller towns and high streets could benefit.</p><p>Not every application to the town centre regeneration fund will be successful, but I believe that the Government's criteria are fair and that, if local stakeholders get their act together and co-operate properly, there is a level playing field and all to play for. One criterion is the definition of a town centre. For an area to be defined as a town centre, it must be described as such in the development plan. That means that some communities that have high streets and an array of different shops that face some of the challenges that I have outlined may miss out on part of the fund; Lesmahagow and Carnwath in South Lanarkshire are examples. I am working with the community councils in those places to see how they can be supported outside the regeneration <place-holder colnum=\"18230\"/> fund process. One important step would be for the local authority to reverse its decision to close Lesmahagow's much-loved Jubilee hall, which was opposed by more than 80 per cent of respondents to a recent survey of mine.</p><p>I am glad that the Parliament has this opportunity to raise awareness of both the challenges facing our high streets and the examples and initiatives from which others can learn. I am sure that other members will be able to offer interesting examples from their areas. I look forward to hearing the minister outline how the Scottish Government will continue to invest in and develop town centres in the South of Scotland and throughout the country.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16044585", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Town Centres"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Town centres are, almost by definition, at the very heart of many of Scotland's communities.

That is not necessarily a bad thing, as the Parliament was designed to ensure rigorous scrutiny and debate. In a Parliament of minorities, it is important that all sides of the argument are heard. However, now that we have reached the final stage of the bill's consideration, I hope that the Parliament can come to a consensus about the best way to ensure that some of Scotland's most vulnerable children and families get the support and advice that they need.</p><p>As a member of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee&#8212;the lead committee for scrutiny of the bill&#8212;I had a degree of sympathy with the policy direction of some of my committee colleagues. We might not all have agreed about how best to use the bill to travel in that direction, but it was clear to me that we had to be sure that its implementation would focus on ending the many problems that were raised in the evidence that we took, which was highly compelling.</p><p>As I said in my speech in the stage 1 debate&#8212;a debate that was notable for the degree of cross-party consensus&#8212;witnesses told us that the 2004 act does not always meet the needs of the parents, families and children who are in desperate need of support. I was aware from my constituency casework of the difficulties that parents faced when trying to do the best for their child with additional needs. Unfortunately, much of the evidence we heard did nothing other than to confirm what many of us have experienced in our casework. The committee heard about parents struggling to get the help that they needed, about cases dragging on for long periods, and about parents being pitted against teams of lawyers representing the council.<place-holder colnum=\"17642\"/></p><p>Those examples were of children lucky enough to have parents to care for them. We heard about the plight of looked-after children, Gypsy Traveller children and children with parents in the forces. It was clear that, despite the good intentions of the 2004 act, changes needed to be made.</p><p>In response, the Government was clear that it was committed to improving the quality of life and support available to those with additional support needs and those who care for them. It was also clear about the financial implications of the bill. Parents of children with additional support needs would be given extra protections when making placing requests, the tribunal system would be extended, and mediation and dispute resolution responsibilities would move to the authority responsible for education rather than the home authority.</p><p>Through the course of the committee's deliberations, the minister made it clear that he was committed to a suite of initiatives that would complement the bill. The Government wants to ensure that adequate levels of information are provided for parents and that looked-after children are not hindered or held back. The minister told us that he was actively working with the parents of disabled children to listen to their views and experiences at first hand and that he was committed to looking to help young carers, among a plethora of other measures. That clearly illustrated the SNP Administration's desire literally to get it right for every child.</p><p>We all have the opportunity now to ensure that we, too, do our best to get it right for every child and get the best possible piece of legislation, which is tailored to suit the needs of some of the most vulnerable families and children in Scotland. For that to be achieved, we need to have level heads and to put party politics to the side. It has been regretful that some members, in their contributions, have sought to change the tone of today's debate.</p><p>Now that we have come through the legislative process, the debates and the scrutiny, I am confident that Parliament can unite behind the bill. Once again, I express our commitment to providing the best possible support for Scotland's children with additional needs and their families.

My experience of visiting the States is that the version of English that we speak in Scotland often sounds like a completely different language to American lugs. Indeed, I am sure that many of the interns who work for members throughout the chamber will testify to that. However, they will also testify that, while it may sound impenetrable at first, the common denominator is not so much the way in which our common language is spoken, but what is said.</p><p>For many decades&#8212;indeed, for centuries&#8212;Scotland has been lucky enough to speak a <place-holder colnum=\"17532\"/> language of friendship with the peoples of North America, in both the US and Canada. That language of friendship extends to the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that are mentioned in the American declaration of independence and in the bills of rights that have been adopted in Canada over the years. As with many such declarations around the world, Scotland's declaration of Arbroath and its assertion of the right of the people to choose who governs them inspired those documents and charters.</p><p>For that reason, 6 April&#8212;the date on which, 689 years ago, the declaration of Arbroath was signed&#8212;was picked as the date for the first US tartan day in 1998. It is worth noting that several Canadian provinces marked tartan day before the idea was adopted in America, but that is just more evidence of the close relationships among our three countries and the benefits that come from working and learning together. Tartan day has grown and evolved to become what we now know as Scotland week. I believe that we can all be proud of the Parliament's achievements in building on that relationship and in strengthening the dialogue between our countries.</p><p>This year's Scotland week events built on the success of those of previous years, with official events taking place in 10 cities across the US and Canada. There was an amazing amount of formal and informal activity, both in North America and in Scotland, to make the most of the week. The Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution recorded his experiences&#8212;as Charlie Gordon noted&#8212;in an exciting blog, which includes some impressive pictures of his time representing our country.</p><p>As the minister said, Scotland week is just one very visible and high-profile manifestation of the relationship between Scotland and the US and Canada, but links of all kinds take place on a daily basis. Anyone in Scotland who traces their family tree back through a couple of generations is likely to find links to North America. We often refer to Americans and Canadians as our cousins, and many families in Scotland literally have cousins or relatives who live across the Atlantic. Scotland's online national archives are well-known to American genealogists, and the popularity of TV programmes such as \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" and of Radio Scotland's \"Digging Up Your Roots\" testify that the interest and curiosity work both ways. Indeed, roots often go deeper. In my family, my father tells the legend that some of our ancestors moved to Canada, where they invented the McIntosh Red apple. I am not sure whether that is true, but I hope that it is.</p><p>Having mentioned the success of television programmes on genealogy, I should point out that <place-holder colnum=\"17533\"/> TV entertainment is also shared by our countries. I happen to know that Scotland's own celebrity interior designers, Colin and Justin&#8212;whom I met at the Young Scot awards&#8212;are hugely popular in Canada. The culture minister will be delighted to know that they have offered their services to promote the year of homecoming in whatever way they can.</p><p>It is appropriate that today's debate on the success of Scotland week and on our relations with the US and Canada takes place during the year of homecoming. No one visiting Scotland this year, or with an affinity for Scotland, can fail to notice that we have opened wide our country's doors to welcome anyone and everyone who wishes to learn more. We want people to visit Scotland to enjoy what we have to offer the world, and we want to learn from them.</p><p>Such an initiative would be good and commendable at any time, but it is especially welcome now as the world experiences economic recession. Leisure travel and tourism often suffer early and seriously as disposable incomes diminish, so the year of homecoming will help to insulate Scotland by making an extra case for visiting this country at a time when people need to choose carefully where and when they wish to travel. The 200,000 potential visitors who are included in VisitScotland's loyalty programme receive monthly updates about homecoming, as do more than 2,400 diaspora organisations around the world.</p><p>Tourism from the US and Canada is worth hundreds of millions of pounds to Scotland's economy&#8212;almost &#163;1 million per day, or some 22 per cent of the total spend by overseas tourists in 2007. We do not yet know how those figures will be affected during the economic downturn, but it is clear that such tourists will continue to remain of huge importance.</p><p>I know that many of us in the Parliament have done our own bit to promote homecoming. I have written to municipal representatives in towns and cities&#8212;such as Biggar, Saskatchewan, and Irvine, California&#8212;that share place names with towns in the South of Scotland, which I represent.</p><p>I have also been involved in trying to make it a little easier for people from Scotland who wish to travel to the US, especially those who wish to make an impact that will benefit Scotland in the long run. As members will be aware, the US consulate in Edinburgh stopped issuing visas several years ago so the recent understandable tightening of visa restrictions has resulted in more and more people from Scotland finding that they must travel to London to acquire a visa. That can prove particularly expensive for bands that wish to travel on tour. Bands such as Mogwai and representatives of other bands have told me about <place-holder colnum=\"17534\"/> the high costs of travelling to London in order to play in the US. Such costs might have a negative impact on the cultural exchanges to which the minister referred, so I have had a meeting with the US consul, Lisa Vickers, to discuss the issue. Of course, independent countries such as Norway, Ireland and even Iceland have a full US embassy with all the associated visa and diplomatic services that are attached to such institutions.</p><p>There is much that Scotland, the US and Canada can learn from one another. Just as an aside, perhaps one important lesson is that deciding to have a Parliament whose purse strings are not controlled by London is no barrier to success in the modern world. However, even under devolution, Scotland continues to improve and develop its relationships with countries around the world. As today's debate has shown, our relationship with North America is among the most important and historic of them all.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14980757", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United States of America and Canada (Engagement)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is an old saying that England and America are two countries separated by a common language.

As the minister made clear, the Government has taken steps to reshape those models for the future to ensure that the right number of teachers are in place to give our children the education that they need and deserve.</p><p>There is also a responsibility on councils to spend the funding that they have been given through the concordat in a way that helps to reduce class sizes. February's statistics show that 18 out of 32 councils are making progress and that more than 75 per cent of pupils in the early years are in classes of fewer than 25 pupils, which is an improvement on the figure of 60 per cent in 2006, under the Lib-Lab Administration.</p><p>The motion, like most of the motions that the Liberal Democrats bring to the Parliament, could simply read that they are still shocked that the voters of Scotland had the bare-faced cheek not to vote them back into government in 2007.

People believed that the devolution settlement could deliver more than it already had and they were ready for the boundaries of the settlement to be pushed. That is what people voted for and that is what is being delivered.

The fact that there are lower waiting times is testament to the work that NHS staff do, and their achievement is even more incredible given the pressures that all of us place on them.</p><p>Reduced waiting times, more staff and the fact that people are being placed at the heart of the NHS suggest a healthy prognosis for the service's future. However, as with everything, improvements will always be necessary, and the Government will need to strike the correct balance on the challenges that lie ahead. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing made that point in her opening speech.</p><p>The most immediate and important benefit of shorter waiting times is for individual patients. Faster treatment helps them to return much more quickly to health and a full and productive life. That has a wider benefit for society as a whole, especially in these times of economic difficulty. If we can treat people quickly and enable them to return to work once they are ready to do so, that will have knock-on benefits for the economy and society.</p><p>We should also hope that less time spent on waiting lists will mean that there is less chance of people developing complications or of conditions deteriorating. In turn, that will mean that NHS resources are spent much more effectively and can benefit more people. We should see a virtuous circle, as waiting lists reduce and more people can be treated much more quickly. In that way, reducing waiting times helps us towards the badly needed goal of moving the NHS away from being a national sickness service to being a health service that promotes prevention and overall wellbeing, which is good not just for individual patients but for society as a whole.</p><p>Since the Government came to power in 2007, there has been a clear, strong commitment to improving the level of care that is provided to people in Scotland. As Alasdair Allan said, &#163;270 million of funding has been provided to NHS health boards between 2008 and 2011 to help them to meet pledges on waiting times. That funding has helped the NHS to take great strides in tackling waiting times in important medical areas such as cancer, drug use and mental health. Figures show that those requiring access to mental health services already receive treatment well within 18 weeks and that 70 per cent of those <place-holder colnum=\"16468\"/> who are offered an appointment for a drug use assessment are offered a date within 14 days. Those figures, and the abolition of availability status codes, which&#8212;as has been mentioned&#8212;kept people languishing for months or even years without treatment, demonstrate that the Government has provided the support that allows the NHS to operate in an even better way.</p><p>The task of creating an even better NHS will be made much easier if we ensure that the NHS has the appropriate number of staff. I was pleased to see that the total number of staff who are employed by NHS Scotland increased by 2.1 per cent in the previous year, that the number of clinical nurse specialists is at an all-time high&#8212;as has been mentioned&#8212;and that the number of allied health professionals has increased.</p><p>As we all strive for a healthier nation, it is imperative that we support the Government in its work to provide the health service with the capacity to treat patients within guaranteed timeframes and to provide wide-ranging services that meet the needs of the people of Scotland. Although the move to reduce further the cost of prescription charges, with a view to getting rid of them altogether by 2011, is not the sole topic of today's debate, it has caught the imagination of my constituents. The move, which will ensure that people are not financially penalised because they suffer ill health, is especially welcome during tough economic times. The approach reunites the NHS with its founding principles and makes the service fit the needs of the people. I hope that such moves, along with the reduction in hospital waiting times and increased staffing levels, will create a healthier and fairer Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14912951", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hospital Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My sister would not forgive me if I did not commend podiatrists on their work.

However, the situation with regard to the bill was different, I believe because we all want to help the Government to move the bill forward, as it is the right thing to do and will help families the length and breadth of the country. As Karen Whitefield and Liz Smith said, the issue is above party politics.</p><p>I do not believe that the bill will change the spirit of the 2004 act; rather, it will expand the provisions so that parents of children with additional needs get more rights and protection. During our scrutiny, many witnesses told us that the 2004 act does not always meet the needs of families who need help or support. We heard about parents being pitted against teams of lawyers representing the council, about parents having to struggle to get their child the help that they need, and about cases dragging on for long periods of time. It was vexing to hear about parents who already have to cope with the added life pressures that having a child with additional needs places on them also having to fight to get the help and care that they require. What we heard, unfortunately, confirmed what many members of the committee had encountered in the regions and constituencies that we represent.</p><p>Constituents of mine wanted me to attend meetings with the social work department because they were scunnered&#8212;scunnered of having to fight for their rights, scunnered of having to face more and more delays, and scunnered of not being given the support that they deserve. That is why I am pleased that the Government will try to rectify the legislation so that it adopts an approach that is more about common sense and less about the letter of the law.<place-holder colnum=\"15384\"/></p><p>The bill covers a lot of issues to do with additional support for learning and needs, so I will limit my comments to the areas that particularly interested me during the course of the committee's scrutiny.</p><p>One recurrent theme was parents' lack of awareness about their rights. Despite there being an obligation on local authorities to inform people of their rights, it appears that some local authorities are often not very forthcoming with relevant information. It was, therefore, pleasing to hear the minister's thoughts about amending the information provisions in the 2004 act and working with Jackie Stewart and Muriel Gray.</p><p>ISEA noted that about 75 per cent of parents are unaware of the fact that they can request mediation and that 80 per cent have no or poor information on their right to request dispute resolution. Furthermore, ISEA's questionnaire, which gave rise to those statistics, showed that parents do not know that when they attend a meeting, they can get papers, agendas and reports. It is regrettable that such knowledge is limited, as that no doubt severely curtails parents' abilities to play a full and informed part in discussions about their child.</p><p>Lorraine Dilworth told us during an evidence session that some councils are good at getting literature to parents and directing them to websites where information is easily accessible, but that one local authority's website was so poor that she could not find the name of the director of education on it. It is clear that the Government should do all that it can to improve the way in which parents are informed about their rights, to ensure that there is consistency throughout the country and that basic methods of sharing information are followed.</p><p>I hope that the Government will also consider the specific problems that are faced by Gypsy Traveller children, children whose parents are in the armed forces and looked-after children. The convener of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, Karen Whitefield, mentioned those groups. A particular issue for Gypsy Traveller children and the children of army personnel is that they experience interrupted learning and access. I can only assume that my point about the lack of parental knowledge of rights is exacerbated for those families, which have to deal with many more local authorities.</p><p>We should also be aware of looked-after children, who do not have a diligent parent fighting their corner. I welcome the moves that the Government has taken so far, such as the launch of the guide \"These Are Our Bairns: A guide for community planning partnerships on being a good corporate parent\", to ensure that looked-after children are not disadvantaged. I know that the <place-holder colnum=\"15385\"/> minister intends to continue to develop policies to ensure that that remains the case.</p><p>Local authorities told us that they are aware that they need to take responsibility for ensuring that all families get equal access. That is encouraging, and I hope that that approach will continue.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government is looking to reclaim the ethos of the 2004 act. We all have a duty to ensure that no child is failed by any system and that all children are treated fairly, regardless of their background, culture or need. It is clear to me that many parents feel let down, are bewildered by procedure and jargon, and do not get the information and support that they so desperately need. Of course, that is true in relation to children who have parents, but we must not forget looked-after children, who depend on us to get the legislation and rules absolutely right.</p><p>There is a wiIl throughout the Parliament to get things right for our children. I hope that we manage to work together to ensure that we do what is right for our bairns and for parents and young people. I want to be able to tell my constituents who have scars because the 2004 act let them down that no one intended it to be that way. I want to let them know that we are on their side and that we want to support and help them to make the situations in which they find themselves as stress free as possible. Not everyone will be entirely happy with the changes, but if we start to improve things now, the benefits will last forever.</p><p>I am happy to support the principles of the bill.

As a member of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, I have heard evidence to that effect from many witnesses.</p><p>It is not only ironic but worrying that, despite all the knowledge and research, one child in four in Scotland is born into poverty. The Children's Society has just published a report claiming that the lives of children throughout the United Kingdom may be more difficult than they ever were before.

The fact that major anti-poverty groups throughout Scotland support universal provision of free school meals shows how effective it will be in reducing poverty. I am glad that Parliament has continued to support the policy, despite the best efforts of some members to undermine it. Free healthy school meals will improve classroom concentration, reduce playground stigma, and can improve the health of each child who receives them.</p><p>In the same way, increased contact time with a teacher through smaller class sizes also helps to build confidence, knowledge and understanding among children, even at a young age. Like the free school meals policy, the class size policy prepares our youngsters for the future by instilling good behaviour and positive life skills.</p><p>Although those policies are vital, they are but the headlines of the framework: much else in the document stands to make a real difference to the younger generations. I particularly welcome the commitment to protect rural schools and safeguard the role that they can play in offering wider services to the local community. Having attended a rural school myself and now representing many areas that depend on such schools throughout the South of Scotland, I know how important local schools can be to our rural communities and how special an education in such an environment can be.</p><p>In a similar vein, the commitments to protect open space and plan for future needs are also welcome features of the document. South Lanarkshire Council, part of whose area is in my region, and North Lanarkshire Council have been chosen to host the international youth games in 2011, which will be an important staging post to the 2014 Commonwealth games. It is important that today's young children, who we hope will be <place-holder colnum=\"14837\"/> the athletes and medal winners of tomorrow, have access to the open space and fresh air that will allow them to train most effectively for the games. Many briefings have noted the importance of play and expressed pleasure that it is mentioned in the framework; indeed, the Scottish centre for intergenerational practice highlighted the need to provide something to do for more than just younger people. I think Robert Brown made that point earlier.</p><p>Outdoor education is hugely important, so I was interested to read in the excellent briefing from Children in Scotland about nature kindergarten initiatives, which are commonplace in Scandinavian countries. I know that there are one or two such initiatives in Scotland&#8212;Fiona Hyslop mentioned them&#8212;which are the kind of exciting and different approach to learning and child care that is often stifled in Scotland by the restrictions and constraints of our budgetary process and Parliament's limited powers.</p><p>I have said previously in the chamber that research from the Work Foundation estimates that, for every pound that is spent on helping families and young people at risk, up to &#163;17 of public expenditure can be saved. That kind of evidence, which some people might seek, demonstrates starkly the business case for investing in our youngsters. However, I believe that the debate is not only about financial worth. It is also a moral debate about the obligations that we as citizens have to those around us, especially the poorest and most vulnerable people.</p><p>The theme throughout the framework document&#8212;as, indeed, it has been throughout this debate&#8212;is that the early years is the key opportunity that society and the family have to influence the future life chances of children. A good childhood means a much greater likelihood of a healthy, active and positive future that contributes to the wellbeing of society as a whole. We in modern Scotland have far too often ignored, or forgotten, the basic steps and simple common sense that should extend opportunities to all our children. As I have said, it is a scandal and a disgrace that so many of our children are born into poverty. That not only shames our society, but actively damages it, because it will cost us more in the later lives of such children through the health service, the justice system and the need for other specialist interventions.</p><p>I believe that what the Government outlines in the framework maximises Parliament's powers to give our children the best possible start in life. However, Parliament is also in its early years and will continue to grow and develop to the point where it assumes all the powers of a normal independent Parliament.

They are an integral part of the landscape in many parts of the country. Those of us who have a personal, political or geographic rural hinterland might sometimes take the forests for granted. For those with a more urban perspective, there is always the possibility that more can be done to make sure that they have access to, and an appreciation of, our woodlands, which are so healthy for body and soul.</p><p>I know how popular with tourists from across the country and around the world some of the Forestry Commission land is in my South of Scotland region. Those forest spaces include smaller areas, such as the West Forth woodland near Lanark, which are popular with day-trippers from the cities because they are within easy reach of major population centres and provide important opportunities for outdoor recreation, fresh air and exercise.</p><p>The Forestry Commission plays an important role in managing those tracts of land; in total, it manages about one third of Scotland's woodland. The land that the commission controls is much <place-holder colnum=\"14492\"/> loved and well used. Therefore, it is a little bit disappointing that the motion on our forests is so negative, offering, as Roseanna Cunningham noted, little constructive vision for the future of Scotland's woodlands.</p><p>There is no doubt that Scotland's forests face a challenge. The previous Administration set a target of increasing forest cover by 25 per cent, and we all accept that an ambitious target is necessary if we are to protect our natural heritage and ensure that we get the full benefit of the carbon emission reductions that forests can provide. That is why the Scottish Government has embarked with an open mind on the consultation, which outlines the different options for managing and growing our forests in the years to come.</p><p>Members will be aware of newspaper reports of plans to sell off to private hands publicly owned forests for ever as a way of earning a quick buck for the Government. However, the Labour Government in London is consulting on proposals for private involvement and ownership of Forestry Commission land in England that are far more radical than those of the Scottish Government. The Labour Government is giving far fewer assurances and guarantees than our Minister for Environment has given about jobs, access and biodiversity, which are mentioned in Labour's motion.</p><p>These days, the default Opposition tactic seems to be to scaremonger rather than to promote any positive or constructive alternative approach. Labour claims that jobs are at risk under the Government's proposals. However, the effect of allowing the Forestry Commission Scotland to enter into joint ventures for the development of renewable energy projects could generate up to &#163;30 million per year by 2020, and leasing the land could generate up to &#163;200 million, which could be reinvested in woodland. We know that the Labour Government likes to pump cash into banks and businesses so that they can turn round and lay off staff, but here in Scotland, the investment proposed by the Scottish Government will safeguard and most likely generate jobs in the forestry industry.</p><p>There are practical jobs to be done on the land, as well as a range of important management and promotional functions, such as those that are carried out from Braidwood house in Lanarkshire. That work could also benefit from the investment.</p><p>I will address the leasing issue in a bit more detail because it is perhaps on that issue that the scaremongering of most Opposition politicians has been extreme. In 1998, the National Audit Office explicitly recommended leasing over privatisation, citing the success of the New Zealand model in guaranteeing public access under the new management arrangements. The Woodland Trust <place-holder colnum=\"14493\"/> Scotland has indicated its support for that option, subject to safeguards, and Scottish Environment LINK has not rejected it. I am pleased to hear that Mike Russell will continue to keep an open mind throughout the consultation, and I hope that he will continue to work with others as he seeks a way forward.</p><p>I am tempted to accuse the Labour Party of not being able to see the wood for the trees in its motion. Labour members claim to be outraged at consultation options that will safeguard jobs, access and biodiversity through continued public interest in land that is owned and operated by the Forestry Commission Scotland, but they are content to let colleagues in London consider outright privatisation of forests elsewhere in the United Kingdom. They seem to reject everything that the Government's consultation suggests, but offer nothing constructive as an alternative.</p><p>Scotland's forests are far too important to be turned into sticks for political parties to beat one another with. I support the Government's attempts to find sensible and viable ways in which to manage and grow our woodlands, and I encourage members of all parties to do likewise.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14648945", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forestry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland's forests are among our most precious natural resources.

As has been stated, Scotland has horrific obesity levels among children and young people, yet, incredibly, as the waistline of the country continues to expand, the acreage of our playing fields seems to contract. I do not think that the irony of that will be lost on anyone in the chamber tonight. We must do all that we can to protect playing fields so that Scotland's children and young people have somewhere to play and the freedom to run around, to play a game of fitba, or simply to enjoy being outside. They need the freedom to get muddy and scrape or graze the odd knee from time to time. If they do not, we will have a generation of people who are very risk averse.</p><p>My next suggestion is perhaps a little left field, for want of a better expression. If schools had more space, they might be able to cultivate gardens in which they could grow their own food. As a by-product, they could encourage children to eat what they have produced, to eat more healthily, to learn about the seasonality of food, and to improve their palate and their health&#8212;but that will not happen if playing fields continue to be sold off to raise a quick buck.</p><p>As well as expressing concern about the loss of playing fields due to planning decisions, we must be mindful of the quality of the playing fields that we seek to protect.

For example, the Executive Office of the President of the United States has had a Council of Economic Advisers attached to it since 1947; <place-holder colnum=\"14274\"/> indeed, in recent days, it has been rebooted with fresh faces and new thinking to take forward the changes in American policy that we have all been hoping for. In 1997, Ireland established a National Competitiveness Council to advise on how to draw together a diverse range of sectors and experience to build the country's economy. Even Gordon Brown has his own&#8212;albeit not wholly independent&#8212;national economic council, which comes complete with Peter Mandelson.</p><p>The Scottish Government has not set up the council to be a talking shop; it is offering the Government real, practical and concrete advice, and the Government is responding positively to its views. The council's report is perhaps even more important in an era of economic uncertainty that is very different from the situation when it was established in May 2007. Unfortunately, we are now hearing regularly of bankruptcies and job losses. In the South of Scotland region that I represent, the haulage industry is just one area that is beginning to feel the pinch&#8212;last week, for example, the Eddie Stobart Group announced the closure of its Larkhall depot. This will be a worrying time for all the staff at the site and their families and I am sure that, through PACE, the Scottish Government will do it all it can to help them and the other businesses and industries throughout Scotland that are trying their best to survive.</p><p>I am particularly pleased by the commitment in the Government's economic recovery programme to strengthen not only PACE, as Fiona Hyslop made clear in her opening remarks, but links between Skills Development Scotland and Jobcentre Plus</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to minimise the time for which people who are affected by redundancy are out of work\".</p><p>The Government is right to highlight its recovery programme at the beginning of its response to the council's report, because the strategy will help to ensure that Scotland meets the present economic challenges as best it can and emerges stronger as a result. That is one of the themes of the council's recommendations, and I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted 18 of the 22 recommendations in full and the remaining four in part.</p><p>The wide-ranging recommendations join up the different sectors and factors that affect&#8212;and are, in turn, affected by&#8212;our economy. As a member of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, I was particularly interested in the council's recommendations on education and skills. Perhaps controversially, the report recommends that the Government consider introducing a two-tier approach to the standard four-year honours course. The Government is right to accept the recommendation containing that <place-holder colnum=\"14275\"/> proposal only in part, because it is important that we respect our higher education institutions' autonomy in this area. Any significant changes to the structure of degree courses in Scotland will need the academic community's full support.</p><p>The Scottish Government has also accepted only in part the recommendation that a range of stakeholders, including businesses and students, contribute to the funding of higher education. Access to education based on the ability to learn, not on the ability to pay, has been a long-cherished principle in Scotland, and its having re-established free education with the abolition of the graduate endowment, I can well understand the Government's reluctance to accept that recommendation.</p><p>The recommendations that the Government has accepted only in part are a small minority of the overall report, which, on the whole, is ambitious for Scotland's economy and confident about the steps that we can take to face economic difficulties.</p><p>It is not surprising that, in its response, the Government accepts all the recommendations regarding growing the powers of the Parliament and the potential difference that greater fiscal autonomy could make to the country. I welcome the growing strength of feeling in Scotland in favour of greater financial powers for the Parliament and the Government. Despite what some members have said, many people now view the fact that the Parliament does not possess the borrowing powers that our local authorities, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Network Rail take for granted as, to use Keith Brown's words, highly anomalous.</p><p>Like the Scottish Government, I want Scotland to have all the powers of a normal independent country. Despite all the challenges that it faces, we have not heard that Ireland is seeking to return to the bosom of London to cure its economic woes; nor has Norway declared itself insolvent, despite some people's predictions.</p><p>The Government has accepted many other welcome recommendations. I particularly look forward to seeing how the advice on developing the planning system is taken forward. One of the issues that constituents raise with me most regularly is the difficulty that they face getting through the planning process. Any steps that the Government can take to make the process streamlined, transparent, consistent and focused on good-quality outcomes will be warmly welcomed.</p><p>The fact that the Government has been able to respond so positively to the report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers demonstrates the wider ambition that it has to help Scotland flourish. Nowhere is immune to the global economic <place-holder colnum=\"14276\"/> downturn but, with a Government that is prepared to listen to the sound advice of its economic advisers, Scotland can prove more resilient than it might do otherwise.</p><p>I congratulate the Government on its positive response to the report, and I am confident that future reports will continue to help strengthen and develop Scotland's economy, no matter the global circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621968", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill: Stage 3: \"First Annual Report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers: December 2008\" (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "One of the Scottish Government's first acts after the May 2007 elections was to establish the Council of Economic Advisers in recognition of the importance of developing and growing Scotland's economy in meeting the Government's other targets, including eliminating poverty, respecting the environment and building the best possible future for our children.

That is unfortunate because, on the whole, people find drink driving to be unacceptable and contemptible.</p><p>As Alasdair Allan said, attitudes have thankfully come a long way over the past few decades. Before I was born, my mother and father were involved in a car accident in which a drunk driver ploughed into them. My mum told me that she was very badly injured and had to spend months in callipers&#8212;she still has the scars from the crash. There was no talk of compensation back then and no real moral outrage, because it was regarded as being just one of those things. Thankfully, things would be very different if such an incident happened now.</p><p>However, according to the police and others, the cavalier attitude to chancing it persists, so we must do all that we can to stop it.

There is a view that a pint is okay, but the stark reality&#8212;as Margaret Smith noted&#8212;is that, depending on a number of factors including a person's size, weight, sex and tolerance of alcohol, the effects vary tremendously between individuals.</p><p>Scottish Government figures show that, in 2005, 30 people died and 990 were injured on Scotland's roads as a result of drink driving. Despite a fall in the number of drink-driving accidents and casualties over the past 10 years, the numbers are still far too high and represent many innocent families who have had their lives needlessly affected by drink driving.</p><p>Even more worryingly, senior Scottish police officers have expressed concern that the prevalence of young drivers and people in rural communities who drink and drive is still too high.

Throughout Europe, the incidence of drink-driving accidents has been reduced by having a 50mg limit in place, so it is a sensible way to move forward. We need to send out a clear message to help people to stop drink driving.</p><p>The BMA briefing said that a level of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would bring about a significant deterioration in someone's driving ability, which would be manifested in slower driver reaction times, increased stopping distances, <place-holder colnum=\"13549\"/> reduced field of vision and&#8212;in the unfortunate case of many young drivers&#8212;overconfidence.</p><p>Additional methods will be necessary to curtail the scourge of drink driving. Many of the briefings that members have received for the debate call for stricter enforcement to deter drink drivers, including the implementation of random breath testing, which is advocated by the BMA and was mentioned today by Dave Thompson. Research in Australia found that highly visible random testing can have a sustained significant effect in reducing levels of drink driving, alcohol-related road traffic crashes and associated injuries and fatalities. RBT is currently common practice in all other nations throughout the EU with the exception of Denmark. However, that is not the only difference between the UK and Europe. Tackling drink driving has been handled very differently on the continent, with 23 out of the EU's 27 member states having a legal alcohol limit set at 50g per 100ml of blood. Only the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta have an 80mg limit.</p><p>The BMA noted that Britain has lost its place at the top of the EU road safety league, and that the Netherlands and Sweden now have lower road death rates and have been more successful in reducing drink-driving crashes. It might come as no surprise that the limits in those two countries are 50mg and 20mg respectively. The European Commission recommends that member states should reduce the legal drink-driving limit to 50mg, and it has encouraged member states to increase RBT, particularly in trouble spots. In fact, I understand that one of the main reasons why the Commission did not propose Europe-wide legislation on the matter was that it was taken for granted that member states would implement measures at their level.</p><p>I welcome the work that the Scottish Government and my colleague Dave Thompson are doing to lobby the UK Government, as well as moves to tackle drink driving in the early morning, as folk who have drunk the night before forget the lingering impact of alcohol in their system. I raise a wee concern about the availability of personal breathalysers, often in the form of key-rings, as I am not sure that that sends out a good message. I understand that there is no regulation of the effectiveness of those devices, which can be bought freely over the counter.</p><p>Other members have stated that, in its road safety compliance consultation document, the UK Government does not address directly the current drink-driving limit or RBT. That would have been a good opportunity to rethink the limit and to recognise that Europe is doing things differently.

As Linda Fabiani, Ken Macintosh and other members have said, it is unfortunate that it has become timelier&#8212;it is timely not only because Ofcom's consultation is drawing to a close but as a result of yesterday's announcements on restructuring and redundancies at the <em>Herald</em> newspaper group and BBC Scotland. As members have said, those announcements will be a body blow to the broadcast and print media in Scotland, and they must be disappointing news to staff as the Christmas holidays approach.</p><p>The recent Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television report, which Stuart McMillan mentioned, shows that there were \"deeply disturbing\" falls in independent network television production in Scotland in 2007. According to PACT, only two hours of independent drama produced in Scotland were broadcast to the whole of the UK during 2007. In comparison, across all the major broadcasters, 10,661 hours of programmes were made in London. On top of the situation being \"deeply disturbing\", it is dismal, disappointing and desperately London-centric.</p><p>It is against that backdrop that we must debate our aspirations for Scottish broadcasting, what we see as the broadcasting future in Scotland and how we can protect what exists at the moment and ensure that Scotland does not fall further behind. That is a pity, given that there was so much excitement about the publication of the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"13046\"/> Broadcasting Commission's report and so much enthusiasm about what new technologies and new, fresh ideas could bring to the important Scottish broadcasting industry.</p><p>I do not need to remind members that broadcasting has enormous socioeconomic and cultural importance and that it is an important tool that informs, teaches and allows us to develop our imaginations. The programmes that we watch often bind society together through providing shared cultural experiences that enrich our lives. Unfortunately, however, Scotland has been and continues to be almost marginalised from having an appropriate level of coverage.</p><p>The Scottish Broadcasting Commission noted that the BBC remains the cornerstone of public sector broadcasting but found in the evidence that it gathered that there was a perceived lack of ambition in BBC Scotland productions&#8212;although that cannot necessarily be said of the First Minister's Reverend I M Jolly performance during \"Children in Need\". The commission also heard that BBC Scotland's output did not accurately reflect the energy and vitality of modern Scottish life, and that its cultural and creative content was limited.</p><p>I do not want to sound overly negative about BBC Scotland, because I thoroughly enjoy much of what it puts out&#8212;most notably \"A History of Scotland\", which has already been mentioned; I and, I am sure, others find it compelling viewing. However, despite the BBC being the backbone of public service broadcasting, Ofcom's review noted that people want broadcasting to continue beyond it. It would be great if that could be done via STV, but I would be keen to explore options outwith Ofcom's proposals, which seek to find ways to move forward into the digital era and are being regarded as the only game in town.</p><p>The commission suggested that there should be a new Scottish network to provide Scottish viewers with more high-quality Scottish programming, to create opportunities to be innovative with content and to nurture talent on and off screen, among other things. It is essential that we achieve those aims if we want programming to reflect our communities properly, whether in news output, sporting events, dramas or documentaries.</p><p>Whether or not members agree with the proposals for a Scottish network, it is clear that we must work together to get a broadcasting industry that is fit for purpose in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The industry should realise the potential of a country whose brightest and best talents often move to London to pursue their careers. We need an industry that is capable of producing programmes that do not have to be twee or kilted to tick the \"Scottish made\" box and that can make programmes and documentaries that are not <place-holder colnum=\"13047\"/> always about Scotland but which can be about absolutely anything, with no limit to what is achievable.</p><p>If Scotland aspires to having a broadcasting industry that is fit for purpose, it needs to aspire to being a normal independent country that is fully in control of its broadcasting and which can respond to and reflect the unique needs and wants of the people who live here. Countless other small nations do that. With the digital age upon us, it is time for Scotland to switch on to its potential and get tuned in.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14289814", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadcasting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members have mentioned the timeliness of today's debate.

At this time in two years, I hope that the treaty of union will also be drawing to a close, given the First Minister's stated ambition of holding an independence referendum around St Andrew's day in 2010.</p><p>St Andrew's day has always had significance in Scotland. I expect that historic significance to grow over the next few years. Today's debate takes place not only on St Andrew's day but, coincidentally, on American thanksgiving day. Many parallels can be drawn between the two celebrations: both are distinctive traditions that have evolved over time and become associated internationally with the countries in which they originated.</p><p>Of course, as others have said, Scotland does not have a monopoly on St Andrew. In addition to the countries on David Whitton's list, Russia and Greece have St Andrew as their patron&#8212;as do fishermen, singers and rope-makers&#8212;but we have a claim not only to his patronage but to his relics, which were in the town of St Andrews, as Ted Brocklebank's amendment reminds us.</p><p>St Andrew and the flag of St Andrew have become key symbols of Scotland and what it stands for. Again, we can draw on the American thanksgiving day tradition of celebrating cultural diversity and the common humanity that draws us together. I am proud that Scotland's egalitarian traditions find expression in such days of national celebration. Just as the American holiday season begins with thanksgiving and ends with new year, so Scotland's winter festival is increasingly seen as starting with St Andrew's day and ending with Burns night. Those are two hinges on which so much that Scotland has to offer the wider world can hang.</p><p>I have already touched on one way that that can happen with the 2009 year of homecoming. The Scottish Government initiative promotes a welcoming image of modern, inclusive Scotland and invites everyone who has an affinity with our country to come home, whether they see Scotland as their ancestral home or a spiritual home, and share in the enjoyment of our culture, heritage and environment.</p><p>Of course, the year of homecoming and our national days&#8212;St Andrew's day and Burns night, with hogmanay resting in between&#8212;are not just <place-holder colnum=\"12909\"/> about the feel-good factor. There is a clear economic and social benefit to making the most of those opportunities. Global marketing and the unique series of events that are associated with the year of homecoming will significantly boost our tourism industry during these tough economic times.</p><p>Interestingly, Wendy Alexander's paper \"Change is what we do\" referred to people aspiring to two foreign holidays a year, as well as a second home and car ownership. Maybe that is how Labour thinks that people will spend their way out of recession, but perhaps the option of holidaying at home will become more attractive and economically beneficial to Scotland. I hope that the year of homecoming will inspire many people in Scotland to stay at home for their holiday next year and take part in the range of special events that are planned, or just enjoy what our multiform and vast Scotland has to offer. As the minister said, the pupils of Larkhall academy are doing their bit to promote a positive image of Scotland with their unite Scotland campaign.</p><p>The south of Scotland will have plenty to offer participants in the year of homecoming. Throughout Ayrshire and the Borders, celebration of Burns, golf and traditions such as the common ridings are being promoted not just to the usual suspects but to audiences in Scotland and around the world who might not be so familiar with those aspects of our heritage. In addition, I have spoken in the chamber several times about the importance of world heritage sites, such as New Lanark, to the year of homecoming as a focus for activity and for attracting visitors. St Andrew's day, along with Burns night, acts as a hinge for many of the opportunities that we have for promoting Scotland and celebrating our diverse culture and heritage.</p><p>Today's debate also gives us the opportunity to think about how we can build on the potential of our national day. I welcome the Scottish Government's moves to formalise the day as a holiday for its staff and to encourage more employers throughout the country to offer the day as a holiday. This year, St Andrew's day falls on a Sunday, which offers families and workers an opportunity to have an extra long weekend. I hope that many people will be able to take advantage of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, as Christine Grahame said, the Parliament still does not have the power to do something as simple as institute St Andrew's day as a full public holiday to which everyone has legal entitlement. Scotland already has a different public holiday schedule from the rest of the UK, despite UK ministers' attempts earlier this year to promote a Britishness day on a public holiday that does not exist in Scotland. We also still have the lowest number of public holidays in Europe. That is one <place-holder colnum=\"12910\"/> way in which St Andrew's day differs from American thanksgiving: our friends in the United States of America are enjoying a well-earned rest and a day off work. Even the stock exchange is closed. However, here in Scotland, unionist politicians stand in the way of giving the Parliament the power to give our population an extra holiday as the winter closes in.</p><p>Indeed, despite some folk proclaiming to be democrats, they still refuse to accept the democratic right of the people to choose independence as a route for Scotland. That is why I hope that, come St Andrew's day 2010, the people of Scotland will be in a position to reclaim that power for their Government, and all the powers that a normal, independent country enjoys. Greenland has just taken a step closer to independence from Denmark in a democratic referendum. Even in these tough economic times, with a population of just 57,000, the people of Greenland are confident in their ability to play a bigger role on the world stage and manage their own affairs more directly.</p><p>St Andrew's day is already a popular chance to celebrate all that Scotland has to offer. The Government's work to develop its potential is commendable and will make a lasting difference to the way in which we mark the day in future. St Andrew's day is one of the hinges on which Scotland's cultural calendar rests. I hope that all members in the chamber and people throughout Scotland have the chance to take a bit of a rest this weekend, and I wish them all a very happy St Andrew's day.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271646", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At this time next year, the year of homecoming will be drawing to its official close, on St Andrew's day 2009.

I was particularly interested in the council's work on demography&#8212;the Scottish Government is taking a lead in that area. Societies across western Europe are facing major challenges as the population ages and patterns of migration change. Such trends begin to affect every aspect of public policy, from education provision to pensions and social security.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the council is examining the effects of our changing demographics and that it is able to pool the experience of its member countries so that we can learn from one other. I am always impressed by the way in which Ireland has inspired many of its citizens, who left the country many years ago for one reason or another, to return and make hugely valuable contributions to its economy and society. I commend the Scottish Government's efforts to reactivate our own diaspora, and I look forward to the role that the year of homecoming will play next year.</p><p>The council has begun to consider the common challenges and opportunities that are presented by the changing demand for and supply of energy. Again, the Scottish Government has sought to lead on that for the council. Contrary to what others think, I believe that that is very appropriate, given our huge contribution to traditional fossil fuel industries and to emerging renewable energy markets, across not just the UK and Ireland but Europe.</p><p>I hope that the Government and the council will work closely together on finding ways to improve the ability of small-scale renewable energy producers to connect to the national grid. Many exciting opportunities and projects in the South of Scotland area that I represent and across the country fall at the first hurdle because the cost of connection is so high at present.</p><p>The recent summit discussed the global financial situation, which has changed rapidly even in the <place-holder colnum=\"11789\"/> few weeks since the summit was held. As the First Minister pointed out recently, Ireland, one of the council's members, has an economy that is 40 per cent better off than that of the UK.

My sister, who is a member of a young farmers club in Dumfries, told me that folk in that group were in tears, as the news brought back memories of the previous time that the area suffered an outbreak of foot-and-mouth. As Jim Hume indicated in his personal account of what happened in 2001, the images of the mass cull of millions of sheep and cattle in that year remain fresh in the memory of people in the South of Scotland.</p><p>If news of the outbreak were not bad enough, reports of what the UK Government had said were a sucker punch too far. As Alasdair Allan indicated, there was utter disbelief at the actions of Hilary Benn, who said in one breath that the UK Government would help Scotland's farmers but in the next that it would help only the English livestock sector. Not only were Scotland's farmers penalised for an outbreak hundreds of miles away, through no fault of their own, but they had to hear that they were being abandoned by the UK Government.</p><p>It is clear from the Scudamore report that such mishandling and lack of communication cannot be replicated and that better communications and relationships need to be established between the two Governments. I know that the Scottish Government did everything that it could to force Westminster's hand at this awful time for rural Scotland, but co-operation needs to be two way. The UK Government needs to work constructively with the sector here and to realise the error of what happened last year. I hope that the Scudamore report will serve to focus the mind.</p><p>One Clydesdale farmer told me how he was affected by the foot-and-mouth scares, how his income fell, how his day-to-day business was interrupted, and how he could not get lambs to the butcher or to other grazings. He also said that, in light of the messages that he heard from London, it was a bizarre anomaly that the Scottish Government has the policy tools to deal with foot-and-mouth disease but not the direct funding. It is clear from what he and others have said that what happened last year cannot be replicated. That is why I am pleased that the report was produced.</p><p>The report praises the Scottish Government for the way in which it handled the foot-and-mouth outbreak and notes that it acted in the best interests of the Scottish industry to ensure a return to normal conditions as quickly as possible. It is important that it also acknowledges the work of the stakeholders who attended meetings at short notice and contributed their expert knowledge and advice in working with the Government to ensure a speedy recovery from the crisis.<place-holder colnum=\"11504\"/></p><p>Although the report praises the Scottish Government, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. Instead, we must ensure that the recommendations and thoughts that are included in it are considered and acted on in a sensible and appropriate manner. I am pleased that there will be a consultation in November.</p><p>The co-operation of the UK Government will be needed to implement the recommendations fully. I hope that that Government takes heed of what the report says and considers devolving budgets for service delivery to the Scottish Government so that it is responsible for the delivery of disease control. I think that farmers want that and that the NFUS backs it.</p><p>A fortnight ago, many of us spoke passionately in the hill farming debate about how we must protect rural Scotland and how different and special our rural economy is. Areas that cover 85 per cent of Scotland are recognised as less favoured areas; that means that there cannot be a homogeneous, one-size-fits-all policy operating centrally. Ideas about isolating Scotland from certain disease controls in order to protect itself and its export markets must be explored.</p><p>Given the ever-increasing amounts of international exports, it is clear that Scotland will not always be free of disease in the future. Therefore, we need to be clear about who will support our farmers and who will compensate them if another disaster occurs. Our Government must work with the UK Government and the EU&#8212;that is important&#8212;so that our distinctly Scottish voice is heard loud and clear. My preference is for the Scottish Government to have full control; it should look after Scotland's rural communities and agricultural interests. Indeed, it may come as no surprise that I can think of a simple way to end the blurring of lines that separate which Government is responsible for which area of disease control policy: one layer of Government could be taken out of the equation. Until that happens, I hope that the Calman commission will, as Sarah Boyack suggested, look closely at the Scudamore report and realise the real and tangible merits of devolving more powers to the Scottish Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate has been a useful opportunity to thrash out what happened during last year's foot-and-mouth outbreak and to examine ways of ensuring that, if another outbreak occurs, measures are in place to deal with it swiftly.

Unfortunately, my father might be one of the statistics that the RSE and NFUS highlighted, as he retreated from the hills and gave up the farm. Sadly, the farmhouse is now a holiday home because, realistically, that is more profitable than my family holding the tenancy, and the fields have been amalgamated and enlarged, meaning that the traditional, small, family hill farm is no more. No doubt a similar story can be told elsewhere in <place-holder colnum=\"10956\"/> the country. That is a pity given that we all agree that sustaining smaller, family hill farms is vital.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary and others said, today's debate is timely. It happens against the backdrop of the SAC and RSE reports and during Scottish food fortnight, which celebrates Scotland's food. Many in the chamber will have enjoyed sampling last night the fruits of Scotland's larder and the delicacies that came straight from the farm gate to the plate. Such food is internationally renowned. One stall described its produce as \"well-hung and tender\"; it was also nutritious, fresh, healthy, local food.</p><p>As Roseanna Cunningham said, we should not forget that farmers are essentially food producers&#8212;they want to produce food and make a decent and fair living. The Government's motion recognises the importance of Scottish hill livestock farmers to food production but, as others recognised, that vocation is under threat because of drastically falling prices. The Blackface Sheep Breeders Association said recently that falling prices are a serious concern for the industry and argued that the hill sheep sector has not made a reasonable profit for at least 12 years. Indeed, the association claims that the industry has suffered losses and that the impact of the falling price of lamb is exacerbated by the rising cost of fuel and feed. That will mean that more sheep will come off the hill, with dire repercussions for the rest of rural Scotland.</p><p>It is all very well for us to extol the virtues of Scotland's larder and ask, \"Wha's like us?\" when it comes to the quality of our food. No one in the chamber would dare to criticise the quality of Scotland's produce. We need to be aware, however, that those who produce what we cook in our kitchens deserve to make a living. No one can afford to work at a loss. There are serious reports about the problems that banks and insurers are facing during the credit crunch, but farmers have been affected by the dreadful, wet summer that we have just had. Lambs are lighter and the cost of feed has further increased. As Dan Buglass put it, cash flow is well and truly \"sunk in the mud\".</p><p>What will happen if Scotland's hill farmers retreat? The NFUS's briefing recognised that it is not just the hill farmers who would be affected by such a retreat. They are part of a complex web that helps to support abattoirs&#8212;wherever they are left&#8212;butchers, agricultural merchants, marts and farmers markets. We found it delightful to have a farmers market in the Parliament last night; just think how sad it would be if it and others like it were not to continue. A retreat from the hills would also affect tourism. The NFUS noted that tourism and recreational activity is highly dependent on open and grazed farming systems. If no animals graze, the systems will deteriorate and become <place-holder colnum=\"10957\"/> less attractive to any visitor. Moreover, seeing sheep on the hills and watching new lambs is a big attraction that will also be lost.</p><p>The debate cannot be allowed to descend into doom and gloom. We have to try to solve the imminent problems faced by Scotland's hill farmers. It will not be easy. I spoke to a farmer at the farmers market last night who told me that the problems are complex and will not easily be fixed. The answer should not be about political point scoring, but requires much consideration. I have to admit that, given the UK Government's inadequacy in serving Scotland's hill farmers, it is hard not to be political. Nevertheless, we have to work together to ensure that solutions are found.</p><p>Becoming more market orientated and diversifying have been offered as part of a list of solutions that have worked to increase the profitability and viability of some farms. A woman I spoke to last night told me that her farm, albeit not a hill farm, had to diversify by packaging its beef smartly and making its product unique. They attracted London restaurants and those farmers are experiencing something of a renaissance. Furthermore, a farmer in the south of Scotland who produces Lanark and Dunsyre blue cheeses began production because his hill farm was becoming less and less profitable. Diversification cannot be the only answer, however, and that is why I am glad that the SNP Government has stood by farming communities since its election in 2007 and has a genuine understanding of the issues affecting hill farmers. It would be easy to think that I was saying that as a patsy, but I heard it at nearly every agricultural show that I went to this summer.</p><p>Jim McLaren wrote in <em>The Scotsman,</em> in response to McCrone's findings, that all those who have an interest in farming should be pulled together to find a solution and to take action. He also said that a clear signal must be sent to those who eke out a living in remote parts that active livestock farming is wanted and valued. It is clear from the Government's motion that hill farming is valued. Richard Lochhead said that the Government wants to work in partnership with all interested parties as part of its LFASS consultation. I hope that that marks the start of genuine action. I have faith that the cabinet secretary will consider issues raised as part of the consultation and I hope that hill farming can become a more sustainable industry with people working the land no longer simply eking out a living, but instead being rewarded fairly for the crucial part that they play in our rural communities.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14004885", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Less Favoured Areas"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many in the chamber, such as John Scott and my South of Scotland colleague Jim Hume, I have an interest in agriculture: my grandfather was a shepherd and my father was a tenant hill farmer.

As others have said, the education of our children is of fundamental importance. As parliamentarians, we owe it to them to ensure that the system works and that each child has a good-quality learning experience and is taught by motivated and accomplished teachers. I am pleased that that is the case for the large majority of Scotland's children&#8212;it was, on the whole, the case under the previous Administration and it will continue to be the case under the Scottish Government. I would not be so petulant as to fail to acknowledge the achievements in the past few years.</p><p>As those who gave oral evidence to the committee confirmed, the post-McCrone set-up for new teachers is recognised internationally as being one of the best. The committee heard yesterday from a new teacher that her probationary year was essential in making her a good teacher. It gave her confidence that she had much to contribute in her chosen profession and to the children whom she will teach.</p><p>Of course it is upsetting to read stories about probationers who have not yet secured jobs. No member, regardless of their political colour, wants anyone who has dedicated time to achieve the necessary qualifications to become a teacher&#8212;their chosen vocation&#8212;not to get a job. Likewise, I have never liked to hear about graduates of the history, economy, physiotherapy or engineering departments in universities the length and breadth of the country ending up in temporary employment in call centres or similar while they pursue their dreams and aspirations for employment in their chosen fields. However, we all accept the importance of teachers, which is why the Government is doing all it can to help probationary teachers. As a result, as we heard from the cabinet secretary, in June 2007 the Government provided an additional &#163;9 million to local authorities, which has provided 300 more teaching job opportunities.</p><p>Furthermore, the cabinet secretary has formed the teacher employment working group, which has the remit of examining workforce planning, finding out where improvements can be made and <place-holder colnum=\"10717\"/> considering whether better matches can be made between student numbers and employment opportunities. That is surely a positive and proactive approach to finding out how things can be improved. It is easy for people to say that something should be done, but until we know where the weaknesses and potential hurdles are, we can only stick on plasters, which is not a long-term or proper solution. As Kenny Gibson does, I welcome that sensible move and wish the cabinet secretary well with it. I hope that the group identifies not only where the problems may or may not lie but, crucially, that it recommends solutions.</p><p>For those who are seeking employment, I understand completely how difficult it is to cope without a job. However, it has never been the case that every single post-probationer has obtained a job immediately. As the Deputy First Minister said in Parliament last week, it has always been the case that new teachers have gained employment as vacancies have arisen during the year. That happened under Labour and will continue to be the case under the present Administration. We must heed Murdo Maciver's comments to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee in May, when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the prospects of obtaining a teaching job are bright, even if some appointments will not be made immediately. We are approaching the targets.

It is a short bill that is designed to establish creative Scotland and allow it to operate in the best interests of our country. I am a member of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, which was the lead committee scrutinising the bill and which had the pleasure of listening to the thoughts and concerns of Scotland's cultural community.</p><p>Most of those who responded, regardless of whether they represented a local authority or were from the arts world, were happy, on the whole. They were breathing a sigh of relief that there is to be no more prevarication and that the new Government is taking action and heeding the advice that was presented to the Scottish Executive by arts organisations in response to the previous incarnation of the bill.</p><p>I will not pretend that there was no criticism of the bill. It would have been strange if no concerns or issues requiring further examination had been raised. After all, this is the stage 1 debate. However, I hope that any concerns will be put to good use and not used to score political points. We all need to look at the bill and realise its potential for allowing creativity to flourish, as well as allowing our artists to explore their media. That requires us in Parliament to trust those in the cultural and creative world to know what is best and how to make creative Scotland work well. It also means adopting an arm's-length approach to culture and the arts. The fact that the minister has listened to those appeals shows that the new Government trusts our artists and has no interest in micro-managing our country.</p><p>It is not just me who realises that the Government is listening. In its written submission to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, the Federation of Scottish Theatre said that it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"heartened by the Scottish Ministers' implicit acknowledgement of their trust in the skills and expertise the Chair and Board of Creative Scotland bring to the execution of their responsibilities\".</p><p>Simon Woods of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra said that the Government is<place-holder colnum=\"9875\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"interested in doing things that genuinely provide a better cultural life for the people of Scotland\".</p><p>John Leighton of the National Galleries of Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have seen an open and forward-looking approach which we welcome.\"</p><p>Even Ruth Wishart, in a fair and balanced piece in <em>The</em> <em>Herald</em>, said that there is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a genuine desire in all the sectors to make Creative Scotland work ... what cultural and creative Scotland on the ground longs for is a working template for the new order that it can understand and respect.\"</p><p>She acknowledged that there were tensions with the bill but warned that, if we sabotage this opportunity with creative Scotland,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"then we'll be well and truly stuffed.\"</p><p>We have a chance to make a difference. I recently attended an event that was addressed by Seona Reid, of the Glasgow School of Art. She spoke passionately about the need for a leader for Scotland's creative industries and she explored the economic potential of the sector. I acknowledge that we should not place a disproportionate emphasis on economic arguments, but I am persuaded by her view that Scotland should aim to be a creative hub because all the right ingredients are there.</p><p>We have creative cities, one of which is the UNESCO city of literature, as Jamie McGrigor said earlier. Glasgow boasts a popular musical heritage stretching from bands on Postcard Records in the 1980s to modern-day indie heroes such as Belle and Sebastian and Franz Ferdinand. We have amazing, world-renowned art schools and incredibly talented people. I have always been amazed by the resourcefulness of that group of people, many of whom are young, with a huge passion for and interest in the future of the arts in Scotland. Friends and contemporaries of mine have gone on to do impressive and important work. For example, Hannah Robinson, director of the Mary Mary gallery, has come a long way since first opening up her Dennistoun flat as a gallery space. Many others have managed and continue to manage to work successfully in their chosen fields.</p><p>We must do more to celebrate and encourage more cultural and arts opportunities for people and we must try to attract more people across the world to realise Scotland's potential. That is why I am heartened by the bill, which will enable creative Scotland to get going and streamline and cut bureaucracy. I was impressed by Anne Bonnar, who gave evidence to the committee. She has the bit between her teeth and she told us that she will never sit on her hands but understands and recognises the importance of this new entity for Scotland and beyond.<place-holder colnum=\"9876\"/></p><p>The bill is simple, clear, to the point and honest. The minister has taken on board the points raised in previous consultations and acted on them. Art for art's sake is given appropriate attention, and we have before us a bill that enshrines an arm's-length approach to the arts. It does not seek to stifle the arts and what they will be in the future, because it is not prescriptive in its use of definitions.</p><p>We should be confident that the passing of the bill will mark a new beginning for creativity in Scotland. We should also be confident in the abilities of our artists, practitioners and creative businesses to make creative Scotland work. I support the principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13753500", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Creative Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As everyone else has said today, it gives me great pleasure to speak in today's debate.

They employ over half the country's workforce and account for the vast majority of private sector enterprises. They are of increasing importance to modern <place-holder colnum=\"9549\"/> Scotland not only because they are a source of employment and enterprise, but because of the flexibility and range of services that they can offer in our changing society. That is why the Scottish Government's small business bonus scheme could not have come at a more opportune time and why I welcome the opportunity to debate its positive impact throughout the country.</p><p>I recently surveyed small businesses in the South of Scotland&#8212;in South Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. The results of that survey were overwhelmingly positive and I will draw on them in my speech.</p><p>As the lifeblood of Scotland's economy, small businesses do much more than simply provide jobs. They often provide services that do not exist anywhere else and make them accessible to the people who need them most. In rural areas, small local shops and businesses bring goods and resources to small communities in which large chains have no interest. A successful small business&#8212;the UK's champion chippy in Biggar springs to mind&#8212;can act as a magnet for an area, which brings business to other small shops and outlets in the vicinity.</p><p>Small businesses have an incentive to invest in their staff and communities. Developing and retaining skilled employees helps to build a personal touch and a level of service that larger organisations with a higher turnover and remote management find more difficult to achieve. The response of one local shop in Biggar to my survey was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we are a rural newsagent and work long hours&#8212;this relief will ensure we can keep all our staff\".</p><p>With the limited powers of devolution, it was right for the Government to seek a way to encourage our small businesses, to promote diversity on the high street and to boost small businesses' ability to reinvest in the community. A health-care firm in Lanark that responded to my survey called the small business bonus \"a very attractive saving\".</p><p>Some Opposition members have taken great delight in criticising the Scottish Government's policy to help small businesses proactively, but allowing businesses to channel profits into higher wages, staff training or new outlets hardly strikes me as the wrong thing to do. It is right, and it smacks of common sense, to help high street shops to stand up to the out-of-town retail chains; it is sensible to help a family firm to find the confidence to plan for the future; and it is certainly not right wing to encourage local artists and artisans to try something new and different that might benefit the whole community.</p><p>If we want to see policies that harm small businesses, we need look no further than the <place-holder colnum=\"9550\"/> Westminster Government, which presides over the moral outrage of poverty indicators that are rising almost as fast as City bonus rates. That Government is content to let immigrant office cleaners pay more tax than their non-dom employers, and it has doubled the income tax rate for the poorest earners in our society. New Labour is in thrall to big business, and it appears to neither understand nor care about the need to invest in and support the dynamic small enterprises that drive Scotland's economy.</p><p>The SNP's brand of progressive social democracy and acting in the national interest chimes well with mainstream opinion in Scotland. That opinion is keen and receptive to attempts to kick-start our economy and rejuvenate our high streets, which in some towns, as Roseanna Cunningham mentioned, are scarred by shutters and closed shops. Members should compare that with new Labour's economics, which have left 17 per cent of Scotland's population living in poverty. If supporting and growing our small businesses can even begin to help to improve wellbeing and other poverty indicators, it should be welcomed across the chamber.</p><p>There is clear evidence that the small business bonus scheme has been warmly welcomed and is having a major impact. In my region, almost 5,000 small businesses in South Lanarkshire, and 3,000 in North Ayrshire, will have their business rates abolished next year. A total of around 6,400 and 3,700 businesses respectively will benefit from some form of reduction in rates under the scheme. My survey shows that many businesses are feeling an immediate impact, with nearly all indicating that they will apply for the refund under the scheme. Perhaps Johann Lamont, who I see is not here, should take note that businesses need to apply for that. If she does not want to apply for her business bonus relief, she should donate it to someone who would like it.</p><p>I highlight to the Scottish Government that around a quarter of respondents to my survey in both council areas had yet to receive information from their local authority about the scheme&#8212;I notice that the Conservative amendment makes the point about awareness raising. I am pleased to hear that the Government has taken note of that.</p><p>The final word must go to an artist in New Lanark, who responded to my survey and was absolutely delighted to have her rates reduced from &#163;66 to &#163;26 a month. I am sure that Opposition members will be pleased to hear this quotation:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is of great benefit to me as I only took over my studio in August and have incurred many set-up expenses. Please pass on my sincere thanks to the blessed Alex Salmond and tell him that if he would like to commission a painting, I will gladly donate one (to his wonderful Party!)\"<place-holder colnum=\"9551\"/></p><p>I am happy to pass on the thanks of small businesses throughout the South of Scotland to the blessed Alex Salmond and the blessed Jim Mather, and to the Scottish Government.

In the very week that the First Minister made his statement, we heard reports from the Scottish Alliance for Children's Rights, suggesting that a damning report card on Scottish child welfare will be presented to the United Nations later this year. Sadly, its contents are not really news&#8212;we already know about rising teenage pregnancy rates, thousands of underage criminal convictions and the fact that one in four children lives in poverty. That is the situation in 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland&#8212;a shameful legacy that 10 wasted years of new Labour have done nothing to reverse.</p><p>Although the First Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government will do everything in its all-too-limited power to tackle those scandals, he agreed with me that the best, quickest and fairest route to ending child poverty in Scotland is for the Scottish Parliament to have the full powers of an independent state. An independent Scottish Parliament and Government will have control of the welfare state, the power to reform taxation and <place-holder colnum=\"9206\"/> the ability to reject the managerial, target-obsessed culture that has stifled the war on poverty in the UK for the past 10 years.</p><p>Unionist members may not like that reality; in that case, I would ask them a simple question. Do they honestly believe that, if they were to form the Government of an independent Scotland, they would not be in a better position to end child poverty, given that the London-based Government has so clearly failed? Does the socialist Scottish Labour Party seriously come to this chamber and say, \"No, we do not want the power and responsibility to lift our children permanently out of poverty. We do not want the power to mobilise Scotland's oil wealth to help our vulnerable two-year olds, our teenagers who are looking for apprenticeships and our students who are struggling to get by\"?</p><p>As we move forward, Scotland faces a choice between vision, ambition and confidence for the future, and a mindset that is stuck in the past. My colleague Alasdair Allan recently raised the spectre of former minister Sam Galbraith, who revealed the true feelings of some on the Opposition benches, when he said on the radio that, but for our links to London, Scotland would be \"an insignificant little country\". To those words, I can only respond with the words of Hugh MacDiarmid:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland small? Our multiform, our infinite Scotland, small?\"</p><p>I believe that no country is insignificant. No country is too small to be limited by anything other than the imagination and ambition of its people. Sam Galbraith's is the mindset that Scotland rejected last year, when it chose to place its trust in the Scottish National Party. The SNP Government has done its best to work with those who are willing to co-operate in this chamber and beyond to make a concrete difference to the lives of people in Scotland and, indeed, in the wider world.</p><p>The motion touches on that when it talks about climate change&#8212;a global challenge that does not respect borders. During the Easter recess, I had the privilege of visiting Zambia with Oxfam Scotland, and saw at first hand the effect of climate change on communities that live in precarious circumstances. That is why I welcome the Scottish Government's world-leading proposals for a climate change bill, the establishment of the saltire prize&#8212;one of the biggest international innovation prizes in history&#8212;and its commitment to growing Scotland's international development budget and influence overseas.</p><p>The First Minister confirmed to the Parliament recently the steps that he is taking to show <place-holder colnum=\"9207\"/> solidarity with people affected by natural disasters in China and Burma&#8212;once again, doing what we can and hinting at the potential Scotland would have as an independent nation on the world stage.</p><p>Our nationalism is defined by our internationalism, and independence is defined by the relationship that Scotland would have with other countries in the United Nations, the European Union, and any other agreements freely entered into.</p><p>The Government motion makes clear that Scotland's future is safe under a Government that is committed to putting the interests of Scotland's people first, last and always.

As the motion states, the association makes a vital contribution to cultural life not only in our capital city, but throughout the country.</p><p>The debate provides us with a good opportunity to consider the importance of youth orchestras to Scotland, and I have a particular interest in speaking tonight. While at school, I played&#8212;or at least tried to play&#8212;the oboe and I was in the school orchestra and the Perthshire central bands, which brought together young musicians from schools from across the county. I never played in the Perth Youth Orchestra, but many of my peers did.</p><p>The opportunity to be part of an orchestra should never be underestimated. It is thrilling to be part of something so big that sounds so wonderful, and to hear applause at the end of a piece is <place-holder colnum=\"8997\"/> exhilarating. On a practical level, the chance to practise and play their instrument in a full orchestra allows young musicians to hone their playing abilities and to improve their skills. Another obvious plus is that it is enormously gratifying to see the pleasure that people get from listening to an orchestra full of young people. It also allows those young people to make new friends and lifelong acquaintances.</p><p>Being part of a youth orchestra offers young musicians the opportunity to learn their trade and gain more experience before heading on to bigger and better things. I mentioned the fact that I played the oboe at school. When I was first oboe at school, a young Michael O'Donnell was second, but members should not be fooled into thinking that I was any good. In stark contrast to me, Michael displayed an obvious talent, and I am delighted to learn that he is now a professional musician with a formidable reputation that includes his playing at the Edinburgh and Cheltenham festivals and the BBC proms.</p><p>Others who have carved out remarkable careers have been Alasdair Beatson and Malcolm Edmonstone, also in my class at school, who are award-winning musicians and have performed around the world. Of course, we cannot forget Ayrshire's Nicola Benedetti, who was recently crowned best young British classical performer.</p><p>Those musicians have all played in youth orchestras, and I do not doubt that they will look back fondly at their time spent there and be appreciative of the support, tuition and experience that it gave them. They are doing Scotland proud, and I hope that youngsters in youth orchestras and groups across the South of Scotland&#8212;such as the Lanarkshire Orchestral Society, the North Ayrshire Schools Orchestra, and the Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra&#8212;find as much enjoyment in their respective groups as I did. Who knows? They may be harbouring the next Nicola Benedetti.</p><p>Those examples and their successful stories illustrate why it is so important that we continue to support youth orchestras and groups in all their guises That is why everything must be done to ensure that the National Association of Youth Orchestras stays in Scotland. I accept that the association's moving to London would not necessarily negatively impinge on youth orchestras and groups, but I worry that such a move could send the message that Scotland is not as good a location as London for UK bodies such as the NAYO, which we all know is not the case. As Ian McKee suggested, modern technologies and transport links surely enable wider dispersal of cultural bodies. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century world, London need no longer be the epicentre.</p><p>I share the sentiments of Ian McKee's motion and support him and the City of Edinburgh Council <place-holder colnum=\"8998\"/> in their efforts to ensure that this important organisation remains here.

It proved that the Parliament had come of age and that parties could work together for the benefit of the people and summon the gumption to travel a radically different route to that proposed and followed by Westminster. It showed that where consensus prevailed, the people benefited.</p><p>However, despite the policy being implemented with the very best of intentions, it has had its flaws, its unintended consequences and its critics. We have heard about the pressures that an ageing population will have on the policy; about food preparation problems from Christine Grahame; and concerns about nail trimming from Help the Aged. Perhaps Mary Scanlon will be pleased to learn that my sister is a podiatrist, so I understand how essential her skills are to the elderly population. That is why it is right that the SNP Government, sticking true to a manifesto commitment, commissioned an independent review of free personal care. I am heartened by the tone of Nicola Sturgeon's motion, which shows that the Government is reacting positively to the Sutherland report by accepting in full all its recommendations, and by her intention to work with COSLA to ensure openness and transparency on waiting times.</p><p>I thought that most of us in the chamber would want to echo the consensus of the past and would try to be as constructive as possible to ensure that this flagship policy does not wither on the vine, but flourishes as intended. I assumed that most members would welcome the Scottish Government's intention to pursue vigorously the attendance allowance that the UK Government so callously withdrew. It just goes to show that one should never assume anything, because it is clear from the Labour Party's amendment, which scrubs from the cabinet secretary's motion the bit that will allow her to pursue the attendance allowance, that the supposedly socialist Labour Party has performed yet another remarkable U-turn and <place-holder colnum=\"8730\"/> does not want the Scottish Government to get that money back.</p><p>The Labour motion also appears to be mixing up Wanless reports&#8212;I think that the one cited in the motion was done not for the Government but for the health charity, the King's Fund. I share Ross Finnie's concerns about that review.</p><p>As we have heard, Lord Sutherland's review categorically states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Review Group considers that the Care Development Group was right to view Attendance Allowance in care homes as a UK contribution towards personal care costs.\"</p><p>It also says that the Scottish Government should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In the short-term seek the reinstatement of the &#163;30 million in Attendance Allowance withdrawn to those in care homes at the time of introduction of the FPNC policy in Scotland and for those arrangements to stand until the wider assessment of funding streams for long-term care at a UK level ... can be made.\"</p><p>If we have a &#163;40 million shortfall and we are due &#163;30 million, we should ask for it. That sounds like a sensible plan of action. Just because the Scottish Government is going to engage in dialogue to get the money back does not mean that it cannot work constructively with the UK Government on a longer-term review of care provision and benefits.</p><p>Margaret Curran, in her amendment, fails to see that point. Alex Salmond cited in his statement to Parliament yesterday examples of when the Scottish and UK Governments have worked together and when the Scottish Government has shown itself ready to co-operate with Westminster to meet the challenges that the countries face. The issues about free personal and nursing care, attendance allowance and wider long-term reform should be no different. Henry McLeish recently said, in an interview on \"Good Morning Scotland\", that parliamentarians should be putting petty, party-political squabbling to the side, that this was not a petty discussion about a small amount of finance and that every political party in Scotland should be supporting the move. I agree with him whole-heartedly on that.</p><p>The new politics currently enjoyed in Scotland should be about doing what is right, not what political masters in London say should be done. The people of Scotland voted for a devolved Government that has responsibility for and a duty of care to its people. The people of Scotland want their representatives to stand up for what is right and, as Christine Grahame said, not to continue to have their policies constrained by what goes on in London. That is exactly what the Sutherland review wants the Scottish Government to do. It has identified a legitimate flaw in the policy of the Department for Work and Pensions to keep the money and it has suggested that the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"8731\"/> Government ask for it back. It is simple, it is supported in the briefing supplied by Help the Aged and it is something that each party&#8212;I thought&#8212;supported.</p><p>Throughout my first year in the Parliament, I have heard accusation after accusation that the Scottish National Party does not care for the most vulnerable in society. The elderly are one of our most vulnerable groups; they are due our care and their dignity must be maintained. The SNP is clear that, by implementing Sutherland's recommendations and, importantly, by getting back Scotland's money to help implement free personal care properly, it will do its utmost for that group. It is also showing the people of Scotland that it is willing to stand up for our country and not shy away when Scotland's interests are jeopardised.</p><p>It is depressing that some have decided to break the consensus in the Parliament, to ignore a key recommendation of the Sutherland report and to question the Government's motives in standing up for this country. The debate need not have descended into the partisan bickering that Henry McLeish warned against; it could have been much more. I hope that the Labour Party amendment falls tonight and I am confident that the cabinet secretary and her team will do their best to secure our attendance allowance. I know that those who should be in receipt of it will be grateful for their efforts.</p><p>There is a real chance to make this flagship policy work and I look forward to the updates that I am sure the Government will provide as it seeks to make free personal care for the elderly a policy for us to be proud of.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660353", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Free Personal Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to participate in today's debate and am glad of the opportunity to join in discussions about a policy that parliamentarians who were here in 2002 are right to be proud of.

I welcome the Government's commitment to ensuring that Scotland's children are equipped to understand the world around them.</p><p>I want to concentrate on the benefits of school linking. I have been amazed by the results that such a simple exercise seems to have on the kids who take part in it. The school links that I have learned about and seen at first hand show that the process helps to build a degree of confidence, self-esteem, wellbeing, knowledge and understanding that might not be attained through the use of text books alone. That is in line with the Government's key objective of making our country smarter and fairer, and with the curriculum for excellence's aims of making children confident individuals, successful learners and effective contributors, and of building capacity so that they can develop their critical thinking.</p><p>Learning about the world and Scotland's place in it by linking in partnership with schools across the globe is not just about learning the geography or the poverty statistics of countries in the developing world; it can be fun. Importantly, international education should be about respecting different cultures, traditions and languages, and it should be made relevant to all areas of the curriculum and all ages and abilities, not taught as an additional subject for teachers to tutor. It should also be about sustainability, with the premise being that the school is in a partnership and that learning from each other is a reciprocal process. In short, international education should be part of the school's ethos.</p><p>My parliamentary assistant spent a year working in Malawi. As I said in a previous debate on Malawi, he told me that when young Malawians come to Scotland or young Scots go to Malawi, the remarkable thing is that they notice not the material differences in their lives but the similarities of their experience. Typically, we say that youngsters do not like doing homework or are on the lookout for romance. From that, we know that genuine partnership and understanding can work both ways, and that young Scots will come to realise that, regardless of where someone comes from in the world, when we scratch the surface we are not that different one from the other.</p><p>What makes a good school link? According to Oxfam, it means educating children about<place-holder colnum=\"7904\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"social justice ... diversity ... interdependence ... peace and conflict ...critical thinking ... respect\"</p><p>and the \"Ability to challenge injustice\", and about having</p><p class=\"indent\">\"empathy ... Commitment to social justice and equity ... Concern for the environment.\"</p><p>I will share a couple of anecdotes to highlight good examples of school linking. The first concerns my first encounter of school linking, which was at the Scottish Storytelling Centre up the road on the Royal Mile. I attended an event that was co-hosted by the British Council, where stalls were laid out by schools that were involved in a partnership. I visited each one and was particularly taken by one stall. The pupils were so eager to tell me about what they were learning that they dragged me over to it, their eyes glistening. Their work was outstanding.</p><p>I told their teacher that they were a credit to their school. She went on to tell me of one wee boy who had brought to school the bull marble from his marble set. He told her that he wanted to send it as a present to a political prisoner whom he had been learning about because his father was in prison and he knew what prison was like. The story sums up everything that is good about school linking. The young boy's thought processes had led him to feel tremendous empathy and respect for someone who was fighting for justice thousands of miles away. I found it incredible that, all by himself, the boy had made a link between the political prisoner's situation and his personal circumstances.</p><p>The second anecdote concerns a visit to the Parliament of a South African school that is linked to a Scottish school and which I hosted. The pupils were members of a choir and were so pleased to share their traditional song that they gave an impromptu performance for us in the chamber. For me, that proved the tremendous cultural benefit to all the pupils and teachers involved.</p><p>Those are fine examples of school links. If the Government is to increase the roll-out of such links, I urge it to ensure that that is the type of school linking that Scotland follows.</p><p>In the briefings that we received for the debate, charities such as Oxfam, SCIAF, IDEAS and the sustainable development education policy network highlighted examples of poor school linkings that do nothing to broaden young people's horizons or promote understanding between them. If those concerns are prevalent, the topic is worthy of debate today. As Kenneth Macintosh and Iain Smith said, schools&#8212;admittedly with the best of intentions&#8212;can believe their role to be that of fundraiser and donor, which serves only to perpetrate and reinforce the stereotypical myth <place-holder colnum=\"7905\"/> that the role of the developed world is to fundraise for the poor and for charity.</p><p>We need to ensure that school links are partnerships that are based on equality. As a country, we must understand that we do not know it all and we have much to learn from those around us. However, teachers need support for that. They need guidance on how to achieve the best for their school and students and how to ensure that the children who leave their school and care grow into adults who know the difference between justice and injustice and right and wrong, and participate in the wider community to make it a fairer and equitable place&#8212;one that respects diversity.</p><p>That approach raises challenges. I believe that the principles of being a good citizen and a good global citizen should be embedded at every opportunity in the curriculum for excellence. The new curriculum provides a good opportunity to ensure that we in Scotland get global citizenship right. We all agree that Scotland has a great role to play in the world, albeit that we may not agree on the level at which we should play it. However, we must all work together to ensure that today's children and students are well equipped to make them confident and able to go forward into work. We must ensure that they realise that co-operation and respect should triumph over prejudice and stereotyping.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402715", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The topic of international education should unite everyone in the Parliament as we grow to realise that Scotland has an important international role to play in the global arena and that, in a fast-changing and interdependent world, education can help young people to meet the challenges that they will confront now and in the future.

I congratulate Patricia Ferguson on securing the debate and on her recent election as the convener of the cross-party on international development, of which I am the vice-convener. The group is the largest established in the Parliament, which in itself is a sign of Scotland's international outlook and commitment to global solidarity with those most in need.</p><p>The basic principle behind the fair trade concept of paying producers in the developing world a social premium, to protect them from the vagaries of the market and to provide a secure and sufficient income, goes back to the formal establishment of the Fairtrade Foundation in 1992 and the Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International network. However, it is the hard work of the foundation and the range of charities and non-governmental organisations that support its work that has led to the wide array of Fairtrade <place-holder colnum=\"7115\"/> goods now available and the increasing level of awareness among the public.</p><p>In 2007, sales of Fairtrade goods reached almost &#163;0.5 billion in the United Kingdom. Since 2005, the number of African producer organisations selling to the UK market has almost doubled, going from 81 to 152. More than half of the UK population&#8212;about 57 per cent&#8212;recognise and understand the Fairtrade mark. That awareness is hugely important because, for many people, contact with the Fairtrade mark and fairly traded goods is the first step on a journey towards greater understanding of the social and economic injustices that leave so many producers and communities in the developing world in poverty. The work of schools, parishes such as St John's in Carluke and towns up and down the country&#8212;many in the south of Scotland&#8212;to achieve Fairtrade status is testament to the desire of many people to put their commitment to global justice into action.</p><p>To achieve Fairtrade status, communities must be dedicated to change over the long term and willing to change what it means to be consumers in a globalised world. I pay tribute to the work of Scotland's international development sector, in particular Oxfam, the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and Christian Aid, in supporting schools, churches and communities in their efforts to achieve Fairtrade status.</p><p>I am aware of the progress that is being made towards Scotland achieving Fairtrade nation status. It is right that we do not rush into that, and I commend the work that has already been done to guide the process. The wider implications for public life and society are immense&#8212;every aspect of procurement, consumer and sourcing practices will have to be carefully monitored. Despite all the hard work and achievements of the Fairtrade movement, we are only at the beginning of a journey towards a world where trade justice becomes a reality.</p><p>Running the Fairtrade organisations remains the work of committed individuals, backed by civil society and the wider public. They are building and promoting an alternative model of economic development. People in Scotland and throughout the rich world who buy Fairtrade goods make a conscious decision to do so and, by that decision, they recognise that many of the alternative goods that they purchase are unfairly traded.</p><p>Multinational companies and rich countries' Governments continue to manipulate the global markets in their interests. Oxfam has summed that up in its report \"Rigged Rules and Double Standards\". Through economic partnership agreements and the World Trade Organization, the rich world denies developing nations the very protections and producer support that allowed <place-holder colnum=\"7116\"/> countries such as ours to become rich in the first place&#8212;all in the name of the free market.</p><p>Many of the organisations that I mentioned earlier, and hundreds more across Scotland, are backers not only of the Fairtrade Foundation but of the trade justice movement, and they were the forces behind the make poverty history campaign in 2005.</p><p>I am happy to join my colleagues throughout the chamber in stressing our commitment to the Fairtrade movement.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fairtrade Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Fair trade is a major success story of our time.

Who in the Parliament can feel pleased that we are discussing the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq when troops and civilians are still being killed and when people across the world who dissented so strongly from the decision to invade are still being ignored?</p><p>If we did not continue to display our opposition to the war and to use every avenue open to us to show our dissent and to reaffirm that the actions that the United Kingdom Government took at this time five years ago were not taken in our name, we would be failing humanity and the memories of the people who have died as a result of the conflict.</p><p>It just so happens that, five years ago, I could voice my abhorrence of the war only by joining anti-war groups and taking to the streets. Five years on from those actions, I have had the privilege of being able to secure a debate on the subject in our Scottish Parliament. This is my first members' business debate and it is timely. My motion supports the actions of Rose Gentle in her pursuit of justice as we mark the fifth anniversary of the invasion.</p><p>I cannot think of an issue that, in my 12 years of active political engagement, has galvanised a generation of political activists more than the Iraq war. With colleagues in the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Green Party, I set up the anti-war movement at the University of Glasgow. The movement was the fastest-growing group on campus, which, given that its membership came <place-holder colnum=\"7043\"/> from an age group and section of society that is often accused of apathy, demonstrated people's motivation to ensure that their voices of opposition to Tony Blair's actions were heard. Alas, as we all know, the people were ignored.</p><p>On 15 February 2003, people took to the streets with a sense of optimism that the Government would listen and Tony Blair's path could change from one of intent towards conflict to one of diplomacy and reason. The 2 million people who marched in London, Glasgow and other towns and cities throughout the UK exploded the myth of political apathy. It looked as though people power might win the day and the heart and mind of a Prime Minister who did not seek unpopularity as a badge of honour. Folk who felt distanced from politics took their chance to re-engage.</p><p>What was the aftermath of all that action? <em>The Guardian </em>summed up the situation when it described the bleakness that stemmed from a political elite that wanted to keep the public's sustained disquiet at arm's length and carry on with business as usual, despite the fact that a disastrous invasion had gone ahead for deceitful purposes. That is what hurts most: our country was taken into a war that the people evidently did not want or believe in and of which people did not accept the legality.</p><p>Far too many experts in international law think that the war did not comply with international law for us simply to ignore the issue and let its legality go untested. The people who marched five years ago and Rose Gentle and other relatives of people who have fought and died still do not know whether the decision to invade Iraq was legitimate.</p><p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations at that time, Kofi Annan, said of the invasion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Wilmshurst, the deputy legal adviser in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote in her resignation letter:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I cannot agree that it is lawful to use force against Iraq without a second Security Council resolution ... I cannot in conscience go along with advice&#8212;within the Office or to the public or Parliament&#8212;which asserts the legitimacy of military action without such a resolution, particularly since an unlawful use of force on such a scale amounts to the crime of aggression\".</p><p>Professor Philippe Sands and other notable academics said in a letter to <em>The Guardian </em>in 2003:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is no justification under international law for the use of military force against Iraq. The UN charter outlaws the use of force with only two exceptions: individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack and action authorised by the security council ... There are currently no grounds for a claim to use such force in self-<place-holder colnum=\"7044\"/> defence. The doctrine of pre-emptive self-defence against an attack that might arise ... has no basis in international law.\"</p><p>Who can submit a robust counter-argument to that? Those quotations illustrate that the rationale to go to war was illegitimate and unlawful and that the war has proven to be an expensive and destructive mistake.</p><p>It is no wonder that the families whose loved ones are serving in the military are calling for an inquiry into the legality of that most hideous conflict. I spoke to Rose Gentle the other day, to let her know about the debate. She told me that the military families who want an inquiry are desperate to find the truth and cannot understand why, if there is nothing to hide, they will not be granted an inquiry. They are not calling for an inquiry as a press stunt or to get their photos in the paper; they are doing so because they want to find out whether their sons and daughters lost their lives needlessly&#8212;and if they did, to get answers and some form of redress.</p><p>All members of the Scottish Parliament will sympathise with the sorrow and grief that those families feel and respect their determination not to let their campaign wither on the vine. As Rose Gentle told me, the campaign's aim is to ensure that what happened does not happen again. The families know the pain of war and what it is to suffer. They are feeling the consequences of the UK's decision to invade Iraq. Their campaign is based on the hope that the Iraq war can be the illegal war to end all illegal wars. They hope to restore the rule of international law and to ensure that no more soldiers and innocent Iraqi civilians die because of that futile conflict.</p><p>I want to use this opportunity to show the people who marched on 15 February 2003 and those who will be at Blythswood Square on Saturday that politicians care passionately about humanity. Politics does not need to be about backroom deals, imperialistic conquests and hidden documents; it can and should be about openness, listening and doing what is right. That is why politicians from the Parliament should march in solidarity with Rose Gentle on Saturday.</p><p>My motion calls for a positive and peaceful resolution, but that can be achieved only if there is full honesty about, and understanding of, how the war began. If Scotland had had the powers of a normal country, with a top-table voice in the UN, it would have had an opportunity to stand up for the rule of international law. That is why I want Scotland to take its place in the international community. I joined the Scottish National Party not to change flags but to change society and to play a role in making Scotland a centre for fostering peace and reconciliation throughout the world.<place-holder colnum=\"7045\"/></p><p>Another Scotland is possible and another world is possible.

However, there can be no room for complacency in protecting livelihoods and communities in rural Scotland.</p><p>I grew up in Perthshire and, although I do not represent that area, my upbringing there allows me to understand the experiences of those who live in the countryside in the south of Scotland. I grew up on my family's tenant farm, which I loved as a child. People in the countryside have a sense of freedom, see the seasons change and grow up with a spiritual connection to the land. No report can ever relay that. However, when people hit their teens, the sight of the first daffodils in spring is less appealing when they feel isolated and remote.<place-holder colnum=\"6751\"/></p><p>In common with many young people who live in Scotland's countryside, I left and headed for the city lights to study. The briefing from the south of Scotland alliance shows that the working age population in the south of Scotland is forecast to decline, partly because of young people leaving the area for education. I suspect that the tale is similar throughout the rest of rural Scotland. I am keen, therefore, for the Government to explore ways to keep young people in rural areas, which will ensure that those areas are sustainable, diverse and vibrant places that people want to stay in or return to.</p><p>People in rural areas seem to make do with their lot and feel that not having access to all the pleasures of 21<sup>st</sup> century life is a normal state of affairs simply because they live in the countryside. A woman came to me about problems that she was having with her heating. She is elderly and lives at the southernmost tip of Clydesdale, and had resigned herself to the fact that her problem had not been solved simply because she lived in the countryside. However, that should not be the case.</p><p>I had the pleasure, at the start of the year, of meeting people from the ambulance service in Biggar.

Rural South Lanarkshire and Ayrshire have farms, but they also have a vast number of mining villages.

The people in its northern and southern regions often think that their opportunities are squeezed by the more prosperous central region. As an MSP for the South of Scotland, I can understand that.</p><p>I have also heard about the innovative projects and programmes that are making a real difference to people's lives in Malawi. The Eva Demaya project, for example, is based 15 miles from the nearest tarmac road and the northern town of Rhumpi, and it relies on solar power for electricity and boreholes for water. However, a genuine partnership exists between a Scots-Dutch couple and the local community that is making a real difference to people's daily lives. The centre provides a mix of conventional western treatments alongside traditional Malawian healing and homoeopathic methods. In addition, it provides food, decent clothing and employment opportunities in an area in which all three are in short supply.</p><p>The Chesney Trust for Education in Malawi is another project that was founded by a Scots volunteer who visited Malawi and fell in love with it. Away from infrastructure such as roads and <place-holder colnum=\"6110\"/> electricity, which we in Scotland take for granted, the trust is building a school with a special unit for hearing-impaired children&#8212;Patricia Ferguson mentioned hearing impairment&#8212;that will also serve as a focus for local employment and development. We can find many similar examples, which is why Scotland's relationship with Malawi has rightly been described as a partnership. Many MSPs can give similar examples of constituents who have built links with Malawi.</p><p>In the South of Scotland, St Michael's academy in Kilwinning was one of the first schools in Scotland to establish a link with a school in Malawi&#8212;St Peter's school in the northern capital of Mzuzu. The partnership has had a transformative effect on St Peter's school. Equipment, buildings and resources have been provided that otherwise would simply have been out of the school's reach. However, it has also had a transformative effect on the school in Scotland. The partnership gives real meaning to the concept of global citizenship and enables young people from both countries to broaden their horizons. When young Malawians come to Scotland or young Scots visit Malawi, what is remarkable is not that they notice the differences in their material lives, but that they discover the similarities of their experiences. They do not like doing homework, they are on the look out for a boyfriend or a girlfriend, and they want to be the next champion in their favourite sport. From that, we can see that genuine partnership works both ways. There should be a two-way street. For that reason, I encourage the Scottish Government to ensure that when it distributes grant funding it considers not only how Malawi can learn from Scotland, but how Scotland can learn from Malawi.</p><p>Agencies such as Oxfam in Scotland, the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and others that have been mentioned understand that people in developing countries are not only looking for charity&#8212;they are looking for justice. Much of the development work that is taking place in Malawi and throughout the poorer parts of the world seeks to strengthen communities by building capacity and empowering citizens with knowledge and capital. Community-based health awareness and care programmes, credit unions and women's centres offer models of local development work that we can learn from and can consider applying in some of Scotland's most deprived communities.</p><p>In conclusion, we all agree that the partnership between Scotland and Malawi is one of the great achievements of devolution so far. The new Scottish Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to building on that positive and healthy international relationship, which is based on global co-operation and respect and does not seek to perpetrate the stereotypical images and notions of the past.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland's new relationship with Malawi is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of devolution.

It was a real treat to be able to hear not only the eventual six finalists&#8212;including Ewan Robertson&#8212;but the other young performers who were unlucky enough not to make it to the finals this time. I would not have relished the job of the judges, who had to pick a winner, as the standard was truly outstanding. Simon Thoumire and others who were involved in organising the event&#8212;and Meg Beresford, who allowed the semi-finalists to stay in Wiston Lodge and jam there&#8212;should be recognised for playing their part in keeping Scotland's music tradition alive.</p><p>And what a tradition we have in Scotland. From the Shetland fiddle tunes and the waulking songs of the Western Isles to the muckle sangs, the border ballads and&#8212;my favourite&#8212;the bothy ballads, our rich tapestry of traditional music is hard to beat. We should never be ashamed to celebrate it. What luck that Scotland has dedicated and talented young people who are passionate about keeping the tradition going. Their dedication, coupled with the time and effort they have to put into learning their instruments, should be congratulated; it shows that not all young people are simply hoodies.<place-holder colnum=\"5917\"/></p><p>Rob Gibson's motion acknowledges the contribution that institutions such as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama can make in the development of musicians, and I support that sentiment, but we must be aware of the vast amount of work that is done over and above those national bodies by local folk groups such as the Clydesdale folk club in the South of Scotland, who had a big hand in supporting the young trad musician of the year award event, and who do their best to nurture talent. I witnessed an example of that when Douglas resident Tom Gold was presented at the semi-final in Coulter with the David Roberts prize. David was a former member of the Clydesdale folk club who unfortunately passed away fairly recently. That young guy, Tom, who is only about 15, blew me away with his fiddle playing&#8212;I know that he will go on to be a great success.</p><p>The tradition is also kept alive by the work of the school of Scottish studies, Glasgow Caledonian University's collection of political songs and the Elphinstone institute in Aberdeen&#8212;they all work hard to ensure that we do not lose the oral traditions of our travelling people. Why is it important to keep those traditions alive? Why does it matter so much? Because our folk songs and music form a crucial part of our history and provide a useful glimpse into our past.</p><p>At university, I studied bothy ballads and agricultural folk songs from the north-east. Members do not need to worry; I will not perform any songs or renditions, because I am pretty rubbish&#8212;Cathy Peattie can do it. Those ballads told the stories of farm labourers: their working conditions and love lives, the feeing fairs and the efforts that were made by the army to recruit them. Those songs were their words, and they should be of equal value to any academic texts or condescending contemporary newspaper reports. The songs add a different dimension to the usual methods of finding out about our past, and are more important than we probably realise.</p><p>Last week, the Parliament debated the importance of teaching Scottish history in our schools. Members largely agreed that we need to be aware of our heritage and history to understand ourselves better and to be able to move forward with confidence. I firmly believe that teaching our songs and traditional music should be included in the effort to encourage our children to learn about their past and to be confident in that learning. I hope that by recognising the achievements of young traditional musicians we can work together to raise awareness of our varied and valuable traditions.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Trad Music Awards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Rob Gibson for lodging the motion, which allows us the opportunity to discuss the traditional music scene in Scotland at a time when, as Cathy Peattie noted, Burns suppers are still taking place.

Health to me, as to others, does not simply mean physical fitness. Mental well-being and overall quality of life need to be factored in when we are measuring how healthy any individual or society is.</p><p>I will focus on aspects of health improvement among two groups: the young people of Scotland and people in rural areas, especially the South of Scotland region, which I represent. Both groups have particular vulnerabilities and challenges and I am pleased to welcome the early steps that the Scottish Government is taking to improve their health and well-being.</p><p>Getting healthy practices right in the early years has benefits that last a lifetime&#8212;and a longer, healthier lifetime at that. The budget commits &#163;32 million to specialist children's services, including cancer care and high-dependency specialties. The Government is committed to sustaining four major children's hospitals in Scotland, including new facilities in Glasgow and Edinburgh by 2012.</p><p>Healthy exercise is one of the best forms of preventive medicine as it keeps young people fit and healthy, builds strength and improves mental <place-holder colnum=\"5420\"/> well-being. The Government has adopted an aim of increasing financial investment in the let's make Scotland more active strategy, which sets a target of 80 per cent of children attaining recommended levels of activity. Currently, around 25 per cent of boys and up to a third of girls are not meeting that target, so it is vital that the Government continues to invest in indoor and outdoor facilities that make it easy for children to keep fit. As we all know, exercise can help to tackle obesity, so we need to make healthy play for young people an attractive and easy option.</p><p>We all agree that the Commonwealth games will inspire a new generation of athletes in Scotland. I am just disappointed that, at such a crucial time, many Scottish MPs at Westminster have voted to divert lottery funding away from Scotland that could have been used to tackle obesity here.</p><p>Tackling a challenge such as obesity requires us to adopt many different approaches and it is good that a consensus is building about the importance of a healthy diet. I am particularly delighted with the Government's commitment to pilot free school meals.</p><p>However, diet includes both food and drink, and it is increasingly clear that alcoholic drink poses a threat to the health and well-being of Scotland's young people. Alcohol abuse can cause both short and long-term damage to physical and mental health. I welcome the Government's commitment to take concerted action to promote better understanding of the risks that are involved in binge drinking. In that area in particular, our approach to health improvement needs to go beyond straightforward management of the NHS and related resources. We need to tackle the cultural and societal trends that encourage and glamorise alcohol intake, such as the manufacture and marketing of sweet alcoholic drinks that are targeted specifically at young people.</p><p>At present, however, the Parliament and the Government can only do so much because there are constraints from Westminster in relation to the powers to alter alcohol taxation and to regulate advertising. If other parties genuinely support Scottish solutions to the challenges that Scotland faces, I hope that their contribution to the national conversation on our constitutional future will take the matter into account.</p><p>Many health challenges are best dealt with from a Scottish perspective, not least those in our rural communities, which often seem to be overlooked when it comes to health provision and improvement. People in rural areas often face particular difficulties, especially with access to services. I strongly welcome the steps that the Government is taking to meet those challenges, including the roll-out of NHS 24 to every mainland <place-holder colnum=\"5421\"/> health board and the trial of walk-in appointment services in Lanarkshire and Lothian.</p><p>The decisions to save accident and emergency services at Monklands hospital and to stop car parking fees at NHS-run car parks&#8212;as mentioned by Stuart McMillan&#8212;will also benefit people in the south of Scotland who have to travel some distance to access hospital treatment.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Improvement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Scottish Government for providing an opportunity to debate health improvement in Scotland.

It is timely because never in my lifetime have I seen such a magnificent display by the Scottish international squad as that during their ultimately unsuccessful campaign to secure a place in the Euro 2008 finals. The nation was behind the team, but alas the whole nation did not have equitable viewing access to witness Scotland's brave attempts to win a place in the Euro championships.</p><p>I want to refer to the response that Keith Brown received from James Purnell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. As members will recall, Keith Brown asked for Scotland's games to be added as listed events, which must be shown on terrestrial television, so that we can all enjoy them. I saw Mr Purnell's response, which was that, although the games meet the required criteria, they cannot be put on the list because that is impractical. If we all took that attitude, I am afraid that the entire world would come to a halt. Why is that too impractical for us, when Germany seems to manage and Italy has no problem getting round the impracticalities?</p><p>The bigger question is not why Mr Purnell, a member of the Westminster Parliament, takes that view; it is why the Westminster Parliament should have any say at all in whether the people of Scotland are allowed to watch their national football team play. Of course, in an independent Scotland, we would have control over everything, including broadcasting, and would not have to wait for the outcome of a Westminster review of which matches should be reserved to free-to-view TV. It is not just the national team that gets short shrift in the television coverage. Why is it that on a Saturday evening we can watch the highlights of English Football Association club games, but if we want to see Scottish Premier League highlights, we have to wait until late Monday night? For a St Johnstone fan such as me, and for fans of other clubs from the lower divisions, there really is no hope&#8212;I mean that there is no hope of getting TV coverage. As someone who used to play football for the University of Glasgow, I am well aware that women's football remains the very poor and far-distant relation of the men's game. If we want to encourage young girls to play football, we must also consider how we can better promote coverage of the women's game.</p><p>To return to Keith Brown's motion and the match to which it refers&#8212;the Scotland versus Italy Euro qualifier last November&#8212;the fact that people could not watch that game unless they had Sky caused <place-holder colnum=\"4860\"/> nothing short of a stushie. I will share with members some stories that show the way in which the current broadcasting of games impinges negatively on young people. One guy told me that, because he is not yet 18, he cannot normally get into pubs to watch Scotland games. However, he did once enter a pub to watch a qualifier. The kick-off was at 7.45, so he saw only the first 15 minutes of the match, because the pub's licence allowed him to stay in the pub only until 8 o'clock.</p><p>Another person told me that the Scotland versus England play-off for Euro 2000 was live on Sky, but was to be aired straight after the game on the BBC. He was too young to go to the pub and tried his best not to hear the result. He was full of anticipation for a successful score, only to look out of his window and see a grown man in a kilt greetin as he walked past. Of course, the fact that he saw that man is by the by, but the point is that it is not very exciting for people to watch important games after they have been played. What kind of message does the situation send out to young people? Only in Scotland could it happen that, on the one hand, efforts are being made to make the population healthier and fitter while, on the other hand, people are being forced into the pub to watch sport.</p><p>I am willing to lobby Westminster and to seek to persuade it that our argument is the right one. I am happier still to argue that broadcasting powers should be transferred to the Parliament so that we can decide what is and is not practical.

The debate is timely, because tomorrow is the day that we celebrate Scotland's patron saint and it coincides with the launch of the winter festival, which is a long overdue initiative that beautifully ties together some of Scotland's most important dates and celebrations. The debate also coincides nicely with last weekend's comments from VisitScotland's chairman, who said that we should market our weather as an attraction. Some of us are perhaps still to be persuaded of that argument.</p><p>We have heard much about how important tourism is and how it contributes more than &#163;4 billion annually to the Scottish economy. We know that gaps exist and that more can be done to improve the industry. That is why I am heartened that the Scottish Government supports VisitScotland's ambitious target of increasing that &#163;4 billion figure by 50 per cent over the years to 2015.</p><p>Tourism has been correctly identified as a key contributor to the Government's economic strategy, which aims to achieve sustainable economic growth. It is important that tourism is not overly concentrated only in certain areas, as my colleagues Nanette Milne, Jim Hume and Cathy Jamieson have already said. Although our country undoubtedly has key attractions and honeypot areas, each region of Scotland has something to offer visitors from elsewhere in the world, from <place-holder colnum=\"3916\"/> elsewhere in the UK and even from elsewhere in Scotland.</p><p>Let us not forget that tourism is not just about bringing in money. Tourism plays an essential part in raising awareness and knowledge of Scotland's history and culture, especially among our younger people. If we can encourage more people to visit Scotland's outdoors by using public and active travel&#8212;be that walking, cycling, horse riding, canoeing, swimming or hang gliding&#8212;we will potentially contribute to a healthier Scotland in line with the Government's key objectives. Although it is important that we continue to attract visitors from overseas, Scotland's wealth of historic buildings and beautiful landscapes and its range of attractions to suit all ages and tastes are well placed to offer alternative destinations to Scottish people who would otherwise take carbon-intensive flights for short breaks in Europe.</p><p>However, not every region is equal in terms of visitor numbers or investment in the tourism industry. In the greater Glasgow and Clyde valley area, the occupancy rate for self-catering establishments is 51 per cent. For caravan and camping sites, the rate is 46 per cent. Those figures are below the Scottish average of 55 per cent and 51 per cent respectively. Given that those types of accommodation are more likely to be located in the more rural parts of the area, as a country we obviously need to up our game dramatically to ensure that every part of Scotland, regardless of its geography, is known about and advertised enough. We must not get bogged down in the traditional notion that Scotland is only the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>There is evidence of concerning trends. For example, New Lanark&#8212;the 13<sup>th</sup> most visited attraction in the greater Glasgow and Clyde valley area&#8212;attracted 354,425 visitors in 2006. That total was down by 2.3 per cent from the 2005 figure of 362,850. The Government and its agencies must be conscious of the requirement continually to raise their game across all of Scotland in attracting tourists from both within and outwith Scotland.</p><p>I want to ensure that the homecoming celebrations in 2009 are not just about the Highlands and Islands or Scotland's major cities. Emigration from the south of Scotland was also significant, so no area of Scotland should be neglected. The Government's idea of enticing back the Scottish diaspora is to be commended. I agree with Alasdair Allan that our diaspora is an untapped resource that is long overdue appropriate attention. Many historians have suggested that the forgotten cousin of the Highland clearances&#8212;the Lowland clearances&#8212;had a greater impact than its northern relative. Without wanting to engage in a debate about whether one clearance was more devastating than <place-holder colnum=\"3917\"/> another, I gently remind the Government that the south of Scotland, which I represent, has much to offer and a history that is equally rich and engaging.</p><p>Indeed, one reason why 2009 was picked as the year for the homecoming celebration is that it is the year in which we commemorate the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns. If he was alive today, he would be one of my constituents. Cathy Jamieson did a good job in highlighting the need to sell the Ayrshire aspect of that.</p><p>We need to ensure that everyone globally knows about what Scotland can offer. That can happen only with effective marketing and by building on the excellent global reputation that Scotland is lucky enough to possess.</p><p>We should be rightly proud of what Scotland has to offer for tourists from all parts of the world and from all walks of life. As VisitScotland implements its strategy to boost revenues by 2015, it should do so in an innovative, sustainable manner that promotes the attractions that are to be found in every part of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue and to do my bit to sell the south of Scotland.

It gives the Scottish Government the opportunity to respond to the super-complaint from the consumer group Which? and the Office of Fair Trading's findings.

In general, Which? believes that multidisciplinary practices would enhance services and bring costs down for clients.</p><p>Whether or not there is agreement on the Which? proposals, it is clear that there is a need for change, but we must ensure that any change is carefully considered. As we move forward to do that, it is important that the Parliament and the Government work with industry to ensure that we find a regulatory framework that is fair and appropriate to Scotland's specific circumstances, as has been acknowledged by the cabinet secretary. Indeed, in its response to the Which? complaint, the OFT&#8212;despite regarding the current regulation of legal services as restrictive&#8212;said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the OFT notes that the legal services market in Scotland is different from that in England and Wales. The OFT also considers that it is important to develop an appropriate Scottish solution to any perceived problems ... the OFT has not assumed that the changes currently being made in England and Wales will be automatically suitable for the Scottish market.\"</p><p>Of course, the debate is not just about ensuring service delivery, or whether there should be regulation. As Pauline McNeill's amendment shows, it is about the kind of regulation that we should have and equal access to justice, especially for those who need it most and those who would be most at risk of losing that access in an unregulated market. As highlighted by Rhoda Grant, with her experience of the Highlands and Islands, that is particularly important in rural communities. It is also true of the areas that make up the South of Scotland region. We must not leave the industry to the whims of the free market, as that would be bad not only for practitioners but for consumers.</p><p>I spoke to a local solicitor in Carluke, who told me that, like every other industry, solicitors have witnessed a lot of changes to their working practices over the years. I was told that it was becoming increasingly difficult for rural offices to recruit new trainees&#8212;and to recruit people, full stop&#8212;and that more and more small, individual firms are being merged and amalgamated. The Law Society of Scotland concurred with that when it said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Rural practices report difficulty in attracting staff and family law practices may be withdrawing from legal aid provision.\"</p><p>In addition, when small firms try to concentrate on and specialise in specific areas, such as conveyancing, there is a latent fear that, eventually, the bigger, amalgamated firms will take away their business. Given that that is the fear now, the situation can only get worse, especially if the free market is allowed to prevail, so careful <place-holder colnum=\"3434\"/> consideration must be given not only to supporting small firms but to allowing bigger firms to use their expertise to compete in a growing international arena. At present, Scottish solicitors work in 44 countries throughout the world. It is clear that a balance needs to be struck.</p><p>The situation demonstrates the importance of ensuring that any regulations are appropriate, that they meet the particular needs of our dispersed communities, and that they recognise the distinctiveness of the Scottish legal practice and its growing international influence. However, no one is saying that the status quo should remain. That is the view not only of the small firm in Carluke but of the Law Society of Scotland, as expressed in its consultation on alternative business structures. The consultation is a useful document that excellently and thoughtfully gets across what we must strive to obtain from people in the legal world. The Law Society acknowledges that things need to change, but it urges us to be mindful that change must never come at the cost of quality or of the much-cherished independence of our legal system. Independence is one of the most important elements of the system's operation; the independence of advocates and of solicitor firms is fundamental to the legal profession.</p><p>I am no legal expert, but I know what I do not want as a consumer: I do not want to be ripped off or given legal advice that discloses confidential information about me or that is not in my best interest. Instead, I want any solicitor whom I hire to respect me and the rule of law, and to behave with honesty and integrity. It is encouraging that the Law Society's council shares those views and is conscious that any changes in business delivery models must protect not just the core values but the client.</p><p>Smaller Scottish legal practices should have the opportunity to expand and innovate in a way that provides communities and individuals who have recourse to the law with the access that they need.</p><p>We must protect our legal system. I think that there is agreement that while the quasi-liberalisation practices that have recently been endorsed in the UK's other legal jurisdictions&#8212;England and Wales&#8212;may be suitable for those countries, they are certainly not suitable for Scotland. We need only look at what is happening to the Post Office to realise what happens when industries that provide vital and specialised public services are forced to deregulate and open up to the wrong kinds of competition. Thousands of local post offices are being closed or are proposed for closure, and the range of services that is provided by the few, increasingly centralised branches that remain is being reduced.<place-holder colnum=\"3435\"/></p><p>We can learn lessons from such an approach to regulatory reform.

Given that we all agree how crucial it is to have healthy, happy, informed, inquisitive, aspiring and involved children, we might think that one of the things that the new Scottish Parliament would have done in 1999 would be to look at an overarching strategy to help us help our children become all those things. That would have been a fitting intervention for the early years of our Parliament. That is why I was pleased to hear our Minister for Children and Early Years talk so passionately and with such commitment about a comprehensive plan to do the best for Scotland's children.</p><p>The nine-year-old strategy that I mentioned a moment ago&#8212;\"Meeting the Childcare Challenge: A Childcare Strategy for Scotland\"&#8212;was not so much an early years strategy as a plan to provide more accessible child care. That is important, of course, and it is something that the SNP supports, but it is not the end of the story. Doing the best for children is not just about education. It is also about health. If children are well nourished, fit and healthy, they will learn better. If they are emotionally secure and their psychological needs are taken care of, their minds will be free to learn. That, too, will enable them to learn better.</p><p>Doing the best for children is about social interaction. It is our duty to create an environment in which children have access to a variety of experiences and adult influences. If they have that access, their learning will deepen.</p><p>Doing the best for children is about having loving, supportive families, as Elizabeth Smith noted. It is society's duty to support families and enable them to provide the right environments for their children. Children thrive in stable, loving environments, where their capacity to learn increases.</p><p>Doing the best for children is also about wealth and poverty. The link between poverty and learning is unquestionable, as are the words of Douglas Hamilton, the head of policy and research at Save the Children, who said of the child poverty figures in March:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Executive and the UK Government strategies have not gone nearly far enough&#8212;the figures are disgraceful.\"</p><p>As the minister said, the SNP Government takes seriously its pledge to eradicate poverty. As we do so, children will be free to learn and they will do so better.</p><p>It is right to invest time and money in our children's early years, but it also makes economic <place-holder colnum=\"2870\"/> sense. When the Work Foundation published the results of a major investigation into the early years, it came to the following conclusion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Many of society's most intractable social problems&#8212;crime, drugs misuse, unemployment, poor skills and endemic unhappiness&#8212;are rooted in the experiences of children during their first five years of life.\"</p><p>If we get things right in the first five years, we will undoubtedly save money that would otherwise be spent on dealing with the effects of crime and drugs. The Work Foundation estimates that, for every &#163;1 that is spent on helping families and young people who are at risk, up to &#163;17 of public expenditure can be saved. If the conclusions of the Work Foundation's studies are correct, we have only a short period of time in which to influence and encourage children positively, so we must not waste any more time.</p><p>What do we have to do? For a start, we need to ensure that our children are fit and healthy. The introduction of the free school meals pilot is a terrific start and is heading in the right direction. Many children go to school without having breakfast and rarely eat a nutritious meal. Our approach is simply common sense.</p><p>Often, common sense is all that is needed to help to improve children's lives. That is why I find the actions of South Lanarkshire Council&#8212;with particular reference to getting children fit&#8212;bizarre. I will give an example of something that happened at a school in Carluke in the south of Scotland. To encourage participation in sport, the school has new enclosed playing fields. That is good news so far. From afar, they look like bright, new, shiny, wonderful facilities, but on closer inspection the surfaces are not grass or new age Astroturf but tarmac.

It will not help us to find the next James McFadden.</p><p>Learning happens not only in nurseries and primary schools but throughout people's lives. We <place-holder colnum=\"2871\"/> have to ensure that children's life experiences are about more than home and school. They need to venture out into wider society, but that is becoming more and more difficult. We have all seen the report by Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People, which says that nearly half of the adults who were surveyed fear being wrongly accused of harming a child and will not volunteer to work with them. Often, that means that local clubs and organisations are not set up. If children are denied access to such clubs, they miss out on other parts of life that will add depth and fun to the learning experiences that they get in the classroom.</p><p>The arguments for focusing on the early years are compelling.

I should have realised that nothing had changed when the very next year I, along with thousands of other students across Scotland, had to pay for my education.</p><p>In 1997, Tony Blair told us that the Conservatives' broken promises had tainted all politics. In comparison, his tenure would be hallmarked by the politics not of a revolution, but of a fresh start. His Britain would be respected in the world for the integrity with which it conducted its foreign relations. The new Labour Government would make the protection and promotion of human rights a central part of its foreign policy.</p><p>However, as the years rolled on, it became clear that new Labour's foreign policy would be far removed from the appealing words that were spoken at the beginning of the party's term in office. As Alex Neil said, if we want to see a genuine example of a broken promise, we need <place-holder colnum=\"2440\"/> only look to the actions of the new Labour Government in waging war on Iraq. Broken promises are not just an element of London new Labour; unfortunately, as we have heard at length, they are a not-too-distant feature of Scottish new Labour.</p><p>Education was to be a key theme for Labour in 2003. In its 2003 manifesto, it told us that class sizes in maths and English at secondary 1 and secondary 2 levels would be reduced to 20 and that additional teachers would be deployed to meet that goal, which had the explicit backing of Labour's Liberal Democrat colleagues. We were also promised maximum class sizes of 25 for primary 1 pupils. Despite being in power for eight years, the Labour-Liberal coalition failed to deliver on that promise.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broken Promises"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take members back to 3 May 1997, which was a bright, sunny day.

When some questioned how Crichton could be saved without amending the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, and others suggested that only a miracle could save it, the new Government stepped in and took full, considered and direct action to ensure its future. That action is a good example of Government working as it should. There was no humming and hawing; positive action was taken. That contrasts with the previous Executive, which failed to deal satisfactorily with the precarious situation that the Crichton faced for more than a year.</p><p>Although the new Government can take some of the credit, it should not take it all. In addition to all those whom Derek Brownlee cited, quite correctly, as having been involved with the campaign, I note that the Crichton university campus students association ran an excellent campaign with the assistance of students and staff, which attracted attention and captured the imagination. As Elaine Murray mentioned, the students' passion for their place of learning was shown by walking 100 miles to the University of Glasgow, by producing a book of essays on how important the campus is for them, and by holding demonstrations and organising a letter writing campaign. That tenacity and dedication should not go unnoticed by the <place-holder colnum=\"1544\"/> Parliament, so I am pleased that the campaigners are given due credit in the motion.</p><p>We are an open Parliament and we are accountable to the people. We need to respond to the people's wants and needs, and to do so for the greater good of the country. I can only imagine how delighted the students must be with the success of their campaign. I say that I can only imagine because, although I marched as a student along with thousands of others, our calls for free education fell on deaf ears.</p><p>Support for the campus has come not just from Dumfries and Galloway but from across the world, which demonstrates the wonderful international reputation of the Crichton campus. The issue grabbed the attention and united staff, students and politicians in such a profound way because the campus has proven to be such a huge success. It has provided a useful seat of learning to those who would not normally have access to higher education. The fact that 56 per cent of the student intake comprises students who are the first in their family to attend university is hugely significant. It is also significant that students from more than 20 countries around the world choose Dumfries as their place of study.</p><p>The campus has also proven to be vital to the vibrancy and long-term sustainability of the rural south-west of Scotland. Providing access to further education and university education is essential if rural areas are to keep young and ambitious folk. As Alasdair Morgan and Murdo Fraser correctly pointed out, if that is not offered, young people will simply leave. With the announcement of new opportunities at undergraduate and postgraduate level and improved education, infrastructure and health provision, the campus has the opportunity to develop in an exciting way&#8212;as Chris Harvie mentioned earlier&#8212;that will assist the whole of the south of Scotland to flourish.</p><p>When the Crichton was opened, the previous Executive was rightly proud of the innovative nature of the project. The new Government is carrying on that work and helping to develop that vision further. If we want a smarter Scotland, we need to ensure that education is accessible to everyone, not just those who live near a city. When we find something that works, such as the Crichton campus, it is down to us to protect it.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crichton University Campus"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a South of Scotland MSP, I am delighted that the new SNP Government managed to save and develop access to university education at the Crichton campus in Dumfries.

It does so for three reasons. First, children get more attention from their teachers. Secondly, if there are fewer children in the classroom, there are fewer distractions in the learning area. Thirdly, children forge better relationships not only with their teachers but with their fellow pupils. The Educational Institute of Scotland recognises that, which explains why it vociferously supports reductions in class sizes.</p><p>In \"The Scots' Crisis of Confidence\", Carol Craig argues that Scots collectively and individually lack confidence, which has knock-on implications for our economic growth, enterprise, physical and mental health, and creativity. We need to shift the cannae-do and \"Ah kent yer faither\" mentality to one that values excellence and encourages and praises effort and determination. A positive child-focused education system, combined with smaller class sizes in the early years, would make a great difference. If we ensure now that there are fewer children in P1 to P3 classrooms, we will have more confident, ambitious and successful Scots in the years and decades ahead. I hope that the Government agrees that we must do everything in our power to create happy and confident kids.</p><p>Last week, I had the pleasure of attending a global schools initiative event at the Scottish Storytelling Centre. A teacher told me that the Scottish kids were in awe of their African and Asian peers who had travelled to Scotland as part of that valuable global exchange. The Scottish kids were struck by the visitors' ability to speak confidently and eloquently in public. There is an endemic lack of confidence in our society, so much so that we consider that lack an unfortunate Scottish trait. However, Scottish children are as <place-holder colnum=\"915\"/> able as children from Africa, Asia, Europe or anywhere else in the world. We must ensure that our education policies address their lack of confidence.</p><p>The Scottish education system was&#8212;in many respects it still is&#8212;the envy of the world because of its ability to give every child a decent education, regardless of where he or she comes from. I hope that the Government will retain that principle. However, we must remember that despite that principle, it is often the poorest children in society who are most disadvantaged, as Ian McKee correctly noted. Urgent anti-poverty strategies must be implemented to work in tandem with all other social policy issues. In its recent report, UNICEF stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The evidence from many countries persistently shows that children who grow up in poverty are more vulnerable: specifically, they are more likely ... to have learning and behavioural difficulties, to underachieve at school ... to have lower skills and aspirations, to be low paid, unemployed, and welfare dependent.\"</p><p>I am sure that all members have seen the shameful child-poverty statistics from Save the Children. We must realise that we cannot ignore anti-poverty strategies when we discuss education and the goal to have a smarter Scotland. No child should be born to fail in a country with as much potential as Scotland. I hope that the Government will acknowledge that as it implements its new policies. We need to raise the aspirations and hopes of all children in our nation and ensure that they are never written off.</p><p>Confidence, anti-poverty measures and small class sizes have the potential to kick-start our economy by helping our country to become smarter and more successful. We might not reap the benefits immediately, but as politicians we must recognise that we should act for the good of society and our country with long-term thoughts in mind. We need to coax and encourage our children&#8212;the future generation&#8212;to realise that they are valued, wanted and needed in our society. Building confidence in the early years is one way to do that.</p><p>The power of the issue was made abundantly clear to me when I participated in a hustings that South Lanarkshire Council held in Hamilton during the election campaign. Schoolchildren from throughout Lanarkshire were present, and after the debate they were asked to use electronic keypads to vote on the matters that affect them the most. The poll showed that one of the biggest issues that concern young people at school is the lack of self-confidence. We must take note of that. If Carol Craig is correct, we can expect to improve economic growth, enterprise, physical and mental health and creativity by tackling the crisis of confidence in young Scottish children.

I particularly welcome the comments on the new entrants scheme and the commitment to bringing new blood into the industry.</p><p>The reason that I have chosen to make my maiden speech in this debate is that rural issues and agriculture are close to my heart. I am the daughter of a tenant farmer and represent the largely rural south of Scotland. I will take great notice of today's words and future action.</p><p>Farming is not an easy occupation. Indeed, to call it simply an occupation does a disservice to that valuable way of life, which is being eroded by mounting bureaucracy, paperwork, red tape and legislation.</p><p>Members who represent rural constituencies and regions will no doubt be aware of the NFU manifesto, which noted that 2,281 pieces of European Community legislation covering agriculture were in force, with a further 568 pieces of legislation on the environment. On top of us are rules covering food hygiene, employment law and animal safety.</p><p>In addition to those rules, quangos hold a Big Brother-like control over the industry. Agencies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency have grown in authority, placing another noose around agriculture's neck. I hope that the minister's actions echo the words of John Swinney and that he looks to rein in the power of such bodies as part of the useful process of slimming down Government.</p><p>We must remember that farmers are primarily food producers. We are a country blessed with the finest food and products and possess a worldwide reputation for quality. It is unbelievable that we do not use that in our best interests, as Christine Grahame was right to note. Our schools and hospitals are providing food that is purchased cheaply to save costs, but the reality is that those decisions cost us dearly.</p><p>We need to be more aware of the impact that our decision to buy strawberries in winter has on the environment. I am not suggesting that we completely remove consumer choice, but we need to raise awareness of what we produce in <place-holder colnum=\"277\"/> Scotland and how foods are produced. As part of a joined-up approach to addressing the health and well-being of our nation, we have to raise awareness of how locally produced foods can help our nation become healthier.</p><p>We need look only to our neighbours in Finland, who reversed their appalling health trends by using the rich source of nutritious berries growing right on their doorstep. That example of how a small country can affect positively the health of the nation using local produce should not escape the attention of our new Executive. We are in real need of action on this, because there have only ever been warm words.</p><p>I went to a rural primary school surrounded by fields of potatoes, but we were served potato waffles and frozen chips. The situation has changed little. I trust that in 2007 we will finally take action to reverse years of neglecting our local producers in favour of the cheapest option. That is why I urge the Executive to examine the possibility of using what is on our doorstep and helping our farmers by using their produce to feed the mouths of the next generation of consumers.</p><p>It is up to us as parliamentarians to set an example and promote, where possible, producers in our constituencies and regions. I plug the Clyde valley, the garden of Scotland, which produces the finest tomatoes. In that case&#8212;and, I am sure, in many others&#8212;the label \"Grown in Scotland\" truly is the mark of quality.</p><p>I am sure that the Executive will be interested in a conversation that I had with a Clydesdale farmer I met at the Lesmahagow show. He is involved with the Royal Highland Education Trust and he is keen to see the expansion of many of its initiatives, such as farmers visiting schools and school pupils visiting farms. I agree that if such initiatives were expanded they could be a useful tool in educating youngsters about where their food comes from.</p><p>Furthermore, I hope that the Executive shares my thoughts about placing Scotland on the international stage. Scotland's food has an excellent reputation and its quality shines through. In my opinion, the marketing of it has let the industry down. We should follow the Irish example, as Brian Adam suggested. Ireland markets its produce well and participates in international conferences and exhibitions much more prominently than Scotland does. I am confident that the new cabinet secretary and minister will be more than capable of releasing that untapped potential.</p><p>There is more to rural development than farming and food. I hope that the announcements made today and the future course that the new rural team takes will kick-start a rural renaissance that <place-holder colnum=\"278\"/> values local over global and acknowledges that co-operation in all areas, strands and avenues is the way to take our rural communities forward.</p><p>One example of co-operation in progress is the Biggar eco forum, which is making an ambitious attempt to make Biggar the first carbon-neutral community in Scotland. I visited the forum in May and was impressed by its emphasis on raising environmental issues, highlighting ways to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> output and attempting to create a viable, sustainable rural economy with the support of local businesses, schools and churches. I hope that the minister will join me in congratulating those responsible for the initiative and perhaps even pay the forum a visit.</p><p>We all understand that a multifaceted approach to the development of the rural economy is needed to ensure its viability. I have concentrated on farming, food and local issues that have been raised with me, but I could have spoken about so much more.
