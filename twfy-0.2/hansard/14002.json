For a start, it fails to properly fund the Government&#8217;s council tax freeze, meaning that, yet again, the freeze will be paid for through increased charges and reduced services for those who need them most and through the loss of thousands of local government jobs.</p><p>The budget does not reinstate the disproportionate cuts in the further education budget. The 3,500 college places that were announced yesterday, however welcome, hardly compensate for the 140,000 fewer college students in our colleges today.</p><p>The budget, wrongly in our view, prioritises the extension of free school meals to better-off&#8212;not well-off, but better-off&#8212;families over accelerating the provision of childcare to half of Scotland&#8217;s two-year-olds. Then there is the &#163;1 billion-worth of anti-poverty programmes that have disappeared since 2007.</p><p>It is good, then, that the cabinet secretary is not tempted by the rather juvenile argument that to support a budget is to support its every measure and that to reject it is to reject everything in it. In that spirit, we have seen the budget this year as an opportunity to achieve something that both we and the SNP and, I think, others such as Green colleagues believe to be desirable, and that is simply an end to the impact of the bedroom tax on council and housing association tenants in Scotland. That would be the effect of the Parliament agreeing to the amendment in my name today.</p><p>It is worth reflecting on how far we have already come. In September, the draft budget contained no money to alleviate the bedroom tax. The cabinet secretary was adamant that it was a UK Government measure, which it is, and he would not let it off the hook. Of course, it was the 80,000 affected households that were left on the hook of the bedroom tax; in fairness, by October, the Scottish Government had relented and found &#163;20 million in the budget, although that was still short of what is required.</p><p>In December, the cabinet secretary argued that social security legislation meant that the sum could not be further increased. When I argued otherwise, I recall the Deputy First Minister heckling me from a sedentary position with the cry, &#8220;Where is the money coming from?&#8221; The fact is that I always had confidence&#8212;more than his Cabinet colleague, it would seem&#8212;that Mr Swinney could find the funds to complete the total &#163;50 million package that is required to match the cost of the bedroom tax to Scottish tenants. This week, the same Deputy First Minister popped up in the Daily Record to say that the money was there after all, as Mr Swinney confirmed today, but that the DWP cap must be lifted.</p><p>We have always said that there are other legal and legitimate ways to use the money to help the victims of the bedroom tax, so last week we presented to the cabinet secretary a proposal for an additional tenant assistance scheme with two elements, one for local authorities and one for housing associations. The proof that it can work is that it already does, in Renfrewshire Council and East Lothian Housing Association. Both have been checked, either by Audit Scotland or by lawyers, and both, in essence, do the same thing&#8212;they write off small amounts of arrears rather than paying tenants, so they do not fall foul of benefits legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When we last debated the budget, the cabinet secretary, in an exchange with Patrick Harvie, said that &#8220;a judgment has to be made as to whether the elements of the budget can be sufficiently considered by individual members and parties to be in the correct balance and therefore worthy of support, despite the fact that not all provisions within the budget may be to their...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Gray", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80468", "house": "4", "member_id": "80468", "person_id": "14002", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "East Lothian"}, "section_id": "22882223", "hpos": "109", "gid": "2014-02-05.19.9", "epobject_id": "22882232", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2014-02-05.19.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14002+section%3Asp#g19.9", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80468"}, {"body": "<p>It is clear that it is always better to avoid debt, but the important thing here is that, come what may, we do the thing that we want to do.</p><p>The cabinet secretary considered the scheme that was presented to him with understandable caution but with a commendably open mind, and our amendment reflects the discussions that we have had. With thanks to Renfrewshire Council and East Lothian Housing Association for their help, we are almost there. The full &#163;50 million funding is in place, and if the DWP restriction remains, a workable alternative exists. Our amendment endorses that position.</p><p>Like Mr Swinney, I want the abolition of the policy rather than the mitigation of its effects. I want the tax to be abolished by a Labour Government next year. I understand that Mr Swinney and his colleagues want it to be abolished in 2016, in an independent Scotland. I think that my way is better, because it will lift the yoke from tenants in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle, as well as those in Scotland.</p><p>However, to be honest, those who are affected are not too worried about who abolishes the tax. We can decide today that no household in Scotland need pay the bedroom tax and that none should face eviction solely because of it, and we should make that decision.</p><p>To achieve that, we must&#8212;in the words of the prophet&#8212;act justly, love kindness and walk humbly, and we must support the amendment. We should act justly because most victims of the bedroom tax cannot choose to move to a smaller house, as no such houses are available to them. We would act justly because, with full funding, a choice will not need to be made about who to help and who not to help. We would act justly because the protection from eviction will extend to all tenants and not just tenants of councils that have no-evictions policies.</p><p>As for kindness, to support the amendment is to reject explicitly the cruelty of an all-too-common rhetoric that suggests that those who are affected by welfare reforms are feckless benefit scroungers who live in palatial accommodation. The truth is that most families who are affected by the bedroom tax are working, that 80 per cent have a family member with a disability and that the spare rooms are needed for carers, medical equipment or children who are spending time with an estranged parent.</p><p>I acknowledge that we and the Government will have to walk humbly. The Government will have to set aside the constitutional argument and accept that getting tenants off the hook is more important than leaving Whitehall on it, while we must acknowledge that, in this at least, the Government has not left Scotland on pause but acted and done the right thing. Even greater humility will be required if the Tories or Liberal Democrats are to support our amendment, given that it is needed only because of the wrong-headed policy of their Westminster colleagues, but I hope that they will consider it.</p><p>Yesterday was a good day for the Parliament. In passing the equal marriage bill, we rose to the singular historic moment and we were the Parliament that we were meant to be&#8212;we were shaping a more modern and inclusive Scotland. Today, we can rise above party differences again and do the right thing again&#8212;this time, in response not to the historic moment but to the daily, relentless and unfair difficulties and challenges of life that far too many of our fellow citizens face.</p><p>We can be the Parliament that we were set up to be again today, by exercising our power to protect our people. To paraphrase Donald Dewar, who is the nearest thing that this place has to a prophet&#8212;although I can hear him snorting with derision at the description&#8212;we can carry ourselves well again today.</p><p>When the budget was introduced, I called it a &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat, do nothing and get through the referendum&#8221; budget. If we agree to my amendment, we will have turned it into a &#8220;sink the bedroom tax boat to the bottom of the sea&#8221; budget. That is something that is worth doing.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-08914.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;but, in so doing, considers that funds be allocated in the total amount needed to fully mitigate the so-called bedroom tax in Scotland through discretionary housing payments and, if necessary, other schemes administered by local authorities and housing associations to ensure that no tenant need face eviction as a result of the bedroom tax.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is clear that it is always better to avoid debt, but the important thing here is that, come what may, we do the thing that we want to do.

That was the theme of almost every committee report on the budget this year, and it was reiterated by almost every expert witness whom those committees heard. The Finance Committee report summed it up bluntly. It said that there is</p><p>&#8220;no link between the Government&#8217;s spending plans ... and the intended impact&#8221;.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, and the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee all echoed that.</p><p>When we last debated the budget, just before Christmas, Mr Swinney suggested that when indicators move in the right direction, that in and of itself is the proof that he has a plan and it is working. To a degree, he did that again today with regard to the employment figures, which is not surprising following today&#8217;s welcome improvement in the unemployment and employment figures. However, I presume that, when we see more families resorting to food banks, falling into fuel poverty or rent arrears, more in homeless accommodation, increasing numbers of our young people not in employment, education or training, a 37 per cent drop in college admissions, or our carbon emission indicators going in the wrong direction, that means that he has no plan or that the plan is not working.</p><p>That is not a new feature of this year&#8217;s budget; rather, it is a pattern over time. Take the challenge of eradicating poverty. What could be more important or desirable? In 2007, Mr Swinney inherited a budget in which &#163;1.5 billion-worth of anti-poverty spending could be readily identified; indeed, he badged &#163;160 million of it as the fairer Scotland fund. Seven years on, &#163;1 billion of that, including the fairer Scotland fund, has disappeared.</p><p>The budget fails to rise to the challenges that Scotland faces. It is a steady-as-she-goes budget that changes little and risks less to get the Government past its only real objective: the referendum in September.

There is a long way to go yet. It is true, too, that too many of the jobs that have been created are insecure, temporary, part-time, zero-hours contracts or simply poorly paid. There are around 250,000 underemployed workers in Scotland, which is about 10 per cent of the workforce, which is an increase of 76,000 since 2008. Those are Scots who are in work but without enough work or enough of a wage to meet their families&#8217; needs, far less their aspirations.</p><p>Meanwhile, recent analysis has shown that the proportion of the Scottish workforce earning less than the living wage has steadily increased since 2000; 820,000 Scots are stuck in low pay. Across the piece, the workforce has seen wages fall in real terms in every single month since 2010, with the exception of one.</p><p>When we welcome the signs of recovery, therefore, many Scots will be left puzzled because, in insecure, underpaid jobs, with wages buying less every month, it hardly feels like a recovery to them. We know that an economy built on insecure, low-paid, low-skilled jobs is not a sustainable 21st century economy. The Government&#8217;s motion implies that it understands that but it also implies&#8212;and the cabinet secretary reiterated this&#8212;that as a devolved Government it can do little to address that. That is not true. The cabinet secretary and I agree that Government spending is a key lever to stimulate the economy. I certainly agree with him when he says that the UK Government has failed to use those levers as it should have done.</p><p>However, Government spending in Scotland is still billions of pounds a year. There is spending on capital projects, but there are also contracts for goods and services and support for economic development. The Government could do much more to ensure that that spending underpins high-quality, properly paid employment. All Government contracts should support jobs that pay the living wage, insist on the creation of local employment opportunities, create training and apprenticeship places and avoid exploitative zero-hours contracts.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22827587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The improvements in the employment and economic positions and the signs of economic recovery outlined by the cabinet secretary are very welcome.

Mr Gibson took us through that extremely eloquently at the start. Not only did the committee, as it has sometimes only done, scrutinise what is up and what is down in the budget, but it took a longer-term, more strategic look at how the budget underpins the Government&#8217;s objectives.</p><p>After all, it is now six years ago that the Scottish Government unveiled its purpose&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>along with five objectives, 16 national outcomes and no fewer than 50 national indicators, all woven together into a purpose framework and tracked in a national performance framework.</p><p>In the course of his evidence, the cabinet secretary told the committee,</p><p>&#8220;I am not sure that it is vital that it is understood by members of the public&#8221;,&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 4 November 2013; c 3242.]</p><p>which may be just as well, but made much&#8212;fairly&#8212;of the complements that many witnesses paid to the national performance framework as an approach. However, he cannot then simply ignore the fact that, one after another, those expert witnesses told the committee members of their concern that they could find no connection between the Government&#8217;s purpose and its spending decisions.</p><p>Mr Gibson quoted his committee&#8217;s adviser, who said:</p><p>&#8220;There is &#8230; no link between the Government&#8217;s spending plans &#8230; and the intended impact&#8221;.</p><p>However, not only the Finance Committee found that. The Health and Sport Committee also reported on the</p><p>&#8220;lack of clear links &#8230; between the information in the Draft Budget and the indicators&#8221;,</p><p>and the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee concluded:</p><p>&#8220;There is no attempt to link spend to specific Targets or Indicators.&#8221;</p><p>The fact that no committee could find any link between the budget and what it is supposed to be for cannot simply be dismissed. Whether it was making Scotland wealthier, fairer, healthier or greener, our committees could see no plan, strategy or targeting of resources.</p><p>Mr Swinney says that we should not worry about that because we should test against outcomes, so let us do that.</p><p>Unemployment figures may be improving, but there are still 75,000 more Scots on the dole than when the Scottish National Party came to power. More and more Scots who are in work earn less than the living wage, more are in part-time work and more are on zero-hours contracts. Those are not outcomes with which we can be satisfied.</p><p>Let us look at the health service. The budget claims to protect the health service&#8212;the First Minister made much of that earlier today&#8212;but a recent survey showed us that less than one third of NHS staff think that we have enough doctors and nurses, and marginally over half think that the NHS puts patients first. That is in a week when what must be one of the most damning reports into any hospital that the Parliament has ever seen was published. Those are not outcomes with which we can be satisfied.</p><p>When the cabinet secretary published his budget, he made much of an increase in the housing line, but the truth is that he is simply restoring cuts that, at one point, cut the housing budget in half. Every year, he tells us that he intends to build his way out of recession but, last year, fewer houses were built than at any time since 1946, 20 per cent fewer social rented houses were completed than in the year before and waiting lists spiralled.</p><p>As for the future lifeblood of the country, Mr Gibson is right that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee was concerned to find than the number of 16 to 19-year-olds not in employment, education or training is not reducing. In fact, it increased last year.</p><p>As for creating a fairer Scotland, the SNP inherited &#163;1.5 billion of anti-poverty programmes and &#163;1 billion of those programmes has disappeared. Is it any wonder that we still have 200,000 children living in poverty?</p><p>The connection between those decisions and the outcomes does not seem too complex to me.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s spin doctors rather let the cat out of the bag when the budget was published, because they briefed that it was a budget for independence. Of course, that is the Government&#8217;s actual and only objective. It is a budget to get through the referendum, so steady as she goes. Difficult decisions are dodged, responsibility is refused and no horses are frightened. That is not good enough.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary wants us to believe that the budget is about more than that, he should start by making two changes. First, he should use the consequentials from the autumn statement to extend 600 hours of nursery provision to 50 per cent of two-year-olds right now. Secondly, he should identify the money and the means to mitigate the whole impact of the bedroom tax; &#163;20&#160;million is less than half of what is needed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Finance Committee is to be congratulated on the approach that it has taken to the budget this year.

To that degree, we can claim that the landfill tax has been a success. At the time of its introduction, 54 million tonnes of municipal waste were sent to landfill per annum UK wide. By 2012, the figure had fallen to 19 million tonnes. Therefore, the tax that we inherit is a successful one, which is why it has support from across the chamber and those of all shades of political view. In legislating to pursue landfill tax as a devolved tax, the most important thing must be to create a framework that ensures that the tax continues that success. After all, by the Scottish Government&#8217;s own calculation, landfill still emitted in 2011 the equivalent of 600,000 tonnes of CO2 into our atmosphere.</p><p>What the devolution of landfill tax does then is to give us the opportunity to consider how it operates and how we might use and change it so that it even more effectively and further reduces waste. It seems common sense that there is a law of diminishing returns here, with the gains made from a serious effort at recycling and reusing being easy progress to secure in the early years, and as time goes on there being a necessity to try harder and be smarter about how we deploy measures such as the landfill tax to get further gains.</p><p>Therefore, it is a pity that about something as basic as the rate itself and how many rates there might be, we still know very little. The cabinet secretary has said at every stage that he is minded to set a rate that is no lower than the one that he will inherit in April 2015, although he will not confirm that for us until September next year. At stage 1, there was considerable debate around waste tourism and whether differential rates would lead to reduced income as landfill was exported to England or, conversely, whether waste would be imported to landfill in Scotland. I do not think that we ever really got to the bottom of that, with the cabinet secretary expressing a view that it becomes an issue only if there is a differential of &#163;15 per tonne, although committee witnesses suggested that &#163;10 per tonne would provoke such an effect.</p><p>That issue matters because it implies a rather limited capacity for us to use the new powers to choose our own rates and it seems to me to reflect a rather cautious approach by the cabinet secretary. Perhaps it is for the same reasons that we still do not have an indication of whether the Government favours an escalator in rates. That has been significant in the landfill tax&#8217;s success in the past, as there is surely a connection between its effectiveness in reducing waste and the fact that we are heading for a rate 10 times the original one introduced.</p><p>For the moment, we remain in the dark on whether the Government has any plans to introduce new rates to differentiate further between types of waste or, indeed, move any categories of waste between existing bands. The landfill tax is a fairly blunt instrument and an opportunity seems to have been missed to explore properly whether and how we could sharpen it. However, as regulations follow the legislation, we will no doubt return to those issues because there is a pressing need for action on waste and carbon, and we must do more than simply frame the bill.</p><p>On the positive side, I am pleased that if and when the changes are made, they will now be subject to the affirmative procedure. I am glad that the cabinet secretary listened to representations to that end. I regret that he did not find a way to meet on the face of the bill Michael McMahon&#8217;s concerns about the danger that the landfill communities fund might be diverted from the communities that are most affected by landfill. However, overall, the landfill tax is useful. It will now be appropriately devolved and it is potentially a powerful tool for the Parliament in pursuit of our environmental agenda.

I say to Mr Mason that it is true that we will have to take a lot of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s reassurances on trust. For example, throughout the bill process, he has insisted that the Scottish Government will be able to levy the tax more efficiently than has previously been the case. That would be extremely welcome, but I am not sure that the cabinet secretary has demonstrated why or how it will be possible, particularly because we do not yet know what the administrative arrangements for raising the tax will be. That is something that we have to take on faith.</p><p>We also have to take on faith that the cabinet secretary believes in the principle that communities that are most directly affected by landfill sites will be the ones that benefit directly from the tax credits, as they do at the moment. That is important because, as I have said already, the fund is likely to reduce.</p><p>Communities such as mine in East Lothian have benefited significantly in the past from those tax credits. Although I would be the last not to have faith in the cabinet secretary, he said that he wants to ensure that the communities that suffer get the benefit of the fund and then he said that he also wants to take account of the wider impact on the environment.

On that occasion, I could hardly believe it but the cabinet secretary wilfully misrepresented my argument by suggesting that I was arguing that devolution was now complete and could never develop. That was not my point.</p><p>My point was that the bill demonstrates that devolution is the kind of dynamic and flexible settlement that the people of Scotland want: it allows us to sustain the benefits of shared risk and opportunity by being part of the bigger United Kingdom while making Scottish decisions&#8212;both administrative and fiscal, where that is appropriate&#8212;that enable us to be most effective, for example in reducing waste and landfill.</p><p>We will support the bill at decision time.

I was particularly struck by a couple of exchanges on the welfare budget&#8212;to which significant reductions were proposed in the autumn statement&#8212;which strike at the core of the fallacy of success.</p><p>Gavin Brown said that the welfare budget is going up but is not rising as much as it would have without the austerity programme. That is not the case. The budget for employment support allowance alone has gone up by almost &#163;3 billion, which is more than Mr Osborne predicted, and housing benefit has increased by &#163;2.7 billion more than was predicted. That is because of the austerity programme, the fact that so many people have been thrown out of work and the squeeze on wages, which has led to people qualifying for and claiming more housing benefit.</p><p>The Tories&#8217; desperation in attempting to justify their position reached its nadir when Alex Johnstone called out from a sedentary position while John Swinney was talking about borrowing, &#8220;We are borrowing less.&#8221; The fact of the matter is that George Osborne has borrowed more in the past three years than the Labour Governments did during 13 years of government. He is not borrowing less&#8212;he is borrowing &#163;200 billion more than he planned to.</p><p>The OBR has featured heavily in the debate today. Mr Swinney was almost waxing lyrical about the OBR at one stage, which surprised me a bit, because the OBR papers that accompanied the autumn statement included a downward revision of its own estimates of oil revenues. That poses some problems for Mr Swinney&#8217;s economic forecasts for independence, as oil revenue would be &#163;1.7 billion less than was suggested by the OBR&#8217;s previous forecast, which in itself was significantly lower than Mr Swinney&#8217;s own forecasts.</p><p>I was even more surprised when Kenny Gibson went further and quoted the IFS. Some weeks ago, when the IFS published its report on Scotland, I did the rounds of the television studios with some of Mr Gibson&#8217;s colleagues, who came close to painting the IFS as some kind of satanic cult.

I welcome the measures that the Scottish Government has taken in Glasgow and Rosyth to help with that. I give the workers in Portsmouth a particular mention since, for them, this is more than the ebb and flow of contracts but rather the end of a shipbuilding era. We all, I think, regret that.</p><p>Yet this debate is about opportunity and the potential of a bright future for our defence industries, and rightly so, because they demonstrate what is possible if we seize the opportunities that the United Kingdom gives us. Contrary to the hand wringing that we have heard from SNP members, the UK defence sector is the second largest in Europe and Scotland&#8217;s skills, ingenuity and reliability have always ensured that we punch above our weight in claiming a share of that. We have 10 per cent of the defence jobs. That equates to almost 12,600 people and is way above our population share. We have one third of the UK&#8217;s shipbuilding, which is several times our population share.</p><p>The industry is not just involved in shipbuilding and is not just on the Clyde, as we have Rosyth, too, and the largest defence electronics site in the UK just down the road at Selex Galileo. Indeed, a third of all MOD sites are right here in Scotland and an estimated 50,000 jobs depend on the sector. Just as our electricity industry benefits from the single British energy market and our universities benefit from access to UK-scale research funds, so our defence industry can make the most of a UK defence budget of &#163;34 billion.</p><p>By the way, the cost of Trident&#8212;the centrepiece of the Government amendment&#8212;is included in that defence budget, so an independent Scotland&#8217;s share of that would already be in the &#163;3 billion Scottish defence budget. It is not some extra lottery win to get us out of any fiscal hole that the Government finds itself in on any given day. As for using it for diversification, as the Government amendment suggests, many speakers spoke about the difficulty over decades of finding ways of diversifying in the defence industry. It is not enough just to say the word. We have to hear the actual plans and suggestions.</p><p>The one SNP idea for defence in the future that we know about is the plan to divert half a billion pounds out of the defence budget and put it straight into the coffers of the banks and the energy companies, by cutting their corporation tax. The SNP will replace 11,000 Faslane jobs with bigger bonuses for bankers and bigger profits for the energy companies.</p><p>Wide as our defence sector is, much of the debate has focused on shipbuilding, where the issues are starkest. That is no wonder. The industry&#8217;s heritage looms large in our collective story, and not just for Clydesiders. I am not from Glasgow, as anyone who hears me can tell, but there was a shipyard at the bottom of my granny&#8217;s street in Leith and I remember being shepherded into the hall at primary school to watch the launch of the QE2 on the Clyde on television.</p><p>Four years ago, I was privileged to attend the launch of HMS Defender&#8212;a type 45 frigate&#8212;at Scotstoun. I defy anyone who has a soul not to shed a tear when they watch the chains slip away and 8,500 tonnes of steel slip away with them. The ships are a living testament to and symbol of our capacity to shape not just steel but our world and our destiny. For that reason, the industry&#8217;s story echoes through our story, in prose, poetry and song, and in politics and this Parliament, as Johann Lamont illustrated when she quoted Donald Dewar&#8217;s great speech on the day when the Parliament opened.</p><p>Our ships are more than artefacts of steel. They are packed with the most sophisticated technology ever devised. They are the pinnacle of human ingenuity. The industry therefore deserves rigorous and honest arguments, but it has not heard such arguments from the SNP benches today. We heard tankers being misrepresented as warships that have been built elsewhere. We heard the argument&#8212;absurd, in the 21st century&#8212;that a global corporation such as BAE could not recruit or transfer skills to build ships elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Of course it could. We heard design partnerships being misrepresented as agreements to build abroad. We even heard the argument that, because there have not been as many defence contracts in the past as we would have liked there to be, we should turn our backs on the contracts that are available today. What kind of argument is that?</p><p>Every SNP speaker has quoted Jamie Webster, who said:</p><p>&#8220;If the situation is that Scottish people by democratic vote, vote Yes, I would expect, no sorry, demand, that every single politician of every section supports us to hell and back&#8221;.</p><p>Let us be clear about this&#8212;and this is Mr Brown&#8217;s answer, on Johann Lamont&#8217;s behalf. I have fought for shipbuilding jobs before. I did it in Whitehall when I worked for the Secretary of State for Scotland and, when I was Labour leader here in Holyrood and the carrier contracts were under threat, I suggested to Alex Salmond that we go together to fight for shipbuilding jobs. We did that, going all the way&#8212;not quite to hell but to Liam Fox&#8217;s office, where we made the case and we won.</p><p>If by some chance there is a yes vote next year, I promise that I will stand shoulder to shoulder with Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon or whoever&#8212;even Alex Johnstone&#8212;and argue that the type 26 contracts should stay on the Clyde.

Indeed, my next point rather contradicts Mr Mason&#8217;s point. An examination of the years of devolution would show that powers have shifted almost daily. One example is responsibility for regulation of offshore wind as that industry developed and became more mature. The most recent example is the devolution of council tax benefit and crisis loans&#8212;parts of the benefits system&#8212;within the past year or so.</p><p>Devolution of powers has happened as and when the circumstances have demanded it. That flexibility is what Rhodri Morgan&#8212;for it was he&#8212;meant when he called devolution a process not an event. However, the Calman changes are qualitatively different, in that they begin substantially to address what the commission identified as the greatest weakness of the Scotland Act 1998: the fact that, by international comparisons, that act devolved a remarkable degree of legislative power to the Parliament but much less fiscal power than in other examples of devolution around the world. The changes in the Scotland Act 2012 are intended to redress that imbalance. That is a shift of principle, not just a shift of administrative convenience.</p><p>The commission identified landfill tax as ripe for devolution for two reasons. First, it is a tax based on place&#8212;specifically, where the landfill is sited&#8212;and, therefore, it is immobile and defined by geography. Secondly, it is a tax the purpose of which is fundamentally related to policy areas that were already within the purview of the Parliament, in the form of pursuing sustainability, reducing environmental damage, achieving greater efficiency in the management of waste and playing our part in addressing climate change&#8212;a global challenge, as the cabinet secretary observed in his opening speech. The tax is a crucial lever in the drive to increase recycling and the reuse of our resources and to cut the emissions that damage the planet on which we live.</p><p>The bill may read like something less than epic verse, but it nonetheless exemplifies a powerful argument that we should exercise this power and that our devolution settlement is flexible enough to ensure that we do so.</p><p>That is of course an argument that the Scottish Government sometimes finds inconvenient for its ambitions and thus it resisted it to the last gasp. However, in the spirit of working on common ground, I will say that I am happy that it has embraced it and that we have reached this landmark today. I commend the Government&#8217;s efforts to get the bill in place so that we are ready for April 2015, when the UK landfill tax will be switched off.</p><p>The bill leaves many questions begged. It is framework legislation, with little or no detail as to how ministers plan to deploy the new tax. Most obviously, beyond indicating, as he did again today, that the rates will be set at levels no lower than the UK rates at the time of transfer, the cabinet secretary has said only that September 2014 is the earliest that we will know what the opening rate for the tax will be. Both business and local government have sought an earlier indication and, given that this is a new tax&#8212;a change&#8212;that would seem to me not unreasonable and could help significantly by providing some reassurance. I understand that taxes can change at any time in the future, but perhaps given the circumstances the cabinet secretary might reconsider whether an earlier indication would be possible.</p><p>This is one of those curious taxes that if successful will deliver less and less income to Government. The Government&#8217;s forecasts reflect that properly. However, we have seen figures today that show that only nine councils have met their recycling targets and that some recycled less last year than the year before, not more. We have to consider how the tax will work. The tax is our key lever to transform that situation, so it would be a little more convincing if ministers were a little less cautious and more imaginative in explaining now how they intend to use their new power to use the tax differently, and to set new and different rates, to do exactly that. After all, that would be no more than the cabinet secretary did in introducing the land and buildings transaction tax, when he took the opportunity to create a more progressive regime than the one that he inherited, which is something that we supported.</p><p>One very welcome change to the landfill tax is the power referred to by the cabinet secretary to tax as well as fine illegal landfill sites. Once again, there is a lot of detail still to hear about how that will be enforced and what additional resources SEPA might have at its disposal to pursue that additional revenue. We look forward to hearing more about that during the passage of the bill.</p><p>There are many outstanding questions about the landfill community fund, too. I welcome the fact that the cabinet secretary today indicated an open-mindedness about how we might change and reform that aspect of landfill taxation. Certainly, the increase to 7.34 per cent of tax liability for the fund is welcome. For constituencies such as mine where landfill takes place, those credits can be a very important source of support for local communities. In East Lothian, they fund very diverse activities from the Hi His at Haddington Athletic Football Club to the probably higher-flying puffins of the Scottish Seabird Centre, which is fighting back against tree mallow on the islands of Craigleith and Fidra.</p><p>The 10-mile limit is just that&#8212;a limit. Kenny Gibson was right to say that, particularly in rural Scotland, 10 miles is not really a very great distance. It seems to me that we could relax the limit without losing altogether the principle that the communities affected are the ones that benefit. For example, we could extend eligibility to the whole of the local authority area where landfill takes place, which would take some account of transportation of the waste to the landfill site.</p><p>We are very pleased to see the bill move forward, although we have some concerns about the many questions that its drafting still begs. I accept that primary legislation can suffer from too much as well as too little detail. The Finance Committee made a point about that, too. The committee&#8217;s resolution was the right one, which was to say that in its view changes in the orders regarding new rates, for example, should be subject to the affirmative procedure, which would ensure proper and appropriate scrutiny when they come forward. The Finance Committee made that point effectively during the passage of the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill. Ministers accepted the point in that case and agreed with the argument, and they should do so in this case, as well.</p><p>As with much of our legislation, the dullness is in the detail, but in agreeing to the principles of the bill&#8212;I am sure that we shall do so&#8212;we should not lose sight of the fact that it is but the latest indication that our devolution settlement is a powerful, flexible and dynamic democratic model that is worth fighting to keep.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Actually, I do not.

I am surprised that this is the first time that the subject has been debated in the chamber.</p><p>Last week&#8212;both inside and outside the chamber&#8212;we spent some time exploring our differences with the Scottish Government on aspects of energy policy but, as other members have said, today&#8217;s debate takes place in one of those crucial areas in which we find ourselves largely in agreement with the Government and, indeed, other parties that are represented in the Parliament. We agree on the potential of carbon capture and storage technology, on the urgency of progressing that potential and on the opportunity that it provides.</p><p>I think that it is worth going back to first principles&#8212;as Patrick Harvie did&#8212;and reminding ourselves that the greatest driver for progressing CCS is the imperative of addressing the global issue of climate change. As Patrick Harvie pointed out, in recent weeks we have had the IPCC&#8217;s latest and, I think, strongest ever assertion that global warming is real, and that it is very likely that more than half of recent temperature rises are directly caused by human activity.</p><p>Earlier this week, delegates at the climate justice conference here in Scotland heard powerful direct testimony of the impact that global warming is already having on the world&#8217;s poorest and most vulnerable citizens, who are, of course, the least culpable in creating the problem. Therefore, we are right&#8212;indeed, we are obliged&#8212;to pursue dramatic reductions in carbon emissions. However, the populations that we represent oblige us to ensure that we continue to provide electricity production for the economy and for personal use. To square that circle, we simply have to find ways of generating electricity without releasing millions of tonnes of carbon into the biosphere.</p><p>We believe that the Scottish Government is right to commit itself to the decarbonisation of the power industry by 2030. Indeed, we believe that the whole of the UK should make that commitment, too, as Labour has said that it will, should it win the next general election. That is an issue on which the industry needs clarity, so that it is clear what is required of it.</p><p>I will digress briefly into an area of disagreement, which is also one of constituency interest to me. It seems perverse that we should discount as a way of achieving the objective of decarbonising the power industry the expansion of non-carbon-emitting consistent base-load produced by nuclear power, especially as any chance that we have of reaching the decarbonisation target is based on extending the life of Scotland&#8217;s two existing nuclear stations. One of them&#8212;Torness, which is in my constituency&#8212;not only continues to provide a significant proportion of our electricity but recently passed the landmark of producing 200TWh since 1988.

That throws even greater urgency on the development of CCS, which is also urgent because of the Government&#8217;s target of producing the equivalent of 100 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020. As the minister acknowledged, that will have to be backed by about 2.5GW of conventional thermal generation.</p><p>We agree with the Scottish Government that we need to move forward on the demonstration of CCS on a commercial scale. We also agree that that means that the UK Government must make significant support available, particularly for the Peterhead proposal, which would demonstrate how the technology could work with Scotland&#8217;s geography and our history of North Sea oil production.</p><p>It is regrettable that such support has been reduced to &#163;1 billion from the &#163;2 billion that the previous Government planned. I have concerns about the consistent uncertainty over the availability of the cash in the comprehensive spending review period. We need to see the cash with certainty and we need tangible momentum.</p><p>The captain clean energy project holds out enormous potential, although&#8212;perhaps importantly&#8212;it involves a different technology: a new build rather than a retrofit. I understand that the project does not depend on Government capital investment, which is always helpful, but that a decision is needed on the contract for difference price. We are happy to echo and support the minister&#8217;s representations to the UK Government for that decision to be expedited.</p><p>We have some concerns about the Government&#8217;s motion, but they relate to clarity rather than substance. We do not want the UK Government&#8217;s support to be spread more thinly among projects, but we assume that the motion calls for more Government investment overall, and we are happy to agree with that. We feel that the reference to the captain project is a little ambiguous, as it suggests that capital investment is being sought, which I understand is not the case. However, the minister made it clear that in this case he means incentivisation through the contract for difference system.</p><p>We might have some differences with or criticisms of the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to cutting carbon emissions, and I have no doubt that some of them will be explored this afternoon.

It has ranged from the depleted reservoirs and saline aquifers of the North Sea to the algal feedstock plants in Australia, via China, Germany, Poland and one or two other places in between. That has been an interesting aspect of the debate because it reflects the global importance of the technology, and shows that we are not the only ones who are debating what needs to be done to turn the technology into something that is commercially available and viable. The issue is being considered right across the world.</p><p>Many members reflected correctly on Scotland&#8217;s particular potential for developing carbon capture and storage technology with our depleted reservoirs and the pipelines that are already in place. Others referred to the potential that is connected to that for using fossil fuels because of our coal and, potentially, our gas reserves. We have been discussing a global issue, but it is right that a lot of the debate has focused on Scotland&#8217;s particular place in that.</p><p>Other members used the opportunity to give us a lesson in chemistry. Mr Don&#8217;s lesson was certainly chemistry and not physics. Ms McAlpine also gave us a short lesson in the history of chemistry, which was of some interest.</p><p>A number of members, particularly Lewis Macdonald and Kenneth Gibson, quite rightly went into some detail about the extremely important proposal in Peterhead. One of the key points that they both mentioned was that success in Peterhead would mean that it would be the first example of carbon capture retrofitted to a gas-fired power station. That is important for Scotland. I have a constituency interest in that because my constituency includes the power station at Cockenzie, which closed earlier this year with existing consent for it to be replaced with a combined cycle gas power station. Unlike at Hunterston, there is widespread local support for the project. The community at Cockenzie has produced electricity and power for Scotland for more than 40 years and those who have been involved with that&#8212;some of them for the whole 40 years&#8212;would very much like to see their sons and daughters involved in doing so again in the future. If they are to do so without damaging the environment, we need investment in the new plant and carbon capture technology that will be applicable to that kind of power generation. I am therefore interested in seeing Peterhead demonstrate that that is possible.</p><p>There has been some discussion about whether this is the first debate that we have had on CCS. Whether it is the first debate or not, it is good that we had it today because, to paraphrase the title of the book and film, we need to talk about CCS. This is a critical point for the technology. Patrick Harvie has made the point strongly on a number of occasions that it is a technology that has not yet been demonstrated at a viable commercial level. That is a statement of fact. The projects that have been mentioned&#8212;there are others closer to home, for example in Wales&#8212;that have demonstrated that bits of the technology work, have been small scale.</p><p>If we look at bigger projects, we see that there is a mixed picture. Margaret McDougall referred to the decision in Norway to close down the project at Mongstad. Quite an interesting aside to that&#8212;given an intervention that was made in the debate&#8212;was that the previous Prime Minister of Norway described getting Mongstad working as being Norway&#8217;s equivalent of performing a moon landing. However, Norway has now pulled back from that project. Mr Stevenson gave us working examples of China pushing forward with the technology. There are examples from Canada, too; the Boundary Dam power station is a significant project that is already under construction.</p><p>The truth is that what is needed is the will to push forward and support the technology. That is why the importance of the current competition in the UK and the contract for difference with reference to the captain clean energy project have featured in the debate.</p><p>I will just say in passing that there were a couple of references to the first Peterhead project. We should be clear that the first Peterhead project was of course a pre-ignition gasification proposal&#8212;not a retrofit, but an experimental project, which never met the parameters of the competition that existed at that time. What is interesting, however, is that it bore similarities to the captain clean energy project, which I think shows how things have moved on in the intervening years.</p><p>We need to talk about CCS because this is a critical point for our targets. A number of members referred to our Climate Change Act targets and the 2030 decarbonisation target for the power industry. It is absolutely true that any examination of the RPP2, which describes how the Government believes we will move towards the targets, shows that it is highly dependent on significant and rapid progress on CCS technology. In fact, it requires us to have 500MW in operation by 2020 and another 500MW in operation by 2025, and it assumes over 1.5GW of gas-generation carbon capture being operational by 2027. Those are extremely challenging targets. In all honesty, from where we stand now, it is quite difficult to see how we are going to achieve them.</p><p>Mr Allard said that we have set the bar high; we have set the bar high on decarbonisation and on climate change targets, and the Government has set the bar high on renewable energy targets. The danger is that we will end up celebrating the height of the bar while ignoring our failure to reach it. That is what Mr Harvie has said we must try to avoid.</p><p>Mr MacKenzie was eloquent in saying that we have the skills, the academics and the infrastructure. I think we have to ask ourselves why, therefore, we are not further ahead. That is a serious conversation that we need to have. That does not mean that I think we should turn our backs on CCS, but that we should redouble our efforts.</p><p>I have a lot of sympathy for some of the arguments that Mr Harvie has made, but I have to say that I believe that oil and gas are assets and resources. They are not intrinsically bad; it is down to how we use them. Therefore, we support the possibility of enhanced recovery of oil using CCS technology. For that reason, we will not be able to support the Green amendment.</p><p>As for the Tory amendment, I understand Mr Fraser&#8217;s caution about picking out one project, but given that the captain project was mentioned in the motion, to remove it might look a little strange and could be misinterpreted.</p><p>I have also expressed&#8212;quite gently, I think&#8212;concerns about the timescale of the current competition.

The exceptions, perhaps, were the final contributions from Alex Johnstone and Alex Neil, which had a passing relationship with reality and, indeed, with the truth.</p><p>Most Scots would not recognise the recovery that Mr Swinney was at such pains to describe a couple of weeks ago any more than they would recognise the recovery described by George Osborne this week. Jackie Baillie made clear our view that responsibility for the structural weakness in the recovery lies with George Osborne and the coalition Government, because a recovery that is built on jobs that are increasingly part time or temporary, and on zero-hour contracts without job security or even a guarantee of work, feels like no recovery at all. A recovery that is built on declining wages that no longer stretch to pay the gas and electricity bills or cover childcare costs, with welfare changes that are already leaving 80,000 Scottish households struggling to pay rent that has been augmented by the bedroom tax, is a recovery for the rich, while most face a struggle to survive.</p><p>It is not getting better. In fact, it is getting worse, as many speakers on all sides of the chamber have demonstrated, using sources as diverse as the IFS and Asda&#8217;s mumdex to show that the real value of wages is falling. The proportion of Scottish families earning below the living wage is rising. Zero-hour contracts have soared in Britain; there are 1 million in Britain, so there must be perhaps 100,000 in Scotland. Energy Action Scotland tells us that 900,000 Scottish households live in fuel poverty. Two hundred and twenty thousand Scottish children live in absolute poverty&#8212;and the figure is not improving. Kezia Dugdale and Jackie Baillie are right to point out that, when we had a Labour Government in Westminster and a Labour-led Government here, the child poverty figure plummeted, but that progress has stopped. Twice as many Scots are now resorting to food banks, many more are resorting to payday loans, and one in three council tenants affected by the bedroom tax is already in arrears. That is not recovery; it is a reversal of living standards, and it demands urgent action now.</p><p>In response, the SNP amendment and most SNP speakers have gloriously missed the point. The fact is that if someone is struggling in a minimum wage job on a zero-hours contract in a property deemed too big for them, they do not pay council tax. The chances are that their children will not go to university, given the Government&#8217;s woeful record on widening access. They cannot afford a car to cross the Forth bridge for free, and if they can still find a bus service running, the fare that they pay will have been pushed up by the cut in concessionary travel recompense to the bus companies, so although it will be free when they are 60, right now they cannot afford it. The truth is that people in those circumstances worry about getting through to the end of the week&#8212;not about getting to 65, when they will get free personal care.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Two weeks ago, when we debated the Scottish economy, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth painted a rosy picture of recovery, with GDP and employment up over the year, and surveys showing that purchasing managers, the Bank of Scotland and small businesses are more confident than they were.

I was keen to take part in it for the fairly obvious reason that, prior to being elected to the Scottish Parliament, I spent 12 years working for Oxfam and so have some experience of where the ideas in the &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; report have come from. In that time, the thing that I was always proudest of and which I thought was most unique about Oxfam as an organisation was just how wide and deep its reach was at both ends of the spectrum.</p><p>For example, it was certainly possible to visit Oxfam programmes in many countries around the world where reaching the community involved might require travelling by small plane, then by truck and then by dugout canoe and then by walking for sometimes many hours. The community might seem remote and beyond the reach of an organisation that started in Oxford, but the truth was that, on every occasion, at the end of the trip there would be a community where Oxfam was not only known and understood but welcomed and respected.</p><p>Equally, at the other end of the spectrum, Oxfam was always an organisation that could knock on doors at the highest levels of society, be that in London, Geneva or Washington and be it Government doors, those of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, or those of academia and the offices of the most respected economists in the world. Oxfam remains an organisation that is listened to and understood.</p><p>I make that point to show that behind the &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; report is an enormous experience of community engagement and economic understanding, and a great deal of experience of using powerful tools to engage with communities and to get from them their experience and turn that into a policy agenda that can make a real difference to their lives. It is exactly that kind of approach that Oxfam has taken in Scotland in order to produce its report.</p><p>Another point about that kind of work undertaken by Oxfam is that it is successful. I think that many people see agencies such as Oxfam as living in a world of permanent despair in which nothing ever gets better and it responds to ever-worsening crises, but that is not true. Over time, many of the communities with which organisations such as Oxfam work do find ways to strengthen themselves and create sustainability. I remember almost 25 years ago visiting communities facing problems in Chile, which was just emerging from the Pinochet years and the austerity programme that had been imposed on it. Those communities used the tools and possibilities presented to them and succeeded in moving forward.</p><p>The Oxfam report is one that we should listen to. It has come at the right time because we have seen in recent weeks many supposed signs of recovery&#8212;for example, slightly better employment figures and some economic growth&#8212;but those of us who are prepared to look behind the headlines see that many of the jobs that have been created have zero-hours contracts and are part time and temporary; they do not provide the kind of security and confidence that people need to be able to go on and build a stable family life. Many of those jobs pay poverty wages that are less than the living wage.

One is old&#8212;it goes back more than 10 years&#8212;and the other is current, but both have some relevance to the Age Scotland campaign and this debate.</p><p>I it was who, as the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, introduced the national concessionary scheme all those years ago. However, it was not the scheme that we know today because, over time, the bus pass has evolved. For instance, in the early days, there was a charge for using the bus pass at peak times. The equalisation of ages was another change: when the scheme was set up, men and women had different retirement ages. Further, when the bus pass was first put in place, one of the greatest complaints about it was that it could be used only locally and that people could not cross boundaries with it, so some work had to be done before the scheme became truly national. I remember one meeting at which members of pensioners organisations complained bitterly that the bus pass could not be used on tour buses. Over time, the scheme has strengthened, although never enough to enable it to be extended to tour buses.</p><p>We have come to realise that the greatest weakness of the scheme is that there is no point having a bus pass if there is no service on which it can be used. That is exactly the gap that is often covered by community transport, which provides a day-to-day link in a way that tour buses, for example, do not. It seems clear to me that, as Alison McInnes said, that aspect is unfinished business in terms of the evolution of the scheme, and that the scheme should be extended to cover community transport services.</p><p>I also agree with Alison McInnes and Christine Grahame that it is entirely legitimate to debate age eligibility for the bus pass and the possibility of perhaps reducing that because of changes over time, but, at the same time, to discuss the extension of eligibility in terms of making the bus pass usable where the service is provided by community transport.</p><p>The second connection that I have with the issue is that I currently have out for consultation a proposal for a member&#8217;s bill to change the regulatory framework for buses in Scotland. That is designed exactly to try to find ways of facilitating more and more accessible bus services, primarily through a new franchise power for local authorities but also through ways of allowing greater use of local authorities&#8217; own fleets and encouraging more community transport to fill the gaps. I believe that my bill could well provide a legislative vehicle that could be used to extend the concessionary scheme to community transport. I encourage Age Scotland and any supporters of the still waiting campaign to make submissions to my consultation that make exactly that case.</p><p>I say to Jim Eadie&#8212;gently, because this has been a very consensual debate&#8212;that the argument for the extension to community transport is made by those elderly and disabled passengers who currently have to pay for community transport, rather than by the community transport organisations themselves. I am sure that, if we said to commercial operators, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to put &#163;190&#160;million into the bus industry. Would you like us to do that through a concessionary travel scheme?&#8221; they would say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not our priority. Here are some other ways in which we would much rather you pursued that.&#8221; Of course, they would be wrong. We pursue that route because of the benefits that our older and disabled citizens get, and those people should get those same benefits when they use community transport, too.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wanted to speak in the debate because of two personal connections with the issue.

We are in a different situation now. That is why the apprenticeship starts need to be used to take young people off the unemployment register.</p><p>It is true that too many of the 25,000 apprenticeships are shorter level 2 frameworks, and there is not enough of a match with long-term job opportunities. Members should consider the oil industry, which ministers say is in a boom. Mr MacKenzie said that the industry has said that it will need 100,000 young people. Last year, there were just 133 apprenticeships in the oil and gas framework. Surely that cannot be right.</p><p>That, of course, is the key, as employability is probably not the biggest problem right now; rather, the biggest problem is a lack of job opportunities&#8212;or demand, not supply.

That is why youth unemployment remains stubbornly high and why the best thing that the Scottish Government could do for our young people is to stop talking about shovel-ready projects and actually get the shovels digging.</p><p>We know what works when it comes to work experience.

The Cabinet Secretary for Justice said then that I was scaremongering and that there were no such plans. Sure enough, the hit list was published, and the cabinet secretary then said that there would be no closures without local consultation.</p><p>We marshalled more than 150 substantive submissions in evidence and we gathered thousands of signatures in opposition to closing Haddington&#8217;s courts. There were no submissions in favour of closure. What kind of local consultation weighs in the balance all evidence against no evidence and comes down on the side of no evidence at all? It is a sham, a deception and a disgrace.</p><p>I was not scaremongering, and the cabinet secretary was dissembling. Last week, he consigned my local court to the dustbin of history. History matters. Haddington has had courts of some kind for centuries. We have had lay justice there since the time of James VI. Local justice survived the siege of Haddington, Cromwell, the reformation, the treaty of union, two world wars and Margaret Thatcher. It seems, however, that it will not survive Kenny MacAskill.</p><p>Haddington court is busy, contrary to the impression that the cabinet secretary tried to create last week. It dealt with more civil cases than any of the other courts that are slated to close. More than 3,000 criminal cases were prosecuted there last year, and many community sentences and drug treatment and testing orders were monitored. Adults with incapacity applications alone soared by 70 per cent. As East Lothian has the fastest-growing population in Scotland, court work there can only increase.</p><p>Victims and witnesses will face considerable inconvenience in travelling to Edinburgh. Those seeking civil redress or involved in family actions face not only their own travel costs but up to &#163;400 more to cover additional travelling time for their agents for each court appearance.</p><p>As Mr MacAskill well knows, family actions can involve as many as 12 such hearings. He might save small change in his budget, but my constituents will pay dearly. Local lawyers say that legal aid work might become financially unviable for them, which would undermine access to advice and cost local jobs.</p><p>Haddington citizens advice bureau believes that its representation of clients will be compromised. Ironically, Mr MacAskill chose that very CAB to launch the first LawWorks legal advice service in Scotland. He praised the CAB&#8217;s in-court advisers, some of whom are here today because they fear that their jobs will be gone tomorrow if he persists in closing the court.</p><p>As for justices of the peace, all but a handful of East Lothian JPs have made it clear that they will not be willing to serve in Edinburgh, which will have a knock-on effect for non-bench work such as signing warrants for police officers. Mind you, those police officers might not need any warrants, because they will be spending all their time travelling to and from Edinburgh or sitting around Edinburgh sheriff court instead of doing police work in East Lothian. That is what our share of those extra police officers will spend their time doing.</p><p>All that is being done to save &#163;81,000 per annum&#8212;a figure that is disputed by forensic accountancy evidence that was submitted to the consultation, and most of which will anyway be pushed on to other public sector budgets.</p><p>The greatest harm in the proposals is the compromising of local access to justice and the abrogation of the principle that justice must be seen to be done and not dispensed at a distance. However, there is another kind of damage, too. Haddington is a county town with a proud history and the community is working hard to maintain its vibrancy. Only last week, the town market was successfully re-established. A trust has just been elected to regenerate the town. The county archives have come home to a magnificent new library. An employability hub has opened to boost local opportunity, and this Saturday our local radio station will take to the airwaves.</p><p>Now, the dead hand of the cabinet secretary is reaching out into the heart of Haddington to snuff the life out of one of our key institutions. He is not standing up for Scotland but stamping down on one of Scotland&#8217;s oldest towns. In this context, he often falls back on the example of his home town of Linlithgow. What he omits to say is that justice was not removed from West Lothian as a county. The administrative centre of West Lothian moved to Livingston and the court went with it. There is no suggestion of the provision of a court somewhere else in my county of East Lothian.

We hear about it from academics, notably in the Sheffield Hallam University research that many speakers have referred to. We hear about it from a wide variety of agencies with an interest, such as advice agencies that tell us that they are overwhelmed by the need for advice, and from advocates of those affected, such as people with disabilities, those who suffer mental health problems or those who are poor. They tell us that they are overwhelmed by the severity of the impact of the reforms that those whom they work with tell them is happening. We hear about the impact from service providers such as local authorities and housing associations&#8212;they too are overwhelmed by the impossibility of the position that they find themselves in.</p><p>However, the most powerful testimony is from the individuals and families who are affected, as we heard today in Glasgow&#8212;the convener described that. They are overwhelmed by the injustice of the reforms, by the fear that the reforms are provoking and by the cruelty that the reforms promise. It is not even a case of being cruel to be kind, because it is clear from the evidence that the committee has heard that the reforms will not have the effect that they are designed to have, whether that is moving people into work or moving them into smaller tenancies.</p><p>Of course, the committee does not just collect testimony; it also seeks to look at ways to mitigate the impact of the reforms and it scrutinises the Scottish Government&#8217;s actions to that end. We have considered the Scottish welfare fund, the new passporting regulations and the council tax reduction that is replacing council tax benefit.</p><p>None of those actions is perfect&#8212;Jackie Baillie mentioned the issue of appeals, for example&#8212;but in every case the Scottish Government has clearly and in good faith set out to try to create a system in which there is no significant loss to those who depend on those benefits. In two cases, the Scottish Government has identified additional resource, in that it has provided &#163;9 million for the Scottish welfare fund and, along with councils, it has contributed to the &#163;40 million for the council tax reduction scheme.</p><p>Much current attention has been focused on the bedroom tax&#8212;and rightly so&#8212;because that is a reform that really cannot work. When the committee took evidence from housing associations, Albyn Housing Society of the Highlands and Islands explained that 75 per cent of its properties have two or three bedrooms and that more than 30 per cent of its tenants would be affected by the changes. That housing association simply does not have single-bedroom houses in the small communities that it serves, so the bedroom tax cannot work as designed to move people into smaller tenancies and free up bigger houses for others.</p><p>In Glasgow this morning, we heard of the particularly pernicious effect of the tax on people with learning disabilities. Those are people whom we have worked hard to liberate from long-stay institutions so that they can live with support in their own tenancies, where they now find themselves punished by the bedroom tax.</p><p>My colleague and friend Andrew Burns of the City of Edinburgh Council has said that Labour and the SNP should be able to work together on fighting the bedroom tax, and I think that he is right. There is less division between us than some portray in, for example, council policies.</p><p>When the committee heard from Dundee City Council&#8217;s Councillor Black, who represents the SNP, and North Lanarkshire Council&#8217;s Councillor McCabe&#8212;a Labour councillor, of course&#8212;they talked about their attitude to eviction as a result of the bedroom tax. Councillor Black said that his council&#8217;s no-eviction policy meant that, if a tenant had arrears only because of the bedroom tax, had done everything possible to avoid that and had not been offered a smaller tenancy, the council would use all forms of debt recovery but not eviction for one year. Councillor McCabe said that his council would do everything possible short of eviction, but he could not promise that it would never come to that. I think that they were saying exactly the same thing, and to pretend otherwise is really to split hairs at the margin of the problem.</p><p>Of course, the trouble with a no-eviction policy is that, first, it provides no protection for housing association tenants. Secondly, it means that, even if tenants avoid eviction, they will still carry the debt of rent arrears into the future. Thirdly, it provides no help for those who find some way&#8212;God knows how&#8212;to pay the bedroom tax, perhaps by heating less, eating less or depriving their kids more. Those people deserve help and mitigation, too.</p><p>The only way to mitigate the effect of this iniquitous tax is to find some or all of the resource to offset the housing benefit reduction not just through providing advice but directly&#8212;through discretionary housing payments, payments under section 12 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 or otherwise. We should be nothing other than clear that the UK Government is responsible for the iniquitous bedroom tax. It is not fair that we should have to try to find additional resources from within our budgets, but then it is not fair that some of our most vulnerable citizens have to meet the bedroom tax from within their resources, too. Solidarity, rather than sympathy, demands that we do not just point a finger at the guilty but stretch out a helping hand to the victims, too.</p><p>I know that something will need to be cut to do that, but that is the consensus that we must reach, and we must find a budget adjustment, which might be less than ideal, that most members of this Parliament can support.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Welfare Reform Committee hears about the impact of the reforms every week.

The shame stalks Scotland, too. Only today, STV reported that a Milnathort man was convicted of assaulting his wife because she had overcooked his steak. That is not an isolated example; tomorrow morning I will buy my weekly local paper, which will have a whole page of court reports, and I am willing to bet that most of them will be similar stories of violence against women&#8212;they usually are. Of course they are.</p><p>Two years ago, Edinburgh Napier University studied attitudes to gendered violence among 11 and 12-year-olds in Scotland. Nearly all those young people, boys and girls, believed that a man was justified in punching his partner because she had had an affair, and 80 per cent of them thought that he had cause to slap his partner if his tea was late. We do not need war to justify abuse&#8212;a badly cooked steak is reason enough.</p><p>That man did not just throw his wife out of the house. He included his daughters, too, presumably to teach them that all women are collectively guilty, no matter whose hand was on the frying pan. His lawyer explained that consideration should be given to the fact that he had now recognised that he has a difficulty with alcohol. It is not alcohol that is his problem&#8212;it is his attitude to women.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale is right. The problem begins with everyday sexism and inequality, and ends in the normalisation of violent abuse. That sexism is found in the most erudite of circles. Last year, the astrophysicist Professor Jocelyn Bell Burnell visited the Parliament and described the intimidation that she was subjected to as the only woman in her undergraduate physics class at the University of Glasgow. She stuck it out and went on to discover pulsars; then her male supervisor was awarded the Nobel prize on the back of her work. And she is not the only one to have been treated in that way. Rosalind Franklin helped to discover DNA, but it was Crick, Watson and Wilkins who got the prize. Professor Bell Burnell was here to launch a report that shows that, in Scotland, 73 per cent of women who study science never find work in science at all. Perhaps they get the message that they are not wanted.</p><p>Likewise, in the Napier study, Sally says:</p><p>&#8220;At the moment I want to be a dancer or a doctor. When I grow up I&#8217;m going to have two babies and work part-time in the shop down the road.&#8221;</p><p>That is a waste of potential and ambition. It is something much darker, too. That is the same Sally who thinks that, in adult life, her partner will be entitled to hit her if she is late with her tea.</p><p>Violence against women is not caused by war, drink or ignorance; it is caused by the attitudes of men, and one billion rising is telling us that the game is up.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: One Billion Rising Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Congratulations to Kezia Dugdale on securing the debate, and to one billion rising on its remarkable global mobilisation on 14 February.

Truly, this Government has taken us through the looking-glass, with SNP back benchers rubbishing Mr Swinney&#8217;s private analysis on Mr Swinney&#8217;s public behalf. We have just heard Linda Fabiani lambast those who base their analysis on OBR estimates, which is exactly what Mr Swinney did in the paper that he prepared for the Scottish Cabinet.</p><p>I remember the first North Sea oil boom. When I was growing up in Inverness, you could not miss it. Tens of thousands of Scots were building oil rigs at Ardersier and Nigg and the rigs were literally queued up along the Moray Firth. Every family and town had somebody working offshore with stories of unheard-of wage packets and leisure to spend them. I do not see that happening now, but what I do see is a mature, growing oil and gas industry based around Aberdeen that demonstrates daily the world&#8217;s current confidence in Scotland. There are major new headquarters for Norwegian companies such as Statoil and Aker and significant investments from Korea and Sinopec from China. Transocean is planning to base all its global training outside the US in Aberdeen. A recent Lloyd&#8217;s survey showed that four out of five companies there plan growth, but it also showed that that growth is primarily international and that, for most companies, North Sea operations constitute 20 per cent or less of their business.</p><p>Those investments are happening right now in Aberdeen. They were attracted exactly by Scotland&#8217;s openness to their business, by our position as part of the English-speaking world and by our position as part of a stable United Kingdom and part of the European Union. They do not depend on Scotland&#8217;s share of the continental shelf. We can build an oil industry that will outlast North Sea oil, and we are doing it right now as part of the United Kingdom. Those companies tell us that their problem is finding the skilled workforce that they need, so they would be better served by a Scottish Government investing more in college places and less in separatist rhetoric.</p><p>As for renewables, a former leader of the SNP published a document last week that says that the &#163;2 billion subsidy required by our renewables industry is</p><p>&#8220;all right if paid for by England ... but it is not clear how this could be done when Scotland is independent.&#8221;</p><p>The inconvenient truth, which even lifelong nationalists cannot hide from, is that Scotland&#8217;s undoubted potential in renewable generation is strengthened by Scotland being part of a United Kingdom.</p><p>We are told today that Scotland would be better off to the tune of &#163;824 per person.

Ken Mackintosh is right, though. It is not a surplus. It is &#163;4.4 billion of deficit.

He called it one of the most significant performance audits that he had ever prepared, for two reasons. The first was the demographic change to which many members have referred. Bob Black pointed to a projected 147 per cent rise in the number of people aged over 85 in the next 25 years. The second reason was that it was because he had audited those services six times in 12 years and could find little evidence of any significant improvement. Of 32 councils, only 11 had any strategy at all for the joint commissioning of social care. Only four even considered demographic change and only one strategy was more than short term. Audit Scotland struggled to find any good joint planning underpinned by an understanding of the shared resources available.</p><p>The report also showed that, for the first time, the majority of care at home and in residential settings is now delivered by neither the NHS nor councils but by myriad private, independent or third sector providers. So what? So, an elderly lady, struggling to stay home, has daily care assessed by the council, but delivered by an agency that sends different carers every week. Her bath is provided by an NHS service, but not the GP surgery that she knows well. Meanwhile, her shopping service comes from a different department of the council. The highlight of her week is when someone visits her to take her out for a short walk, which is the responsibility of a local voluntary organisation. When one of them fails to turn up, she does not know who to call. Whoever she does call knows nothing. When she goes into hospital, as happens every so often, all those services are removed and every one of them has to be reinstated when she comes out. Sometimes that takes weeks or months, dozens of phone calls and a bewildering array of highly paid professionals. Some basic needs, such as nail cutting, turn out to be no one&#8217;s responsibility.</p><p>That is my family&#8217;s lived experience of the care system for an elderly aunt, but it is not unique and it is why we need integration. I have seen the capacity of the NHS and local councils to agree the need but resist the change. It is 13 years since, as a health minister, I got them to promise that they would pool budgets through joint future committees. Thirteen years on, the joint future committees are still there and so are the separate budgets. I hope that I can be forgiven if I am a little more sceptical than some colleagues about the willingness to change. It is informed by experience.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s proposals are in danger of becoming as complex and convoluted as the care system that they seek to reform. We are to have</p><p>&#8220;body corporate models of financial integration&#8221;</p><p>unless there is an agreed &#8220;delegation between partners&#8221; arrangement. There will be integrated resource frameworks and a non-hierarchical relationship between community planning partnerships and HSCPs. I do not know what that means. Accountability will be to NHS boards and local authorities&#8212;because that is working really well&#8212;and we can have confidence in all that because of single outcome agreements, which is nice; most of us had assumed that they had died a death a long time ago.</p><p>That adds up to a committee in which the NHS and the councils will argue forever about how much of their budgets they are willing to share. The consultation shows that they are already arguing about their voting rights and dispute resolution procedures. For all that I know, they are arguing over where they will sit and whose turn it is to bring the biscuits; they are not arguing about the care standards that we need.</p><p>We are in danger of paying senior professionals serious salaries to sit in endless meetings looking after their own budgets while the looking after of people is being done by a minimum-wage workforce in 10-minute care visits, with no time allowed between clients and with orders not to waste time speaking to them. Even that parody of care will be available only to those who are assessed as being in critical need.</p><p>I believe that the cabinet secretary is absolutely sincere in his desire for the integration revolution that he described. Like him, I think it is a revolution that we need. It is not too late to use this opportunity to deliver it. He can create a proper, formula-based, local, integrated budget so that the local negotiation is about delivery and not the share of budgets. He can legislate for a clear single line of accountability through democratically elected councillors who are answerable to their communities. He can insist on clear basic standards such as giving users and carers a single point of contact to manage all their care. What could be simpler?</p><p>The cabinet secretary can do those things if he is willing to show the leadership that he talked about and to call time on the vested interests on all sides of this debate. He can then create a care service on which our elderly and disabled citizens can depend and of which we can all be proud. If we do not do that, our successors will be back here in 13 years&#8217; time, doing this all over again.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last year, the then outgoing Auditor General for Scotland, Bob Black, audited the joint commissioning of social care by the NHS and local government.

Ever since the 2002 act was passed the SNP has said clearly that FOI should be extended to housing associations, arm&#8217;s-length bodies and contractors in Government contracts. That is what the SNP argued in opposition, and when it came into government it said that it would make those changes. However, it took the Government until 2010 to carry out the consultation and then it introduced a bill that did not extend FOISA at all. The Government&#8217;s action on the bill does not live up to its rhetoric.</p><p>Nor do other day-to-day actions of the Government live up to its rhetoric. I am thinking about the court cases around local income tax or legal advice on the European Union, when the Government resisted the release of information despite the commissioner&#8217;s decision. I am reminded of the Professor Qvortrup controversy, when emails were released in stages so that the particularly difficult one came out just before or after Christmas. The Government&#8217;s actions are nothing to be proud of.</p><p>I must be honest and say that no Government or Administration finds FOI particularly easy. I acknowledge that the previous Scottish Executive failed to use section 5 to extend FOI coverage, although we said that it would be desirable to do so. I recall much high-flown rhetoric in 2001 and 2002 about having the best FOI legislation in the world, and I am not sure that we lived up to those aspirations. I thought that we would do. A member said that, given that I was instrumental in setting up GHA, I should have noticed that people were losing their FOI rights in the transfer. I did notice that, but I assumed that my Administration would extend FOI to housing associations. I have to acknowledge that that did not happen.</p><p>The point is that FOI legislation tests a Government&#8217;s moral fibre. No Government likes FOI. FOI is always inconvenient, but it is the right thing. I think that we failed the test today: we could have extended FOI but we missed the opportunity to do so. Today has also been an exercise in futility, because at some point FOI will be extended to the bodies that we have been talking about. The tide of history is running in the direction of more information being available to the public.</p><p>I think that the cabinet secretary realises that, which is why she made a concession and promised to use section 5. It is a pity that it looks as if she was dragged kicking and screaming to that position, when she could have extended FOI in the first instance and correctly claimed to be living up to her own rhetoric. The jury is still out on whether, in the long run, she will live up to her rhetoric on openness and transparency.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681662", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Saul Alinsky, the campaign and community organiser in the United States, had as one of his &#8220;Rules for Radicals&#8221; to &#8220;make them live up to their own rhetoric&#8221;.

We are third in the world when it comes to peer-reviewed scientific papers per head of population and, as has already been pointed out, we garner for Scottish research facilities far more than our fair share of UK research funding. I say to the minister that it is, of course, true that we do that because of the quality of our research, but we also do it because we have access to a bigger research funding pot. I recently put to a research scientist the argument that scientists all collaborate across borders and would still be able to do that if we were independent. He replied, &#8220;I can collaborate across any border if I have the funding for my research.&#8221; That is a real concern in the scientific community that should not be dismissed.</p><p>Last year, the Royal Society of Edinburgh produced a report on the topic, which strongly made the point that, before we can have proper science-based policy making, we must have, among the public and politicians, better understanding of science. There are three areas in which our politics and science sometimes clash. One is to do with causality. Dr Simpson talked about the issues with the MMR vaccine, when a connection that was not a causal one between vaccination and autism led to a drop in herd immunity in Scotland&#8212;or to its disappearance. We must be honest and say that the problem was not just to do with the media; some politicians rode that bandwagon and contributed to the problem, which still has consequences today.</p><p>A second issue is to do with certainty. There is a lack of understanding that uncertainty is fundamentally built into the universe and science, so the question &#8220;Are you 100 per cent sure?&#8221; can never be answered with a &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Too often, we ask that question, although there cannot be the answer that we are looking for.</p><p>During the debate, we have already seen the biggest clash, which is to do with the way in which scientific consensus operates. Murdo Fraser hinted that he does not want to accept the scientific consensus on climate change. As we might expect, he was attacked by Patrick Harvie&#8212;who, of course, refuses to accept the scientific consensus on genetically modified crops, or on the safety of nuclear power and the contribution that it should make to our energy strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland should certainly aspire to science-based policy making, especially given our historical record in science, whether we mean Hutton working out the age of the earth for the first time, CTR Wilson&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s only science Nobel prize winner&#8212;developing the cloud chamber where the fundamental particles that make up the universe were discovered, or James Clerk Maxwell, who...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Gray", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80468", "house": "4", "member_id": "80468", "person_id": "14002", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "East Lothian"}, "section_id": "22679523", "hpos": "78", "gid": "2012-12-11.7.28", "epobject_id": "22679551", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2012-12-11.7.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14002+section%3Asp#g7.28", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80468"}, {"body": "<p>I accept that economic arguments are made, but the fact is that, on climate change, those whom we call climate change deniers find scientists who are outriders and who are outside the consensus and then bring their arguments to the fore.

Many members have talked about the chief scientific advisers that we have had, two of whom have been good role models for women&#8212;Anne Glover and Muffy Calder. Some departments also have scientific advisers. However, it remains the case that not all departments in Scotland have scientific advisers, although all Whitehall departments do.</p><p>Further, I believe that scientific advisers here do not have a strong direct line to the highest levels of Government.

I set up and chaired the first meeting of that committee when I was Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning. It was correctly stated that the committee gives independent advice, but I wonder whether that independence is less valuable than a connection to the centre of Government would be. I would like the science advisory committee to be more like the financial services advisory board or the Scottish energy advisory board and to be chaired by a cabinet secretary for science, or even by the First Minister on occasion, as those other boards are.

As I think most of us agree, this nation&#8217;s greatest resource is its people, particularly its young people, and the careers service is right at the centre of helping them to achieve their potential. It is not only about fitting young people into the right place; it is about opening their eyes and raising their aspirations. I remember the entrepreneur Tom Hunter telling a story about the place where he grew up in Ayrshire. In his village, everybody worked in the pits. People who were working class went down the pit and those who were middle class worked in the office, but everybody worked in the pits. However, when the pits closed, the issue was not just that there were no jobs, but that people in the community could not conceive of how they could earn a living.</p><p>I became a teacher for similar reasons. I was the first person in my family to go to university and join a profession. Many of us in that position became teachers, because people aspire to the things with which they are familiar. As a teacher, I found that, too. I well remember arguing with a young guy who was better at physics than I ever was and who wanted to go to college. I tried to get him to go to university, but he was adamant that he did not know anyone who went to university and he would not go. I remember trying to convince a young woman who wanted to be a nurse that she could in fact aspire to be a doctor.</p><p>Sometimes, careers advice is about people turning their back on opportunities. On a later occasion, when I worked in Livingston during the previous recession, when youth unemployment was high, Ferranti suddenly took on 100 apprentices and my higher physics class disappeared in its entirety. Many of the people in that class could have aspired to highers and going to university and so on, but they felt that they had to take the chance that was presented to them.</p><p>Careers advice is important in trying to ensure that we have the skills that we need in our economy. Even in these difficult times, there are skills shortages, particularly in areas such as science and engineering. There are still opportunities in those areas. The Institute of Physics recently produced a report that showed that there are 190,000 jobs in Scotland in physics-based sectors.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Most speakers have rightly referred to the importance of careers advice.

I am talking about gender stereotyping and the self-limiting choices that young women often make. A group that does not access such opportunities is young women. Only 28 per cent of standard grade physics students are women and only 15 per cent of engineering undergraduates are women. There are opportunities into which careers guidance should be moving young women.</p><p>In my experience, careers guidance is about opening and changing minds. That is not just necessary at school&#8212;I think that the people who went to Ferranti will have looked for careers guidance later in life&#8212;and it is not just for low achievers. However&#8212;and I think that this is what Dr Hughes was talking about&#8212;it needs to come at an early stage and it needs to be consistent and proactive, because gender stereotypes, for example, are set very early in life.</p><p>Above all, careers guidance needs to be face to face. Members talked about the importance of an individualised, personalised service. There is nothing more individualised or personalised than a sensitive professional listening carefully to the person with whom they are dealing and responding in a way that is appropriate to their needs. That is individualisation and personalisation. I was astonished when the minister, without a trace of irony, told us that we should not worry about the 92 per cent of SDS staff who were cynical about the new system, because they had all had high-quality &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; interventions on the new system. That is the best way to change people&#8217;s minds.</p><p>The issue is whether the new system is fit for those purposes, and members have brought to the debate a weight of evidence that it is not. The traffic-light model is excluding 100,000 higher achievers from the front-line service that they need. Sign-up rates for the my world of work website must be a cause of concern&#8212;the rate in my constituency is 15 per cent, which is even less than the average.</p><p>What we have here is a trend in government. The internet-based approach to careers guidance is analogous to approaches that are developing elsewhere. Benefits applicants are expected to apply online, and in preparation for the introduction of self-directed support, local authority social work departments are planning to create web-based choices for the disabled and elderly people who are trying to create their own care packages. I think that we know what is happening. Such approaches sound plausible in an organisational change-management presentation, but they leave the people at the sharp end frustrated, ill-served or downright excluded.</p><p>The careers service was not perfect before, but the evidence is that the changes that we have debated are not an enhancement.

Five councils even charge for tuition for pupils who are required to learn an instrument as part of study for music exams. Eleven authorities have raised fees during the past year. I record my pride that my council, East Lothian Council, is one of the eight authorities that do not charge for music tuition.</p><p>I congratulate Scotland on Sunday on its let the children play campaign, which calls for instrument tuition to be free, especially for those who are studying music, and calls on the Scottish Government to take a lead in making that happen. There is a precedent for that in Jack McConnell&#8217;s youth music initiative, which ensures that every pupil has the chance to try a year of instrumental tuition by primary 6. Thousands of youngsters have benefited from the scheme and the Scottish National Party Government has continued the scheme since 2007 and deserves full credit for doing so. In most of Scotland, however, pupils who are inspired by the initiative to continue with their instrument have to pay. That means, for many, that the opportunity is lost.</p><p>My motion was prompted by all that, but was driven by personal experience; all three of my daughters benefited from free music tuition in schools. One learned violin, one the clarinet and one the bassoon. All of them participated in school bands or wind bands, and two of them participated in the Edinburgh secondary schools orchestra. One is now an instrument teacher herself, but all three were challenged, enriched and inspired by music. I am sure that they are better, broader-minded and happier adults for it.</p><p>That view is supported by research such as that which my motion cites from Harvard medical school, which shows that pupils who play an instrument demonstrate</p><p>&#8220;better motor, auditory, vocabulary and non-verbal reasoning skills&#8221;.</p><p>Such evidence is part of the answer to the rather obvious criticism that, given Labour&#8217;s argument that we must debate carefully what benefits can be provided free, this is not the time to argue for free instrument tuition. That criticism misses the point, just as the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities does when it says:</p><p>&#8220;let&#8217;s be clear, what we are talking about here is extracurricular music tuition.&#8221;</p><p>Even if we set aside the fact that we are talking about Scottish Qualifications Authority exam courses in five council areas, the crux is that instrument tuition should be part of the core provision of our schools and should therefore be provided without charge. If we think that schools are just about getting pupils through exams, our aspiration is narrow and our ambition limited, indeed.</p><p>The benefits of music participation at its most intense are seen in El Sistema, which engages a whole community. It was pioneered in Venezuela and is transforming the Raploch in Stirling. I spent midsummer&#8217;s evening watching the children of the Raploch sit in the midst of an orchestra from Venezuela, thousands of miles away, and play with it a Beethoven overture from hundreds of years ago. No one there needed to be told that music has the power to transcend distance, time and culture and to transform the lives of those whom it touches, because that truth shone transparently in the faces of the children of the big noise. We cannot have that everywhere, but we can have music tuition. We have all seen some of that when we have seen parents at school concerts watch their children conjure beauty, no matter how falteringly, from thin air.</p><p>When I taught in Mozambique, my class&#8217;s timetable included mandatory singing&#8212;not from me, fortunately. In a country that was torn by war and ravaged by famine, people sang. The children sang everywhere, all the time, in heartbreakingly perfect harmonies. Just as young men tied together rags to play football, they constructed guitars from any disused boxes that they could find, so that they could make music.</p><p>In Cambodia&#8212;a country rebuilding from nothing with nothing&#8212;I have seen the establishment of a school of music and dance being prioritised. That was because people there understood music&#8217;s magic in bringing people together and raising them up, and because they knew that the Khmer Rouge killed the musicians first because it, too, understood that.</p><p>Nearer home, when I lived in Wester Hailes, the whole community&#8212;which had little&#8212;clubbed together to buy a saxophone for one Tommy Smith, so that he could take up his place at Berklee College of Music. He learned through the kind of tuition that we are debating, and people in that community understood that the glory of his jazz enriched them all. If people who have little can find the time and resource to sing, play and learn, why do we have to debate whether we can let our children play? A lack of money need not hold us back, but a lack of vision surely will.</p><p>Nicola Benedetti told Scotland on Sunday:</p><p>&#8220;Learning an instrument is ... about understanding the creative, spiritual thing that goes on inside of us. It goes to the heart of who we are as human beings.</p><p>How can it possibly be separated by something as superficial as whether you can pay for your lesson or not?&#8221;</p><p>I know that it is not practical to suggest that anyone can learn any instrument anywhere, on demand, but the Scottish Government can take a lead in pushing open a door that is closing in the faces of too many young Scots across our country. It goes to the heart of who we are as human beings and to the heart of what we want to be as a country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678449", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Music Tuition"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This evening&#8217;s debate, on the value of instrumental music tuition, is prompted by research that was undertaken by the Educational Institute of Scotland, which established that 24 out of 32 councils charge up to \u00a3340 per year for instrument tuition in schools.

I also congratulate John Park, who has worked tirelessly on the issue for some years and, in particular, on the work on his proposed living wage bill, which we look forward to debating in the chamber.</p><p>The real congratulations, when it comes to the living wage, go to campaigners outside Parliament, because this is a grass-roots campaign that was initiated by Citizens UK in London and which has been followed through by bodies in Scotland such as the Poverty Alliance. They are to be congratulated on their persistence in bringing the campaign to the stage that it has reached today.</p><p>We have come a long way. Like Malcolm Chisholm, I am old enough to remember the debates about the national minimum wage. It is worth remembering that at that time some workers were paid as little as &#163;1 an hour. I remember instances being discovered of some people working in the security industry for accommodation only and no wage whatever.</p><p>There were dire predictions of job losses when the minimum wage came in, but those have been proved to be false. It is so pleasing to see that we have moved beyond the idea of the bare minimum to the idea of a decent quality of life being provided by the living wage.</p><p>The policy has been public-sector led. The Scottish Government and the local authorities that have introduced the living wage and made commitments to staff are to be congratulated on that. I am delighted to add to that roll of honour: two weeks ago my council&#8212;East Lothian Council&#8212;introduced the living wage, and 145 permanent staff and 150 casual or relief staff will benefit. As with Christina McKelvie&#8217;s South Lanarkshire Council, most of those staff are women who work part-time. Those numbers might sound small but, for the people concerned, the increase in their wage&#8212;which, in some cases, will be as much as 13 per cent&#8212;is significant. However, given that they represent only a small proportion of the 500,000 Scots in the public and private sectors who are paid less than the living wage, it is clear that we must do more.</p><p>As John Park said, the key task is to push out beyond the public sector and into the private sector by persuasion and procurement. The issue is not just about fairness to individuals; it is about providing a level playing field for people in the third sector. I spent some time chairing an organisation that provides support to people with learning disabilities who live in the community. I am not proud to say that we had to squeeze the conditions of our workforce, because we were bidding for tenders against other organisations that paid the minimum wage and used zero-hour contracts so that they could make lower bids. To me, that seems to be quite pernicious.</p><p>In addition, we must be strong on the issue of advice from Europe. I know that the Scottish Government has asked for advice and believes that it is difficult to use procurement to promote the living wage, but I say&#8212;without being funny&#8212;that the Scottish Government can be quite bullish about European advice when it comes to matters such as minimum unit pricing or even entry to the European Union. If the Government were to be bullish about promotion of the living wage and pushed it through in the procurement bill that is to come before us, that is one area in which we would support it.</p><p>The living wage matters to all of us. This week, we have seen it go up&#8212;but we have also seen top executive earnings go up by more than 25 per cent. Why do we still have so much stress, anxiety, addiction and family breakdown in our society when, in general terms, we are better off than we have ever been? I think that the reason is to do with the inequalities that we are discussing. The living wage may be only a small step in addressing those inequalities, but it is an important one, which is why I believe that this is one wheel to which, together, we should all put our shoulders, because it is an idea whose time has come.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my good wishes to Kez Dugdale and I congratulate her in her absence on securing the debate.

As Mr Coffey said, Armstrong landed the lunar module manually and set it down on the Sea of Tranquillity with seconds of fuel left.</p><p>We are politicians, and we should remember that Armstrong&#8217;s mission was political. When Kennedy told Congress that the US would put a man on the moon, no one knew how that could be done. That was politics, not science, and pretty venal politics at that. The task was launched by a supposedly vigorous new President who, in truth, could stand up only with the aid of a back brace and a toxic cocktail of stimulants. The challenge was to a supposedly modern nation but, in fact, tens of millions of its own people were denied the vote and even the right to sit, eat or study alongside their white compatriots in those days.

Of course, as Elaine Murray outlined, Labour initially called for it some years ago. Low-carbon buses, which the fund will help to buy, contribute in a small but welcome way to cutting carbon emissions.</p><p>The minister was also right to mention the opportunity that the green bus fund provides for a great Scottish manufacturing company, Alexander Dennis Ltd, which, like him, I have visited. Not only is Alexander Dennis demonstrating how innovation can lead to success, it is demonstrating that Scotland can still build some of the best light engineering products anywhere in the world. Indeed, the Enviro400 hybrid, which is produced by Alexander Dennis, is the United Kingdom&#8217;s best-selling hybrid bus.</p><p>However, the core purpose of the work in this area is as part of our response to climate change and our endeavours to meet the carbon emission reduction targets that we have set ourselves, so it was disappointing news when we discovered in the summer that Scotland had missed its emissions target by the equivalent of more than 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. In some ways, that is no surprise, because although emissions in general have fallen in the past 20 years, those from transport have edged up, and there are about 1 million more vehicles on Scotland&#8217;s roads than there were 20 years ago. Decarbonising our bus fleet might be desirable, but that is not the real challenge. The real challenge is to decarbonise transport, which means getting people out of cars and on to those buses.</p><p>Given that there were 438 million bus journeys in Scotland last year and only 81 million rail journeys, it is clear that it is buses that have to play the primary role in that modal shift. The minister said that the share of bus journeys is growing, but that is not what is happening. The number of bus journeys has slumped by 150 million in the past few years, while the number of rail journeys continues to rise. Perhaps one reason for that is that the Government provides &#163;667 million in subsidies to rail each year but only &#163;295 million to subsidise far more bus journeys that reach many more parts of Scotland. I applaud investment in our rail network and I know that that balance is not new or unique to the current Administration, but it needs to be examined.</p><p>In truth, Government funding for buses has been cut. There has been a cut in BSOG and the recompense for concessionary journeys is being squeezed. The result is that, for the first time since devolution, bus passenger numbers per head of population are lower in Scotland than they are in Great Britain as a whole. I warn members that the decline will not be gradual. In my constituency of East Lothian and in West Lothian, First bus services, which had gradually become unreliable, irregular and expensive, were completely removed one day. Unless we act, that will happen more and more.</p><p>Green buses mean something else to me. For people of my age who grew up in the Lothians, there will always be red buses and green buses. The red buses were the corporation buses in the town and the green buses served the outlying areas. The green buses were run by the Scottish Bus Group. They were required by law to make 6 per cent profit every year, and that was reinvested in the services. They were regular, reliable, busy, profitable and lively. I know that, because I spent four summers as a bus conductor on those Eastern Scottish routes. In fact, they could get too lively. I remember one of my colleagues claiming that he had had a gun pulled on him on the last Dunbar service on a Saturday night. That was one fare that he did not collect.</p><p>Those routes in East Lothian were the best routes for the Scottish Bus Group. How can it be that we reached a point at which First, the successor company, simply removed them? Competition has not served us well in that part of Scotland. Competition crushed those First services at one end of my constituency, where the people are, and the company was left to try to serve those areas where there are far fewer people. The refocusing of BSOG has not helped my rural constituency. Our buses disappeared.</p><p>Nothing focuses our minds as much as an election. In East Lothian, when our bus services were removed, the local SNP councillors who were facing the electorate not only suddenly found additional money to subsidise bus routes but told the voters that they wanted to start their own council bus company, and the minister did not discourage them from that. However, they were not serious&#8212;and I have to say that the electorate saw through it all and did not believe them.</p><p>If we look at where buses are succeeding, surely the message is that it is time to change the industry&#8217;s structure, not just the fuel used by its buses, if we are to give passengers the assurance of reliability, stable fares and high-quality vehicles. We need look only at London, where Transport for London is so confident and successful that it has ordered 600 hybrid buses to give to the companies, delivering popular affordable services in a regulated market; at Renfrew, where we have Scotland&#8217;s only quality bus partnership, which is regularly lauded in the chamber by George Adam as a model that should be followed elsewhere; or at Edinburgh, where we have the nearest thing in Scotland to a publicly owned bus company running a near-monopoly of services across the city at an incredible &#163;1.40 flat fare, however far one goes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The green bus fund is a welcome initiative.

When we add to that the fact that electricity is an important added-value export from Scotland and the potential&#8212;rightly recognised by the Scottish Government&#8212;that we can use new technologies to reindustrialise our country, we can see that there is nothing dull at all about EMR.</p><p>In fact, it is not putting it too strongly to say that our way of life depends on getting EMR right. The consequences of getting it wrong are already becoming obvious. SSE turned away from some of its proposed hydro investments immediately in response to ROCs decisions by the UK Government. In my constituency, 1,000MW of capacity at Cockenzie power station is about to disappear in April, with no investment decision on the horizon in spite of the Scottish Government having already consented to a combined cycle gas turbine replacement. Iberdrola has the investment decision on hold, as it awaits EMR decisions.</p><p>We are currently in a worrying position. The proposals do not really reform the market. In particular, they would leave the wholesale market unreformed and would not restore any balance between the interests of the consumer and those of the big six energy companies. However, because of the complexity of the contracts for difference system, the lack of clarity on counterparties and a lack of confidence in the proposed capacity market auctions, the proposals have also failed to gain the confidence of the companies, with Ian Marchant of SSE calling them a train wreck.</p><p>Cockenzie is one example of a hiatus in investment that either results from EMR concerns or for which EMR is the excuse. Either way, EMR is not delivering what we need, and we will not resolve those issues by allowing it to become a polarised battleground over competing low-carbon technologies.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s position on nuclear is clear. I think that it is wrong because Torness in my constituency generates reliable baseload electricity&#8212;15 to 20 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s electricity, day by day&#8212;without producing carbon emissions and provides 500 highly skilled and well-paid jobs for my constituents, but there is no doubt that the Scottish Government is entitled to take the view that it does on nuclear.

In the long term, renewable technologies hold out the prospect of electricity generation without dependence on finite fuel supplies. Balance must be the aim.</p><p>The Scottish Government should be supported in arguing for transmission charging, contracts for difference and a capacity market that all incentivise renewable generation throughout Scotland, including our islands.

However, the disreputable argument that has been mounted this week is the one that says that, because we voted against the budget, we voted against apprenticeships. That is not only disreputable, but infantile. It is the political equivalent of the argument that, because Scotland beat France a couple of years ago, if France wins Euro 2012, Scotland will really have won it. We voted against the budget because it would not grow the economy; it would cut tens of thousands of public sector jobs; and it would cut teachers from our schools and nurses from our hospitals&#8212;and we were right. There were many reasons to vote against the budget, but apprenticeships were certainly not one of them.</p><p>The minister made a number of very good points, including the need for employers to look beyond the recession. However, that is not happening. For example, 1,000 tradespeople leave the electrical industry every year but there are only 400 apprentices. When the upturn comes, that gap will mean a massive skills shortage. I know that the problem with increasing those numbers is the fact that apprentices need jobs&#8212;the Government is right about employed status. However, those jobs should be coming from public sector contracts. No matter whether they are capital or service contracts, unless we ensure that local and small companies get their share of what is available and unless we insist that every single contract creates opportunities for young people to get off the dole, we will waste the most powerful mechanism that we have.</p><p>I know that the minister agrees, because her draft strategy has at its heart a sustainable procurement bill. Why did she not mention the bill today? Where is it? What are we waiting for? Every day, contracts are being let, still aggregated and still tendered 92 per cent on price alone. We know what works. In Wales, public contracts are let 70 per cent on the basis of social benefit, not price; Glasgow has its apprenticeship guarantee and graduate employment promise; and in Falkirk procurement was used to create hundreds of apprenticeships, which were filled with youngsters lifted from the unemployment scrapheap. The minister herself highlighted an example from Perth and Kinross Council. Why can every single council in the land not do the same? If the Government had the political will to force every council to stop increasing council tax, why can it not put the same effort into getting every council to emulate Glasgow and Falkirk and stop the rise in youth unemployment?</p><p>The minister is right to say that she needs to reach back into schools to see what is happening there. She also mentioned curriculum for excellence, but an unintended consequence of that move is emerging right now to undermine her efforts. Teachers are telling us that because of the way in which course choices operate, pupils are dropping all sciences at the end of secondary 2. On Sunday, I heard Mike Russell say that curriculum for excellence will not change the laws of physics, but science teachers are telling him that, as a result of it, fewer pupils will learn the laws of physics.

However, the Scottish Government must take its responsibility, too. The number of bus journeys in Scotland peaked in 2007 and has been in decline ever since. The annual number of bus journeys now is the lowest since the advent of the Parliament. It is no coincidence that that decline parallels the SNP in power, because it has never prioritised or supported the bus industry.</p><p>First, the SNP scrapped its policy of regulating services. It then scrapped the &#163;27 million bus route development fund, cut the bus service operators grant and systematically underfunded the concessionary travel scheme. The SNP has no strategy for taking the bus industry forward.

I think that I am the only one here who was at Wendy Alexander&#8217;s lecture on St Andrew&#8217;s day in 2007, in which she outlined her view of the challenges that devolution faces and her proposal to create a commission to meet them. There were three principles at the heart of her speech. The first was that the devolution settlement can change without breaking the social, economic and political partnership of the United Kingdom. The second was that any such change should be developed in Scotland. The third was that the Parliament should be accountable for raising more of our resources as well as for spending them.</p><p>The Calman commission studied devolution settlements across the world and reached a similar conclusion. It said that the Scotland Act 1998 had created a Parliament with an unusually high degree of legislative devolution, but in contrast, it enjoys unusually limited fiscal devolution. The commission&#8217;s proposals, which were developed by a powerful group of economists and endorsed unanimously by the commissioners, who were drawn from right across the spectrum of Scottish political and civic life, were designed fundamentally to rebalance that position, and that is still the essence of the measures that we are debating.</p><p>The Parliament should face the responsibility of setting the rate of income tax that Scots pay, and we should reap the consequences or the benefits of that. It should have the power to borrow and to choose to spend future resource in order to allow us to invest in and shape that future. That is a grown-up power for a grown-up Parliament, and it is a job-creating power for a Parliament that should be spending more of its time creating more jobs with the powers that it already has.</p><p>As we have heard, the detail that flows from the changes can be complex. However, we should not let the devil in the detail blind us to the power in the principle of the legislation or the uniqueness of its passage.</p><p>Mick McGahey, of the National Union of Mineworkers, famously said that</p><p>&#8220;there is nothing more painful than the birth of an idea.&#8221;</p><p>Those days back in 2007 were painful ones for Wendy Alexander, yet she brought forward this idea, which has prevailed in spite of everything.</p><p>First, the Scottish Parliament itself, in what was at the time a dramatic act of defiance, seized the Parliament&#8217;s authority in the teeth of opposition from the SNP Government of the day. In spite of it being in defiance of the Government, a heavyweight and wide-ranging commission was recruited.</p><p>As it was recognised that legislative power in this area lay in Westminster, the UK Government was engaged too and a commitment was made that proposals would be pursued, with this Parliament having a de facto veto through the requirement for the LCM that we are debating today.</p><p>If that was not remarkable enough, the Scotland Bill survived elections in both Parliaments, which produced in one a coalition led by a party that has only one member of Parliament in Scotland and many MPs who wear their antipathy to devolution on their sleeve. In this Parliament, there was the glorious contradiction of a majority nationalist Government that was hell-bent on refusing, discrediting and sabotaging the offer of more powers for Scotland.</p><p>However, common sense has prevailed. As Mr Crawford outlined at some length, the UK Government has shown flexibility and agreement has been reached. That is testimony to all those involved: Wendy Alexander and also Annabel Goldie and Nicol Stephen, who set the process in motion; the two Scotland Bill Committees of this Parliament; and the ministers of all the Governments involved. It is testimony, too, to the strength of devolution itself. It nails the lie that those of us who oppose separation must therefore oppose change, too. That has never been the case. Donald Dewar never said that devolution is a process, but he said that</p><p>&#8220;It would be absurd to pretend that ours is the last word on the constitutional settlement.&#8221;</p><p>The truth is that the whole story of devolution has been a story of change in powers and responsibilities. When I worked in the Scotland Office, we devolved rail infrastructure to this Parliament and with it a budget of &#163;300 million a year. Powers over energy consents have been devolved as the industry has changed. The current UK Government is devolving council tax benefit, although that was once an issue of great contention.</p><p>The SNP&#8217;s argument seems to be that the Scotland Bill is not perfect and that some of its supporters admit that, but the understanding that waiting for a perfect blueprint for devolution would mean waiting for ever, and the profound belief that it should not be beyond the wit of future politicians to deal with anomalies and make changes, is what unlocked the modernisation of our constitution in 1999. We can arrange our constitutional affairs in a partnership of nations whereby we pool sovereignty so that we can share risk, resources and opportunities flexibly and responsibly and make changes. That is a wholly different matter from the once-and-for-all question of whether we want to see that partnership ended irrevocably.</p><p>If we support the LCM, we will show that we have the wit to improve devolution and the willingness to set aside what divides us in order to do what is right and what the people of Scotland want us to do&#8212;by that, I simply mean strengthen the powers of this Parliament.

Bob Black has developed an internationally respected, modern, open, independent and highly effective public audit regime. Under his leadership, Audit Scotland&#8217;s reputation has been not just Scottish but international. Indeed, Audit Scotland participates fully in the development of international ethical standards and takes part in the audit of the United Nations. Bob has provided Scotland, not just the Parliament, with exemplary service over the years and I know that the Parliament will join me in wishing him a long and happy retirement. However, I do not wish him too restful a retirement, as I sincerely hope that Scotland will continue to benefit from his experience and wisdom in some way or another.</p><p>Caroline Gardner was the unanimous choice of the panel from a very strong field of candidates.

The motion itself reflects what is a powerful cross-party, cross-community and cross-council campaign in the south-east of Scotland. I have supported the introduction of a local rail service between Edinburgh and Dunbar and on to Berwick for a number of years, and I echo John Lamont&#8217;s commendation of the work of RAGES. In fact, I should probably declare an interest as a paid-up member of the group.</p><p>Although Dunbar in my constituency is served primarily by a mixture of cross-country and east coast long-distance trains, the truth is that it is an afterthought in those timetables. There are gaps of up to an hour and a half between trains during the day and of more than two hours at some points in the evening. Even worse, my constituents in East Linton, where the station closed in 1964, have to watch trains pass through their village all day without stopping. The recent addition of a few ScotRail services to Dunbar is a welcome, if slight, improvement, but the service remains inadequate to the town&#8217;s needs and does nothing to address the demand for train services from East Linton.</p><p>Given that East Lothian&#8217;s population is projected to rise by 33 per cent by 2035&#8212;the biggest projected increase in any part of Scotland&#8212;and that in Dunbar itself planning permission has already been granted for 500 houses that we expect to be built in the near future, it is clear that there is huge potential for rail services to grow in this part of Scotland. The proposed service would link young people directly to Queen Margaret University and job opportunities in Edinburgh; after all, we must bear in mind that this is the part of Scotland where youth unemployment has risen fastest in the past two years. It would also get commuters out of their cars, cut carbon emissions and thereby contribute to the Scottish Government&#8217;s emissions reduction efforts in the transport sector.</p><p>Over the years, successive transport ministers of all political parties&#8212;including, I fear, me&#8212;have met the RAGES campaign with warm words but lots of hurdles. However, the group&#8217;s persistence has overcome those hurdles one by one. For example, some years ago, a STAG appraisal produced a positive business case; East Lothian Council has safeguarded land and committed funding for a station at East Linton; and ScotRail has begun to train drivers to go beyond Drem on the east coast main line. Most recently, the MVA Consultancy feasibility study showed that a station at East Linton improves the benefit-cost ratio for the Edinburgh to Dunbar service and finally laid to rest the argument that a Dunbar local service would impact on the mainline timetable.</p><p>As Mr Lamont has explained, a multimodal STAG 2 study has now been demanded. We will also get over that hurdle, because the journey on the so-called express bus from Dunbar to Edinburgh takes around an hour longer than the train; in any case, its frequency has just been halved. Constituents in East Linton are often left standing by rush-hour buses that are already full before they get to the village.</p><p>Like Mr Lamont, I was very pleased that the transport minister took the time last month to visit the site of the old East Linton station. However, I worry about the fact that, on that visit, he emphasised that, at closer to &#163;2.5 million per annum rather than &#163;1 million, the operating subsidy required would be at the upper end of projections. We know that other new stations such as Laurencekirk and new services such as those to Bathgate and between Stirling and Alloa have attracted passenger numbers way beyond expectations, and the MVA study assumes that there will be new rolling stock, which I think would not be necessary. We have every reason to believe that the subsidy required for the service will be less than predicted; in any case, it would be marginal in the overall ScotRail budget.</p><p>South-east Scotland is looking only for its fair share of rail services. The time has come for a transport minister to say yes, not maybe. That challenge now falls to Mr Brown and I hope that he will rise to it this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663697", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Services (Berwickshire and East Lothian)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As one of the initial signatories to John Lamont&#8217;s motion, I congratulate him on securing the debate.

The paper&#8217;s conclusions are the second iteration of a proposal to remove court services from many of Scotland&#8217;s communities. In fact, the proposals are drastic and involve the closure of 15 out of 49 sheriff courts and a reduction in the number of sheriff courts holding jury trials from 47 to 14. The report is absolutely explicit about the driver behind the proposals: cuts in the service&#8217;s budget of 6.9 per cent next year, 8.4 per cent the year after and 11.1 per cent in 2014-15. The proposals have nothing to do with justice; they are a cost-cutting exercise.</p><p>My particular concern is with Haddington sheriff and justice of the peace courts, which are both targeted for closure because of their so-called proximity&#8212;around 20 miles&#8212;to Edinburgh. However, I have no doubt that my reasons for opposing the closure of my local courts will apply in most or all of the communities that are threatened by the plans. I am sure that colleagues will take the chance this evening to speak up for their towns, too.</p><p>The closure of Haddington sheriff court might be an attractive cost-cutting measure for the Scottish Court Service, but it would be a significant blow to the people of East Lothian. After all, not just people on trial but victims and witnesses would face longer journeys and longer waits. Our justice system often fails victims and witnesses, without our imposing an additional cost in time and travel. We must also consider local police officers, who already spend too much time away from their front-line duties in the community but would have to be extracted for even longer so that they could give evidence. It is no wonder that Sheriff Peter Gillam said that closure would be &#8220;extremely detrimental&#8221;. He also pointed out that cases in Edinburgh sheriff court already face serious delays, without having the burden of additional work from East Lothian.</p><p>The issue is not just criminal cases. Citizens who seek recourse in civil law would find that such recourse was offered not next door but a significant distance away. Then there is the whole court supply chain; fiscals, lawyers and court workers could all go. Our local newspapers, the East Lothian News and East Lothian Courier, would find it hard to maintain their coverage of local cases. The papers are to be commended for their campaigning against the proposal. Justice must be not only done but seen to be done.</p><p>Haddington&#8217;s justice of the peace court would go, too. Such courts embody the principle of justice that is delivered in one&#8217;s own community by one&#8217;s peers. Lay justice was introduced in 1609 by James VI, precisely to protect the people and their communities from the high-handedness and arbitrary decisions of the elite&#8212;barons and lords, who could not be trusted to act in the interests of the people. We ask a lot of JPs, not least that they sit on the bench at least 12 times a year. There is no doubt that finding candidates in East Lothian who would be willing to discharge those duties would be made harder if JPs were required to sit in Edinburgh. The effect would be to make the other duties that they undertake more difficult.</p><p>The closure of Haddington court would diminish the actual and perceived effectiveness of the justice system in my constituency. If justice delayed is justice denied, justice displaced is also justice denied.</p><p>There is another point. Like many towns in Scotland, Haddington&#8217;s reasons for being have changed and been challenged over the centuries. It was a major port when the River Tyne was navigable&#8212;that is long gone. Its function as a market town in a rural county, which served farmers and farm workers, has also gone. It has been a shopping centre with a wide catchment area, but as we speak my town centre is fighting for its life in the face of supermarket developments and online shopping.</p><p>However, Haddington remains the administrative centre of East Lothian, and the court is a central component of its stature and standing. To remove the court would be to diminish the town a little more, to question its purpose a little more, to reduce its vibrancy a little more and to hurt its pride a lot. Some of us find it passing strange that a Government that concerns itself so centrally with the stature, strength and sustainability of the nation can seem so cavalier with the vitality and vigour of the small towns that make up so much of the nation.</p><p>Haddington has certainly had a court for 600 years and there is every reason to believe that there has been some kind of assize there since the 12th century. In some form or other, the court has survived the siege of Haddington, the reformation, Cromwell, the union, the industrial revolution and two world wars. It would be a tragedy if it did not survive this Scottish National Party Scottish Government.</p><p>I know that the minister will say that there are no firm proposals, that savings must be made and that there will be consultation.

I chose this subject and to lead the debate in order to make it clear that, for us on this side of the chamber, there is no challenge more important or more urgent.</p><p>The unemployment figures that were released this month were a milestone and an alarm call: 100,000 young Scots between the ages of 16 and 24 have no work. That is the highest figure ever recorded and is a national crisis for Scotland because of the profound threat that it poses to the future prosperity, equality and fairness of our society. Every one of those 100,000 is a real person with real hopes and real dreams frustrated by the failure of us all, as the leaders of society, to ensure that they have a fair chance. We should not assume that they are passive actors in their frustration. Those young men and women want to work and complete dozens&#8212;sometimes hundreds&#8212;of job applications. They walk the high streets of our communities delivering CVs to anyone who will take them, but they are knocked back and knocked down. They get up and try again, but the question is, for how long? No matter how polite, courteous or regretful the knock-back is, it is nonetheless corrosive. It poisons optimism, crushes hope and corrodes self-esteem.</p><p>I know that first-hand from the last time that we were in this position. At the start of the 1980s, I was a teacher in a secondary school in Edinburgh. Many of its pupils did not have the easiest of backgrounds, but they were full of life, hope and bravado&#8212;exactly as young people should be. In 1981, I left for two years to work in Africa and when I returned it was to the same building but to a different school. Youth unemployment had soared and the Government of the day believed that unemployment was a price worth paying. The kids in the school had come to believe that society had no place for them. They thought that they would never work; even the ablest thought that there was no point in trying. All their hope, bravado and life had drained away. They had turned in on themselves and against a world that they felt had turned away from them. Today is world AIDS day. In Edinburgh in the 1980s, after the unemployment came the heroin and the shooting galleries, and my city, of which I am so proud, became the AIDS capital of Europe. I saw that generation lost&#8212;many did not survive the 1980s. We cannot let that happen again.</p><p>There is still time to turn the tide. There are things that we can do in Scotland&#8212;things that we can do with the powers of the Scottish Parliament. That is why, when the First Minister told us in May that he had no monopoly on wisdom, I asked to meet him to discuss the areas in which I thought that we could collaborate, of which this was one. The manifesto on which Labour stood included a detailed plan to eradicate youth unemployment. I thought that some of those measures could command a joint effort to demonstrate the urgency of the issue and our willingness to take Scotland forward together. I still think that, but I got no sense at that time that the First Minister had a plan for jobs or a real interest in working together on one. Indeed, there seemed to be little sense of urgency then, although it was clear six months ago where things were going.</p><p>Youth unemployment is the urgent problem of the moment. That is why we propose that the time has come for an emergency response from the Government. Instead, the Government amendment combines complacency with self-congratulation to justify the usual excuses.</p><p>First, ministers will say that they can do nothing because unemployment is driven by decisions of the United Kingdom Government. We can agree that the Tory-Liberal coalition is driving growth out of the economy and thousands of people out of work. That is why Labour is arguing day in, day out, for our five-point plan for growth. Four elements of that plan are indeed matters for the coalition Government, but it is simply not true that there is nothing that the Scottish Government can do.</p><p>Secondly, the Government will argue that it is doing all that it can: funding 25,000 apprenticeship places a year and guaranteeing a training place for 16 to 19-year-olds. We support those initiatives&#8212;the first was born out of our budget vote some years ago and the second is lifted from our last manifesto&#8212;but those 25,000 apprentices need jobs and, as for the guarantee, we have heard about it for six months but we see no sign of it on the ground. As a guarantee it is passing 20,000 by&#8212;and that number is growing. Those measures, welcome as they are, are demonstrably not enough. The 100,000 young people who are out of work are testament to that. The time has come to stop telling us what is being done and to start working out what more can be done.</p><p>Thirdly, the Government will say that we are outperforming the UK as a whole. In fact, the youth unemployment rate is worse here, so ministers spin to youth employment and try that instead. Does it matter? Is the top and hem of this Government&#8217;s ambition for Scotland to be a fraction less terrible than the Tories? This Government&#8212;any Government&#8212;should match its aspiration for the next generation of young Scots to the unlimited potential of every one of those young men and women. It should match the self-belief of those young men and women in all they can be and do. To use the failures of David Cameron and George Osborne as a benchmark is a sad, sorry and limited objective for any self-respecting Government.</p><p>The first thing that we must do is raise our own expectations, accept responsibility and act. We need more than words and more than a plan; we need an emergency response. Even George Osborne was shamed this week into taking some new action on youth unemployment.</p><p>The first signal that could be sent is the appointment of a cabinet minister for youth jobs, as the Smith group proposed this week. I have never been, nor ever will be, an advocate of additional ministerial posts for anything and everything, but in this instance any effective response will have to marshal efforts from across the Scottish Executive and command the many elements of Government policy making, so there is a vital role to be fulfilled. It could be a temporary measure, but it could send the strongest of signals to the young people we are talking about that the Government has finally noticed their plight.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government likes to say that jobs are a priority, and I know that, to reflect that, John Swinney had the word &#8220;employment&#8221; added to his title when the new Government was formed earlier this year.

Any investment is helpful in terms of economic growth; what is not helpful is a procurement system that allocates multimillion-pound contracts without creating local employment and training opportunities for the long-term unemployed. Every public sector contract should do that, and that is why the legislative programme this year should have featured a procurement bill to make that not just possible, and not just desirable, but mandatory. We know that it can be done&#8212;Falkirk Council, for example, has created hundreds of apprenticeship opportunities. However, too often it is not done or it is not enforced. It should apply to every public sector contract, whether it be Government, local authority, national health service or non-departmental public body. It should apply to revenue contracts as well as capital&#8212;and the Government should introduce it now.</p><p>I said that George Osborne had been shamed into action this week. He reintroduced a version of the future jobs fund&#8212;which he, himself, had abolished 18 months previously.

That is a start, but there have been only 820 placements. The scale of the challenge is much greater than that. We need those placements to be rapidly increased, and it is not enough to seek them only in the voluntary sector. The scheme has to be extended into the private sector. That is harder to do and it takes more effort, but the pay-off is worth it. We cannot allow the UK scheme simply to substitute for what we should be doing. Of course, we want as many placements as possible, so the Scottish Government should, right now, be talking to Jobcentre Plus, establishing a partnership and expanding what is going to be on offer.</p><p>While we are on the subject of U-turns, the Scottish Government should admit right now that cuts of over 20 per cent to our colleges can only make this problem worse. College principals are clear: they cannot sustain places with that degree of cut, and any guarantee to 16 to 19-year-olds will be delivered only at the expense of opportunities for the over-19s. We have been here before with this Government, when it expanded apprenticeship places for 16 to 19-year-olds by abolishing apprenticeship places for the over-21s.

They laughed, I cried. I hope that the result today is slightly different.</p><p>Today is an important day in the life of the Parliament. This is the last of the fixed points of a new parliamentary session. We had the election of the First Minister, then we had the official opening. Today, we have the first legislative programme for government of the new Administration. It is, then, the last time that I feel the obligation to begin by making clear yet again that we, on the Labour benches, understand not only that the First Minister won but that he won a majority of seats in the Parliament and that, under our electoral system, that is a remarkable achievement. I have tried to make it clear&#8212;how can I put it?&#8212;that we get it. I believe that my colleagues have conducted themselves with dignity and even as much magnanimity as they can muster. However, I hope that the chamber will forgive me if I make this point today with a little envy in my heart&#8212;not envy of position, patronage, pay check or even power itself but, I confess, envy of the opportunity that power affords.</p><p>I believe that all of us are here because we want to change our country for the better. I profoundly disagree with the First Minister and with other members in the chamber on how we should do that, but I do not question their intent or the First Minister&#8217;s. What an opportunity he has! With an absolute majority, he has the chance to achieve so much&#8212;the chance to put into practice the policies that he preaches and the power to shape Scotland for the better. He has power over the national health service, local government, our education system, our colleges, our universities and our legal system&#8212;all of those and much more besides. He can define how those institutions are and how they work. He can bend them to his will and make them deliver the things that he wants. There is no place now for excuses or for blaming others. The Government has the power to make Scotland and its institutions work as it would wish.</p><p>When fears have been expressed in the chamber about the danger of hubris from a Government with a majority, the First Minister has been quick to point out that we have had Governments with a majority before, through coalitions. We have. In those Governments, we took the opportunity of that power to reshape this country. We introduced land reform and ended a thousand years of feudalism. We passed the best incapacity legislation in Europe and the best homelessness legislation in the world. We introduced free personal care. We abolished tuition fees in Scottish universities for Scottish students. We introduced the smoking ban. We even set party advantage aside and modernised the way in which we elect our local councillors. I still have the scars from that and I was not even here to vote for it.</p><p>As I look around, I wonder how many new members on the Scottish National Party benches owe their start on a political career to proportional representation&#8212;more than a few, I think. That measure was introduced by a majority Government setting party advantage aside and pursuing measures every one of which changed Scotland for the better. Every one of them was unique to Scotland&#8212;in the case of the smoking ban, at the time at least. Every one of those things made Scotland better and different.</p><p>That is what a party can do with a majority, even if it is through a coalition. What can a single party with a majority do? It can do more than a national library bill. For four years of an SNP minority Administration, the First Minister dutifully introduced his centrepiece measures and legislation, then dutifully withdrew, cancelled or smothered them, and it was always someone else&#8217;s fault.</p><p>Members: Yours!</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The last speech that I made was a father-of-the-bride speech at my daughter&#8217;s wedding.

Forget the fact that the Government sets its budgets and that it has the power to ensure, if it wants to, that class sizes are cut. It ended up being the broken-class-sizes-promise bill, capping classes not at 18 but at 25.</p><p>In year 2, we were promised a bill to abolish the council tax. Where did that end up? It ended up with the Government running to the courts to hide the documents that showed just how badly that bill would have punished ordinary Scots&#8212;taxpayers&#8217; money being spent on legal bills to stop taxpayers finding out how much tax they were going to have to pay. It ended up with the Government going to the Court of Session to take on the Scottish Information Commissioner. That does not augur well for the amendments that the Government promised to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 this year.</p><p>Finally, the Government sneaked out the evidence that it had known all along that we were telling the truth about how much the local income tax would cost Scots on the day on which all eyes were on the First Minister&#8217;s erstwhile golf and theatre partner, Mr Murdoch, being humbled by a select committee in Westminster.</p><p>In year 4 of the previous session, we were promised a water bill, which was going to make Scotland the first hydro economy on the planet. We suspected that, like other promises, it was a flagship that would sink. It did, resurfacing now, a year late, watered down and stripped of the hyperbole.</p><p>Unfettered by minority, there is nothing now to stop the First Minister. He can legislate for class sizes of 18 if he still thinks that that is the right thing to do. He can introduce his local income tax now if he still thinks that it is a good idea. He can make us into a hydro economy&#8212;God knows, the raw material for it has been falling from the sky day after day. If he does not, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that he never had any intention of reducing class sizes to 18 and that he always knew that his local income tax was unfair, unworkable and a massive tax hike for most families.</p><p>What of the year of the great referendum bill? It was coming on Burns night and we would be voting on St Andrew&#8217;s day. It was to be the centrepiece not just of that year but of the very century in which we live. I know how important that issue is to the First Minister. I read it in the paper:</p><p>&#8220;Salmond puts independence at top of the agenda&#8221;.</p><p>That is the headline of a report, dated 15 August 2007, on the launch of the independence white paper. The white paper came out in 2007 and 2009 was to be the year of the referendum.</p><p>No wonder&#8212;[[Interruption.] I did not actually keep the paper as a souvenir; I found it at the weekend. [Interruption.] I tell members what, I reckon that they could go to just about any newspaper from any week in the past four years and find the First Minister launching an independence white paper. No wonder we never got round to the rest of the agenda; we were always stuck on item 1. We had white paper after white paper, we had a national conversation and we had a launch, a consultation, a relaunch and a consultation about a proposal for a white paper about a bill, but we never had the bill itself.</p><p>The First Minister said that the reason for that was that he did not have a majority for his referendum. He does now, but guess what? We are still stuck on item 1. In 2007, the First Minister asked every Scot to pause and reflect on the matter. He has been pausing and reflecting&#8212;noisily and expensively&#8212;on exactly that for four years, but he still does not know what his question will be, how many questions he will have or what propositions the questions will be about. He still cannot tell us about the Scotland that he wants to see. He cannot tell us what currency it would have, how it would defend itself, which institutions it would share with neighbours, whether it would be a member of NATO, or how or whether it could enter the European Union. He cannot tell us how our benefits and pensions would be secured.</p><p>The one thing that the First Minister has told us for sure about the Scotland that he wants is that the Queen would remain our head of state. He told her that right here, only a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, of course, it turned out that he could not be sure of that, because his party&#8217;s policy is to have a referendum on that matter, as well. There is nothing that he can tell us about the proposition, after all this time.</p><p>The First Minister has a mandate now. He has a majority in the Parliament. He has a draft bill&#8212;or so he said. He has no credible excuse for not bringing the bill forward, except that he does not think that the people of Scotland are ready to have their say, because they might not give him the answer that he wants.</p><p>I know that the First Minister knows his Montrose. Why would he not? Any poem that has the line</p><p>&#8220;Like Alexander I will reign,</p><p>And I will reign alone&#8221;</p><p>is bound to be to his liking. Of course, the poem also says:</p><p>&#8220;He either fears his fate too much,</p><p>Or his deserts are small,</p><p>Who dares not put it to the touch,</p><p>To win or lose it all.&#8221;</p><p>Where is that bill?</p><p>We will prosecute the case for unity&#8212;for all that a strong Scotland in a strengthened United Kingdom can be. We will present the case for a Scotland that is big enough, rich enough, smart enough and talented enough to get the best out of a modern, 21st century United Kingdom. We will present the case for a strong, devolved Parliament in Scotland, as we have done for decades.</p><p>When the First Minister talks about our history and other parties&#8217; histories, he should remember his own history. The claim of right was a direct result of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, as is the Parliament in which we stand. That was the Scottish Constitutional Convention in which he refused to participate from day one, just as he opposed the work of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution and the preparation and early stages of the Scotland Bill until he felt that there was some party expediency to be gained by coming on board. That is the history of his approach to devolution.</p><p>What do we find in the First Minister&#8217;s legislative programme? In the creation of a Scottish police force and fire service, there is a substantial reform, which I have long made clear we will support. However, we have to get it right. We will not get it right if the argument is made solely in terms of saving money. We have the opportunity to strengthen local democratic accountability of our policing at a more local level than is the case now and, at the same time, to streamline policing of organised crime, terror and fraud at the national level. I hope that, from tomorrow onwards, the Government will grasp this opportunity for positive change and not&#8212;as I have heard it do in recent days&#8212;trot out the tired old argument about Westminster cuts forcing its hand. Establishing a Scottish police force and a Scottish fire service is the right thing to do for reasons of policing and safety. We should do it right and we should do it for those right reasons. I believe that, if we do that, we will win the arguments with those who have not yet been convinced.</p><p>The Government is entitled to return to minimum unit pricing of alcohol, and we are entitled to continue to ask about its legality and effectiveness. However, I accept that it will happen. I am concerned, though, that the planned bill will be narrowly drawn and will not allow us to look again at other issues, such as restrictions on caffeinated alcohol, or to reconsider alcohol treatment and testing orders, which could have the same impact as drug treatment and testing orders have had over many years. We should be trying to extend further test purchasing and increasing support for children who are exposed to the worst excesses of alcohol-fuelled behaviour. If the bill is drawn too narrowly and we cannot do that, that will be a lost opportunity for Scotland.</p><p>Speaking of lost opportunities, I must ask why we have not used the measures that we passed in the previous session. A year ago, we passed a ban on alcohol promotions. That has not come into force yet. We also passed the idea of the social responsibility levy, which could be used to push up prices for alcohol and ensure that there is a payback not to the supermarkets but to local government, which could be invested in preventive measures. We agreed that we should implement that proposal. There is no point passing legislation in the Parliament if we simply do not use it. We all agree that the problem is urgent, so why has the Government not urgently used the legislation that we passed?</p><p>There is a more profound debate that we must begin, and I hope that the politics of this issue will not stop that debate beginning. Last week&#8217;s figures showed that, although alcohol consumption in Scotland is falling, it remains 23 per cent higher than it is in England, even though there is no price differential. I do not know why that is, but I am sure that it is something that the action that we take on price&#8212;or, indeed on opening hours or the strength of the drinks that are sold&#8212;will not completely address. Perhaps it involves issues of inequality or is a symptom of atrophied communities, the stress of modern family life or alienation. I do not know, but I think that it is time that we tried to find out, whatever disagreements we might have about anything else.</p><p>The delayed bill to tackle sectarianism is another one that we support. We do so, critically, because it involves another area of great difficulty. That has been demonstrated and reinforced by the recent inexplicable judgment in Edinburgh&#8217;s Sheriff Court in the case of an assault against a nationally known figure that appeared on live television. The lesson for us is that these offences are on the statute book and the will to deal with them is there, but it is hard to make them work. That is why the First Minister was right to delay the bill and extend the timetable. We must take our time if we are to get it right.</p><p>On higher education, we agree with the Government on the principle of free education. However, the funding situation is already spiralling out of control. Of course, fees for students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland had to rise and, of course, the fundamental problem is caused by soaring fees in the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;I do not deny that. However, we now have a crazy situation in which the University of Edinburgh is the most expensive university in Britain. That is not what the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning said he wanted or expected. He said that he expected that fees would be set in the range of &#163;1,800 to &#163;9,000. It is, frankly, hard to escape the conclusion that the universities are laughing at him and going their own way. He needs to get a grip, and quickly. Fees for Scottish students are only one element of how we fund our higher education sector, and there are many other questions that we must resolve urgently.</p><p>I am sure that we will support other bills on the list, such as the national library bill&#8212;I apologise to the National Library of Scotland for poking fun at it earlier. We will also support the self-directed support bill, which is late, as it was promised well over a year ago, and support for carers. All that is welcome.</p><p>This is what I meant about opportunity. A Government with a majority and a five-year term ahead of it could legislate today to create a national care service that would integrate health and social care, stand alongside the national health service and give a guarantee to our older people and those with disabilities that they will be looked after. That would be bold and dramatic, and change Scotland for the future.</p><p>I go back to my original question: what should one do with a majority like the First Minister&#8217;s? In fairness, he got that partly right. He should focus on making a future for young Scots, jobs and the economy, and opportunity. He should start now and aim as high as he can imagine. I welcome the attention in the First Minister&#8217;s statement to youth employment and the further measures that are proposed. However, they should be bolder still, and the First Minister should be more prepared in that area to use his majority legislative power if need be. Every public sector procurement of any size should require the creation of apprenticeship opportunities&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

As I have made clear over the past three weeks, we on this side of the chamber recognise the mandate that the Government has, and we want to identify the common ground on which we can take Scotland forward together. However, we must begin to explore the detail of that common ground&#8212;the how and the when. It is time to move from the poetry to the prose.</p><p>That is especially urgent in the case of action on sectarianism, as the First Minister has said that he wants to see new legislation on the statute book before the summer recess. We want to co-operate. The First Minister knows that we on the Labour benches are proud of Jack McConnell&#8217;s initiative in facing up to sectarianism and believe that more could have been done over the past four years. He knows, too, that one of our former Labour colleagues, Trish Godman, was a victim of the incidents that have led him to his current proposals. We take the issue very seriously and believe that it is about more than football, as he acknowledged in his statement. Nevertheless, we have concerns about getting legislation right in a very short time. Legislating for cybercrime is notoriously difficult, although I agree that we should legislate. We want to co-operate but, to do so, we must start talking immediately about the detail of what is proposed and the process, which will have to draw on evidence from outside the Parliament, as all good law making must. We cannot afford to legislate on the issue in haste and repent at leisure or to begin this session with a law that the police, courts and judiciary do not use.</p><p>I wrote to the First Minister last week, offering to discuss that matter and his plans to reintroduce alcohol minimum pricing proposals. On the latter, a good start would be to implement quickly the laws that we have already passed&#8212;months ago&#8212;to stop drink promotions. Above all, in that letter, I said that I wanted to work with him on my highest priorities&#8212;jobs and getting the economy growing. Last week&#8217;s unemployment figures may have been encouraging but there are still more than 200,000 Scots out of work and the number of women claiming jobseekers allowance in Scotland is the highest that it has been since records began.</p><p>We agree with the Government on a lot, in spite of the exchange that the First Minister and I had at a Federation of Small Businesses hustings. Attacking my plan to create 250,000 jobs, he said that</p><p>&#8220;Government can&#8217;t create jobs by diktat.&#8221;</p><p>He is right: we cannot do it by diktat&#8212;we need a plan. We need apprenticeships and job placements for the unemployed; we need support for employers in the small business sector to enable them to take on more staff; and we need investment in infrastructure. There is plenty of agreement there, and there is a lot more that we can do. A mortgage deposit scheme would boost construction and give young Scots the chance of getting on to the property ladder. Providing better support for students at college by extending the educational maintenance allowance would improve their opportunities. Extending co-investment funding, which has been so successful, would plug investment gaps in new and growing businesses.</p><p>We propose a plan for jobs and growth with more than 80 elements. We have a real chance to drive Scotland forward. The coalition Government at Westminster has no plan for growth and no plan for jobs. The regional development agencies have been abolished in England. I agree with the First Minister that Scotland can, right now, construct a comprehensive and coherent plan to get those 200,000 Scots back into the job market and let them take their families, enterprises and Scotland forward.</p><p>We can add to that the advantage that we have, on which we agree, in terms of green jobs and especially renewables. The Scottish Government&#8217;s 100 per cent target for renewable electricity production is ambitious. Now it must deliver it. An increase in marine production from a consented 45GWh to a delivered 2,260GWh and an increase in offshore wind generation from a consented 650GWh to more than 20,000GWh in only nine years are heroic assumptions that are based on some fairly speculative plans.</p><p>It is right to provide support for the University of Strathclyde&#8217;s innovation and technology centre and the offshore infrastructure fund, and we welcome that. However, we need quickly to start thinking about what else needs to be done. The plans need an extra 2,000MW of onshore wind generation delivered by the end of the decade. Should we not revisit the national planning framework to make it clearer where that might be installed? What are the grid implications? How quickly can all of that be consented?</p><p>Of course, this is not just about energy. Scotland should not just have the wind turbines; we should have the jobs, too.</p><p>I remember the jobs boom when the North Sea opened up. I was growing up in Inverness at the time, and everyone who was just a little older than me seemed to be heading offshore or to the construction sites at Nigg or Ardersier. Scotland got 70 per cent of the jobs that were created then. Now, however, we get only 10 per cent of the jobs that renewables projects create. We need to do more.</p><p>I will give one example to illustrate the point. The diving school at Fort William, which was originally set up to train Scots as divers for the North Sea, should be training Scots now to be the divers&#8212;potentially thousands of them&#8212;that those offshore wind projects will need. However, it is not doing that; it is training divers from across the world&#8212;from everywhere except Scotland. We have to change that. We should be finding a way to fund that work, so that those opportunities are available here in Scotland.</p><p>The First Minister and I signed a pledge that higher education would be free. He has the mandate to deliver that and no excuse not to. However, we have to start answering the questions about how we do that without slashing student places and while keeping our universities world class, because the First Minister promised all that, too. We have to improve support for students and end the situation in which they have access to less resource to live on than their counterparts elsewhere in the United Kingdom. That is urgent because course planning and the student application process mean that we need to begin to answer those questions in weeks rather than months if the future of our higher education sector is to be secure.</p><p>Another promise that the First Minister made&#8212;surely part of any social contract&#8212;was to protect the national health service. The First Minister promised to maintain that protection throughout this parliamentary session. That was the right thing to do, and we will hold him to that. However, in the course of the election campaign, I met NHS workers from around the country and across many professions who told me the health service that we cherish is struggling: vacancies remain unfilled; beds are being closed; operations are being cancelled; and building projects are being delayed. Some said that the situation was the worst that they had ever known, which surprised me. I know that the First Minister heard those things too&#8212;an NHS worker challenged him in one of our television debates.</p><p>The truth is that protecting the NHS does not just mean protecting the budget; it means protecting the service. Yes, we should reject the reforms that are&#8212;perhaps&#8212;happening in England, but we need to face up to reform of the bureaucracy or even the number of boards. Surely that is common ground, just as reform of care services&#8212;moving forward on self-directed care as the health secretary promised before the election&#8212;is common ground.</p><p>Another area in which we agree on direction but need detail now is policing. The First Minister has promised to maintain police numbers and we will hold him to that, but we do not know how many police forces the First Minister believes that we should have. I think that one force would maximise what savings there are to be made to protect the front line, provide more effective policing at a strategic level and strengthen the accountability and authority of local policing&#8212;if we get it right.</p><p>However, to do that we need to get governance structures right and build confidence in the reform within the police service itself and in the communities that it serves. We cannot begin to do that until the Government makes up its mind on how many forces are best. I think that one is best; if the Scottish Government decides that three or four are best, that will happen, given the parliamentary arithmetic, but we should move on that&#8212;and move quickly.</p><p>Those are just some of the areas in which we are in agreement with the Government about how to take Scotland forward, and I agree that Scotland&#8217;s path should be different from that pursued by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition in Westminster. There is a fairer, better way, and we will hold the First Minister to his promises on the social wage, as he has characterised it: on free personal care, concessionary travel, free prescriptions and free education.</p><p>We agree with the need for pay restraint, but the First Minister must accept and understand that the public sector pay freeze is, in a time of inflation, a pay cut for many thousands of public sector workers and families throughout the country. He cannot assume that those public sector workers will bear that burden alone to pay for the social wage for five years to come. That would not be fair; what is more, if in Scotland&#8212;as he says&#8212;the poor are not to pick up the bill for the rich, that pay restraint must be moderated by the full implementation of a living wage to protect those on the lowest incomes so that they are not the ones paying the highest price for something that they did not create.</p><p>There is common ground&#8212;but not, of course, when it comes to the First Minister&#8217;s ambition to separate Scotland from the United Kingdom. The First Minister was clear during the election campaign that an election result could not provide a mandate for such a separation, but I am clear that he can claim a mandate to hold a referendum on the issue.</p><p>I do not think that such a referendum is a good thing for Scotland, because it creates&#8212;and is already creating&#8212;uncertainty about the country&#8217;s future. It could damage investment in our economy, both internal and external, but I assume that it is going to happen because he now has no excuse for it not to.</p><p>That begs questions that the First Minister is now obliged to stop avoiding. When will it be? What will the question be? How much will it cost? What will the franchise be? How will campaigns be funded? What choice will be offered? He spent four years drafting the bill&#8212;was it three white papers that we saw?&#8212;but it never appeared because, we were told, there was a majority in this Parliament against it. There is no such excuse now.</p><p>It is simply not credible for the SNP to say after all this time that it does not know when or what the question will be or how many questions there will be, or, best of all, that it is not sure what it means by independence after all. That is not credible&#8212;and it is not convincing.</p><p>Last October, I said:</p><p>&#8220;I love my country too much to be a nationalist&#8221;.</p><p>Members: Oh!</p><p>I meant that I do not think that Scotland is too small, too poor or too stupid to stand on its own; I think that it is big enough, rich enough in talent and certainly smart, creative and educated enough to take every opportunity afforded by being part of a bigger social and economic unit.</p><p>In any case, I know that the sentence enraged those SNP supporters sad enough to comment on my speeches in the middle of the night. It was meant to do so; indeed, it is still working. [Laughter.] However, I hope that some of them were literate enough to know that I did not coin it&#8212;it was a quote from Albert Camus, who also said:</p><p>&#8220;You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question.&#8221;</p><p>If that is the First Minister&#8217;s referendum strategy, it is not good enough. The question is too big and too important not to be clear.</p><p>I know that the election result means that we will have to make our case against separation&#8212;and we will do so. The First Minister should be prepared to make his case for it, honestly and openly. He has no excuse not to.</p><p>I know that the election result also means that we will in any case talk about the Parliament&#8217;s powers. I do not mind some of that; we even agree with the First Minister sometimes, including, for example, on the need to get capital borrowing powers more quickly. However, we will not move Scotland forward if the Government turns every challenge to it into a challenge to the constitutional settlement. We will not move Scotland forward at all by talking about the powers that we do not have and failing to use those that we do.</p><p>In the spirit of last week&#8217;s parliamentary multilingualism&#8212;for the avoidance of doubt I tell Mr Crawford that this is Spanish, not Portuguese&#8212;I say:</p><p>&#8220;no hay camino, se hace camino al andar&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, there is no road; the road is made by walking. Yes, Scotland&#8217;s road forward is different&#8212;that is devolution&#8212;but we make it by walking, not talking. There are many directions that we agree on&#8212;on health, education and jobs, for example&#8212;and Scotland expects us to take those forward and to do so quickly.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the First Minister for his statement and for making it available in advance.

I welcome that, too, as I welcome today&#8217;s Amazon jobs announcement, although it is the case that the key areas of enterprise support, infrastructure and skills are now split across three portfolios.

Further, as if that was not enough, right on cue, the arc of prosperity erupted again, engulfing Scotland in volcanic ash. Apparently, it is not only the First Minister who has been endowed with God-like powers by a majority mandate. Mr Stevenson&#8217;s apocalyptic touch seems only to have been intensified by his brief sabbatical from ministerial office.

It is here; it is real.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 13 May 1999; c 18.]</p><p>Whether in government or opposition, we must now put the campaign trail behind us and face the real challenges ahead.</p><p>For the First Minister, there is the challenge of delivering all that he promised without the limitations of minority government. For this Parliament, and our democracy, there is the challenge of holding a majority Administration to account.</p><p>That is why this moment matters so much. It is a reminder that even in these circumstances, our First Minister must still be elected by the Parliament, not appointed. The symbolism is profound and important. The First Minister and his Government are answerable and accountable to the whole Parliament, and thereby the whole people&#8212;I know that he understands that.</p><p>Across the chamber, we have great responsibility, too: the more powerful the Executive, the more important the scrutiny we bring to bear on it in committee or in plenary, and the more diligent we must be in our engagement with the people and institutions of Scotland through the evidence that they give us, the petitions that they submit to us and the consideration that they seek from us. This is the result that the people chose, so it is up to us to make it work for them.</p><p>For those in the Government party, that will require an independence of thought and action, especially in committee, which might not always be comfortable but is their democratic obligation.

This week, we saw that three of the four worst unemployment black spots in the United Kingdom are here in Scotland.</p><p>In the past 10 days, we have heard plenty about the 57 varieties of independence. Yes, we will explore the powers that we might have&#8212;that is a consequence of the election result&#8212;but the most urgent and pressing matter is how to exercise the powers that we have now to create opportunity for our people now.</p><p>We will debate what divides us, but let us begin with something that unites us.

Jack&#8217;s legacy will be a lasting one, not least in the continuing work of the Parliament in international solidarity, especially with Malawi. The legacy of the smoking ban, which he led, is a real one that will eventually be measured in saved lives of many of Jack&#8217;s fellow Scots. He leaves the Parliament but&#8212;as the First Minister said&#8212;Jack McConnell has much public service to give and I wish him well in that. [Applause.]</p><p>It is somehow invidious to pick out other members, but for those of us who grew up in Edinburgh politics, Robin Harper was always a presence and a character. It is one of the Parliament&#8217;s strengths that it has given Robin the opportunity to make his unique contribution during the past years. His door was always open to the civic Scotland that we serve. He has served Parliament and his city well. [Applause.]</p><p>I turn to the motion itself and to our Presiding Officer. Alex Fergusson and I have a little-known bond through the village of Leswalt. He was born and grew up there, my mother-in-law lives there and, as it turns out, the manager of my football team grew up there, too. Leswalt really rules all aspects of my life. Fortunately, all of those figures of authority carry out their duties with grace and success&#8212;even Colin Calderwood, these days&#8212;and the Presiding Officer does so particularly. The First Minister is right that the Presiding Officer has not lost his political antenna. On at least one occasion in visiting Leswalt, I had been there only five minutes when I received a text from him to let me know that he knew that I was in his constituency. [Laughter.]</p><p>Alex Fergusson has presided over debates and even First Minister&#8217;s question time with a careful mixture of light touch and firmness. I think that the uniqueness of his task as Presiding Officer has been to preside over a Parliament not just of minorities in general, but in which the Administration itself is a minority, too. That has led to high drama once or twice, not least at budget time, and to occasions when the Parliament has chosen a direction in defiance of the Government, as in the Calman process. Throughout that, the Presiding Officer has presided with care and kept the integrity of our Parliament intact, for which he deserves our thanks.</p><p>Alex Fergusson has also discharged his duties of representing the Parliament at home and abroad with great dignity and gravitas. I do not think that he will mind my saying that he did not seek the office but, rather, had it thrust upon him. He has, nonetheless, served us well and he has done us proud.

They focused rigorously on what is right for Scotland. They took evidence widely, studied the forms of devolution that are to be found elsewhere in Europe and the wider world, and assessed the performance of our devolution settlement assiduously before reaching their conclusions. They recognised that Scotland has a high level of legislative power but a low level of fiscal devolution. To rebalance that, they pursued the extension of our fiscal powers in order to improve our accountability to the people whom we serve.</p><p>The expert group that the commission created developed the proposals for the devolution of some taxes and, crucially, the sharing of income tax between ourselves and the UK Parliament. It supported the idea of this Parliament having powers to borrow. Those are serious proposals, prepared by serious people, and they form the basis of the fiscal sections of the Scotland Bill. </p><p>The wider financial powers in the bill will give this Parliament real choices.

Most of our taxes will be pooled and redistributed to the Scottish budget via a grant, which is a practical expression of solidarity through sharing resources and risks across the United Kingdom. Recent history has shown how important that is.</p><p>Everyone except the SNP knows that it was the sharing of risk across the larger economy of the United Kingdom that allowed our two biggest banks to be saved from collapse. If the SNP does not understand that, surely the considerably greater difficulties that Ireland has encountered in dealing with its banking crisis are a reminder that small is not always beautiful when it comes to risk.</p><p>Sharing income tax will give us real accountability when we set a Scottish rate, as we will have to do under the bill&#8217;s proposals. There will still be a common UK tax framework, which makes practical sense for workers and employers. It also means that capacity will still exist for redistributive policies across the whole UK&#8212;the social union that the Calman commission made very clear was a central part of the structure and strength of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Parliament should support the principles of the bill for all those reasons, but there is a greater reason, too. The bill moves us to a stronger Scottish Parliament in a strong United Kingdom, which is the overwhelming desire of the Scottish people. It is demonstrated in opinion polls but, more important, it is demonstrated in election after election. Of course, there is much detailed scrutiny to be carried out. The previous Government&#8217;s white paper did not exactly follow the Calman proposals <place-holder colnum=\"31358\"/> in every detail, and the new Government&#8217;s Scotland Bill is not the same as the white paper. That is why the work of the ad hoc committee that has been set up under Wendy Alexander&#8217;s convenership is so important.</p><p>The detail of the financial plans requires careful scrutiny, but we do not need to accept the SNP&#8217;s scaremongering to agree that the implementation plan must be designed with a very close eye on the consequences for the Scottish budget.</p><p>It is not too late for the SNP to be a constructive part of this constitutional challenge. The SNP has stood apart from it until now, but that is the pattern of the party&#8217;s engagement in devolution, just as it boycotted the Scottish Constitutional Convention but then joined the referendum campaign when it realised that that was in step with the desires of the Scottish people and the SNP was not.</p><p>The SNP has the space to do this, as its own constitutional cupboard is bare. The national conversation has fallen silent&#8212;not that it was ever anything more than an echo in an empty room&#8212;its referendum bill has fallen by the wayside and its core purpose has fallen yet further out of favour, with independence attracting the support of less than a quarter of Scots. The SNP can be a constructive partner in strengthening devolution, but to do that it must accept the principle that a strong Scottish Parliament that is anchored in the monetary, fiscal, social and political union of the United Kingdom is the settled will of the Scottish people. To be a constructive partner in the project, the SNP must end its endless search for coded formulations of independence&#8212;fiscal autonomy, full fiscal responsibility or whatever it is going to be today. It cannot be a constructive partner in the project with its amendment today, which tries to disguise opposition as grudging support and cannot be supported for that reason.</p><p>Detail is important, but today is the day when we take the decision of principle.

They have refused to give up and I wish them all luck for Saturday, which is a key date in their efforts.</p><p>I well remember the first time I visited Leuchie house as the newly elected MSP for East Lothian. Although it was June or July, I was greeted at the door by Santa Claus. I had come at the end of one of the family fortnight holidays in which Leuchie house specialises and, to mark the occasion, the people there were having what I was told was an Australian Christmas&#8212;in other words, Christmas in the middle of summer. I think that that illustrates the sense of fun and happiness that one gets with those holidays, which will be recognised by visitors and, in particular, anyone who has participated in the dinners that end them.</p><p>That also points us to Leuchie house's uniqueness. The facility provides respite or a holiday not just for those who suffer from MS but for their carers, usually husbands or wives, and indeed whole families. It is the only facility that allows its users to have a holiday without being separated from their loved ones and their loved ones to have a holiday with them in the knowledge that their care needs will be looked after.<place-holder colnum=\"28985\"/></p><p>Since that first time, I have been back to Leuchie lots of times and have never heard anyone who has used the service say a bad word about it. I cannot say the same about any other health service, care service or public service that I have encountered. Many users have explained how Leuchie house is a lifeline and an absolute necessity in their being able to continue to live with their loved ones at home. Indeed, the point was never more poignantly made than it was when I visited just after the MS Society took the decision to close the facility.</p><p>Of course we are not just talking about people who come to Leuchie house from afar. Fifteen families in east Lothian also use the day service and for some of the MS sufferers concerned, the service's removal means the difference between their being able to continue to live at home with their family or not.</p><p>I understand that many MS sufferers might like more choice or more flexible short-break options. However, I do not understand why the route to that involves taking away choice from those who already have what they want. Those who face this situation are clear that they will be offered the choice of a nursing home or hospital, and that is simply not acceptable.</p><p>I do not understand why the MS Society has made what I think is a wrong decision. The society should have been so proud of Leuchie house that it could not have considered its closure. I can tell the chamber that east Lothian is proud of Leuchie and does not want it to be closed down.</p><p>I have been disappointed by the response not only from the society but from the Scottish Government. When I raised the matter with the minister, I was told, first, that it was a matter for the society and, secondly, that respite for MS sufferers is a matter for their local authorities. Both those things are true, but cannot the Government see that, to those service users, it is washing its hands of the service&#8212;not once, but twice? I know that the minister supports better services for people with MS and that she understands the Scottish dimension to the disease. I do not understand why she will not help to find a way to keep Leuchie house open.</p><p>I close by mentioning the staff&#8212;some 83 of my constituents&#8212;whose jobs will go. If they were here&#8212;some of them may well be&#8212;they would say that their jobs were not the important thing here. However, I know that some of them have found alternative employment but have turned it down to stay at Leuchie for the final 10 weeks, because they could not bear to walk away. Given that degree of dedication to the service&#8212;a service so loved and valued by its users&#8212;surely we should stand alongside the staff, the campaigners, the <place-holder colnum=\"28986\"/> carers and, above all, the service users in their efforts to keep Leuchie house open.

Presenting his first programme for Government in 2007, he made a virtue of its being light on legislation: that is one promise that he has not broken. The legislative programme that has been presented to us today is, in parts, worthy but it is not substantial and fails to address the most pressing concerns of Scotland and its people.</p><p>I exclude from that remark the Alcohol (Scotland) Bill, because there has never been disagreement from the Labour Party that Scotland's relationship with alcohol is a pressing concern. That is why we have always signalled our willingness to work with all parties to progress measures to address it. However, we cannot support the Government's approach to price, not because we think that price does not matter but because the Government's proposal is still likely to be found illegal, still leaves major problem drinks untouched and still constitutes a windfall for the supermarkets to the tune of &#163;140 million a year. There is no single solution on alcohol in any case, and we will support the vast majority of the bill's proposals.</p><p>I hear from the Government benches that we want to do nothing. Nothing could be further from the truth. I hope that the Government will, in turn, be able to set aside party politics and support the amendments that we will lodge on, for example, alcohol treatment and testing orders to tackle drink-fuelled crime, a mandatory challenge 25 scheme to tackle underage drinking, and action on caffeinated drinks, which fuel much youth crime. Those proposals now have the backing of the independent commission that Labour set up. From its proposals, I ask the Government also to support amendments that we shall lodge quickly to end price-based alcohol advertising in our print media, and to end supermarkets competing on the depth of their drink discounting.<place-holder colnum=\"28256\"/></p><p>We agree with the Government that double jeopardy should end, and we will support the bill to achieve that. However, I wonder why that has taken so long; it is three years since the collapse of the World's End case, which clearly illustrated the importance of that measure.</p><p>We will also support the Government on forced marriages. However, what has been proposed is catch-up to the rest of the country, for which legislation on forced marriages was passed two years ago.</p><p>We welcome the idea of Scottish Water being able to engage in new profitable commercial activities. Indeed, there are other possibilities that the First Minister did not mention&#8212;the use of the Scottish Water pipe network for fibre optic networks, for example. However, our welcome is cautious because we must see the details of how that engagement will be achieved. If the model is, as I suspect, the model that has been developed by the Scottish Futures Trust, that does not augur well. The Scottish Futures Trust should probably try to build the Scottish National Party's first-ever school before it tries to build the world's first hydro economy.</p><p>Of course, the problem is that in every previous year Mr Salmond's statement has had a major policy&#8212;a core promise; the hallmark and substance of his Government&#8212;at its centre for the year ahead that he has committed to absolutely and without prevarication. In 2007, it was the sure and certain delivery of class sizes of 18 in all primary 1, 2 and 3 classes throughout Scotland. In 2008, it was the sure and certain introduction of a council tax abolition bill and the introduction of a local income tax. In 2009, it was the Government's introduction of a referendum bill in 2010. That bill was going to be introduced on Burns night. That is the bard who wrote the immortal lines:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The best laid schemes o' mice and men<br/> Gang aft agley\".</p><p>We can see the theme. Every year, Mr Salmond's grand plan comes to nothing. Let us see whether his water bill survives or whether it, too, evaporates like so much before it did. Last year, Mr Salmond's independence bill was his flagship policy; now it is a ghost ship that flits eerily in and out of view from time to time. We have had four programmes for government, three consultations on his bill, a national tour of sparsely attended town halls, and endless drafts of a three-part question that nobody could understand. What is the First Minister going to produce out of all of that? He is going to produce an election leaflet. There will be no bill in the Parliament, but there is a &#163;2 million bill for the Scottish taxpayer.</p><p>Now the Scottish Government is at it again. Surely the central question of this year's <place-holder colnum=\"28257\"/> programme is the Budget (Scotland) Bill and its impact on services, jobs and the economy. The Scottish Government tells us that the comprehensive spending review will impose enormous pressure on the 2011-12 budget and beyond. We know that. It tells us that the Con-Dem coalition is cutting too fast and too deep and is threatening recovery. We know that, too. What we need to know is what Alex Salmond is going to do. Instead of telling us, he is sending John Swinney and one wise man around Scotland all over again for a national conversation&#8212;on cuts, this time. It is time that the Scottish Government told us what it is going to do with its \"Independent Budget Review\" and time that it got its proposals to this Parliament.</p><p>The First Minister has form in refusing to say what his budget might bring. This time last year, he omitted to mention that the Budget (Scotland) Bill's high point would be the cancellation of the Glasgow airport rail link. Has not that been the pattern of the First Minister's actual programmes for Government: the cancellation of rail links to Edinburgh and Glasgow airports; failure to complete the motorway network; failure to build the Aberdeen bypass; failure to build the Borders rail link; no replacement for the route development fund; year-on-year cuts to the enterprise budgets; the cancellation of transitional rates relief; and a rates revaluation that threatens the existence of businesses across Scotland that today face a 50, 100 or 200 per cent increase in their rates?</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20976559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the First Minister's fourth programme for Government statement and, of course, his last.

I see that during the summer the First Minister was made a \"Star Trek\" Starfleet officer, so who knows where the arc of prosperity will reach out to next, boldly going where no serious economist has ever gone before.</p><p>As for cuts, the truth is that in the good years this Government was cutting our public services: 2,000 fewer teachers, 1,000 fewer classroom assistants, 4,000 fewer posts in the national health service and 1,500 fewer nurses. If that is the First Minister's idea of protecting front-line services in the best of years, what is in store in his budget this year?</p><p>Even where there is consensus, the Government cannot deliver. The First Minister boasted of our \"courageous\" climate change legislation. He went to Copenhagen to boast about it, and for all I know he is still planning to go to the Maldives to boast about it, but he still has not managed to construct the annual targets that the legislation demands. He is in danger of breaking his own courageous law.</p><p>There is always less than meets the eye with this Government and this First Minister. Students learned that when their loans were not cancelled. Parents learned it when class sizes did not come down. First-time home buyers learned it when their grants did not materialise. The construction industry learned it when capital projects dried up. Small businesses learned it when their rates doubled or worse. Knife crime victims learned it when the Government refused to act on knife crime.</p><p>In his first programme for government, Alex Salmond said that his statement was different, because we had a Government and not an Executive. Right enough: an Executive does things, but this Government undoes things. It undid the capital programme of schools, hospitals and transport projects, it is undoing 10 years of economic progress and it has undone every promise it ever made to anyone.</p><p>We cannot fault the First Minister for chutzpah. If anyone has expounded</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the droopy mantra of 'it wizny me'\"<place-holder colnum=\"28259\"/></p><p>in this Parliament, it is the First Minister. Every day he gives the impression of being in office but not in power.

Seven of them are still with us and a couple of them have reappeared in this year's programme. Those include the children's hearings bill, which is so incompetent that it has been delayed already&#8212;before its announcement in the programme. That must be some kind of record.</p><p>Looking back, last year's flagship bill was, of course, the council tax abolition bill. It was trailed extensively and with the usual bravado and bluster, but&#8212;alas&#8212;it was a flagship that was already holed below the waterline. A few weeks later it sank without trace, to the relief of business, trade unions and the families who had faced a 25 per cent hike in their income tax bills. Now that was action to support Scotland's economy. The truth is that this Government's record of delivery on its programmes is poor indeed. It famously brings forward little substantial legislation, and much of that is then delayed, botched or just plain dropped. Therefore, we should take this programme with a large pinch of salt.</p><p>This year's flagship bill&#8212;the referendum bill&#8212;was also pre-announced last year. It starts with even less support than the late, unlamented council tax abolition bill had last year. The First Minister's coy hints about multi-options are just game playing, when he should be governing. The test of a Government programme must surely be the extent to which it addresses the crucial matters that face our country. We are in the middle of a recession, so the measure of this year's programme should be how it protects and creates jobs, helps Scots through the economic downturn and prepares us to move ahead when the upturn comes. As lain McMillan of the Confederation of British Industry said earlier this week:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The overriding challenge to our politicians is simple&#8212;test all policies against a single benchmark: will it make <place-holder colnum=\"19212\"/> Scotland a better place to create jobs and wealth as the economic recovery takes hold?\"</p><p>We should all take that test seriously. The Scottish National Party should take it seriously, but nowhere more so than in the showpiece of this programme for government: the referendum bill. If ever a piece of legislation failed to reach that benchmark, it is that bill.</p><p>This is about priorities.

I will say more about that.</p><p>As the banking crisis deepened last year, Alex Salmond's analysis and pronouncements became ever more eccentric. From, \"Don't panic, our banks are sound,\" and, \"Spivs and speculators did it,\" to the bizarre claim that the First Minister would extend &#163;100 billion of credit in an independent Scotland&#8212;overblown, ill-informed and just plain wrong.</p><p>It was indeed Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling who took firm and decisive action to reflate the banks and prevent the collapse of our financial system. That action is working. Moreover, it took Labour, on these Opposition benches, to come up with an action plan for how devolution could be used to help Scottish families weather the worst of the global economic storm: fast-tracking capital expenditure; giving more help for home owners facing repossession; restarting public-private partnerships to remove the blockage in public building that was caused by the Scottish Futures Trust; ditching the local income tax; and restoring adult apprenticeship numbers. Those are just five <place-holder colnum=\"19213\"/> of the 15 practical suggestions that we made while the SNP stood frozen in the glare of the crisis. That is the core of the economic recovery programme that the First Minister has just boasted about. I am glad that he has implemented it. If he had thought of it, that might have been something to boast about.</p><p>There is worse, because at every turn the SNP Government has undermined its own economic recovery plans. Yes, it accelerated housing budgets, but it changed, changed again and changed back housing association grant arrangements, so that months went by and housing associations could not build. Accelerated capital investment is a good thing, but the Government then lost another year of school and hospital building in trying to make its Scottish Futures Trust work. In two years, the Government lost &#163;2 billion of public sector infrastructure from the PPP pipeline and tore 20,000 jobs out of the construction industry.</p><p>The problem is not just in construction, however. Last week, I visited the Borders, the centre of Scotland's textile industry, which employs 17,000 Scots and is worth &#163;1 billion to the economy&#8212;and it is paying people off. David Breckenridge, the chair of the Scottish Textile Industry Association, has declared himself staggered at ministers' inability to grasp what is happening and what is needed. Referring to Scottish ministers, he said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ministers dissemble and refer to an 'economic recovery programme' which is bereft of tangible support for businesses.\"</p><p>The First Minister should not have been telling us today what he has done; he should have been announcing new measures on the economy&#8212;for example, wage and training subsidies such as those that are already in place in Wales, top-ups for firms that take on new employees, or support for companies that use short-time working to keep staff on through the hard times rather than paying them off.</p><p>Last week, I also visited Borders College's excellent new campus in Galashiels, where I was told that two thirds of last year's first-year apprentices will not be coming back, because they have been laid off. The First Minister promised that that would not happen. Action should have been announced today to begin to make good the promise made to redundant apprentices that they can complete their training.

However, the First Minister must first demonstrate that he can turn that money into schools and hospitals; then he can talk about bringing forward further capital investment. I am delighted that the First Minister opened the campus at Galashiels, because it was a Labour-led Administration that gave the college &#163;30 million to build it. That is capital investment doing what it is supposed to do.</p><p>There are examples of what can be done, and Falkirk Council is showing the way. Its insistence on providing training places for young people with no other prospects, both in a proportion of its own vacancies and in contracts that it lets, is working. It has put 300 youngsters on the path to a future. The Government should be telling us how it will roll that out across councils and across the public sector.</p><p>Of course, action on the economy does not always require legislation, except when we come to the opportunities presented by the budget bill. Last year, the Government needed two attempts at a budget bill, exactly because it would not agree to measures to support the economy quickly enough. However, in the end, the bill included 8,000 more apprenticeships, &#163;50 million funding for those who lose or face losing their jobs and &#163;60 million for our town centres. We showed last year that we are willing to work towards a budget that serves Scotland's needs. I only hope that, this year, ministers will do that first time round, in good time and in good faith. They should have started today by giving priority to new plans on the economy and jobs.</p><p>People who face repossession have real fears. Almost three months ago, the First Minister conceded that, yes, Scottish families have less protection from repossession than those south of the border. I offered to bring Labour MSPs back to Parliament over the recess to support the Government and to get the legislation passed as quickly as possible, but that offer was declined. Every day that passes puts more Scottish families at risk and under pressure. When will the debtor protection bill actually become law, not just warm and weaselly words of comfort?</p><p>Like the First Minister, I spent the summer out and about across Scotland&#8212;although I travel a bit lighter and certainly more cheaply. In many towns, I joined knife crime campaigners to collect signatures for our petition. I was taken aback by what I found. Outside one supermarket in <place-holder colnum=\"19215\"/> Glasgow, the first three people I stopped all had close family members who had been knife crime victims. The next day in Greenock, the first person I met was the mother of a young man who was murdered a year ago this month. The second was a football team-mate of Damien Muir, who was stabbed by an assailant on bail for a previous knife attack. The programme for government should include action on knife crime, including the introduction of minimum sentences to send the message that anyone who carries a knife will go to jail. That would make Scotland safer.</p><p>Also during the summer, we had the report on the tragic death of Brandon Muir. I have said that even that tragedy is transcended by that of the 20,000 children who live with drug-dependent parents and the perhaps 100,000 children who live with alcohol-dependent parents. We do not how many children are living the way that Brandon Muir lived. I want us to re-examine the circumstances in which we remove children from harm. I accept that the Government and local authorities are trying to fix the system where there are not enough social workers or procedures are failing, but we also need to change the system. Barnardo's, Professor Neil McKeganey and many Scots agree with me. The programme for government should include action now on that issue.</p><p>Of course, we will be able to support some of the bills in the programme for government. Colleagues will talk more about those in the course of the debate. On bills such as the budget bill and the alcohol bill, we are willing to look for consensus if the Government is willing seriously to seek it. However, our priorities every day will be: jobs and the economy; crime and support for the victims of crime; and a refusal to accept that children should be at danger in their home in a modern Scotland. Those should be the Government's priorities every day as well.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173890", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Accelerating capital investment this year was a good thing, of course&#8212;we suggested it.

His justification&#8212;that Jack Straw had said that representations must be heard from the prisoner&#8212;has proven to be simply false, and a different explanation has appeared every day. However, the documents that were published yesterday made it clear that it was the cabinet secretary who offered to visit the prison and hear representations, as many members, such as Elaine Murray, have quoted chapter and verse to show.</p><p>The note of that meeting, which has now been released, reveals no argument that could not have been made in writing to the justice secretary, but it clearly shows that the visit compromised the separate but parallel application for compassionate release and the then on-going appeals. Indeed, when Mr MacAskill was talking about that visit today, he clearly stated that he told Mr al-Megrahi that he was considering the two applications together because that was the most efficient way of undertaking the process. The note reveals that Mr MacAskill raised with Mr al-Megrahi the point that his PTA application could not be granted while his appeal continued. It is <place-holder colnum=\"19083\"/> impossible to avoid the conclusion that that ill-advised visit compromised the whole process.</p><p>The prisoner transfer application was turned down because Mr MacAskill accepted that the American families of victims believed that they had been promised that al-Megrahi would serve out his sentence in Scotland. I accept that reasoning, and Jack McConnell has explained why, in his view, it is indeed correct.</p><p>However, Mr MacAskill has never explained why, if that ruled out transfer to incarceration in Libya, it did not similarly disallow release on licence to freedom in Tripoli. Mr al-Megrahi is still a lifer and is still technically liable to recall. His sentence has not been quashed and he has not been pardoned. There is a glaring logical inconsistency between the two decisions, and it is a cruel inconsistency for those American families in whose name the prisoner transfer application was refused. It could have been resolved by compassionate release in Scotland, but it is clear that Mr MacAskill dismissed that option. It is also clear that Strathclyde Police simply indicated how it would provide security for that option and at no time said that it could, or would, not do so. The option should have been considered.</p><p>As many speakers have said, compassion is woven into the fabric of our justice system just as it is inscribed on the mace. That is why we have no death penalty, why we have the right of appeal and then further review, why we have parole, and why we have the right of application for compassionate release. However, David McLetchie was right when he said that compassion is tempered by justice, just as compassion and justice are intertwined on the mace. That is why due process requires consideration of the sentence served and any views of the court on that sentence as well as the medical evidence.</p><p>As Robert Brown and other speakers made clear, we have never heard from the justice secretary that he considered any of those factors, nor have we had any indication of how he balanced them alongside the medical evidence. We can only conclude that he failed to give them due consideration. As for the medical evidence, we know that, at best, it is far less clear-cut than we had been led to believe.</p><p>The decision was entirely one for Scottish ministers to make. Every document that was released yesterday&#8212;even the account of the Libyan minister's statement regarding the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary that has Mr Salmond so excited today&#8212;made it clear that UK ministers respected the fact that the decision was one for Scotland to make.</p><p>I have made my judgment on the decision and <place-holder colnum=\"19084\"/> the process and I stand by it. I said that the visit to Greenock was unnecessary and I believe I was right. I said that compassion for al-Megrahi had to be balanced against the length of the sentence remaining and I believe I was right. I said that compassion had to be balanced against the enormity of the crime, and the guidance says that I was right. I must admit that I assumed initially that the medical evidence must be incontrovertible and unambiguous, but as it turns out I was wrong about that. On none of those matters has Mr MacAskill convinced the Parliament. The First Minister must address them now. He can use this chance to make the case for his minister's decision or he can use it to make political capital.

Whatever happens&#8212;and a fair bit has happened in the intervening years&#8212;no one can take that moment from those of us who were there.</p><p>The argument for Scotland to have a greater degree of self-government within the United Kingdom is a political thread that, for Labour, has run from Keir Hardie through J P Mackintosh to Donald Dewar.</p><p>I am in no doubt about the purpose of the Scottish Parliament. Labour delivered it to be a powerful instrument of social progress, and so it has been. One of the great achievements of our first four years was to launch an assault on the systems of ownership of the land that we love, with the abolition of 1,000 years of the yoke of feudal tenure, the right for communities to buy and manage the land on which they live and work, and the right to roam across the land, which is a commonwealth for all. In only 10 years, the patterns of land ownership have begun to shift away from wealth, privilege and absenteeism towards community ownership and mutualism.</p><p>Our Parliament was delivered to bring politics closer to the people whom it governs, and so it has done. I remember a young woman telling a harrowing story 10 years ago at a voluntary sector conference. Her husband had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's and he was incapable of taking decisions with her about the family's finances, so the bank had frozen their joint bank account. Not only did she have to deal with the care of her husband in the face of that most tragic of diseases, but she could not access any of the family's resources. All that, because the laws that <place-holder colnum=\"18836\"/> governed such incapacity in Scotland were 400 years old.</p><p>Even worse, the new law that was required had been drafted 15 years earlier and was ready and waiting, but it had never been enacted because it was Scotland-only legislation and parliamentary time at Westminster had not been found for it. Jim Wallace and I took the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 through the Parliament. The Parliament was able to say, \"This is the first piece of major, substantive legislation we will pass.\" Scotland went from having the most obsolete incapacity legislation to the most modern incapacity legislation in Europe. The law is used by as many as 100,000 Scots every year, so pretty well every family in the country has benefited from it at some time.</p><p>We could say the same of our world-class homelessness legislation, the first smoking ban in the United Kingdom, and so it goes on. However, closeness means more than just responsiveness in legislation. The public gallery in the Parliament is never empty and surprisingly often it is full. I remember responding to a debate as Deputy Minister for Community Care on the shortage of British Sign Language trainers and hence of signers. I turned up to find hundreds of BSL users from all over Scotland who had come to watch the debate. A watched parliament may still boil sometimes, but at the very least it has to treat the people's issues seriously while they look on.</p><p>Devolution has demonstrated that it can carry visionary and historic legislation, that it can serve the people's interests, and that it can drive change in Scotland. The Calman report's authors said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"devolution has been a remarkable success\".</p><p>However, they also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the present system also has shortcomings.\"</p><p>Indeed, our headlines sometimes reveal a Scotland that is lagging behind and not living up to its potential. In primary 5 mathematics and science, we are 20<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> respectively in a league table of 36, and we are falling down the list. We are still the sick man of Europe; although we are getting healthier, we are doing so more slowly than is the case in comparable countries. We have more than twice as many drug-related deaths per head as any other European country has. In international reports we are sometimes called the most violent country in the world, with record levels of alcohol abuse, knife crime and murder. It is clear that there is still much to be done.</p><p>Calman's conclusion was that devolution is lop-sided. All the significant legislative powers that should properly have been devolved to Holyrood were devolved, but the Scotland Act 1998 provided limited devolution of fiscal power.<place-holder colnum=\"18837\"/></p><p>The Commission on Scottish Devolution represents a remarkable achievement, and I welcome Sir Kenneth Calman to the public gallery. The commission was cross-party and it was driven by the Scottish Parliament, against the will of its executive arm. It was also cross-Administration, with support from the UK Government, and it was cross-sector, with its members' mix of business, voluntary sector and political backgrounds. However, it delivered a unanimous report.</p><p>At a time when the people's trust in their politicians is as low as we have known it to be, the commission's recommendations are not about giving more power to members of the Scottish Parliament; they are about accountability and giving more power to the people who elect us. The Calman process was characterised by rigour, attention to evidence and the breadth of consensus that the commission commanded throughout the process.</p><p>To maintain that consensus and momentum, the steering group has quickly established itself and begun to discuss how to progress Calman's proposals. Only the Scottish Government stands aloof and alone, outside the consensus, in defiance of the will of the Parliament&#8212;the very body to which it is democratically accountable. We should not be surprised, given that whenever the heavy lifting on devolution is to be done, the Scottish National Party is always posted missing&#8212;from the Scottish Constitutional Convention onwards. I paraphrase a saying from that time: when it comes to Calman, the Scottish Government says no, but we are the Parliament of Scotland and we say yes.</p><p>The Calman process, with its rigour, substance and ability to reach out and build consensus, has simply underlined the emptiness of the vessel that is the national conversation, which has reached out only to the twilight world of the SNP's midnight bloggers. Consultation events are now just platforms for First Minister's speeches of notoriously stultifying length.

Such is the importance of HBOS to Scotland that few Scots will not be directly affected by the proposed takeover. I suggest that no one will be unaffected by it in some way as a result of the potential impact on the Scottish economy of changes to the bank.</p><p>That is why last week Labour suggested a broad meeting of all political parties and representatives of wider Scotland to strengthen our common advocacy for Scottish jobs and Scottish decision making, and to leverage consensus into the most powerful case we can make to Lloyds TSB. That meeting happened on Monday. Using the Scottish Council for Development and Industry to facilitate and host such an event was a good idea, and I was pleased to participate in those discussions.</p><p>For one thing, the gathering revealed that HBOS has an even greater reach into Scottish life, commerce and society than I think we in the Parliament had realised. Looking beyond the primary concerns of people with jobs, mortgages, savings or investments with HBOS, takeover of the company will impact on our construction industry, our voluntary sector and our cultural and sports sectors. For example, HBOS holds a significant portfolio&#8212;around &#163;4.5 billion&#8212;in the housing association sector and on Monday, BAA talked about concerns for air routes that are dependent on the Edinburgh business market, of which HBOS is a big part.</p><p>A quarter of a million people enjoyed the Bank of Scotland fireworks concert at the end of the Edinburgh festival, and 140,000 youngsters benefit from the Bank of Scotland's support for grass-roots football, while many of the company's staff engage in a volunteering scheme that benefits many projects throughout Scotland. The Bank of Scotland's contribution to Scotland's history is profound, but the company's contribution to the Scotland of today runs deep and wide. If HBOS is to be taken over by Lloyds TSB, we must&#8212;in addition to protecting jobs and sustaining HBOS as a key part of the Scottish economy&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"11096\"/> ensure that the communities across Scotland that benefit from such initiatives continue to do so.</p><p>Clearly, the issue of protecting jobs in HBOS and Lloyds TSB is paramount&#8212;not only in today's debate but in the coming weeks as the situation develops. Obviously, the threat lies at the retail, back office, and corporate elements of the combined operation, so we must ensure that jobs there are protected as best we can. Customers must be protected too: we must ensure that access to banking services is not threatened but enhanced, and that customers do not suffer from a lack of competition in the retail banking sector.</p><p>The interests of customers and staff are connected. Many Scottish businesses, large and small&#8212;the First Minister has referred to some of them in recent days&#8212;use HBOS corporate banking services. I was pleased to hear Susan Rice, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB Scotland, make the point that those customers will still be there&#8212;indeed, they are a big part of the asset that Lloyds TSB seeks&#8212;and so the jobs will still be needed. Susan Rice is also a symbol of another source of hope: Lloyds TSB does not just have Scottish roots, it also has a strong Scottish presence, powerful Scottish brands and a Scottish board.</p><p>However, it would be naive to imagine that, in such a takeover, there will not be a search for synergies and perceived duplication, which will lead to job losses. In the past, Lloyds TSB as a business has offshored jobs in order to cut costs. Unlike HBOS, it does not have an agreement with trade unions on there being no compulsory redundancies. However, Lloyds TSB has made positive statements in the announcement of the deal, with a focus on retaining jobs in Scotland, a headquarters on the Mound, and continued printing of Scottish banknotes.</p><p>In my meeting yesterday morning with Archie Kane&#8212;who is the Lloyds TSB Group executive director of insurance and investments, and chief executive of Scottish Widows&#8212;I was encouraged by our positive discussions. However, we need positive statements to be turned into guarantees as details of the deal are worked out. A myriad of professional services support the bank, and they are also at risk in the merger. Again, the stakes are high.</p><p>However, underpinning all that are the facts that the sector has done well in Scotland for good reason, and that we continue to offer the same attractive opportunities, highly skilled workforce, good connections to further and higher education, good transport links and excellent quality of life. The message that Scotland is open for business and is a good place to do business has to go out loud and clear.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035851", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that the Parliamentary Bureau agreed to amend our business to schedule this important debate on a topic that is of concern to people throughout Scotland, from savers to home owners to bank staff.

That would be very serious, especially for the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p><p>In sending out the message that Scotland is open for business, and in arguing for jobs, I am happy to stand alongside the First Minister. However, when it comes to his analysis of how we got to this point, he really is on his own&#8212;in fact, he is out on a limb. Last week, he argued that HBOS's position was due solely to the short selling by \"spivs and speculators\". He resiles from that position now and talks only of naked short selling. However, that was not his position last week. He was wrong.</p><p>I agreed with the First Minister last week that regulation of short selling should be considered. Within hours the Financial Services Authority had, as he has pointed out, suspended the practice in financial institutions. However, I also said that there were clearly problems with HBOS's business model, its exposure to the mortgage market and its reliance on the wholesale money markets. I also said that the global liquidity crisis was a major factor in its weakness. HBOS is a global player in global markets&#8212;it has never been just a Scottish institution. Pre-union, 36 of its 172 founding shareholders were based in London. It was its exposure to wholesale money markets that left it vulnerable to the global liquidity crisis. With every day, and from every commentator, it has become clearer that although short selling might have exacerbated the position, there was a problem with the fundamentals of the bank, for which those who run it must take responsibility.</p><p>Far from standing idly by and failing to give the institution the backing that it needed, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer moved decisively to remove competition barriers to the Lloyds TSB deal. The alternative last Wednesday might well have been a run on HBOS and the loss of the whole bank with all the jobs, all the savings and all the mortgages.</p><p>The First Minister says that he would have extended a &#163;100 billion credit line, which would have saved HBOS. Leaving aside the question of where he thinks he could have got those funds <place-holder colnum=\"11098\"/> from, he misses the point that a credit line was available to HBOS, but it did not access it.

All those measures were taken through the chamber by the building of consensus, and they were amended and improved throughout the process on a cross-party basis.</p><p>There are bills in the Government's programme that can be welcomed if they are approached in that way, such as the climate change bill, the marine bill and the flooding bill, which are not only welcome but overdue. The test will be whether the Government gets both the principles and the practice right, and whether they will be taken forward in partnership with the Parliament and the rest of the United Kingdom. Those legislative measures will have to be matched by decisions that complement them, including those in the budget. Particularly on the issue of flooding, the concerns of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee on funding for flood protection measures must be listened to.</p><p>There is a determination across the chamber to tackle tobacco and alcohol misuse, but on this side of the chamber we will not support some of the measures in the consultation paper on alcohol, particularly a higher age limit for sales in off-licences. We want stronger enforcement of the 18 age limit, with stronger sanctions against those who ignore the legislation.</p><p>One bill that the Government is of course obliged to introduce is the budget bill. If we want to know what the Government really thinks is important, that is where we must look. In the same way, if we want to know what the First Minister really thinks, we should look to what he says in his relaxed, off-guard moments, perhaps in a <place-holder colnum=\"10334\"/> comfortable summer interview. That would be when he told a magazine that Scotland did not mind Margaret Thatcher's economics, just her social policy. In the same piece he said that he did not like saying sorry. Well, like it or not, he should say sorry to Scotland for that crass comment.</p><p>The problem is that the SNP actually believes that it can separate economic policy from social policy. That is why last year's budget bill was prepared to ditch everything else&#8212;every promise, every investment and every protection for the vulnerable&#8212;in order to deliver two tax cuts.

In secondary schools, course choices have been narrowed and closed down rather than opened up. Probationary teachers now face the scrap heap. No sign can be seen of the &#163;34 million for families with disabled children. That money was campaigned and fought for by disability groups and won for the whole of the United Kingdom, but it has disappeared in Scotland. In Aberdeen, projects for the homeless have been closed down, as have services for the disabled. In Fife, the council leader is standing for Parliament on his proud record of raising home care charges from &#163;4 per week to &#163;11 per hour.</p><p>However, those who seek solace in the words of the song \"The First Cut is the Deepest\" are in for a rude awakening, because the worst is yet to come. One cannot have Margaret Thatcher's economics without her social consequences. If the budget bill again attempts to do that, the price will be paid by the elderly, the disabled and schoolchildren in every part of Scotland.</p><p>Instead, this year's budget bill should begin to reinvest in Scotland's future. Skills and education <place-holder colnum=\"10335\"/> are the bridge between prosperity and social justice. Increased opportunity and access are the keys to unlock the economic success of the country and to provide for the economic wellbeing of Scotland's families. In the face of global economic turbulence, the programme for government needed to demonstrate urgent measures to invest more in Scotland's skills set. In the past year, apprenticeship programmes have been cut back; they need to be expanded and opened up, but there is no sign of that. The SNP knows that the Parliament believes that the Government's skills strategy is inadequate, as we have rejected it more than once. If the strategy was inadequate a year ago, how much more serious is that now in the light of changed economic circumstances?</p><p>To talk of the year of homecoming as a major boost for the tourism industry would make more sense if the Government had not just cancelled all adult modern apprenticeship programmes in the tourism industry. The sector has also been left floundering in a reorganisation of the enterprise network that is still generating more questions than answers.</p><p>If the lack of urgency on raising Scotland's skills levels is an omission in the programme and damaging to economic growth, the SNP's insistence on pressing forward with its discredited local tax proposals and its unworkable futures trust is a damaging inclusion. The Government's chief economic adviser recently identified low business confidence as the greatest threat to Scotland's economic growth. One might think, then, that the Government would think twice about its cuts-and-higher-income-tax bill&#8212;that is what it is&#8212;given that the tax has been identified as a threat to the Scottish economy by the Confederation of British Industry, Scottish Financial Enterprise, the Institute of Directors, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>The proposed tax has been described as \"unworkable\" by those who would administer it and \"unfair\" by the Scottish Trades Union Congress. The tax would bring students, student nurses and single pensioners who live on &#163;8,000 a year into its net, but it would let someone living on shares and investments in a mansion house escape scot free.</p><p>Such a tax would not only undermine the economy but decimate local services with a shortfall of at least &#163;800 million. Slashing services and trying to dress it up as a tax cut is another Tory trick that Scotland knows of old and will not forgive another time. Frankly, a tax that would undermine the economy and destroy local <place-holder colnum=\"10336\"/> services begins to look less like an act of Parliament and more like an act of sabotage. To boost business confidence, that discredited idea should be junked&#8212;and junked now.</p><p>The Government should have taken the further opportunity today to provide relief to the economy by dropping its unworkable and inexplicable Scottish futures trust. That is yet another flagship policy that is sinking under a tidal wave of criticism, with industry, local government and the trade union movement united in opposition to it. Although we heard warm words today about school building programmes, earlier this week John Stodter of the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland stated clearly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There's a lag in the time scale for more investment in school buildings ... waiting for the Scottish Government's decision on the Scottish Futures Trust.\"</p><p>The problem is that our children cannot wait for the school buildings that they need and the construction industry will not wait. The industry is already coming to the conclusion that Scotland is closed for business. If construction companies leave, they will leave lay-offs and redundancies behind them.</p><p>Even the First Minister's Council of Economic Advisers has told him to get a move on. That was just before it pointed out to him that the Government's energy strategy is wrong too, when it added its voice to the anxiety that has been expressed by the business community, the trade unions and the entire scientific and engineering community, which are worried about the security of future electricity supply. The Government is succeeding in uniting Scotland in complete opposition to its flagship policies.</p><p>Just in case higher taxation, a hiatus in infrastructure development and an insecure energy future were not enough to undermine business confidence and the prospects for jobs and prosperity, the SNP has its very own sword of Damocles hanging over Scotland's future&#8212;a referendum on independence two years down the line.</p><p>One place where I spent the summer where there is a palpable air of optimism is Rosyth dockyard, where investment has already started in dock 1 in preparation for the carrier contract. The new contract will raise employment at the dockyard, which was facing closure, back up to the highest levels that it enjoyed when it had thousands of skilled jobs and apprentices were taken on in their hundreds. All that work and all that optimism are a direct result of Scotland's place in the United Kingdom. Every one of those jobs would be placed in jeopardy by the uncertainty of the constant desire for separation.<place-holder colnum=\"10337\"/></p><p>The SNP's programme for government is a programme for a Government determined to carry on regardless&#8212;regardless of the economic circumstances, regardless of the worries of the business community and regardless of the cost to the elderly, the disabled and our schoolchildren. The SNP is careless of Scotland's future. The First Minister has prayed Keynes in aid several times today, but Keynes said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"When the facts change, I change my mind\".</p><p>The SNP should face the facts now and, for the sake of Scotland's future, change its mind on its discredited local income tax, its unworkable futures trust and its unwanted separatism.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. Their classes are not smaller but bigger, and many more pupils are in composite classes.

None of those is true today. The idea that we are somehow opposed to reducing the rates burden on small businesses is rubbish.</p><p>It is right and proper to assess the measures against the Government's wider programme. As David Whitton said, from the word go we have said that the scheme is a missed opportunity. The relief&#8212;or some of it at least&#8212;could have been used to incentivise desirable outcomes.</p><p>The Government is keen on outcomes&#8212;it tells us that it will be measured not by inputs but by outcomes; outcomes, not inputs, are what matter. However, today's motion asks us to celebrate an input. Of course, such an input has many potentially virtuous outcomes, which members such as Roseanna Cunningham have described. As several members have mentioned, the FSB briefing states that businesses report that they have used this year's SBB to make larger one-off investments, for example in double glazing, refurbishment, waste disposal and so on. All of those are good outcomes, and I do not doubt that other examples could be found of businesses investing in staff training, upgrading their information technology or other equipment or even feeling secure enough to recruit an extra member of staff. Our point is simply that such a scheme could have aimed to provide particular benefit to those businesses that wish to make investments in people, in innovation or in energy efficiency. Those are desirable outcomes for a variety of reasons: not only are they good for the individual business, but they are good for our communities and wider society&#8212;and they could have been incentivised or rewarded.</p><p>I have some sympathy with the desire to avoid bureaucracy, which was given as one argument against the use of such targeting, but the small <place-holder colnum=\"9557\"/> business bonus scheme is already an application scheme. Given that some form filling is required in any case, incentivising or rewarding businesses as I suggest need not have led to a significant increase in bureaucracy and none of the knock-on local benefits on which many members elaborated&#8212;Roseanna Cunningham did so quite eloquently&#8212;would be lost. Improving energy efficiency or taking on new staff would still bring benefits to the local economy, because additional local work would be provided either directly or through the supply chain.</p><p>In today's debate, we have seen the Tories again tripping the light fantastic with the SNP in a faint reprise of their budget tango. The SNP motion coyly fails to mention the acceleration of the business rate relief scheme so that&#8212;oh, what a surprise&#8212;the Tories' self-congratulatory amendment can complete the picture, like matching his-and-hers towels. In fact, their actions this afternoon have had a little bit of the air of a couple reaffirming their vows. No doubt that gives the smug marrieds a warm fluffy feeling, but it leaves the rest of us somewhat underwhelmed and wondering why we have been dragged out again. At least the SNP has kept its word to the Tories on the small business bonus scheme; the same cannot be said of its promises on police numbers.</p><p>We very much support the second half of the Tory amendment, which calls on the Government to ensure that businesses are informed of the scheme's existence so that they receive the benefit to which they are entitled. Of course that is essential and important. The first part of the Tory amendment refers to the acceleration of the scheme's implementation. In one sense, that is fine, because there is no doubt that, at the time of the budget, the SNP was ready to break yet another manifesto promise by phasing in the increase in rates relief, contrary to what it had promised. However, in the context of a budget in which resources for housing, higher education and enterprise support were cut, in which local authorities were not provided with the resources necessary to avoid school cuts and in which growth in health service spending was set to lag behind that in the rest of the UK for the first time since devolution, we found it hard to see business rate relief as a top priority for any additional resources. We did not support that during the budget, nor will we support it today.</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, I repeat that we have not argued, either then or today, against the small business bonus scheme per se. All taxation decisions are decisions about balance and priorities. Even the Tories recognise that they faced a choice. Mr Johnstone owned up to the fact that other things could be done, but he was not at all clear on the point at which it would be better to <place-holder colnum=\"9558\"/> support other measures to help small businesses instead of business rates relief. He simply implied that other things could be done. For example, the Tories could support the town centre renewal fund, which was proposed in a similar form in their manifesto, or the use of the extra resources to abolish water rates for pensioners.</p><p>A number of members have spoken about the importance of our town centres and the help that the small business bonus scheme will provide to businesses there. There is no doubt that that is true&#8212;representing East Lothian, I know that as well as any other member. However, our town centres also need other kinds of help. I can think of town centres in my constituency that are blighted by empty and derelict properties that the owners have no interest in improving or maintaining. A town centre turnaround fund would allow local trusts to do something about that problem&#8212;to buy the properties, if necessary, to refurbish them and to turn them over to community use. Our town centre businesses need life in their high streets, to give them the footfall that they need. The lesson of the successful business improvement districts&#8212;Bathgate is an especially successful example&#8212;is that they are even willing to pay a little for that. Businesses recognise that public realm improvements are needed and sometimes do not mind paying for them, especially if they have a say in what those improvements are.</p><p>We see the Lib Dem amendment as eminently sensible, and I am glad that the SNP has indicated that it will accept it. The SNP is much more interested in outcomes than in inputs, so the amendment makes sense. The output that the small business bonus scheme is supposed to deliver is economic growth. It may help in that respect, but the evidence is questionable, to say the least. When advising the Finance Committee, Professor David Bell made it clear that it is not self-evident&#8212;as Mr Brownlee said&#8212;that cuts in small business rates will give us the economic growth that we seek. The trouble with the relationship between the small business bonus scheme and the Government's economic strategy is that the scheme seems to be the only club in the bag. Even when the First Minister spoke to businesses in corporate America, he gave the small business rate relief scheme as an example of why they should come to Scotland. I do not argue&#8212;nor does our amendment, as Alasdair Allan tried to claim&#8212;that small business rate relief cannot support economic growth, but rather that it cannot do so alone. More support for our economy is needed.</p><p>Our amendment does not oppose the business rate cuts but calls for a realistic, considered approach that places this economic measure in <place-holder colnum=\"9559\"/> the context of the wider economic picture.

That is why, in my constituency of East Lothian, six high schools were refurbished under public-private partnership but two brand-new primary schools were delivered through traditional finance. That is how a new or refurbished school was delivered every week between 2003 and 2007. The best deal was obtained, whether the investment came from public or private sources.</p><p>Mr Swinney's statement places him squarely in the same infrastructure procurement camp as all his predecessors, no matter how he tries to pretend otherwise. The Scottish futures trust's purpose is to allow him to pretend otherwise. The Scottish National Party told us that it would end PPP and that it would build schools and hospitals with public, not private, money. The SNP said that no one should make any profit from vital infrastructure for health and education services. Now, that means only no excessive profits and obtaining the best deal, wherever the investment comes from.</p><p>Mr Swinney tells us that the non-profit-distributing model is at the core of the Scottish futures trust, but that is simply a version of PPP, which Argyll and Bute Council used first to build schools and which was agreed to, facilitated and launched by Mr Peacock. Last week, the cabinet secretary told the Finance Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"NPD models are part of the family of public-private partnerships\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Finance Committee</em>, 27 May 2008; c 578.]</p><p>He tried to say that PPP is a generic term that covers PFI, which is bad, and NPD, which is good, but that is rubbish. The Bank of Scotland has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the projects, on which this assertion is based, are those ... amongst the first PFI projects ... when the market was embryonic ... The current PPP market is significantly different. It ... has attracted ... numerous bidders and investors who, in order to remain competitive in bidding projects, reduced their return target levels\".</p><p>PPP schemes were a vast improvement on PFI projects and NPD is a version of PPP that builds in the profit at the start. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>However, the NPD model might be an ugly duckling.

It is for them that the whole charade of the past year has taken place. It is for them that Mr Swinney is still ducking and diving, trying to pretend that the Scottish futures trust is what it was meant to be when the SNP promised it in 2006. At that time, the SNP leadership was in no doubt. Nicola Sturgeon told us that finance would be raised through bond issues, which would crowd out PPP. It took Mr Swinney the best part of seven months to turn that statement into a consultation document, which, when it appeared in December, was not widely welcomed, as he has sometimes claimed, but widely laughed out of court. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said that the model would not work; the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers said that local authorities could not afford it; the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said that it would cost more; Audit Scotland was worried that it broke accounting rules; and investors said that they were <place-holder colnum=\"9436\"/> baffled as to why anyone would invest in it.

The Liberal amendment is right to draw attention to the matter, because it is an iconic project. The First Minister knew that when he promised that it would be built using patriotic bonds. We know that it will not, but we do not know how it will be built. We suspect that Mr Swinney does not know either. I am old enough to remember the days when people crossed the Forth in a small car ferry. If Scotland must wait for the Government to sort out one or <place-holder colnum=\"9437\"/> other of the 14 possible ways in which it might finance the bridge, we could find ourselves taking to the Forth in boats again. Scotland's investment community will be looking to invest in small roll-on, roll-off ferries rather than the construction of a new bridge. After all, at least the ferries floated&#8212;the Scottish futures trust does not.

That might slightly overstate the case, but it has certainly been a debate with different views. We and the Tories agreed only once all afternoon, when Alex Johnstone agreed with Michael McMahon that the SNP's motion is unambitious. Perhaps that is why we have heard from SNP members a fair bit of repetition of the same dubious claims of progress.</p><p>I exclude two SNP members from that statement. Michael Matheson talked about the need for culture change to improve public services&#8212;for more openness, transparency and engagement, instead of public bodies thinking that they can do what they want and ignore the consequences. I agree with that important point. However, I also agree with Charlie Gordon that the Scottish Government has failed to show those qualities: not only has it reduced the budget detail that is available to the Parliament and refused requests for more information, it has&#8212;as Robert Brown said&#8212;taken many decisions first and consulted after. The latest example of that is the extension of the ScotRail franchise well before it had to be done, without any consultation such as that on the original letting of the franchise.</p><p>Mr Don talked about how to improve front-line services for their users. He mentioned the in control system. That is an important and powerful concept in care that&#8212;as he said&#8212;builds on direct payments, which are not available widely enough in any case. Such moves should be supported.</p><p>The rest of us probably spent too much time arguing about how many quangos there are or are not, so I will carry on with that. Many members talked about the SNP's pledge to cut the number of quangos by 40 per cent, on which the SNP has <place-holder colnum=\"8494\"/> claimed great progress, but not all of that progress bears examination. In several cases, the suspicion remains that two or more quangos have simply been merged and that they retain all their functions and costs. That might reduce quango names, but it hardly qualifies as streamlining. Derek Brownlee and other Tories have made that point eloquently in the past, but they did not get round to it today. I presume that that is because, once again, they held us to account and let the Government off the hook. Gavin Brown was in the final minute of summing up before he mentioned the SNP Government. The Tories really miss the point.</p><p>As several members have said, in the past year, the Government has by our last count established 39 all-new consultative committees, groups, councils and other bodies. Mr Crawford seems to believe that giving those organisations a different name means that they do not count, which is a pretty strange way to operate. That is not an example of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. It was claimed that reorganising the enterprise network cut 21 local enterprise companies, but they have been replaced by 48 new national, regional and sub-regional organisations. I acknowledge the help of Tavish Scott in calculating that; he has pointed that out several times. That arrangement is not as streamlined as it was presented to be. As Jeremy Purvis eloquently showed, the system in the Borders is not more effective either, and other, similar, examples exist.</p><p>No one could argue with the principle of the Government's seeking greater focus on the outcomes that it wishes to achieve, but we are entitled to consider the effectiveness of its progress, which is central to the premise. Only yesterday, Mr Mather said in the chamber that he was told&#8212;in Canada, I think&#8212;that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Cash may be king, but focus is queen.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 7 May 2008; c 8332.]</p><p>That is another inspiring slogan to go above the ministerial desk, but I fear that there is still no space on any ministerial desk for Truman's famous plaque that said, \"The buck stops here.\" More of that later.</p><p>The Government's key instrument of focus is the national performance framework, in which we find five strategic objectives, one purpose, seven purpose targets, 15 national outcomes, 45 national indicators and targets and 11 local government spending priorities. On top of that we are promised 32 single outcome agreements.</p><p>Tavish Scott is right: we have hankered after a sighting of a single outcome agreement for a long time. After all, we signed off &#163;11 billion on the promise of those agreements. I have before me <place-holder colnum=\"8495\"/> the City of Edinburgh Council's single outcome agreement, which runs to 62 pages. If every council is equally assiduous, we can expect about 2,000 pages of single outcome agreements. After the famine will come the feast; we can be pretty sure that this is not really streamlining.</p><p>The motion mentions not only focus but alignment. It is certainly the case that there is not much point in having outcomes to aim for if efforts are not aligned with them. The inescapable fact is that investment is a major element of those efforts. The Tory amendment tries to bodyswerve that, but although its words are innocuous Derek Brownlee rather gave the game away when he claimed that councils have been overfunded. The amendment may be innocuous but it hides a harsher analysis that we will not support.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council agrees with my point about investment: the common theme that runs through its single outcome agreement is the lack of finance available to achieve the outcomes.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13648967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Effective Public Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is traditional to say that the debate has been interesting.

John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group said of the budget:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is excellent news for Scotland's poorest children and children facing poverty across Britain.\"</p><p>However, a mistake was made in the abolition of the 10p tax band. The extra support in the budget leaves most of those who paid only or mostly the 10p rate better off. However, it is clear that the abolition would have a detrimental effect on those who are low paid but childless and on pensioners under 65 years. That is wrong, and it should not be allowed to happen&#8212;nor will it, because a commitment has been given to compensate those groups and to backdate that compensation to 1 April. Many Labour Party MPs voiced their concern and said that they would reflect it in how they voted. The United Kingdom Government listened and responded.</p><p>Mr Swinney is right&#8212;we should compare that with what happened with the Scottish budget. Concerns were expressed that budget decisions <place-holder colnum=\"8211\"/> would have a detrimental effect on some of the most vulnerable groups in society. Every day brings more evidence that those concerns were well-founded. Amendments were moved to stop pensioners paying water rates, to protect women suffering domestic abuse and to support families living with disability. Were those concerns heard? No. Were those concerns responded to? No. Did those concerns come from any of the Government's back benchers? No. SNP members turned up like the claque at the opera and applauded whatever was put in front of them. When the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth found additional resources, did the SNP back benchers argue that the money should be used to alleviate poverty or to benefit low-paid workers or hard-pressed pensioners? No. They demanded that it be handed out to small businesses as a quicker, bigger rate cut.</p><p>The 10p rate and the impact of its abolition have been exhaustively debated in Westminster. Here is what one MP said about it:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"No one is going to reinstate the 10p band at a cost of &#163;7 billion; we are looking for mitigating procedures\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report, House of Commons</em>, 28 April 2008; Vol 475, c 106.]</p><p>That is a fair point. It was made by Stewart Hosie of the SNP. So SNP London does not support the position in the motion. SNP MPs recognise the compensation that is on offer. The First Minister went all the way to London to vote for it, not a reinstatement of the 10p band.</p><p>On fuel poverty, too, the motion fails to recognise what has happened since the budget. On 9 April, the UK Government concluded an agreement with energy suppliers, in line with the budget announcement, to increase support through social assistance programmes by &#163;225 million over three years. On 23 April, the Government, the energy industry and the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets met and prepared further concrete proposals which will be announced when election purdah in England ends. Meanwhile, the fuel poverty forum in Scotland has not met for a year; the SNP housing consultation ignored fuel poverty altogether; the SNP oppose Sarah Boyack's energy efficiency bill; and fewer central heating systems were fitted last year than in any year since 2003, and the waiting time has doubled.

It is appropriate that we do so, as Scotland has a proud record in the fair trade movement and played a more important role in its origins than is often remembered.</p><p>My involvement with Fairtrade fortnight goes back to 1986, when I joined Oxfam as a campaigns organiser. As several members have said, at that time there was really only one product, which was campaign coffee. A few enthusiasts would buy a share in a container of <place-holder colnum=\"7121\"/> coffee from Tanzania or, latterly, Nicaragua&#8212;often in partnership with the Max Havelaar Foundation in Holland&#8212;and, incredibly, that coffee would be shipped to a flat in, if I remember correctly, Stockbridge in Edinburgh, where volunteers would pack it by hand before hawking it around any outlet that would take it.</p><p>Promoting fairly traded coffee was a centrepiece of Fairtrade fortnight at the time, and I spent many evenings persuading Oxfam campaign groups to ask their local supermarkets to stock it, even if it was only for that fortnight&#8212;breaking out into the main stream in such a way was our holy grail. That was a truly thankless task. I well remember the jubilation when our group in Alloa succeeded in talking the local Co-op into taking a small supply. It was trumpeted as a national success&#8212;so much so that, a year later, we sent them back to repeat it, only for them to be told not to worry because last year's coffee was still on the shelves.</p><p>To have got from that position to today, when Fairtrade sales have reached nearly half a billion pounds in the UK, and one in every four bananas sold in Britain is fairly traded, is astonishing. The key was to commercialise the quality and the presentation of Fairtrade products without compromising the ethical principles behind the idea. Edinburgh-based Equal Exchange was a leader in that field, and it still is.</p><p>Caf&#233;direct&#8212;the coffee that finally laid to rest the idea that drinking fairly traded coffee was only for those with a strong stomach&#8212;led its assault on the coffee trade from Edinburgh. I pay tribute to Lorna Young, Caf&#233;direct's first sales director&#8212;her life was cut tragically short in 1996, but her work lives on, and Caf&#233;direct is now the sixth-largest coffee brand of any type in the UK. The Fairtrade mark that she, Equal Exchange, Oxfam and Christian Aid helped to create now endorses more than 3,000 different products.</p><p>Aileen Campbell was right to say that Fairtrade still depends on volunteers and their commitment. In my constituency, I pay tribute to the work of the Fairtrade shop in Prestonpans. During Fairtrade fortnight, I went to a very well-attended screening of the documentary \"Black Gold\", about the global coffee trade, which was organised by Earth Matters, a local Fairtrade shop in North Berwick. As a result, a steering group is now working towards making North Berwick a Fairtrade town.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson was right to say that the most important thing in all of this is the benefit that Fairtrade brings to producers. In the case of Caf&#233;direct alone, that means that more than 1.5 million farmers and their families benefit from a fair price and from investment in their communities.</p><p>Fairtrade is of course the lever and the example that drives wider trade justice, but I celebrate the <place-holder colnum=\"7122\"/> fact that a handful of enthusiasts in a basement flat in Stockbridge can take on the market in the world's second most-traded commodity, and bend it to their will. That is the lesson and the promise of the fair trade movement: that there is no supply chain so long that it cannot be bridged; no cartel so closed that it cannot be broken; and no trade that cannot be made fairer by people of good will in the determined pursuit of justice.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fairtrade Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Patricia Ferguson for giving us this opportunity to mark Fairtrade fortnight with this debate.

Those amendments would also help pensioners with water bills, families caring for disabled children, the homeless and victims of domestic abuse.

All those amendments would have shifted resources to skills, training or education, to support for vulnerable groups or to the protection of funding for vital environmental measures on areas such as waste management and flooding. I do not understand the point about waste management and flooding: either local authorities have ring-fenced money that is allocated for those priorities or Mr Swinney cannot come to us and say that he is investing more or less in those priorities.

No doubt the idea of a dormant bank account is a novel one for most of us, expect perhaps the minister. Throughout my life, my bank accounts have tended to be not so much dormant as near death. However, it has been well known for many years that a great deal of money is lying unused and unclaimed in dormant bank or building society accounts.</p><p>The UK legislation to which the LCM relates is a welcome solution, as it will release those resources so that they can be used for the greater good. It is entirely appropriate that the resources released be distributed to the nations of the UK and that in Scotland the Scottish ministers and this Parliament decide on their distribution. After all, the resources must be used for social and environmental purposes, which are devolved responsibilities, so any other arrangement would have been perverse.</p><p>I note the assurances that the minister gave the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and which he repeated today, that the income from this source will be separate&#8212;or, dare I say it, ring fenced&#8212;in the Big Lottery Fund. I also note his assurances to the committee and the Parliament about addressing concerns that committee members expressed about the fund's application and decision-making process.</p><p>Our amendment seeks to acknowledge the requirement for consultation about the distribution of funds, but also the widespread view that particular consideration should be given to the <place-holder colnum=\"5391\"/> provision of youth services throughout Scotland. I doubt that there is a member present&#8212;whether they represent a constituency or a region&#8212;who cannot cite examples of the fact that youth-work facilities and services often struggle to compete with other causes for funds. Equally, every one of us can certainly describe the turning around of a young life or lives through patient care and selfless support and work, which is often done by volunteers and which usually reaches out beyond the formal structures of the education system.</p><p>Every young person who is supported thus to find their way in life becomes a driver of a better future for our country. That is important, because although the bill will create a revenue stream, it will begin with a windfall of the order of &#163;40 million or more. Rather than simply being spent, a windfall should always be invested in something that gives us a future return, and investing in our young people would do exactly that. That is why we believe that there should be a presumption in favour of using the funds in that way and why we have great sympathy with Mr Purvis's amendment and the amendment that was lodged but not moved last week.

That takes us to the heart of the debates that we have had in the chamber and in committees over recent weeks. We know what the express purpose of this budget is: we are told&#8212;the cabinet secretary repeated it today&#8212;that it is the single purpose of the Government to create a more successful country with opportunities for all Scotland to flourish through increasing sustainable growth. We accept that, we agree with it and we support it. In fact, the aim contains a fundamental truth to which we hold fast, which is that we cannot build prosperity&#8212;certainly not sustainable prosperity&#8212;without fairness and opportunity for all.</p><p>As we face the unprecedented challenges of climate change and globalisation, which we have seen in recent days, we ask ourselves where we will find the capacity to rise to those challenges and make Scotland's future better. The answer can only be by releasing, nurturing and investing in the potential of our people. That is the bridge between the need for economic growth and the desire for social justice.</p><p>Constant expansion of access to education, skills and training, and through that to work in enterprise of ever greater value, productivity and return; the promise of progress both individually and collectively for us all; a relentless refusal to accept the loss or leaving behind of any Scot through poverty, disability or disadvantage of any kind, because the diminution of the future for any one of us diminishes the future that we will all come to share: that principle should be at the heart of Scotland's budget, but it is not. We hear that it is&#8212;the cabinet secretary says so, but to will the end is not enough if the means do not follow.</p><p>The idea of investing in skills is in the budget document and in the Government's skills strategy, but the resource to back it up is not apparent in the budget. The enterprise lines in which funding <place-holder colnum=\"5301\"/> for skills is to be found are falling. I know that those lines contain other expenditure too, but at best that means that skills investment is static. Despite asking repeatedly, we have received no assurance, for example, that more apprenticeships will be created to match the expansion that is happening elsewhere in Britain.</p><p>The recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report that was debated in the chamber last week praises a great deal in our education system, but it also specifically suggests that vocational opportunities in schools should be widened. The cabinet secretary mentioned that today, but the budget targets not a single penny at that objective. It has been reduced to a single sentence in the local government concordat and is unsupported, so far, by local government sign-up or by any resource.</p><p>Meanwhile, the inadequacy of the allocation for higher education, especially in the year that is covered by the bill, has been well articulated and is now well known. The likely cost in loss of competitiveness in our universities is clear, and there will be no increase in places for Scottish school leavers in our universities.</p><p>We cannot look for comfort, either, in investment in infrastructure, which can also drive economic growth. We have already seen the Edinburgh airport rail link project go, and we hear that a Europe-compliant replacement for the air route development fund is apparently beyond the wit of the Government&#8212;although I note that the cabinet secretary declined to rule out absolutely a marketing-based alternative to the fund.</p><p>We might even have expected a Government that loves to brag of its vision and its aspiration to look for and find the resource to invest in an updated digital fibre-optic network. That would give us a competitive advantage for the future&#8212;the kind of competitive advantage that the cabinet secretary talked about today when he commented on the gross domestic product figures&#8212;as the previous Executive's investment in increasing broadband accessibility in Scotland to among the highest levels in Europe did.</p><p>The budget also falls short when it comes to social justice principles. We simply do not know the extent to which services for those whose potential will be lost without early intervention, extra respite, protection from violence or support through mental illness will be protected or improved. An assurance about that is promised to us when single outcome agreements with local authorities are agreed in April, but we are in January. Today, Parliament is being asked to agree to more than &#163;11 billion of expenditure without knowing what the Government will agree to deliver come April. That is not good financial accountability.<place-holder colnum=\"5302\"/></p><p>We have been accused of not trusting local government. That is not true&#8212;it is the Scottish Government that we do not trust, and we have plenty of reasons not to trust it. The local government settlement might well have been the best on offer, but it is not enough to cover inflation, to compensate for there being no rise in local taxation or, for example, to reduce class sizes in primaries 1, 2 and 3 by 2011, as was promised in this chamber by the First Minister.</p><p>Labour-led Glasgow City Council demonstrated this week that it can be trusted on services. It introduced dramatic plans to improve care of the elderly. It is also pioneering skills academies, which will provide the vocational opportunity that we want for school students throughout Scotland. In Scottish National Party and Liberal-led Edinburgh, home care services are being reduced. In SNP-led Fife, home care charges are rocketing and people are stranded in hospital. In Grampian, there is the warning that front-line police budgets may be required to plug a gap in the pensions fund. In SNP-led East Lothian, schools have to contemplate not just efficiency savings but cuts in teacher numbers.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396350", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We consider today the principles of the budget bill.

A small amount of money in the route development fund kick-started more than 40 air routes to Scotland and money could be spent on promoting further new flights in different ways to build up clientele in the early years. To build their confidence, our universities could today be guaranteed the first call on future end-year flexibility. Instead of heaping scorn on the worries of organisations that work directly in the most difficult circumstances with vulnerable and disadvantaged people, the Government could find a way to provide the assurances that they seek.</p><p>We have proposed all that and more. We have suggested where resources could be redirected, by trimming growth in budgets that were increasing and by redirecting lines that are always underspent.

First, we had the hysterical but synthetic outrage at the level of the settlement, which I have no doubt will be echoed today. All that sound and fury was intended to divert attention from the fact that Scotland obtained from the settlement what the Scottish National Party expected when it made its manifesto commitments. The settlement amounts to almost &#163;90 billion, which renders ridiculous any argument that when the SNP fails to deliver or welches on its promises, it is someone else's fault.</p><p>Then the budget document appeared, but what did not appear were most of the level 3 budget lines, all the grant-aided expenditure totals for major local government services, comprehensive capital expenditure figures and real-terms <place-holder colnum=\"4866\"/> spending trends at level 2. All that detail was introduced into budget information at committees' request after consideration of previous budgets. The previous Executive agreed to provide that information, which the Government has now removed without consultation. The Finance Committee wrote to ask the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth for that detail, as did the three main Opposition parties jointly, but the response was a list of 170 lines of budget information that had been rolled up&#8212;it has disappeared&#8212;and which could not be tracked or scrutinised. On top of that, 43 specific and previously ring-fenced funds have been dissolved into the single local government line.</p><p>I will return in a moment to the concordat with local government, but first I will get to the heart of the matter. Parliament is being asked to authorise through three budget lines &#163;11 billion of funding to local government to deliver uncosted service developments, without any direct link to outcomes. The same situation applies to the block allocation of &#163;8 billion to health boards. In total, that is &#163;19 billion in year 1 alone that the Government will ask Parliament to sign up to providing through what will be, in effect, a blank cheque.</p><p>The minority Government does not have a mandate to govern unsupported.

The Prince's Trust has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Potentially thousands of young people won't get the support they need and deserve.\"<place-holder colnum=\"4867\"/></p><p>Children 1<sup>st</sup> has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The current climate is unpredictable\".</p><p>The Scottish Association for Mental Health has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"funding we rely on ... may come under much more pressure\".</p><p>NCH Scotland has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We could ... have a postcode lottery\".</p><p>Shelter Scotland has referred to a significant threat to about &#163;600 million to &#163;700 million of what we usually call the housing budget, and Scottish Women's Aid has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This could mean a vast reduction in refuge and support services\".</p><p>The Government has heaped scorn on those fears and described them as \"negativity\", but they are not just our concerns&#8212;they are the concerns of the homeless, the mentally ill, the disabled and their carers, young people who are fighting addiction, and women who are fleeing domestic violence. If those people find it hard to share the mood of optimism that the Government loves to claim exists, that is because they have been let down by life, society and all of us too many times not to fear for the services that they need. If those people find it hard simply to accept the assurances that the money for all those services is available and that there will be no problem, perhaps that is because those assurances come from the same people who promised to provide 1,000 extra police, smaller class sizes and first-time buyer grants, and to pay off student loans.</p><p>Mr Swinney will surely say, as he always does, that I do not understand the new relationship that he has with local government. [<em>Interruption.</em>] I do not doubt that many SNP members&#8212;from sedentary positions or otherwise&#8212;are sharpening their Pat Watters quotations for the debate. However, they should remember that when it was put to the president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that Alex Salmond had promised to Parliament that there would be class sizes of 18 in primaries 1, 2 and 3 by 2011, Pat Watters said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"And which council is he a member of?\"</p><p>When COSLA's chief executive was asked about the concordat indicators, he said that COSLA had</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not signed up to them.\"</p><p>The Government cannot give the assurances that it has given.</p><p>I have heard John Swinney being compared to a bank manager. I think that it was meant kindly and was meant to suggest that he is dependable and can handle figures, but he asks us to see him as a bank manager&#8212;as someone who handles other people's money with little more than a word of <place-holder colnum=\"4868\"/> advice as to how they might spend it. A bit of a threat of bank-managerial sternness is also present. On ring fencing, the minister responsible for housing told <em>The Big Issue</em>:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If we find a local authority who decide to use the money for something else entirely, we can always re-introduce ring fencing.\"</p><p>That is called having your cake and eating it.</p><p>Such services matter so much because they tackle disadvantage and deprivation. Any budget should be measured by its contribution to social justice. I accept that removing ring fencing does not mean that services will certainly be lost, but it creates such fears, which the Government should not dismiss.</p><p>Other budget lines are also central to social justice and, as the smoke clears a little, we see that they are certain losers. On the day of the spending review announcement, every housing organisation protested that the housing budget would be cut in year 1 of the review period. They were told that they had to consider the whole three years and that the housing budget would really rise by 19 per cent. The budget allocates &#163;1.6 billion to housing over the spending review period, but the previous Executive spent &#163;1.5 billion on housing and regeneration over the previous spending review period. In real terms, that is a cut in the housing budget.</p><p>We now have detail of the fairer Scotland fund. It rolls up seven existing funds and it is budgeted at &#163;145 million for each of the next three years, but those seven funds already add up to &#163;145 million, so that is another real terms social justice cut.</p><p>If the budget fails the social justice test, surely it must invest in economic growth, given that the Government's all-embracing priority is sustainable economic growth. However, again the Government remains unconvincing.</p><p>On infrastructure, we have already lost the rail link to Edinburgh airport and we still await an announcement on the M74, although to be fair we are assured that the funding is in the budget. There is no funding allocated to upgrading Scotland's digital infrastructure and there is no replacement for the route development fund, which has supported more than 40 direct air routes from Scotland.</p><p>In recent weeks we have seen the cancellation, or at least the postponement, of the new route between Aberdeen and Houston and the cancellation of the Inverness to Heathrow link. Those are straws in the wind, but they are not encouraging.</p><p>It is when it comes to investing in its people that the Government's budget fails most. We have very good participation rates in higher education, but <place-holder colnum=\"4869\"/> they are still lower than in many of the countries with which we will have to compete in the potentially difficult economic times ahead. Our universities are now telling us that they will, as a result of the budget, have to cap participation rates. When it comes to vocational training in schools and modern apprenticeships, we have still to hear of a single guaranteed extra place, while in England the huge increase that was recommended by the Leitch report will be delivered 10 years early. We are in danger of being left behind.</p><p>The budget could be better&#8212;small changes could improve it markedly. We will continue to argue for and promote in the budget process funded amendments that would inject social justice into the budget, better secure Scotland's economic future, and which would invest in our young people and their skills and in those who undertake higher education.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Spending Review 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That Administration did not provide more detail, but the point is that, in previous consideration of the budget, it was agreed that more detail would be supplied in future years, for exactly the reason that has been given.

Perhaps it was to hide the spending cuts that are emerging even as we speak this afternoon: the 6 per cent cut in next year's budget for affordable housing&#8212;which has been slammed not by us but by housing organisations and is hardly the sign of a Government that is prioritising housing need&#8212;or the real-terms cut in culture spending from a Government that often talks about its commitment to Scottish culture.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391835", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Spending Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer. \"I thank the minister for his statement and for providing an advance copy of it.

It shapes the investment of almost &#163;90 billion over the next three years. We should dwell on that figure for a moment because, this afternoon, we have heard yet again the broken record of complaint that, somehow, nationalist ministers have been short changed, robbed and mugged in the comprehensive spending review. Let us look at the facts.</p><p>In March, the SNP said that it expected to get &#163;1.8 billion extra over the three years of the review period. Even by its own arithmetic, which I do not accept, the SNP received more than 99 per cent of that. On top of that, as Mr Swinney boasted today, it has access to &#163;900 million more in end-year flexibility funding. Therefore, the SNP has almost exactly what it expected it would have to spend.</p><p>In fact, a week before the settlement, the nationalist spin doctors fanned out to tell the media that Scotland would get only a 1 per cent real-terms increase. Even by the SNP's own dubious arithmetic, it got a 1.4 per cent increase, so it seems that in the end the SNP got more than it expected. Therefore, that single transferable excuse for every failing will not do. The Government got almost exactly the budget that it expected when it made its promises to the voters. A senator once said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A billion here, a billion there, and soon you're talking about real money.\"</p><p>Well, &#163;30 billion a year is real money and we have a real increase year on year, so those who voted for the SNP will believe that they have every right to expect it to deliver what it said it would.</p><p>The budget is one of broken promises. The week began with the tortuous confession from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice that the true number of new police officers was not 1,000 but 500. In fact, the budget will recruit fewer additional police officers than either of the previous two Administrations recruited. Then, more quietly, in the erudite columns of <em>The Times Educational Supplement</em>, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning admitted that the First Minister's promise to have class sizes of 18 in primaries 1, 2 and 3 by 2011 also meant something different. Today, we hear that the promise might be delivered some time, somewhere, but that was not the pledge that the First Minister gave in the Parliament&#8212;to paraphrase Gladstone, a promise delayed is a promise denied.<place-holder colnum=\"3353\"/></p><p>We hear, too, that the promise to Scotland's students to write off their loans has been ditched. We always knew that that promise could not be afforded and, I suspect, the SNP always knew that, too. This morning, we had the sight of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, hours before he stood up in the Parliament, going to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities as a supplicant, desperate for a signature on a deal and gambling everything on being able to come here today with a piece of paper&#8212;the Neville Chamberlain of Scottish politics&#8212;claiming a council tax freeze. However, as he admitted, he cannot claim that, because the 32 councils will make up their own minds.</p><p>The point is that Mr Swinney does not want councils simply to deliver his council tax freeze; he wants them to deliver all his other promises, too. He is trying to pass over to local authorities responsibility for the promises on class sizes, school buildings, free school meals, increased nursery provision, carers and respite care. The First Minister visited my constituency today to open a new primary school. He was welcome and he was right to come, because it is an excellent new school that was funded and built by a Labour council under a Labour-led Executive. The Government promised to match our school building and refurbishment programme brick for brick, but Mr Swinney cannot make that promise today. He has outsourced the promise to local authorities. Our programme was for 250 schools. Will he build 250 schools? He simply cannot say.</p><p>The Government should be clear: we will hold it accountable for its promises. It will not be able to hide behind local councils when promises are broken, any more than it will be allowed to hide behind the settlement. We will work hard to examine constructively how the budget can provide more skills opportunities for our young people as well as support for respite care and for renewing our town centres. We will work with others in the Parliament to examine constructively how we do that. However, we will hold the Government to account. We once called the SNP manifesto the longest betting slip in history. Those who placed their bet on the promises on police officers, class sizes, student grants or first-time buyer grants have today seen those promises fall at the first hurdle while others disappear into the mist or into the distance.

In the first days of this session of Parliament, much was made of the recognition that we are a Parliament of minorities. There was much rhetoric about recognising that no single party had a majority, and what that would mean for our deliberations. The First Minister was clear on that. On his first day in post, he made a solemn pledge:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"My pledge to the Parliament today is that any Scottish Government that is led by me will respect and include the Parliament in the governance of Scotland over the next four years. ... We will appeal for support across the chamber policy by policy.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2007-05-16.34.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 16 May 2007; c 36.]</citation></p><p>Later in May, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Good ideas&#8212;well researched and well argued&#8212;will be welcomed and considered.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 23 May 2007; c 58.]</p><p>Fair enough. As Mr Purvis and Mr Henry have pointed out, the Parliament then spent several weeks debating the Government's priorities. Ideas were suggested from all sides of the chamber&#8212;ideas on skills, justice, energy and the renewal of our towns. However, in those weeks, one idea grew on all sides of the chamber: the idea that it was all a charade and that the Government had not the slightest interest in being prepared to listen and learn. What the Government was interested in <place-holder colnum=\"3200\"/> was avoiding the chamber's scrutiny by any tactic to hand.</p><p>Even the present Government could not avoid forever facing real votes on real debates. It had, eventually, to produce a programme for government&#8212;a legislative programme&#8212;and submit it for the scrutiny of the chamber. It did that for the grand total of less than one and a half hours. Members will recall that, the following day, the Government found rather more time for a debate in which it congratulated itself on finding additional funding for the Crichton campus.</p><p>We all know the importance of the spending review that Mr Swinney will present next week. It will set the direction of health, education, housing and transport for the next three years. It will affect every aspect of public policy so much that, for the past six months, the nationalist Government has been unable to tell us anything of what it will do. On no fewer than 60 occasions in the chamber, ministers have refused to answer questions until the comprehensive spending review is announced&#8212;questions on care of the elderly, higher education funding, support for carers, mental health provision and student support. The list goes on and on.</p><p>There is a great deal to hear and a great deal to debate. Our premise is simple: a statement followed by technical questions and a short debate next Wednesday afternoon is not enough time for Parliament to scrutinise the budget properly. Of course, the Parliament's committees will scrutinise departmental budgets in great detail, as Christine Grahame eloquently described. We have no intention of compromising that process. Those who have argued against our motion today on the basis that it seeks to change committee procedures have missed the point entirely. It does not do that.</p><p>The point is that the SNP is seeking to bring us a budget that is greater than the sum of its parts. To prevent that, the budget process normally features a stage 1 debate on strategic spending priorities. We want to scrutinise Mr Swinney's budget line by line, but we also want to see a budget that, as a whole, drives economic growth, builds social justice and addresses the challenge of climate change. Those are big, strategic challenges that must be met by the shape and thrust of the budget in its entirety. It is good sense and good democratic practice that the Government's budget be judged as a whole against those yardsticks by the entire Parliament.

Instead, the 100 days document says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will first freeze the council tax\".</p><p>There are no ifs, buts or maybes in that statement. By June, however, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth was saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am not making the decision. I am encouraging local authorities to move to a council tax freeze.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 27 June 2007; c 40.]</p><p>That is a broken promise because it could not have been a real promise in the first place; after all, the Government does not have the power to freeze council tax. Did it not know that when it made its promise? Did that lack of powers over local government just creep up and surprise it, or did it make the promise in the sure and certain knowledge that it would be broken?</p><p>There are also promises that must have seemed like good ideas in an election campaign but which, from the perspective of Government, are revealed as simply daft. Help for first-time house buyers is a good idea, but what they need is more houses at more affordable prices. A universal &#163;2,000 grant will not provide one single extra house&#8212;and, better still, its principal effect will be to increase house prices by &#163;2,000. That promise is being broken because even this Government realises <place-holder colnum=\"2403\"/> that it was an election bribe that was too cynical and counterproductive to implement. It should simply own up and get on with finding ways of addressing housing issues.</p><p>The list of broken promises goes on and on: smaller class sizes; the paying off of student loans, as pointed out in the Liberal Democrat amendment, which we are happy to accept; a criminal justice bill; a drugs commission; and the pledge to cut red tape for business, as addressed in the Tory amendment, which I am happy to commend to the chamber.</p><p>However, let us not get bogged down in lists. Instead, we should consider the Government's strategic objectives, such as the greener Scotland objective. There is no bigger issue than climate change and no more urgent matter than cutting carbon emissions. The SNP agrees; its 100 days document says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We all have a part to play in meeting the challenge of global warming\".</p><p>What part has this Government played? Even in these early days, decisions have already been taken. First, it wants to abolish tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges. However, it must also explain how it intends to avoid the 15 per cent increase in traffic volume and the release of 9,000 extra tonnes of carbon each year that such a move will cause.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broken Promises"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The SNP's biggest promises have been on council tax.

That is not an achievement to be proud of.</p><p>The Government is demonstrably not doing what it said it would do and yet there has been a whirlwind of activity&#8212;we know that, because the SNP has told us so. That is a good metaphor, because a whirlwind forms when storms start to spin, and spin is what we have had. We have a new name and new headed notepaper for the Government. It abolished availability status codes in the health service, but they were abolished again by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in May and then abolished yet again a couple of weeks ago. We had a green energy day when renewables generating capacity surpassed nuclear generating capacity, except that it did not, because one is available almost all the time and the other is always intermittent. We have had a skills strategy that did not promise a single extra apprenticeship, college place or vocational course in schools.</p><p>A whirlwind dissipates when it hits something real and solid. The SNP whirlwind is hitting up against the realities of government and, sure enough, it is dissipating. The excuses come out as to why the SNP cannot do what it said it would do, but it is doing exactly what we said it would do. We said that the Government would pick fights with <place-holder colnum=\"2405\"/> the United Kingdom Government at every opportunity, and it has done so. We said that it would blame the UK Government for all its failures to deliver, and it does.</p><p>I repeat that, if one is going to make an excuse, it might as well be a big one. The big excuse is the comprehensive spending review. Time after time in the Parliament, we have sought assurances from ministers that services that are vital to the communities that we serve will be protected. Time after time, ministers tell us that they do not know because they are waiting for the results of the CSR. However, the envelope of the spending review has been known since the most recent budget. Are ministers seriously telling us that they have made no working estimate of how much they might have to spend? Either they have made an estimate and they are dissembling, or they have not and they are simply incompetent.</p><p>However, the ministers know enough about the CSR to start briefing the press that the settlement will be inadequate, unfair and unequal. That is simply preparation for the biggest and lamest excuse of all. The Government harvested votes using promises that it could never afford, that it never had the power to deliver and, worst of all, that it had no intention of seeing through in government. Rather than take responsibility for that, it now seeks to dish out the blame. The truth is that the Government has twice as much to spend on Scotland as the first Scottish Executive had in 1999&#8212;it will have more than &#163;30 billion to govern Scotland. However, this very week, thousands of Edinburgh school students are told that there is no money to provide them with the decent school buildings that they need, want and deserve&#8212;in 2007, in our capital city, there is no money for that out of &#163;30 billion. Broken promises and lame excuses: let us have a national conversation about that.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament regrets the SNP Government's failure to implement a range of policies that the SNP pledged to take forward in its election manifesto and its document, <em>It's time to look forward</em>, including reneging on the promise to set out plans to employ 1,000 additional police officers, backtracking on a council tax freeze, failing to implement smaller class sizes in every primary school and not delivering on plans to give &#163;2,000 to first-time house buyers; recognises that the SNP Government is already letting down communities and hardworking families across Scotland, and calls on Scottish ministers to make a statement to the Parliament explaining why they have failed to implement these policy pledges.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broken Promises"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept perfectly that this Government is following the example of our Government in Westminster.

I admit that the motion that it has brought to the chamber today fulfils a manifesto promise, albeit an entirely wrong-headed one. It is important to point that out: members should be clear about the promise that the Scottish National Party made. It promised to cancel EARL come what may&#8212;not if it was over budget or behind schedule; not if it had management problems; and not if there was a delay in procurement. The project was to be cancelled, full stop.</p><p>For some reason, ministers felt compelled to dress up that political decision. First, they claimed that costs were out of control. When they were asked to produce the evidence, they could not. They then asked the Auditor General to construct the evidence, but he did not. They then claimed that the project was irretrievably broken, but it was not. Today, they said that they have found a better alternative, but they have not. They then presented other&#8212;extremely welcome&#8212;improvements to rail lines in central Scotland, as if the funding for those projects depended on EARL's cancellation, but it does not. We would have done those things, as well as deliver EARL.</p><p>The SNP wants to cancel EARL, but not for any of those reasons; it planned to sacrifice the project to release moneys to fund other promises that it has made. Back in March, during the passage of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill in the previous session of the Parliament, Fergus Ewing gave the game away by saying</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the money can be better spent on other projects.\" &#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2007-03-14.33136.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 14 March 2007; c 33136.]</citation></p><p>He made clear that he meant projects in his constituency, as did Rob Gibson&#8212;in a piece in his local paper of 28 June this year&#8212;and Brian Adam, in a members' business debate only last night on the Aberdeen western peripheral route. That is <place-holder colnum=\"2262\"/> why ministers have been ducking and diving, seeking ways to defy the will of the Parliament.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth said in the previous debate on the subject that he would abide by the will of the Parliament, only to walk straight into a press briefing in which he conceded the case for Edinburgh trams, but averred that EARL had \"had it\".</p><p>Even this week, the cabinet secretary and his ministerial colleagues attempted to avoid the full scrutiny of the debate that they had promised&#8212;they hoped to get by with a statement alone. Let us be clear: on 27 June, the Parliament instructed ministers to continue to progress the EARL project by resolving the governance issues that the Auditor General had identified. Instead of that, the cabinet secretary and his ministerial colleagues stopped work there and then on EARL. Today, they have returned to the chamber with a poorer alternative and, in so doing, they have defied and failed the Parliament, failed Scotland and failed our capital city.</p><p>For the Tories, Mr McLetchie described the SNP position on EARL as \"depressing negativity\". He went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the SNP policy on the rail link and trams is hostile to the interests of our capital city and its role as a driver of the Scottish economy. The SNP is an anti-Edinburgh party, and its transport policy speaks volumes about its parochialism and provincialism.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2007-03-14.33141.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 14 March 2007; c33141.]</citation></p><p>That is still true today, and I am sorry if the Tories have now U-turned into the SNP's siding of negativity, parochialism and provincialism.</p><p>The project that our amendment supports would provide the best cost benefit ratio of any of the planned rail projects in Scotland&#8212;2.16:1 over 60 years&#8212;and almost &#163;1 billion of benefit in the first 30 years. It would remove 1.7 million car journeys from our roads and connect 62 stations&#8212;serving 64 per cent of Scotland's population&#8212;directly to Edinburgh's airport, without a need to change. We accept that the scheme that the Government proposes is better than having no surface link at all and even that it will provide wider connectivity than a simple spur solution would. However, where are the full costings and the Scottish transport appraisal guidance appraisals? What is the cost benefit ratio? How many car journeys will the proposal save? Does the Government know? No. Does it care? No.</p><p>In the minister's peroration about getting out of cars, he forgot to mention that, as Iain Smith rightly said, public transport works when it goes where people want to get to. The Government promises an airport station that is not at the airport and which will not get airport passengers out of <place-holder colnum=\"2263\"/> their cars. We are promised a journey time from Edinburgh to Glasgow of 35 minutes, which is good and welcome, but it will take almost as long as that to get to Edinburgh's own airport from the city centre. The proposal is simply second best and second rate.</p><p>The SNP Government is fond of symbols. It has negotiated flag-flying protocols, changed its headed notepaper and got new ministerial business cards. The decision on EARL is a symbol of how serious the Government is about investing in the infrastructure and convenient international connections that a modern economy needs. EARL would be the kind of fast, simple and direct connection that international travellers expect and are used to elsewhere. What message will we send them if we cannot provide that? What message will we send the business community and the construction and engineering sector? The message will be that flagship projects such as EARL will be agreed, designed, legislated for, budgeted for and then cancelled on a political whim to pay for pork-barrel projects elsewhere.</p><p>I have heard EARL described as a Rolls-Royce solution&#8212;it is, and why not? The SNP ordered a luxury Lexus limo for its First Minister, so why is it delivering a Reliant Robin rail link for the rest of Scotland? The Government might win the vote on the motion tonight, but if it does it will lose any credibility that it is big enough to take on the sort of projects that Scotland needs in order to compete in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and it will lose any right that it might ever have had to claim to have vision and ambition for Scotland.

It says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland is the only nation or region of the United Kingdom where the percentage of people with a Higher Education qualification outnumbers the percentage with a basic school leaving qualification.</p><p class=\"indent\">Scotland's skills profile has also been improving faster than that of the rest of the UK\".</p><p>That is not a bad place for us to be in. However, we know that with, for example, China and India producing 4 million graduates every year, it is not a place in which we can stay unless we constantly and urgently raise our game on skills.</p><p>We know that in 2020 three quarters of the workforce will be made up of people who have already completed their education and entered the workforce, which means that in-work training is crucial. Therefore, I am pleased that the document commits ministers to supporting the successful Scottish union learning fund and uses the excellent example of the agreement between the Amicus section of Unite and Rolls-Royce to illustrate it.</p><p>The document is also correct to say that we have to ensure that our skills profile matches the needs of the labour market. That is a key task of the sector skills councils. The strategy's commitment to that approach and its endorsement of the UK commission for employment and skills is another welcome aspect of the document.</p><p>However, if the Government believes that workforce development is central to economic success, that the skills profile must meet the needs of the economy, that we must improve the utilisation of skills in the workplace and that we must stimulate and increase demand for skills from employers, why has it shifted ministerial responsibility for skills away from responsibility for enterprise and economic growth?<place-holder colnum=\"1592\"/></p><p>I know that ministers will say that they approach government in a cross-cutting way and that economic growth is central to all ministers' objectives. However, I hardly believe that when the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism meets the enterprise sector or the energy sector&#8212;and I think that the voluntary sector is next in line to have its concerns and views mind-mapped before its eyes&#8212;skills do not come up. The question is whether the minister with responsibility for skills is at those meetings when that happens.</p><p>When the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning discusses with the further education and higher education sectors their central contribution to raising the level of skills and qualifications&#8212;to say nothing of their role in driving innovation and its commercialisation&#8212;is the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism in the room?</p><p>The importance of that is shown in \"Skills for Scotland\", which quotes Les Carey of the Rolls-Royce factory at Inchinnan, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"our competitors use similar machine tools and methods of manufacture ... our differentiator in the market place is our employees.\"</p><p>When she was the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina said something similar:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Keep your tax incentives and highway interchanges, we will go where the highly skilled people are.\"</p><p>If we are to be sure that Scotland remains where the highly skilled people are, we need to step up a gear now.</p><p>The disappointment with the strategy is not in what it contains, with which fault largely cannot be found, but in what it does not contain. The strategy's top line on its launch was a merger of two public bodies, but the merger is a poor fit and is opposed by those who deliver the service.</p><p>Ten years ago, apprenticeships had all but disappeared from Scotland&#8212;there were about 2,000&#8212;but now there are 35,000. However, we need more and we need them now. In my constituency of East Lothian, when the council advertises for an apprentice, it receives 300 applications. That means that for 299 people who are ready and willing to take up an apprenticeship, the opportunity is still not available.</p><p>We need more modern apprenticeships. The strategy document says that what matters is the quality and not the volume of apprenticeships. I disagree. What matters is the quality and the volume of apprenticeships. Of course they should be of the highest quality, but Labour was committed to establishing 50,000 apprenticeships in Scotland. How many will the Government deliver?<place-holder colnum=\"1593\"/></p><p>If we are to be sure that Scotland remains where the highly skilled people are, we cannot afford to waste the potential of a single young person. In 2007, no person between 16 and 18 years old should be left to drift on benefit. Every 16 to 18-year-old should have the chance of a job, proper training, a quality volunteering experience, a college or university place or a meaningful fifth and sixth year at school.

Suffice it to say that in East Lothian there is no support for Forth Ports' proposal. It is opposed by all political parties in East Lothian.

We know that the measure will not give ministers absolute power to agree to or to reject proposals such as this on the basis of public opposition or the threat to tourism, for example; it allows solely for the exercise of devolved powers, within the framework of the habitats directive. It is a partial measure, but we agree with the minister that it is what is possible under the Scotland Act 1998 and that it will be a great improvement on the perverse legal position that currently prevails, which leaves Forth Ports as both regulator and beneficiary. Roseanna Cunningham was right to point out just how perverse the position is. Of course, this perverse position was created by a previous Tory Government.

In the <place-holder colnum=\"1113\"/> previous session of Parliament, he successfully argued for the inclusion in the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill of sustainability and fair trading as two of the criteria that local authorities should consider when procuring food or catering services. In that debate, John rightly highlighted the success of East Ayrshire Council and North Lanarkshire Council in sourcing food locally when possible. As Christine Grahame said, procurement is the key.</p><p>The benefits of local food are increasingly apparent: many members have already spoken of them. Local food is certainly good for the economy. In advance of the debate, I visited the excellent East Lothian food and drink website that East Lothian Council set up and which I recommend. In its directory, I found no fewer than 53 food and drink producers and specialist retailers in my constituency alone. Some of the firms are small, but they sustain employment and contribute significantly to the wealth of the county.</p><p>Local food is also good for the environment, reduces congestion on our roads and improves road safety. However, the Royal Highland show clearly does not do that, given Mr McArthur's experience earlier today. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimated in 2002 that food miles result in over 17,000 injuries and 290 deaths from road accidents. That is as compelling a case as any for reducing the distance between where food is produced and where it is subsequently consumed.</p><p>The roots and fruits healthy eating project in East Lothian is funded primarily by East Lothian Council and NHS Lothian. The scheme delivers low-cost fresh fruit and vegetables to hundreds of customers across 19 towns and villages in East Lothian, encourages healthier eating and provides access to good-quality fruit and vegetables&#8212;locally produced, where possible&#8212;to local communities at affordable prices. The scheme works with schools to increase awareness of how our food is produced, particularly through working in the scheme's own vegetable garden. I was pleased to attend the scheme's 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary event recently. Similar schemes are proving to be successful around Scotland.</p><p>Like other members, I welcome the NFU Scotland campaign&#8212;what's on your plate?&#8212;which is aimed at encouraging consumers to buy Scottish produce. I was pleased to pledge my support to the campaign earlier in the week. Furthermore, the launch this month of Scotland Food and Drink is a positive development, bringing together food industry interests from trade bodies and companies to secure a stronger and more profitable food industry in the years ahead.</p><p>I cannot claim the level of engagement with farmers markets that John Scott can claim through <place-holder colnum=\"1114\"/> his involvement in the farmers market movement, but I am a regular customer at the Haddington farmers market. It is an excellent event and its strength is that almost all the food on sale is local, being from either East Lothian or Berwickshire, including the legendary ostrich burgers, which come from just up the road from Haddington. I welcome the support that is given to the farmers market sector by bodies such as SAOS. Will the minister say in his summing-up speech what support the Executive might plan to give the sector to sustain and grow farmers markets in Scotland?</p><p>I am glad to have had the opportunity to take part in the debate. I hope that the minister will consider seriously a framework that favours a more local and sustainable trade in food and which moves that agenda forward as fast as possible, for which, as Mr Scott said, there is a great appetite.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385974", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Food"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Mr Hume on securing a debate on an important issue.

It is clear that those who work in the North Sea oil and gas industry move seamlessly between that city and Aberdeen. The two cities are twinned, but their relationship is rather more real and profound, even workaday, than most twinning relationships that I have come across. In fact, I am tempted to say that if people moved as readily between Edinburgh and Glasgow, whether for the day or for periods of their careers, as they do between Aberdeen and Stavanger, it would be a good thing for Scotland.</p><p>That relationship is aided considerably by a relatively new direct air route from Aberdeen to Stavanger. It is one of more than 30 facilitated by the route development fund, which, if I can be forgiven a moment of self-congratulation, I recall launching as Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning back in 2002 to 2003.</p><p>The relationship is also helped by excellent existing co-operation between the Norwegian and United Kingdom Governments, which was most recently codified in the 2005 framework agreement. The agreement covers transboundary oil and gas projects and cross-boundary developments, many of which previously needed a new treaty each time a project was proposed. The co-operation also led to the groundbreaking agreement on the supply of wet gas to Britain from Norway, specifically benefiting Mossmorran and St Fergus. The agreement's added value to us was certainly recognised in Norway, where it provoked some controversy at the time.</p><p>The agreement was groundbreaking in another way. Looking back at the press coverage at the time, I see that the MP for Banff and Buchan, whose constituency covers St Fergus, put out a press release praising both former Labour minister <place-holder colnum=\"859\"/> Brian Wilson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. That certainly is an unusual occurrence.</p><p>The constant contact and collaboration between energy companies based in both countries is a great driver of innovation, and Mr Gibson is right to single out the Scottish Power-Hammerfest project to harness tidal resources. He was right, too, that it is another testament to the test and development facility at EMEC, where the kit will be developed and improved to the 1MW level.</p><p>In passing, I noticed Mr Gibson's reference to a renewable obligation weighted towards marine, which I support. I am not sure whether the minister was quite as clear on that in his recent statements, but perhaps he will say something about it tonight.</p><p>We should not forget opportunities for reducing carbon emissions from more conventional energy sources, and I commend to the minister current discussions between the UK and Norwegian Governments on infrastructure and regulation for capturing and storing carbon under the North Sea.</p><p>The proposal for a North Sea supergrid is interesting, and I hope that the minister will provide more detail of Scottish National Party thinking on it. I understand that the First Minister had already had discussions with Norwegian ministers about it prior to the election.</p><p>From this side of the chamber, we hope for a fair wind and favourable tide for greater co-operation with Norway, with the gentle caveat that we should not parallel Norway-UK collaboration but build on it for added value, which, like Mr Gibson, I believe that we can bring to the relationship.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish-Norwegian Commercial Co-operation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mr Gibson on securing the debate.

In every part of the world, developing economies are revealing themselves as opportunity markets for our goods and services, not simply threats to our economic future. We cannot do it by competing on low wages, nor should we even consider doing so. We certainly cannot do it with fiscal fairy dust.

However, although rate reduction was presented as a panacea for town centres on several occasions in <place-holder colnum=\"239\"/> the debate, we believe that additional resources are required to take action in our town centres.</p><p>We think&#8212;and here I disagree with Gavin Brown&#8212;that it is a missed opportunity not to use business rate relief to create virtuous cycles by incentivising research and development, increasing training and raising energy efficiency. That would provide a link with the Government's stated objectives on wealth creation, fairness and energy use. It would be a tax cut with several purposes.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to all those members who made maiden speeches today.

Although it trumpets the reduction in tax on business, it plans to raise taxation on the income that is earned by those who work in those businesses and who make them succeed. We know that the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism believes that that is \"naive\"; to us, it seems simply perverse.</p><p>A number of members pointed out that the link between today's two topics of wealth and fairness is jobs&#8212;higher-quality, higher-skill and higher-return jobs. Education and skills are the engines of Scotland's economic growth. Building the capacity of our people and harnessing their endeavour will secure our future. That approach is demonstrably correct and it is working. Scotland is already the highest-skilled part of the UK. In 1997, 23 per cent of the workforce was educated to degree level; now the figure is 31 per cent. Ten years ago, 69 per cent of the workforce qualified to level 2; now the figure is 77 per cent. In 1997, there were a couple of thousand apprenticeships in Scotland; now there are 34,000.</p><p>People's skills have been harnessed. There are 250,000 more Scots in work now than there were 10 years ago, with many more graduates staying in Scotland and working and creating wealth here. After generations of decline, Scotland's population is growing again. We have seen the results of that. Output from the financial services sector is up by 90 per cent and income from tourism, which did not really get a mention in the debate, has risen by 20 per cent in five years following a period of stagnation. Life sciences now contribute &#163;1 billion to our economy. There has been a 12 per cent increase in the number of innovation-active Scottish companies.<place-holder colnum=\"240\"/></p><p>None of that happened by accident. It happened through investment in skills, education, innovation and initiatives such as the fresh talent initiative and the new deal, which have unleashed the talent and imagination of our people. Like Jeremy Purvis, I trust and hope that the fact that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is closing the debate means that the Government agrees with that. I hope that she will present to us the Government's proposals for developing the area of skills. It is an area that needs constant attention and where we need constantly to raise our game. We cannot pause now while we strategise or wait to appoint advisers.</p><p>If we were on the Government benches, we would be debating concrete proposals today to build Scotland's skills base, to increase opportunity and to get more Scots into work. Subject debates such as this one are okay, but it is a full employment agency that would drive economic growth, given the political will to make that aspiration a reality. That would mean 15,000 more apprenticeships, or skills academies in every part of Scotland. That could widen opportunities, particularly for those who do not have them now, and it could raise&#8212;in quality and esteem&#8212;the skills that both small and large Scottish businesses need now. Even Liz Smith agreed with that in some way.</p><p>We ask ministers to give us a vote on those commitments, and we will support them. We can win that vote, and we can get behind the potential of our people. We can let Scotland's people make Scotland wealthier and fairer. It's time&#8212;decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Our commitment to an extension of the existing rate relief scheme was clear, but we were also committed to using such a business tax reduction to incentivise the things that I described.

Unlike Mr McArthur, whom I congratulate on his maiden speech, I find the approach to government a good maiden speech topic, because it was in East Lothian that John P Mackintosh had the vision and clear sight to develop, in the face of opposition from all sides&#8212;including his own&#8212;the idea of a Scottish Parliament. Tragically, he did not live to see it. His successor&#8212;and my predecessor&#8212;John Home Robertson was one of those who carried the idea through to the Parliament. I pay tribute to John, who served my constituents as MP and MSP for 28 years.</p><p>Re-reading Mackintosh on how Scotland should be governed, I find it astonishing how prescient his vision of a Scottish Parliament was. He even foresaw the SNP holding power, or a share in power, in the Scottish Parliament. He did not fear that, because he thought that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the practical task of governing the country\"</p><p>might convince them that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the days when small countries can maintain the fiction of national sovereignty are over.\"</p><p>We can only hope that that will be the case.</p><p>Mackintosh's other great concern was the nature of cabinet government and the centralisation of power within the executive branch. He believed in efficiency and that a Scottish Parliament would improve the governance of Scotland, but he might have baulked at the creation of ministerial briefs as all embracing as the one that is held by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth.</p><p>Over the past couple of days there has been some banter about the crocodile tears that were shed by Mr Swinney when Wendy Alexander held the brief for enterprise, transport and lifelong learning. I, too, held that brief, although I do not recall receiving much sympathy from Mr Swinney at the time. That portfolio existed in the context of a clearly articulated strategy that explained how economic growth would be driven by improving the commercialisation of research and innovation in our universities. That link was never simply a convenient description of a ministerial brief; it represented a pipeline of support and funding, including the small firms merit award for research and technology&#8212;or SMART&#8212;funding, the support for products under research programme, the proof of concept fund and the Scottish co-investment fund. That support&#8212;unique to Scotland&#8212;has been internationally admired and has created and sustained spin-out companies in many sectors. Indeed, in the case of life sciences it has nurtured an industry that now contributes &#163;1 billion to the Scottish economy.<place-holder colnum=\"159\"/></p><p>The portfolio also responded to a business community that said that investment in the transport infrastructure was the key to success. The result was a transport delivery plan that had at its heart the route development fund, which has delivered more than 30 new direct air routes from Scotland, including vital links to the United States and the far east, and a plan for our capital city that seeks to place its international airport at the heart of our rail network and to link businesses from every part of Scotland to the rest of the world.</p><p>The Administration's early decisions have broken the link at the heart of government between ideas and enterprise, and have threatened the link between Scotland and the world that the Edinburgh airport rail hub can be&#8212;all for an efficiency saving that, by the cabinet secretary's own admission on television last week, amounts to around &#163;500,000 over four years.</p><p>Efficiency in government is a good thing, and this side of the chamber will support it as long as it also underpins effectiveness. The efficiency that matters most to Scotland's economic future is to maximise the contribution that our people make to their own future and ours by ensuring that there is high-quality employment for all and by giving everyone access to the skills and training that they need. We must, above all, avoid wasting our people's potential.</p><p>In the spirit of these subject debates, and given the minister's willingness to listen and his desire to focus on the important issues, I commend to him Labour's plan for a full employment agency that would pull together all the necessary supports to put 100,000 more Scots into employment. If the Government really wants to put economic growth at the centre of its priorities&#8212;which is what the First Minister said yesterday he wished to do&#8212;it must put skills and full employment at its heart. I do not know whether this is what is meant by the new politics&#8212;after all, it has always been the politics on this side of the chamber&#8212;but I can tell the minister that he will have our support if he commits himself today to the goal of creating full employment to drive economic growth.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Approach to Government"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not know whether it is technically possible to lose your maidenhood twice, but as this is my first speech in this chamber and my first as the member representing East Lothian, I hope that members will indulge me and allow me a moment to mark it.

Youth unemployment has fallen by 54 per cent since May 1999, while the number of unemployed older people has fallen by 32 per cent in the same period.</p><p>From a global perspective, Scotland has a small and open economy. In 2001, the growth in gross domestic product slowed simultaneously in the United States, Europe and Asia&#8212;the first time such a slow-down has happened in the three major global economies for almost 30 years. That situation has inevitably impacted on businesses in Scotland and, as a result&#8212;as we have made clear repeatedly&#8212;our GDP growth figures are not good enough. Of course, current events continue to cast a shadow of uncertainty across the global economy. That is why it remains absolutely essential that we continue to lay the foundations for our future prosperity.

The Scottish co-investment fund and the business growth fund form a &#163;40 million package that is intended to help Scottish companies grow. Regional selective assistance has been refocused to provide better support for Scottish companies and smaller companies and to provide investment in knowledge capital as well as physical capital. There is a new research and development support grant scheme.</p><p>We have also made the most far-sighted investment of all: &#163;450 million over a 10-year period in three intermediary technology institutes to commission and commercialise market-driven research.

This is a strategy based on which we are building new industries in biotechnology, photonics, software design and renewable energy.<place-holder colnum=\"19861\"/></p><p>There is no doubt that that strategy is a necessity across the economy. What is a successful, home-grown financial services company such as Intelligent Finance, if it is not built on innovation, the skills of its work force and investment support for its back-office functions in Rosyth and Livingston? Last November, I met senior executives of the JP Morgan bank to discuss with them their experience of setting up their European technology centre in Glasgow. They explained that they had chosen the site from 18 possibilities on the basis of infrastructural support in the financial services district and the available skills. Earlier this week, the bank announced an expansion of the centre and the creation of 150 highly skilled jobs. When I met State Street Bank, in the United States, to discuss its plans for the Edinburgh-based fund management operation of Deutsche Bank, it was assurances about investment in Edinburgh's public transport system that the bank sought. It has now taken out a long lease on its Edinburgh office and has thereby committed to Scotland.</p><p>Dundee has world-renowned biotech companies such as Cyclacel. It also has Michelin Tyres&#8212;traditional manufacturing, surely&#8212;which is driving up productivity by innovating in the production process, investing heavily in the skills and training of its work force and benefiting from the new, shorter and cheaper link to its markets that is provided by the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry. We are investing in innovation, in infrastructure and in people, whether in manufacturing, in the financial services sector or in retail. We are investing in every sector of our economy, old and new.</p><p>We will pursue this strategy with determination. It is for the long term, but we will continue to refine it. The Executive's response to the Scottish manufacturing steering group's report was published this morning. When I reconvened the Scottish manufacturing steering group, I set a tight timetable for it to report under Dr Masters' leadership. I undertook to respond to the group before the end of March, and today I did so in a letter to Dr Masters and the other members of the group. We have accepted 21 of the 23 recommendations that were directed at the Scottish Executive. Seven more will be discussed with UK ministers before August.</p><p>One initiative that flows from the report will target small businesses by establishing a pilot scheme of at least 300 business learning accounts over the next two years. A number of those will be targeted specifically at the manufacturing sector. Employers who are engaged in the pilot scheme will be reimbursed for 50 per cent of all business growth training.</p><p>All the effort and investment in economic growth is driven by the recognition that our growth rate is <place-holder colnum=\"19862\"/> not good enough and that there is no quick fix. Our annual growth rate to the third quarter last year was 0.1 per cent, compared with 1.3 per cent for the UK. However, it is instructive to compare the rates when the electronics sector is removed from both figures. Growth for the remaining 94 per cent of Scotland's economy was 2.4 per cent, which outperformed the UK's figure of 2 per cent. Those figures are not offered as spin, but simply as an indication of the importance of electronics to our economy. It would be foolish to deny that factor and we must address it.</p><p>The electronics sector is performing poorly worldwide. However, there is evidence in the electronics industry in Scotland of what we need to do. For example, Wolfson Microelectronics was born from world-class research in the University of Edinburgh and now designs and sells from Scotland&#8212;production is done overseas&#8212;components contained in cutting-edge, must-have products such as the X-Box games console and the iPod MPEG player.

We promised to report on progress and \"Building Better Transport\", which was published today, is that report. \"Building Better Transport\" describes progress and the way forward in five key areas: economic growth, accessibility, integration, new ways of working and developments for the future.</p><p>Transport is vital to us all and underpins every aspect of our lives, but I begin by talking about its importance to economic development. Economic growth is firmly at the top of the Executive's agenda and I am determined that we will stimulate growth in the economy to generate wealth, to create jobs, to reduce unemployment and to give ourselves a competitive edge in the global marketplace. We have listened to business, which says that it needs a first-class transport infrastructure to support economic growth. We are now investing in exactly that alongside our investment in research innovation and the skills of our people.</p><p>The announcement of the Scottish budget in September was a defining moment. The decision to allocate record funding to transport has been the biggest single factor in enabling us to move forward. The budget placed transport at the heart of our strategy for economic growth. It was a budget to stimulate growth in our transport systems, to invest in our public transport and to give businesses better opportunities to access their markets.<place-holder colnum=\"18969\"/></p><p>The transport budget will rise by more than 50 per cent in the next three years and reach almost &#163;1 billion a year by 2006&#8212;an unprecedented increase by any standards. That huge uplift in transport spending has given us the assurance that money is available to fund the major infrastructure projects that business and Scotland need. Securing those resources has given us the confidence to plan and budget for the long term.</p><p>With a stable macroeconomic environment, low inflation, low interest rates and increased public spending, we have an unprecedented opportunity to invest in our transport infrastructure, to provide the freer movement of people that our economic development strategy demands and to link the work force to the labour market and Scottish business to the world. With the security of the new levels of funding, we can now plan properly for the longer term. We are developing a strategic investment plan that will enable the Executive to make commitments to major capital projects that extend beyond the standard three-year budgeting cycle, adding up to some &#163;3 billion of transport improvements over the next 10 years.</p><p>Combined with that longer-term commitment will be a new approach to active management of financial flows over the longer term, with some additional end-year flexibility for the major capital projects. That means that, over the next 10 years, we will be able to use that &#163;3 billion to invest in the biggest package of transport infrastructure investments that we have ever seen. Although resources are not limitless, I am certain that the transformation of Scotland's transport infrastructure will be well under way by the end of the decade.</p><p>For example, yesterday I was able to announce that the Executive would guarantee &#163;375 million for Edinburgh's transport infrastructure. That substantial investment will ensure that funding is available for at least the first new tramline in the city. The investment is also irrespective of any decision that might be taken on congestion charging. Edinburgh's tram proposal will be one of the first public transport schemes to benefit from the new, longer-term approach to planning. The same long-term planning horizon was applied when we committed ourselves to funding the strategic elements of the Aberdeen western peripheral route.</p><p>Building on significant investments that were made prior to the spending review&#8212;such as the completion of the M74, the M77 and the Glasgow southern orbital route&#8212;we have given firm commitments to upgrade the A8 and A80 to motorway status, to build the Aberdeen western peripheral route and to reinstate the Airdrie to Bathgate railway line. We are also pressing ahead with rail links to both Glasgow and Edinburgh <place-holder colnum=\"18970\"/> airports. We have received the report from the consultants and in the next few weeks I should be in a position to make decisions about both airport rail links. We have invested &#163;1 million in the redevelopment of Waverley station and supported the Waverley railway partnership with more than &#163;2 million to develop the case for the Borders railway line and to secure parliamentary powers. All those projects should benefit from our longer-term approach to budgeting and financial planning.</p><p>One of my key priorities is to deliver the new Scottish passenger rail franchise. Good progress is being made in partnership with the Strategic Rail Authority to deliver the next franchise. Later this month, I expect to be able to announce the shortlist of those who will be invited to bid for the franchise. However, we are not prepared to hang around and we are investing in immediate improvements to our rail services. We announced in December our single biggest railway investment to date, which will deliver 22 new trains, more drivers and more reliable journeys on the network. That investment will make a real difference to the transport system and the economy of Scotland.</p><p>The delivery of Edinburgh Park station, which is at the heart of Edinburgh's financial services sector, threw up the problem of performance penalties, because creating a new station extends journey times, which carries a financial penalty. Working with the rail regulator and the SRA, I broke that impasse and secured agreements that prevented the financial penalties from being levied. In addition, we agreed to fund fully two additional trains to enable new Edinburgh Park trains to operate without creating delays to other services. We will ensure that those and other lessons are learned so that we can improve the speed of delivery of other rail projects.</p><p>Sustainable development is fundamental to our transport vision and thinking and is vital to reducing our use of resources, making better use of our energy and tackling congestion. We have committed to freight facilities grants totalling &#163;47 million and have provided &#163;12 million for the new rail-freight hub at Grangemouth. We have invested &#163;11 million in the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry connection, which has helped to stimulate tourism from and trade with Europe. Those grants and investments are a huge boost to the economy and the tourism industry and will get a greater number of heavy lorries off our roads.</p><p>Buses, too, play a key role in our economy. They carry more passengers than any other form of public transport does and the number of bus passengers has increased in each of the past three years. Through the bus service operators grant, the Executive pays grants of &#163;50 million a year to the bus industry. In addition, to increase accessibility to transport and to lessen social <place-holder colnum=\"18971\"/> exclusion, we introduced free concessionary bus fares, which have enabled more than 1 million older people and people with a disability to enjoy local off-peak bus travel and have easy and free access to amenities.</p><p>Safe and reliable transport services are vital, but people also need excellent travel information to make the best use of them. Traveline Scotland was created to meet that need and it now deals with more than 16,000 telephone and online inquiries a week and provides timetable and journey-planning information for all modes of public transport throughout Scotland.</p><p>We are investing to make transport more accessible and inclusive. We live in a diverse country where our island and remote rural areas require different transport solutions. We continue to invest heavily in Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, to support the air network across the country and to use public service obligations for the maintenance of key links to remote areas. The new interim route development fund will help to stimulate new routes from the Highlands and Islands to other parts of the country and between various airports and the continent. Having direct links to Scotland from the continent and further afield is crucial for business and for attracting more visitors here from overseas.</p><p>Our support for lifeline ferry links is at record levels, which means new ferries for Orkney and Shetland, investment in new piers and harbours and the tendering of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. That support will protect fares and lead to important service enhancements. Those key economic and social lifelines remain high on our agenda. We are making real and significant progress in delivering the key transport projects that Scotland needs.</p><p>We are doing all that we can to increase the speed of delivery, but it has to be recognised that a detailed and intricate process is involved in taking the initial idea of a new road to the eventual opening of that road. In the case of railways, the number of players involved is greater, the legislative process is more complex and the experience of building new lines is almost non-existent in Scotland. We must consider new ways of working that will bring about real change and move more quickly from inception to completion. That is likely to involve considering the legislative process for rail enhancements and financial planning processes. However, I am determined that we will do whatever is needed to improve transport in Scotland.</p><p>The \"Building Better Transport\" report is about taking a long-term, strategic view.

Indeed, the council believes that it is enough for a second tramline. I hope that that is the case, as that would be very good.

The Waverley railway partnership is working up its plans and a funding package, which will include an indication of how much public funding will be required for the line.

It is important that we give guarantees that Edinburgh can move forward on that. Today's announcement is very much about supporting Scotland's economic success. The cities review recognised that our cities must be the drivers for economic success. We need to support Edinburgh's economic success particularly in the area of public transport, where there has previously been some difficulty.</p><p>I am sorry if I misinterpreted part of Mr Mundell's question. Waverley station was one of the priorities in the transport delivery report. The situation is that we are supporting the technical studies that are currently being carried out to allow us to develop a proper plan for the redevelopment of Waverley station. The SRA, which chairs the steering group that is taking the matter forward, recently made it clear that it will support the redevelopment of the station. We expect that the SRA will be very much involved. Nonetheless, we have taken cognisance of the key necessity of the redevelopment of Waverley within the envelope of the investment plans that I have outlined today.</p>", "hdate": "2003-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13292768", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For a number of good reasons, I will not make an explicit funding announcement with an amount of money attached.

I congratulate the committee on its report, which is a thorough and wide-ranging analysis of a complex policy area. The committee has certainly given the Executive food for thought. It is particularly impressive that the committee took evidence from such a wide range of interests, as its convener indicated. It is even more impressive that that vast body of evidence has been distilled into the final report and that the convener distilled the report into his 20 minutes almost exactly.</p><p>As the committee is well aware, the Executive plans to produce a new lifelong learning strategy early next year. I confirm that we intend to take full account of the committee's findings in developing that strategy. Today, however, I want to listen and not to give the Executive's definitive position on the committee's recommendations. The report was published only four weeks ago and I will give the committee a considered response when we publish the strategy document early in the new year. In the meantime, the debate gives me the opportunity to listen to the Parliament's views on the committee's proposals. I am grateful for that opportunity.</p><p>I have produced an interim response to the report, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament information centre. It should be clear from that that the Executive has much common ground with the committee. At the most fundamental level, we agree that lifelong learning is crucial.</p><p>Like the committee, I believe that a learning culture can lead to more confident citizens, more cohesive communities and a more prosperous economy. All of us&#8212;whether we are employed or not and regardless of where we work or what we do&#8212;can benefit from learning new skills and developing new interests. As the convener made clear, that is a requirement for us all in this day and age. The people of Scotland and Scottish businesses in the private and public sectors have a huge appetite for learning. By working with providers, employers, trade unions, the work force and all learners, we can harness that appetite so that everyone can realise their potential through learning.</p><p>The convener said that in no way did the committee's recommendations suggest that an enormous amount of good practice in lifelong learning did not exist. I echo that. In recent years, the Executive has made several significant structural and funding changes to stimulate demand, expand provider capacity and widen access to learning and training. We are also improving the information, guidance and support that are available to individuals and businesses <place-holder colnum=\"15728\"/> about the benefits of learning to them. I listed the initiatives that are under way on those matters in my interim response to the report.</p><p>Today is about looking towards the future, so I will not dwell on the past. However, the evidence is that the current lifelong learning system in Scotland is producing some positive results. For example, 50 per cent of Scottish young people participate in higher education by the time that they are 21. More than 65,000 new further education places have been created in Scotland since 1998-99. Three in four people in the Scottish work force are qualified to Scottish credit and qualifications framework level 5 or above, and that figure continues to rise. More than 20,000 Scots are in training for a modern apprenticeship, which is at SCQF level 6. However, the committee is right to say that the future holds significant challenges for us. I am not complacent about our need to face up to those challenges.</p><p>Like the committee, I take seriously the forecast changes in Scotland's population. Fewer young people will enter the labour market, so it will be important for us to help those who are in work to reskill and retrain. We must keep up with the demands of our economy and enable young people to enter the world of work with confidence.</p>", "hdate": "2002-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13284034", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lifelong Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee for giving me this opportunity to speak.

It is important that we ensure that young people are not funnelled into particular channels, but are given the opportunity to choose the channel that is right for them and right for us and our economic growth. That does not mean university or higher education for everyone. The committee made that point powerfully in its report.</p><p>Like the committee, I believe that inequality and disadvantage should have no place in a modern, 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland. I am convinced that closing the opportunity gap will improve the lives of people in our most excluded communities. That, in turn, will help to make learning of all kinds more attractive to everyone and help to establish the <place-holder colnum=\"15729\"/> learning culture that we all need for success in the future.</p><p>The issues are of interest not only to the Executive and the committee, nor do we alone bear the responsibility for delivering change to meet the challenges. I am thinking not only of the delivery agents such as the funding councils, enterprise networks and the institutions, but of the employers, the work force, trade unions, learning providers, community groups and individual citizens, all of whom have responsibilities and roles to play, which is why there was such broad engagement in the development of the report.</p><p>I have said that there is much common ground between the Executive and the committee. I will quickly give some examples of that. We share the committee's aspirations for widespread stakeholder engagement in lifelong learning policy. We will address that in the strategy. We agree with the committee that learners need and deserve better and more co-ordinated information and advice about learning. All the various players on the lifelong learning field need to work closely together to ensure that learners have easy access to digestible information about the learning that is relevant to them.</p><p>Like the committee, I believe that it is essential that the learning opportunities that are available in Scotland are not just of high quality but, as the convener said, of the highest quality. That will be an important strand in the new strategy.</p><p>The committee recommended the medium-term merger of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. We understand the case that the committee has made for further integration between the councils and we will provide specific proposals on the funding councils in the new strategy.</p><p>The committee has made a number of recommendations about work-based learning for young people.

For example, the committee links entitlement to the SCQF, which is clearly important for the development of lifelong learning. However, the SCQF is in its infancy and there is a great deal of work to do to complete, implement and propagate it. That framework is another aspect that we must ensure is right and robust before we move forward. Our strategy will address that.</p><p>Potential learners do not always take up existing learning opportunities, so we must be certain that people are aware of available opportunities and ensure that barriers to access are steadily dismantled. The committee's convener saw that as one of the most important aspects of the report.</p><p>None of that is easy. Barriers to access, both real and perceived, are as many, varied and complicated as individual learners are. The provision of co-ordinated services to learners and of help for people to help themselves through the learning pathways are important factors. One of the practical steps that we will take to extend access to learning is to set up a successor scheme to individual learning accounts. We are making good progress on that and I will provide further details in the new strategy.</p><p>The committee also recommended that we establish a single funding system for the whole of lifelong learning, albeit one that recognises the differences between the sectors. I understand that the committee is particularly concerned about the differences in funding between the HE and FE sectors.</p><p>Care needs to be taken with the way in which figures are analysed. Comparisons of simple averages do not always recognise the complexities within and across sectors. For example, a medical course will always be more expensive than a business studies course. We must not lose sight of the fact that what is really important is that resources are in place in each part of the system to enable the delivery of our objectives at every level. Our strategy must address that.</p><p>On a connected point, the committee further suggested that the current lifelong learning system is not cohesive and does not serve learners or business well. The committee made several suggestions for structural change to bring the various elements of the current system closer together. There are some relatively new elements in the system&#8212;for example, Careers Scotland and learndirect Scotland&#8212;which need time to prove their effectiveness. However, I agree with the overall aim of getting the system to work smoothly and coherently and I will address that in our new strategy.<place-holder colnum=\"15732\"/></p><p>The committee rightly devoted much space in its report to workplace and vocational training. As the report says, the enterprise networks have an important role to play in supporting work force development and in helping business and the economy to grow. That is why we placed learning and skills at the heart of our strategy for the networks. The convener is right in his view that it is important to society and the individual that we match skills to the needs and opportunities of the economy. We must provide the framework and opportunities to support an efficient labour market and maximise opportunities for those who enter that market.</p><p>A key step is to have a better understanding of how the system works in relation to the skills that employers are looking for and the links between the supply of skills and economic results. The establishment of Futureskills Scotland is a significant step in that direction. The results of its first skills survey are surprising and fascinating. For example, the survey shows that a lack of suitable skills in the work force&#8212;skills shortages&#8212;is a relatively minor issue, accounting for only one in five vacancies. Probably a more important issue is the skills gap. One in six employers feels that some of their employees have skills deficiencies that limit their performance.</p><p>The Executive is not the only player in this arena. We recognise, for instance, the important role that employers have to play. Indeed, we estimate that employers invest some &#163;2 billion in training in Scotland. However, it is clear from the Futureskills Scotland survey and from elsewhere that more could be done to maximise the benefits of that investment. I want employers to do more to develop their work force across the piece. I believe that maximum benefits will result all round if that is done in partnership with employees and their trade unions. There are excellent examples of how that can be done and I am sure that the committee is aware of them.</p><p>I want to talk about resources. As with all policy decisions, affordability is an issue and I would be failing in my duties if I did not take it into account. The committee has given us a thorough analysis of the lifelong learning landscape. It has highlighted where it feels that problems arise and has suggested some solutions. The Executive is investing some &#163;2.1 billion in lifelong learning this year. We have increased those resources by 14 per cent over the next three years in our current spending plans, which means that investment will rise to some &#163;2.4 billion by 2005-06. We will then build on the process of deciding where the priorities lie for the future in the new strategy.</p><p>It should be clear from what I have said that I broadly agree with the aims and objectives that the committee has set out for lifelong learning in <place-holder colnum=\"15733\"/> the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Learning is a lifetime opportunity and a lifetime commitment. As the convener eloquently explained, it is also a lifetime requirement. It can help people to develop in different ways that can enrich their lives, their careers, our communities and our country. The committee's report is a powerful contribution to the debate about the future of lifelong learning in Scotland. Some difficult challenges lie ahead, but the new strategy is an opportunity to set a clear direction so that all our efforts are focused on meeting those challenges. The committee's report is already influencing the shape of the strategy and this debate is an opportunity for other members to do the same.

The debate itself is an introduction, because its essential purpose is to allow members to contribute to the consultation process on air transport, which was launched by Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Transport, in July, and which will close at the end of November. The process is taking place across the United Kingdom. A suite of consultation documents and technical studies provide a variety of detailed growth scenarios and outline the likely infrastructure requirements.</p><p>In Scotland, the consultation process is being conducted jointly by the Department for Transport and the Scottish Executive. Compared with the situation prior to devolution, Scotland is in a strong position because many of the key areas are devolved. Land-use planning, surface access and the management of publicly owned airports are our responsibilities. Licensing, safety, security and environmental policy are reserved matters, along with international agreements, economic regulation and slot policy.</p><p>The aviation industry is critical to Scotland's future, not only because it is worth &#163;0.6 billion a year to the Scottish economy and provides directly 15,000 jobs&#8212;and at least as many again through multiplier effects&#8212;but because it links our nation to the rest of the world. Air links bind nations together. Airports and air services promote economic growth by increasing access to markets and suppliers, and by encouraging inward investment and tourism. Airports themselves act as focuses for clusters of businesses.</p><p>The aviation sector is growing. The success story in Scotland is one of dramatic growth with passenger numbers doubling in the last decade. The Scottish consultation document indicates that the current 18 million passengers a year who pass through Scottish airports may well increase to somewhere between 26 million and 50 million by 2030. The document also outlines the potential for air freight and the role it can play. The freight sector is subdivided into different categories, with dedicated cargo flights by freight aircraft&#8212;either scheduled or chartered&#8212;as well as belly-hold <place-holder colnum=\"14497\"/> facilities on passenger aircraft, and dedicated mail operations.</p>", "hdate": "2002-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13280905", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Future of Air Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to introduce this debate.

Glasgow airport has a healthy belly-hold freight operation. Edinburgh airport is the dominant airmail centre for Scotland and its position in the central belt, its road links and its proximity to express freight users give it great advantages for express parcels and airmail in the future.

As with the growth in passenger traffic, many considerations must be taken into account, not least environmental factors. The consultation document, rightly, assesses the impacts at Scottish airports of the growth scenarios, and environmental factors include noise and air quality changes as well as the potential impact on ecology and heritage. Like safety, those factors are key elements of the circle that must be squared to allow us to develop the aviation strategy in the best way.</p><p>Anyone can participate in the consultation process.

As such, it is led by the marketplace. The landing charges at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports are a matter for the operator of the airports who has to negotiate with the airlines in order to create the possibility of new route development. I would expect that to happen.</p><p>I turn to Mr Butler's point. Glasgow and Edinburgh airports are the two largest airports in the United Kingdom without direct rail access. That is why the Executive has said that providing rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports is one of its top priorities. That commitment pre-dates the air transport consultation.</p><p>The study to determine the value-for-money case for the links is progressing well. The <place-holder colnum=\"14500\"/> consultants are considering in more depth four options for each airport and I expect their recommendations on the preferred option at each airport in the next few weeks. With the assistance of the Strategic Rail Authority, BAA, which owns both airports, and the relevant authorities, we will be able to move the projects forward to delivery.</p><p>However, necessary and unavoidable groundwork has to be done, including ensuring that the private bill that comes before the Parliament is robust enough to enable members to make informed decisions. All that groundwork suggests that the earliest starting date for design and construction of any link is likely to be 2005. I recognise that that is an ambitious timetable but, with the will and a fair wind, I believe that it is achievable.</p><p>Like many members, I am keen to see an improved network of direct routes to Europe and beyond. In the past we have considered new routes on a case-by-case basis. Together with the enterprise agencies, we are now working towards a coherent route development strategy. However, any financial assistance to air operators must comply with European Union regulations on state aid. A framework is required for identifying the routes that provide the maximum benefit.</p><p>In that context, I am pleased that Scotland has been selected to host the ninth world route development forum next September. The forum is the largest gathering of airline network planners in the world. Well over 1,000 route development specialists are expected to attend one of the most important events in the aviation calendar. By bringing that highly prestigious forum to Scotland, we are sending out a global message that we want to develop air travel in Scotland to our full potential and ensure that we achieve maximum advantage from the benefits of strong air links. Securing more direct international air services for Scotland will be top of the agenda when the leading players in the aviation industry visit Scotland.</p><p>Access to the London airports is also important for Scotland. Such access gives us entry to markets and services in south-east England and to many interlining opportunities. We will work closely with the other devolved Administrations on how best to protect access to the south-east and on the view that we should take on extra capacity at the south-east airports.</p><p>We are keenly aware of the particular requirements of remote communities and their need to access central Scotland, south-east England and interlining opportunities at the big hub airports. The financial support that we have made available to HIAL has risen from &#163;7 million in 1997 to &#163;21.5 million in the current financial year, which represents a 207 per cent increase in Government support over a five-year period. In the <place-holder colnum=\"14501\"/> period from 2003-04 to 2005-06, HIAL's expenditure will further increase to &#163;22.1 million. That is a substantial commitment to HIAL and to lifeline transport links in the Highlands and Islands. The support that we provide will allow HIAL to continue to operate 10 airports and will keep airport charges at a level that can encourage the continuing development of air services. I understand that on Friday there will be an announcement about a new route from Inverness. I am sure that more details about that will follow.</p><p>Air services are shaped by businesses making commercial decisions. Our role in Government is to identify failings in the market and to be persuasive about, promote and legislate for the provision of public goods. In order to do that, we require a broad consensus about our aims for the industry that takes account of economic, social and environmental factors and considers the needs of all our communities. That is where the current consultation process comes in. We will do our best to ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute&#8212;that is the purpose of this afternoon's debate.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the consultation process currently being undertaken jointly by the Department for Transport and the Scottish Executive on the future development of air transport in the United Kingdom.</p>", "hdate": "2002-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13280905", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Future of Air Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Key to the aviation industry is the fact that it is an industry.

That is a given.</p><p>It is also a given that growth is our problem; no one argues about that. The latest gross domestic product figures for Scotland were unwelcome, to say the least.

Those matters are of the greatest import&#8212;we all hold strong views about them. However, this afternoon we should address the subject matter of the motion.</p><p>Scotland was getting to grips with the impact of globalisation on a small, open economy such as ours when the 11 September attacks happened. Our approach to the economy was born from a recognition that we had to focus on growing our own businesses, developing our own skills and fostering global connections. Overnight, all that work became even more relevant, as, like all other countries across the world, we realised the profundity of the global economic links that exist today.</p><p>There is no doubt that Scotland has suffered from the economic after-effects of 11 September. Perhaps tourism has been most obviously affected, but other industries, such as the technology sectors, have also had to cope with post-11 September uncertainty and the consequent serious global slow-down. As we address that situation, one of the factors in our favour is the depth of our historical, cultural, philosophical, business and economic links with the United States. As Rhoda Grant and Annabel Goldie&#8212;among other speakers&#8212;said, we must work to expand those connections.</p><p>Scottish Development International offices in the USA build on those links and have an extensive reach from north to south and from coast to coast. Our California office is the hub of our activities on the west coast in the high-tech electronics and venture capital sectors. On the east coast, our Virginia and Stamford offices have helped to forge links with many leading academics and entrepreneurs, particularly in the biotechnology and financial services fields.</p><p>Of course, John Swinney was right when he said that we should not forget that inward investment has been a major feature of Scotland's economic links with the USA in the past 20 years. Despite the fact that the proportion of inward investment jobs created by US-based firms has dropped from 48 per cent to 33 per cent over the past 10 years&#8212;that drop may not be as big as we sometimes imagine it to be&#8212;I am in no doubt that it will continue to be important to engage with major inward investors, not least because they have much to teach us about best practice in research, innovation and productivity.</p><p>We also have productive links in the main US centres of California and New England, whose investors are interested in backing specialist fields that sometimes find it difficult to get support from within Scotland. Several leading Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"13570\"/> companies, such as Compound Semiconductor Technologies, Photonic Materials, Kamelian, Kymata and Cyclacel have already benefited from recent US investment. By developing such links further, we will allow Scottish academics and business people to benefit from a vast body of expertise in the process of funding and commercialising innovation.</p><p>Many Scots have crossed the Atlantic and built successful lives and careers in the USA. There are far too many to mention, although the debate has featured some examples, from Alexander Hamilton, in banking, to Andrew Carnegie. Those connections are as alive today as they ever were. Scottish Enterprise's globalScot network recognises the need to unlock the potential of today's equivalents of Carnegie and Hamilton in order to help Scotland survive and thrive in the global economy. The globalScot network already has 400 founding members, more than half of which are based in the USA. Those senior individuals are willing to help us to open doors abroad for Scottish business and, by sharing their experience, they are willing to help us to develop home-grown expertise, for example by offering positive role models to Scottish schoolchildren.</p><p>Several members have commented on the fact that Scots have traditionally demonstrated what they can do after going to America. We must bring back that enterprising entrepreneurial approach. We must repatriate it and apply it here in Scotland.</p><p>Many members have mentioned that some of the strongest links between Scotland and the US are in education, particularly in higher education. It is well known that the American higher education system was modelled on Scotland's&#8212;it shares a pattern of initial breadth followed by later specialisation. The link is not merely historical. Students from the USA form the largest group of overseas students in Scotland. Rhona Brankin provided examples from Midlothian. They study at all levels, from undergraduate to postgraduate, and often stay on, as teachers and researchers, to enrich our university faculties. The growing number of American students who come to study in Scotland&#8212;the figure now stands at more than 1,500 per year&#8212;represent a transatlantic link that we should cherish.</p><p>Among those students, we welcome a small number of Marshall scholars. The Marshall scholarship scheme, which will celebrate its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary next year, commemorates the humane ideals of the European recovery programme in the aftermath of the second world war&#8212;the Marshall plan. The scheme provides the finances for a small number of high-ability young Americans to study for a degree in the United Kingdom.</p><p>What is true of the classroom is true of the <place-holder colnum=\"13571\"/> common room and the laboratory. The academic community is truly international. Benjamin Franklin, no less, was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. That transatlantic link remains strong&#8212;next month, the RSE will host a lecture on Hugh Miller's influence on transatlantic environmental awareness.</p><p>There are countless examples of connections in teaching and research between Scottish universities and their US counterparts. The link between the University of Edinburgh and Stanford University has been mentioned. The Edinburgh-Stanford link is a five-year collaborative programme, which is worth &#163;6 million. It aims to establish Scotland as a global leader in the commercial development of language technology and to boost our reputation as a centre for research and design.</p><p>There are many other ways, from the long-standing to the very new, in which our academic community reaches across the Atlantic. I want to focus on just one of them, the Colin McArthur postgraduate scholarship at the University of Glasgow. The award, which has been provided as a lasting tribute to a Glasgow graduate, Colin McArthur, who died in the events of September 11, has been supported by his widow, his friends and his colleagues, as well as by alumni and friends of the university. It will enable a student who lost a parent or guardian in the tragic events to attend the university to study any chosen discipline. The university hopes that, in time, enough will be raised to endow the scholarship in perpetuity and it seeks, eventually, to extend the terms to cover any US student.</p><p>Of course the tragic events of last September dented the confidence of the US. That was reflected in transport links&#8212;people stopped travelling for a while. Those links are important to us and a strong recovery is taking place. We want to encourage the development of our air links with the US. The re-establishment of the link between New York and Glasgow in 1998 has proved an undoubted success. Direct access to the US and to the Newark hub of Continental Airlines provides a wealth of opportunities to travel throughout the Americas. American Airlines also provides scheduled links to the US and there are charter links to Florida. Such links are important, because people mediate our connections, whether they are business, family, academic, cultural or sporting connections.</p><p>I was at the World Trade Center, as part of a holiday, a few weeks before 11 September last year. It is odd what one remembers when one thinks back. I remember a covered walkway that was mirrored all round in the New York style. People who passed underneath would see their reflection from a strange angle when they looked <place-holder colnum=\"13572\"/> up. Our links with the US are like that&#8212;we see ourselves reflected back because there is so much of Scotland across the Atlantic. Like all reflections, the image is not always identical. Sometimes we may like what we see and at other times we may not be so fond of what we see, but we cannot escape the reflection of ourselves.</p><p>Similarly, we cannot escape the impact of moments in time such as 9/11. All kinds of previous history, actions, decisions and politics converge from all directions on such a moment. All kinds of potential consequences flow from it. However, in the moment itself, and when we talk about where we were, the world stops. Our heart stops too at the tragedy and suffering and heroism, which were above and beyond all normal days. 9/11 was like that. We can analyse the roots of the moment; we can, and should, debate what should happen next or now; but we should also pause in all sincerity to mark apart the moment itself. That is what today is for.</p><p>At a different time and for a different tragedy, a great American writer wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places.\"</p><p>We all need that to be true now for the United States. That is why our links matter so much now.

The institute will be a new, powerful link between research and commercialisation. It will spot market opportunities by linking with energy companies and identifying their future commercial needs. The institute will link with the pure research that is going on in universities and, potentially, commission new work.

First, because more than 70 per cent of households are now in the private sector, it is incumbent on us to ensure that the system operates fairly for everyone. That is why the task force has taken seriously the issue of equality. Its work has shown that there are people who, for no reason apart from the community in which they live or were brought up, do not have full access to either the rental or buyer market. We must take that issue seriously and address it. It was disappointing that it was not taken seriously at all at one stage in the debate.</p><p>Andrew Welsh spoke about housing in rural Scotland. The task force refers to that and is aware of the specific issues in rural Scotland that must be addressed. That is the advantage of taking our time&#8212;we have time to consider all the issues and to come up with comprehensive solutions. Those solutions will have to include considering legislation such as the proposed tenement bill, which will also go a long way towards finding a legal framework to resolve the problems of common repairs.</p><p>Along with other colleagues, I look forward to seeing the recommendations once they are ready, and to debating them with members of the Parliament. We have a promise that the Tories will join in the debate at that stage. We all look forward to that.

The provision of accommodation is not, of itself, enough. Many homeless people, particularly those who sleep rough, face a multitude of other problems. Many have poor health or are addicted to drugs or alcohol. Others have been victims of violence or domestic abuse.</p><p>For all homeless people, whatever has led them to homelessness, the resettlement process can be very difficult, especially for those with no prior experience of managing a home or maintaining a tenancy. Homelessness is a housing problem, but not only a housing problem. People at risk of losing their home require intensive support if the crisis of homelessness is to be averted. Those who have experienced homelessness need intensive support if resettlement is to be sustainable and permanent.</p><p>That is why we chose to mobilise the widest range of experience and expertise available to us: Shelter Scotland, <i>The Big Issue</i>, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, the national health service&#8212;a broad base covering all aspects of the problem. The quality of the task force's work is already reflected in statute, with the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 including its interim recommendations.</p><p>Local authorities are therefore already obliged to <place-holder colnum=\"10076\"/> carry out assessments of homelessness in their area and produce homelessness strategies. They must also produce wider local housing strategies, and plan for the economic, efficient and effective provision of housing and related services. Those two things must be interlinked and a wide range of agencies must be brought together in their production. We now have Communities Scotland acting as the regulator of homelessness services. Regulation provides a means of dealing with inconsistent and poor practice. It ensures that the legislation and guidance is followed.</p><p>Having set that framework, the task force has, in its final report, made 59 specific recommendations. We accept them all. Some of the recommendations are directed towards other Government departments: the Scottish Prison Service; the education department; the Ministry of Defence; and the Department for Work and Pensions. The benefits system has a vital part to play in helping people avoid and resolve homelessness. We will work with the DWP and Westminster ministers to ensure that that part is played to the full. We want to ensure that homeless people are not disadvantaged, particularly in their efforts to develop their skills and move into work.</p>", "hdate": "2002-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13269247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness Task Force"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open this debate on the report of the homelessness task force.

As I said in response to a question last week, I have already ensured that, latterly, the DWP was part of the task force recommendations.</p><p>Overall, the implementation of the task force report will give homeless people rights that they have never enjoyed before and will change the way in which homelessness is perceived and dealt with in Scotland. Most significantly, within ten years, all homeless people will be entitled to permanent accommodation, except where that right has been suspended for a specific reason. There will no longer be a distinction of priority need&#8212;homelessness itself will be enough to confer a right to a permanent home. There are those who criticise the time scale, but it is simply realistic. That pragmatic focus has been a marker <place-holder colnum=\"10077\"/> of the task force's work. Its aim was real and realistic changes to address homelessness.</p><p>Along with the change to priority need, homeless people will be able to apply to any local authority in Scotland without having to establish a local connection. There is no evidence to show that that will lead to a deluge of homeless people in certain areas. In Edinburgh, where such fears were whipped up by Tory councillors, the local authority seldom uses the local connection measure as it is.</p><p>A new regime for responding to intentionally homeless families will also be established. Accommodation must always be provided within a framework that supports the intentionally homeless household to maintain that accommodation, to address the issues that led to their homelessness and to move on to more secure accommodation.</p><p>Those measures require legislation. I can confirm today that we will introduce a homelessness bill later this year.

There will be an opportunity to discuss with the monitoring group whether a statutory instrument is required, and the task force has said that expanding priority need is the first step.</p><p>Responding to homelessness is not all about legislation. Providing the right kind of accommodation is important. For example, the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families is unacceptable and must be eliminated. Large-scale hostels for homeless people must also be a thing of the past. We need to widen access to housing for homeless people by requiring all local authorities to provide a rent deposit or guarantee scheme by 2004. Furnished tenancies and lead tenancies must also be considered.</p><p>Support packages must be in place for homeless people, and health care needs must be fully met. Homeless people must be given every <place-holder colnum=\"10078\"/> opportunity to participate in education and employment and to rebuild supportive social networks. We take all those things for granted for ourselves and our families. It should not be any different for those who experience homelessness, if for no other reason than that any one of us or our families could face homelessness. Homelessness can result from illness, family breakdown or job loss, which can happen to anyone.</p><p>A major focus of the report and of our future approach is the prevention of homelessness. In particular, we stress that local authorities should be proactive and should intervene early to avoid the crisis of homelessness. Corporate policies in local authorities on anti-social behaviour, rent arrears or eviction should not lead to avoidable homelessness. The change in culture goes further than a greater emphasis on prevention. We must recognise, and have services that recognise, that homeless people deserve to be treated with respect. Their views should be listened to and acted on. As I said at question time last week, there is an attitude problem that must be addressed.</p><p>We will act quickly to implement the recommendations of the task force. I am not convinced of the need for further action plans. The recommendations themselves point the way. Work on the forthcoming legislation is already under way, and we will establish a monitoring group to drive and oversee progress.</p><p>We have already allocated &#163;11 million over the next two years to start the delivery of the recommendations. We should remember that that money is in addition to the &#163;40 million allocated to the rough sleepers initiative, with a further &#163;11 million over the next two years.

Only this morning, Richard Simpson announced the allocation of &#163;250,000 of seized criminal assets to fund drug services for Glasgow's homeless people. We are providing new resources, but we must also focus on more effective use of existing resources.</p><p>Looking at the amendments to the motion, I fear that at least some of this afternoon's debate will focus on the recital and deconstruction of statistics. I confess that my heart sinks somewhat. However, statistics are important and we do not have statistics that are good and up to date <place-holder colnum=\"10079\"/> enough.

This year, for the first time, we have provided data that reveal the size of the gap between deprived and affluent areas on key determinants of health such as breast feeding, women smoking in pregnancy and mortality rates caused by heart and respiratory disease. Those gaps are too large and turning them round will take time. That said, taking the first step of disaggregating our milestones is crucial to introducing effective strategies to reduce inequalities in health.</p><p>Also for the first time, we have comprehensive information on rough sleepers through a new study that has been warmly endorsed and welcomed by the voluntary sector. We have been able to disaggregate more milestones than last year on urban and rural classifications, an issue that was quite properly raised in the debate on last year's report.</p><p>All the statistical information in the report and the technical annexe is produced by Government statisticians to a code of practice.

For example, claimant count unemployment is at its lowest level for a generation. The level of underage smoking has dropped and there are signs of a fall in teenage pregnancy rates. The employment position of disadvantaged groups such as lone parents has improved and there appears to be an increase in the employment of disabled and older people.

The message is plain: poor children are better off and the gap between them and the average is narrowing, although it is still too great. It is also plain that the foundation of that progress is the rise in general prosperity that is being delivered by successful management of the economy. The SNP's separatist ambitions, as couched in its amendment, would destroy that foundation by creating economic instability.</p><p>As we have said endlessly, there is no single definition of poverty, and poverty is about more than low income. Last year, as well as providing income data across 20 different indicators in the report, we quoted the survey results as they relate to numbers of children. This year, I am not in a position to give numbers in addition to the comprehensive collection of indicators on low income, because there are technical difficulties with the survey information. However, that does not affect the proportion data, nor the data in the report.

Following discussion with local mothers about their needs, an innovative new project&#8212;the baby weight gain programme&#8212;has just started with the support of the NHS and a major food retailer. That approach is the key&#8212;working with communities to identify the action that is required and then forging the alliances that can deliver it.

He then quite correctly pointed out that if we ask practitioners in the legal profession&#8212;as the committee did&#8212;whether the law protects those complainers, the answer is an overwhelming yes.</p><p>The key point is that both those groups have experience of this kind of trial in our courts, because the researchers spoke to complainers, not the general public.

We will then monitor how the new provisions take effect. However, as members will understand, doing so will take some time.</p><p>Members have also pointed out that, in requiring the accused to be legally represented for the whole of a trial, we have gone further than is strictly needed to protect the complainer. I tried to explain that we have done that partly because of procedures in Scottish trials, which mean that evidence is disclosed in the course of the trial. That means that a solicitor who had to take over representation in the middle of a trial would, at the very least, need to have shadowed the whole trial to be aware of the evidence. Our option made better sense and indeed, as several members have pointed out, might provide better-quality <place-holder colnum=\"4029\"/> representation for the accused. Stewart Stevenson also pointed to a further benefit involving other witnesses and he is probably right.</p><p>The bill states that when a solicitor is appointed by the court, he or she has to get instructions from the accused. We must recognise that, occasionally, an accused may refuse to co-operate. Where a solicitor cannot obtain instructions or receives inadequate or perverse instructions, his or her duty is only to act in the best interests of the accused. It is likely that, in that position and with regard to professional ethics, the solicitor will be able to perform only a very limited role. However, that will have demonstrably been the result of the accused's own action. As Pauline McNeill helpfully pointed out, we now have experience of similar circumstances through the Public Defence Solicitors Office pilot scheme It is true that the bill gives the accused no right to dismiss a solicitor who has been appointed by a court. By the time the court appoints a solicitor, it will already have received a number of warnings. We believe that the court should be in control of the appointment process and that it should have the power to discharge the solicitor during the trial if, for example, there is a clear clash of personalities or if the accused has approached the court and given an acceptable reason for that to happen. We intend to lodge an amendment at stage 2 to make the court's power clear.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland put forward a proposal that several members have referred to&#8212;the idea of an amicus curiae. Our key reason for not pursuing that idea is straightforward: it does not deal with the basic issue of personal confrontation between complainer and accused. That is what we seek to make impossible through the bill. However, the proposal may warrant further discussion and I expect that it will be discussed when we consider wider issues concerning the protection of vulnerable witnesses. I do not support the idea&#8212;I have concerns about it&#8212;but time will be found to discuss it further, as some members have asked for that.</p><p>Members have asked why the bill is drawn so widely. There has to be a specific list, so that it is clear whether the provisions of the bill apply. Some of the minor offences that are given as examples, such as flashing, would normally be charged as a breach of the peace and would not automatically be covered by the bill. However, I agree that there is still debate to be had on the contents of the list, especially regarding homosexual offences&#8212;as I acknowledged&#8212;which is a similar issue.</p><p>I appreciate the fact that, of the three effects of the bill, the one about which members are most lukewarm is prior notice defence. It takes us back <place-holder colnum=\"4030\"/> to the question of balancing the experience of those whose experience is intense but limited and that of those who have wide experience. Almost all trials of this kind may involve a defence of consent. Bill Aitken may know that. The procurator fiscal may, as a matter of course, tell victims that they are likely to face such an accusation. I see no reason why we should not make sure that the victims know what they will have to face.</p><p>Let me be clear. We cannot protect a victim from a defence of consent: that is not the purpose of the bill. Similarly, we are not stopping the accused from defending himself; we are only insisting that he does so through instructing a lawyer. We are not outlawing evidence of character or sexual history but regulating its use more stringently, so that it is allowed only when it should properly be used. Nothing that we do today will make facing a trial as a victim of rape anything other than a distressing, traumatic nightmare, but we can ensure that victims know what they will have to face and that they will never face direct cross-examination by their attacker.

Those have been our twin objectives throughout the process leading up to today's debate. I am therefore encouraged to see that the Justice 2 Committee's stage 1 report concludes that the bill strikes the right balance between the protection of the complainer and the rights of the accused, and that the committee recommends that the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the bill.</p><p>The committee's conclusion was reached after a searching process of evidence taking from a wide range of interests. I would therefore like to record my thanks to the members of the committee and their staff for the hard work that has gone into producing the report. The report highlights a number of issues for us to consider further. If, at the conclusion of the debate, the Parliament sees fit to support the general principles of the bill, we will ensure that those issues are addressed in full before stage 2.</p><p>The Executive made a commitment to introduce the bill in June 2000. A pre-legislative consultation document, \"Redressing the Balance: Cross-examination in Rape and Sexual Offence Trials\", was issued on 9 November 2000 and the consultation period officially closed on 31 January 2001. Our deadline for introducing the bill was 28 June. That was a very challenging deadline, but one that we were able to meet. I would like to thank everyone who took the time and trouble to participate in our consultation exercise. Without their contributions we would not have been able to introduce the bill on time.</p><p>The single most important aim of the bill is to reduce the fear factor that alienates victims of sexual crimes from our criminal justice system. That aim is an integral part of the Executive's commitment to support the victims of crime, which we made in our programme for government and confirmed in the Scottish strategy for victims.</p><p>Although the bill focuses particularly on <place-holder colnum=\"3984\"/> complainer witnesses in sexual offence cases, it is part of a wider programme of work. Next year, we will be consulting on whether further changes to the law of evidence are needed to help other vulnerable or intimidated witnesses testify in court. We will be considering the whole range of witnesses who may have additional needs and examining whether changes to practices and procedures are needed.</p><p>The bill slots into a much wider framework, within which it is designed to tackle some of the particular problems faced by victims of sexual offences. We all know that the majority of such victims are women, but we should not forget that there are also male victims of sexual abuse and assault. They share the feelings of shame, humiliation, fear and anger that all victims experience. The Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Bill will protect them, too.</p><p>If it is passed, the bill will do three things. It will ban an accused in a sexual offence case from conducting his or her own defence. It will strengthen the existing law regulating the use of evidence about the complainer's character and past behaviour. Finally, it will require any defence of consent or belief in consent to be notified before the trial.</p><p>The first part of the bill responds to the concern created by three recent cases where an accused charged with a sexual offence did not have a lawyer and questioned the complainers himself. We have always acknowledged that such cases are rare, but their small number does not diminish the trauma caused to those individuals most closely involved. Furthermore, the publicity about recent cases may have exacerbated the fear of going to court among victims. A victim is always likely to dread questioning about the humiliating details of a sexual attack. That dread can only be made worse if there is a possibility of the questioning being done by the person who may be responsible for the attack. If someone were to ask us today whether that could happen, we would have to admit that it could; passing the bill would mean that we would be able to say in truth that it could not.</p><p>The bill bans an accused charged with a sexual offence from conducting his or her defence in person at the trial. We are taking a different approach from that adopted in England and Wales. We considered carefully the solution chosen in England and Wales, but came to the conclusion that there are significant differences between our respective systems, which mean that a different approach is needed here. In Scotland, there is usually no disclosure of evidence by each side to the other before the trial. In England and Wales there are rules that require pre-trial disclosure. In England and Wales the defence will <place-holder colnum=\"3985\"/> have seen the statements of the prosecution witnesses before the trial starts. In Scotland each side will interview witnesses separately as they see fit, and usually neither side will see the other's statements. A full picture of the evidence will emerge only during the trial itself.</p><p>A lawyer brought into the case for the sole purpose of questioning the complainer&#8212;who may not be the first witness&#8212;without having access to the prosecution statements, and without having had an opportunity to prepare the defence case in advance, would be unlikely to be able to represent the accused effectively. In our view, requiring the accused to be legally represented for the whole trial protects the interests of the complainer and the accused.</p><p>We have been careful in the bill to provide other protections for the accused. The schedule provides for a series of notices to be given, from arrest onwards, alerting an accused to the need to appoint a solicitor. He or she will have plenty of time to select their own lawyer, but if they refuse to appoint anyone, ultimately the court will choose a solicitor for them. That solicitor will be under a duty to try to get instructions from the accused. Where the accused does not co-operate, the solicitor will have the authority to act in the accused's best interests on the basis of the material available.</p><p>The other major change proposed by the bill is in relation to questioning about the complainer's character and past behaviour. At the moment, applications to introduce sexual history evidence about the complainer can be made orally in the course of the trial with no prior notice. Discussion of those applications may be fairly brief. Sometimes, the evidence slips through without application and before any objection can be made to stop it. Furthermore, there is currently no need to make an application when the evidence is about the complainer's general character or non-sexual behaviour, rather than about sexual activity. Questioning of the complainer as to whether she is an alcoholic, has used drugs, or has suffered mental illness, may be made without any formal application at all, and with little, if any, examination as to whether such questioning is relevant to the issues at trial.</p><p>Published research suggests that there are subtle character attacks, using non-sexual evidence to hint at sexual behaviour or to undermine the complainer's credibility, which the current law does little or nothing to prevent. That research is not recent, and it may be that that situation is now less common, but the perception is that it happens. The bill must give confidence that it will not.</p><p>The bill tackles those problems in two ways. First, it brings the question of the relevance of the evidence, and the purpose for which it is to be <place-holder colnum=\"3986\"/> used, much more to the forefront. Secondly, it sets down a clear process by which the admissibility of the evidence is to be determined, a process that involves consideration of the rights of the complainer as well as of the accused.</p><p>The bill sets out the criteria to be used to decide whether an application to introduce character or sexual history evidence should be granted. There is a series of stages at which the evidence must be assessed before it can be admitted. First, the evidence must be about specific instances of behaviour by the complainer or specific facts. Secondly, the evidence must be relevant to an issue at stake in the trial. Thirdly, the evidence will have to have significant probative value, that is, it will need to be of potentially significant help to the judge or jury in resolving the case. Fourthly, that significant value must outweigh any prejudice to the proper administration of justice that will be caused by admitting the evidence. The proper administration of justice, of course, includes ensuring that the accused can present a full and fair defence. That is a fundamental pillar of our system of justice.</p><p>The bill does, however, draw the court's attention to two other factors in assessing whether justice requires that the evidence be admitted. One of those is the possibility of diverting the jury's attention from the major issues it has to decide. It is not, after all, the function of the trial to pass judgment on the character of the complainer. The other factor is the need to give appropriate protection to the complainer's privacy and dignity. This is the first time that the complainer's rights and interests have been given any express status in the process. I hope that members will agree that that is a major step forward.</p><p>The bill also introduces a written application process for the admission of that evidence and, unless there is a good reason for lateness, the application must be lodged before the trial. As the Justice 2 Committee recognised in its report, that is intended to ensure that such evidence is considered in a thorough, detailed and structured way. It is also intended to ensure that the issues are clarified and dealt with before the trial begins.</p><p>However, I note the concerns that the committee has expressed about some aspects of the application process and the potential for delay, either before or during the trial. I assure members that we will consider carefully how to address those concerns before stage 2 of the bill.</p><p>The bill will also require the accused to give notice before the trial of any intended defence of consent, including a defence of belief in consent. That would be the third effect of the bill, should it become law. Late notification will still be permitted on cause shown. I know that, at the committee stage, doubts were expressed about the practical <place-holder colnum=\"3987\"/> benefit of such a provision to the complainer. I will therefore take a moment to set out clearly the aims of the provision.</p><p>First, the provision will give the complainer fair warning that consent will be an issue and will allow her to prepare psychologically for the type of questioning that she might face. Of course, in most sexual offence cases, the absence of consent is an essential element of the crime. Evidence of that will have to be led by the prosecution, and that might involve evidence of the use of force or threats.</p><p>In cases where the accused and the complainer are known to one another, the complainer might expect that the accused's position will be that the complainer consented. However, there are other cases where such a defence might be entirely unexpected&#8212;for example, in a case where the complainer has suffered injuries, clearly showing that force was used. It is not unknown for an accuser to counter such evidence with argument that the complainer enjoyed being treated roughly and that consent was given.</p><p>Even in cases where the accused and the complainer are total strangers, and where there is a strong prosecution case, the accused might still argue that the complainer consented. In such cases, the suggestion that she actually consented to the violence against her could come as a complete shock to the complainer. Advance notification will prevent that happening.</p><p>The provision also links in with the requirement to make an application to lead evidence about the complainer's character or sexual history. That sort of evidence will rarely be relevant, unless the defence is consent. Before considering any application, it is important that the court knows that the accused is alleging consent.</p><p>In combination with the provisions on sexual history evidence, the provision tries to create a situation where, before the trial begins, both sides are clear on what the issues are and what evidence about the complainer the accused will be seeking to lead, if any. The trial should be concerned primarily with whether the accused did or did not commit the alleged offence and not with the conduct of the complainer.</p><p>During stage 1 evidence, it was suggested to the committee that the provision is an attempt to shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. That has never been our intention and I am pleased to see that the committee's report accepts that the provision would not have that effect. We acknowledge, however, that some of the words in the bill could be used to be imply that a burden has been placed on the accused. We will consider that wording carefully and see whether a stage 2 amendment might be needed in order to <place-holder colnum=\"3988\"/> dispel that ambiguity.</p><p>Some concerns have also been expressed about the range of offences to which the bill applies. The Equality Network has made some good points about the treatment of homosexual offences. We are committed to ensuring that the bill does not have a discriminatory impact based on sexual orientation. There are some practical problems with certain aspects of the Equality Network's suggested amendments. However, we intend to lodge an Executive amendment at stage 2 to deal with the issues that have been raised.</p><p>In the consultation document \"Redressing the Balance: Cross-Examination in Rape and Sexual Offence Trials\", we sought views on whether an accused's previous convictions for sexual offences should automatically go before the court following a successful application to lead character or sexual history evidence about the complainer. Large numbers of consultees backed that proposal. However, arguments were made in opposition to it. At the time that the bill was drafted, it was felt that such a provision could be too sweeping and that we should consider the matter further.</p><p>After further consideration, we have decided to introduce a modified proposal. If members agree to the general principles of the bill, we will lodge an amendment at stage 2 that will require the judge, following a successful application by the accused to lead evidence about the complainer's past, to consider whether any previous sexual offence convictions of the accused should be disclosed.</p><p>A presumption will be made in favour of disclosure, but it will be open to the accused to overturn that by satisfying the court that revealing his or her record would be contrary to the interests of justice. The normal presumption of innocence will apply in relation to the offence being tried, and it will be for the prosecution to convince the jury of the accused's guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.</p><p>Under current law, it is open to the court to grant a prosecution application to admit evidence of the accused's previous convictions when the defence has attacked the complainer's character. However, members of the Justice 2 Committee will be aware from Professor Gane's evidence to them that that provision is rarely used in sexual offence trials.</p><p>In the months preceding this debate, concerns have been voiced about whether the bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights. Such compatibility is a fundamental requirement of our legislative process.</p><p>At the heart of most human rights issues lies a balance that must be struck. The bill is no different. Article 6.3(c) of the convention confers on an accused the right<place-holder colnum=\"3989\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing\".</p><p>The question is whether that gives him an absolute right to conduct his defence personally. In our view, it does not.</p><p>The body of case law that the European Court of Human Rights has built up suggests that a rule that requires an accused to be legally represented is usually regarded as legitimate. It is clear that limitations on the rights conferred by article 6.3(c) may be justified by circumstances that make them appropriate in the interests of justice. Such circumstances may arise when the accused's rights under article 6 must be balanced against the rights of others under the convention.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13260590", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a short but important bill, whereby the Executive fulfils a commitment to improve significantly the way victims of sexual crimes are treated in our criminal justice system, while still ensuring that those accused of such crimes receive a fair trial.

Such a confrontation is unnecessary for a fair trial.

The genesis of the bill needs little explanation. The terrorists who struck at New York struck at us all. They killed without discrimination, and those who died were men, women and children of all ages and of many nationalities, races, and religious and political persuasions. It was truly an act of terror.</p><p>Tragically, we are not strangers to acts of terrorism. However, 11 September saw the manifestation of a threat of terrorism of a scale, audacity, single-mindedness, global reach and disruptiveness that we have not previously faced. It is therefore right that we respond not only to the actual act, but to the threat of similar outrages. The recent advances that have been made in Afghanistan do not diminish that imperative; indeed, they may arguably increase it.</p><p>On this issue, we walk a fine and difficult line. We aspire to tolerance and respect for all and to uphold fundamental civil liberties. However, to do so, we must deal with those who exploit our liberties with threats to life and limb. I do not say that that is easy; however, it is inescapable.</p><p>The Executive believes that the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill is a proportionate response to the events of 11 September. It is not a wholesale revision of our legal and security framework, but a collection of carefully targeted improvements.</p><p>The bill has a number of strands. First, it enhances information disclosure to aid policing and prosecution; it enhances financial controls in much the same way as the Proceeds of Crime Bill; <place-holder colnum=\"3840\"/> and it strengthens existing asylum and immigration powers. Secondly, the bill contains new criminal offences on religious hatred, corruption, weapons of mass destruction, associated hoaxes, and failure to disclose information about terrorist offences.</p><p>Thirdly, the bill requires enhanced security for the storage of pathogens, civil nuclear installations, and airports, which form the tools and targets of the new terrorism. Fourthly, the bill enhances policing, with new powers on DNA and fingerprint evidence; an extended jurisdiction for British Transport and Ministry of Defence police; and extended access to passenger information. Finally, the bill allows for fast-track implementation of any European Union agreements on justice and home affairs.</p><p>I will now deal with the devolved provisions that we recommend be included in the Westminster bill and those that we propose to exclude. That is the purpose of our debate this morning; we are not debating aspects of the bill that are clearly reserved and would, in any circumstances, be a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament. That is why the SNP amendment is not appropriate.</p><p>Our rationale for a Sewel motion is essentially pragmatic. We do not think it acceptable to delay these matters until the introduction of the criminal justice bill next year, and we do not think that emergency legislation of our own is appropriate for proposals that are unlikely to differ on either side of the border. It is right to move quickly and, as far as possible, on a common UK front.</p><p>We recommend that the enabling power on EU criminal measures be extended to Scotland, which will allow Scottish Ministers to introduce secondary legislation on devolved, criminal, police and judicial co-operation initiatives. That safeguards this Parliament's role and strikes the right balance between parliamentary scrutiny and the ability to legislate quickly when necessary.</p><p>We recommend that the bill's provisions on dangerous substances be extended to Scotland, which will make it an offence for a person to use nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological or any other noxious substance, or to threaten to do so.</p><p>We recommend that the bill's provisions on disclosure of information be extended to Scotland. The provisions will enable Government departments and other public authorities to disclose information for possible criminal investigations or proceedings. The Parliament has already passed a Sewel motion on this in relation to the Criminal Justice and Police Bill. However, the measures were dropped and are now being reintroduced with some modifications.</p><p>We recommend that the new powers relating to the security of premises holding harmful <place-holder colnum=\"3841\"/> substances be extended to Scotland. The powers are primarily designed to address security arrangements at laboratories where there are stocks of potentially dangerous substances such as viruses, bacteria and toxins. The substances will be specified in secondary legislation and examples of the new controls are given in the memorandum that accompanies the Sewel motion.</p><p>We recommend that the new police powers on passenger information be extended to Scotland, which would enable the police to request information in relation to ships and aircraft arriving anywhere in the UK from any other country. The current powers are limited to travel between the UK mainland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>We recommend that the extension of powers for the MOD and British Transport police be extended to Scotland. That would extend their jurisdiction so that they could assist other police forces on request. Members will recall that the Parliament previously approved this approach for the MOD police, but the proposals were subsequently dropped from the Armed Forces Bill.</p><p>We recommend making use of the bill to allow fingerprints and samples that are taken under Terrorism Act 2000 powers to be used in the investigation of the whole range of crime. That will ensure that links can be drawn between terrorist suspects and other criminal acts that might have terrorist connections.</p><p>I will now address the aspects of the bill that we do not wish to be extended to Scotland. First, we will pursue a distinctive approach on religious hatred. I shall chair a ministerial working group with cross-party representation and a remit to report by the end of February. The Deputy First Minister has written to invite the Commission for Racial Equality and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to participate in that group. We intend to invite others to participate and will of course consult widely. Our aim will be to ensure that any new legislation is workable and effective in the Scottish context. In the meantime, we will deal with religious hatred firmly under the current law. Religious aggravation already exists at common law in Scotland.</p><p>Furthermore, because of different rules of evidence and procedure in Scotland, we have decided to introduce international corruption provisions in our own criminal justice bill, which will be introduced next year.</p><p>Finally, we have decided not to extend to Scotland the new police powers to remove face coverings. The police in Scotland were lukewarm in their support for the proposal and pointed out that there could be practical difficulties, for <place-holder colnum=\"3842\"/> example, with some forms of traditional dress. In the circumstances, we believe that the benefits would be marginal. The UK bill will be amended to exclude Scotland from this provision.</p><p>We consider the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill to be a proportionate and carefully targeted piece of legislation. With the three exceptions that I have mentioned, we commend its extension to Scotland and I therefore invite the chamber's support for this Sewel motion.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the urgency of enhancing anti-terrorist capability and security in the current international situation and agrees that the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill specified in the Scottish Executive's memorandum that relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13260172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Earlier this week, the Government introduced the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill in the House of Commons.

Those preconditions will arise when the amount of unspent requisition money and police grant to be carried forward as a working balance, when added to existing accumulated reserves of unspent requisition money and police grant, exceeds 5 per cent of the requisition and grant received in that year.

Those years taught me the power of people in seemingly hopeless circumstances to transcend despair and make a collective effort to improve their lives and those of their families and neighbours.</p><p>Oxfam was started in the darkest of times&#8212;1942&#8212;by a handful of people determined to do something about the plight of people in occupied Europe. Indeed, sending aid to occupied Greece in 1942 was not popular with the Government of the day. The refusal to temper its humanitarian instinct to suit the circumstance has continued to characterise Oxfam throughout its life. From being the first aid agency into the nightmare of post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia to engaging in the moral maze that was Rwanda in 1994, Oxfam has never flinched from the most difficult theatres of humanitarianism. It does not do so today and, as many members have said, it is playing its part, as we speak, in the provision of aid to the people of Afghanistan.</p><p>Oxfam has long refused to respond only to emergencies. Rather, it engages with the structures of poverty and conflict that create them and is at the forefront of campaigning on issues such as debt. It is a leader in the development education movement in Scotland and I am pleased that Currie High School in my constituency is part of the sustainable schools project that Mary Mulligan referred to. Neither does Oxfam flinch from issues of poverty at home.</p><p>Oxfam's reach is astonishing. I once visited a relief programme in northern Mozambique, which saw supplies trucked from Malawi into Mozambique and back out again to Zimbabwe, where they were loaded on to the Beira railway and taken to a remote rail junction. They were then trucked to an airfield, airlifted to towns that could be reached only by air, and then trucked out again another 200km to camps that people had walked for a fortnight to reach. People who might have been thought to be geographically beyond help were not beyond Oxfam's determination to reach them.</p><p>Of course, that astonishing chain actually stretched all the way back to the groups of supporters and activists who have always been the driving force of that kind of effort. Those links are very real. Of those groups, there is no better example in Scotland than the Linlithgow Oxfam group. As we have heard, its members have raised a great deal of money but, more than that, they understand that the effectiveness of <place-holder colnum=\"3089\"/> international solidarity depends on the depth of the roots that we put down in our own communities. They have made themselves, and therefore their cause, a part of Linlithgow. They work in schools, campaign on the street and participate in annual marches&#8212;and they held their once-legendary raft races on Linlithgow loch. In contributing to the world, they contribute to their own town.</p><p>Someone once described Oxfam as a bridge of people. That is exactly what it is.

I welcome the committee's broad agreement with the general principles of the bill, although I recognise that it has some concerns about the detail. Before dealing with the matters raised by the committee, I would like to give some background about the need for the bill and to set it in context. It would probably be easier if I deal with each service in turn and, if I may, I shall begin with the police.</p><p>As I am sure members are aware, the police are funded differently from other local authority services. Each force has a police authority or joint police board, which has responsibility for setting force budgets. The Scottish Executive pays a grant of 51 per cent to cover eligible police expenditure up to a cash limit. Joint police boards then requisition the balance from their constituent local authorities or, in the case of unitary police authorities, from the local authority.</p><p>Until 1996, the Scottish Office set a maximum number of police officers for each force, and police grant was paid at 51 per cent of all eligible police costs. Since then, the controls on police officer numbers have been removed, and police grant has been paid up to a cash limit. That change has given chief constables and police authorities more freedom to manage their budgets. However, it has left the police facing something of a quandary. As an emergency service, they have to keep in hand sufficient reserves to enable them to meet unusual demands, but at present they are obliged to return any money unspent at the end of each financial year. That creates a pressure to rush to spend money at the end of the year to avoid its being lost to the force.</p><p>In November 1998, the Accounts Commission for Scotland and HM inspectorate of constabulary investigated police funding and published a report called \"Credit to the Force\". Among other things, it concluded that better value would be obtained if forces could carry forward a working balance from <place-holder colnum=\"2971\"/> year to year. The report argued that working balances, in conjunction with greater stability in funding, would make the financial planning process more efficient and effective. The report suggested that the amount that could be carried forward should be limited to 3 per cent of a force's annual budget.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258219", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Local Government Committee for its careful consideration of the Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill and for its report, which provides a considered assessment of the issues that arise from that small, but quite intricate, piece of legislation.

The reason for making similar proposals for the fire service and the police service is a matter that, if Richard Lochhead is willing to wait, I shall come to later in my speech.</p><p>As members will know, we have introduced three-year budgets for local authorities, including the police service, giving the stability sought by the \"Credit to the Force\" report. The ability to manage spends at the end of each year is of even greater significance if forces have to budget for three years at a time, so that underspends in one year can be compensated for in the next. In fact, we have gone beyond the recommendation in \"Credit to the Force\" and have allowed joint police boards to accumulate balances year on year. I shall return to that point later.</p><p>The bill amends the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 to make provision for the carry-forward of working balances. Section 1(1) of the bill deals with the carry-forward of unspent police funds by joint police boards. It does so by amending the 1967 act to require the amalgamation orders that set up the boards to make provision with regard to the payment by the constituent authorities of the amounts that the joint police board estimates will be incurred.</p><p>Section 1(2) of the bill amends the 1967 act to ensure that both joint police boards and unitary police authorities can carry forward unspent police grant. At present police grant is paid after an order is laid under section 32 of the 1967 act before the beginning of each financial year. That order is redetermined to show the actual grant paid after the end of the financial year when actual figures are known. The bill ensures that, given the approval of ministers, boards will be able to carry forward police grant.</p><p>I mentioned the origin of the proposals in the report \"Credit to the Force\". As Mr Lochhead correctly pointed out, that report related only to the <place-holder colnum=\"2972\"/> police. However, it would have been remiss of us not to have regard to the read-across to the fire service. Many of the same considerations apply and we have therefore included provisions in the bill relating to the carry-forward of working balances by joint fire boards. No equivalent to police grant is payable to fire authorities so, to that extent, the provision for joint fire boards is shorter. Apart from that, and some minor adjustments to the existing legislation in respect of administration schemes, the provision for those boards has the same effect as the provision for joint police boards.</p><p>Part of the answer to Mr Lochhead's question is that a unitary fire authority with a single local authority would be able to carry forward using the other arrangements for local authorities to carry forward; however, where a joint board is in place, the proposed legislation would be required to allow that carry-forward too. The fire service is, of course, also an emergency service and, although most of the imperative for the legislation came from the police side, it seemed right to mirror arrangements for the fire service.</p><p>I hope that members will understand that the bill's intention is to provide for better financial management, to avoid a rush to spend at the end of each year in particular, and to underpin the three-year budgeting cycle that has been introduced. The bill is a sensible amendment to existing legislation and the Local Government Committee's report commends the general principles of the bill. I hope that the report's conclusions will be endorsed by Parliament today.</p><p>The committee had some concerns about the constraints in the bill. If the bill becomes law, there will be issues about the building-up of large balances and the impact on local taxation of not returning unspent requisitions to local authorities. Consequently, some safeguards have been built into the bill.</p><p>The first safeguard is that balances can be carried forward only with the consent of the constituent authority whose contribution constitutes, or is part of, the money that is intended to be carried forward. Secondly, any proposal to carry forward requisitioned funds or police grant should have the consent of the Scottish ministers. In addition, as discussed earlier, there is a 3 per cent limit on the amount that can be carried forward from individual years, although that carry-forward can be accumulated year on year.</p><p>The committee, and many of the witnesses who gave evidence, had some difficulty with the first safeguard. The fear was that if a single authority opted out of carrying forward its share of any underspend, the difficulties caused would undermine the whole principle of the bill. The <place-holder colnum=\"2973\"/> proposal was introduced to protect the position of individual authorities since, at present, any unspent requisitions are returned to them in full. We have carefully considered the committee's report and the evidence submitted by the witnesses and concluded that the provision could be removed from the bill. We will lodge an amendment to that effect at stage 2, assuming that members approve the motion.</p><p>The committee was also concerned about the need for ministerial consent before a carry-forward could take place. Again, we have carefully considered the committee's report and the evidence submitted; however, we still think that there is a case for involving ministers and I will explain why.</p><p>As I mentioned, we have gone beyond the recommendations in \"Credit to the Force\". The bill as drafted allows authorities to accumulate carried-forward amounts and so build up large balances to meet anticipated financial pressures. The ability to build up reserves may have an impact on local council tax levels and we therefore think that some sort of safeguard is necessary. However, we acknowledge that misuse of the facility is unlikely and we do not wish to get involved in day-to-day police and fire board issues. Some witnesses expressed concerns about the time that it might take to get the ministerial consent that is required. We therefore propose to allow boards blanket consent to carry forward balances without reference to the justice department, except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>The details have yet to be worked out but, for example, automatic consent might be based on the accumulated amount not exceeding, say, 5 per cent of that year's budget. That approach would give the boards the certainty they need, but protect the interests of taxpayers at both national and local level. That is a significant qualification, and I hope that committee members in particular will agree that it is one that goes a long way towards meeting the concerns raised about that provision.</p><p>Some people have argued that the provision is not necessary because, at least in the case of police grant, the Executive can react to excessive reserves by simply reducing the amount of police grant available in subsequent years. Fire boards could apply the same approach to any reserves accumulated by brigades. However, I think that most of us would agree that it is better to avoid difficult situations arising rather than to apply sanctions later in the process.</p><p>There is another reason why ministerial consent is important, particularly in relation to the police. Given that police grant and local authority requisitions are treated separately, it would be possible for a board to deliberately set a budget <place-holder colnum=\"2974\"/> above its requirements, draw down police grant and then carry forward police grant, but not requisitions. That would distort the balance between police grant and local authority expenditure. I do not want to suggest for a moment that that kind of devious machination is likely, but safeguards should be put in place to stop it occurring.</p><p>The final safeguard is a limit of 3 per cent on the amount that can be carried forward. That limit is based on the recommendation in \"Credit to the Force\". The limit may prove generous or restrictive in practice, but it can be varied by means of a statutory instrument subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p><p>In conclusion, we think that the bill is sensible and that it will help financial management in the police and fire services. I am glad that the Local Government Committee approves the general principles of the bill.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258219", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The limit on carry-forward carries with it an element of control.

That announcement generated a good deal of comment, reinforcing the importance of the subject and justifying the devotion of parliamentary time to it today.</p><p>On the basis of the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into our domestic law, any punishment that constitutes \"inhuman or degrading treatment\" can never now be acceptable under Scots law. Our proposals seek to clarify what that means in practice.</p><p>Let me begin with a crucial piece of clarification that has, I fear, been missed by some commentators. We are not proposing to ban smacking. Our consultation paper did not propose a ban, the responses did not show a majority opinion in favour of a ban and our announcement confirmed that position. Our intention is to clarify the law and to set clearer guidelines for the courts and parents. In particular, we do not think that parents should have a right to hit very young children, to hit children with implements, to shake them or to strike them on the head.</p><p>The right to administer reasonable physical punishment to children who are old enough to understand what is happening will remain. Parents who use physical punishment as part of a principled and caring system of family discipline have nothing to fear from our proposals. That right will extend to anybody who has control of a child in the child's own home. Parents will be free to set the ground rules for discipline in the home, just as they are at present.</p><p>Most of us face difficult, daunting and even scary times in our lives. For those of us who have children, parenting often seems to be the single most scary and difficult role that we undertake. The decisions that we have to take from day to day, particularly in respect of very young children, can have far-reaching effects.</p><p>We are often told that children need role models. They need to learn from their role models that <place-holder colnum=\"2499\"/> violence is not the right way to get other people to do what they want. A balance must be struck between acceptable intervention by the state for the welfare of children, and the freedom of parents to use their own good judgement. That balance is not new in this country. It was established in the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937. That act has stood the test of time and it makes it quite clear that cruelty towards or neglect of a child is an offence, but it does not interfere with a parent's right to administer reasonable chastisement. We are not proposing to change that. The only area in which we propose a complete ban is in respect of children up to and including the age of two. The reaction to that in some quarters has been extraordinary.</p><p>I ask members to reflect for a moment on what is meant by punishment. Punishment is designed to signal disapproval of wrong actions by inflicting retribution on the person who has done wrong. It might, incidentally, also be designed to rehabilitate and deter, but its primary purpose is retribution. It is quite wrong to punish someone who can understand neither that they have done wrong, nor the relationship between the punishment and the wrongdoing.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13256947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children (Physical Chastisement)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last week, we announced the results of our consultation on the physical punishment of children.

Having reflected on the matter, I am now persuaded that the most suitable course of action&#8212;and that which is most consistent with domestic procedure&#8212;is to remove the provisions in section 12(4) that refer to consent being given by an appropriate person to questioning on behalf of another person. The effect of amendment 43 is that only the person to be questioned can give consent. I have also given consideration to the amendment 47, in the name of Christine Grahame. Although I sympathise with its intentions, I am not inclined to agree in this instance that it represents the best way forward.</p><p>Our objectives are twofold: to fulfil our obligations to provide assistance to the ICC; and to reflect as far as is practicable similar domestic arrangements, where such arrangements exist. In that respect, what amendment 43 proposes does not differ significantly from what takes place daily in Scotland. For example, any suspect may be advised that they are to be questioned, but that they are not bound to answer. Furthermore, if it is thought that questioning by the police has been carried out in an unfair manner, it is highly likely that it will not be admissible in court in evidence thereafter.</p><p>The same will apply to questioning undertaken at the behest of the ICC and will be covered by its regulations on admissibility. For example, article 69 of the Rome statute states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Evidence obtained by means of a violation of this Statute or internationally recognised human rights shall not be admissible\".</p><p>Attempting to define exactly the circumstances in which a person can give consent to questioning not only is unnecessary for the reasons I have just outlined, but might be unworkable in practice. The High Court has consistently declined to set out exactly when a person is considered incapable. Each case must be considered on its merits. Any attempt to provide a fixed definition to be applied in all circumstances could have the unintentional effect of obstructing our obligation to provide assistance to the ICC.</p><p>It is worth pointing out what usually happens in Scotland&#8212;under this bill or any other similar domestic circumstances&#8212;if the police wish to question an individual who is thought, for example, to have a mental disorder. The relevant details are to be found in the current Scottish appropriate <place-holder colnum=\"2440\"/> adult scheme, which was introduced in June 1998 by the then Scottish Office. That code of practice, which is based on a multi-agency, non-statutory model, gives comprehensive guidance on such matters, and I believe that it accounts for the legitimate concerns that were raised by the Justice 2 Committee during its stage 2 consideration.</p><p>For instance, the guidance specifies that if the officer in charge of the investigation detects signs of mental disorder in the interviewee, he or she must arrange for a medical examination to establish whether an interview can take place. If the interview does proceed, an appropriate adult, as defined by the code, is to be present to ensure, among other things, that the interviewee understands the questions being put to him or her and the implications of their answers.</p><p>As a result, I am satisfied that if members accept amendment 43, section 12 will allow us both to fulfil our obligations under the Rome statute and to retain consistency with current domestic procedure and&#8212;given the key issue in this regard&#8212;that of admissibility of evidence before the competent court.</p><p>I move amendment 43.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13256695", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 12 &#8212; Questioning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members of the Justice 2 Committee will recall that, during our stage 2 discussion of the bill on 26 June, I agreed to reconsider the provisions in section 12(4).

The most important tradition is the principle that territorial jurisdiction is central to the prosecution of crimes in Scotland. In Scots law, criminal jurisdiction is based on the territorial principle. In the absence of legislation to the contrary, the jurisdiction of the Scottish criminal courts is limited to crimes that are committed in Scotland.</p><p>That jurisdiction has been changed in a number of instances that lend argument to the Executive's position. Two statutes that extend jurisdiction of the Scottish courts to offences that are committed outwith Scotland are the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Sex Offenders Act 1997, section 8 of which inserted section 16B into the 1995 act. That level of jurisdiction is contained in the International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill. Perhaps more relevantly, universal jurisdiction as described by Christine Grahame is taken through the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and section <place-holder colnum=\"2427\"/> 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which provides for the prosecution of the offence of torture committed in the UK or elsewhere by a public official of any nationality. The key point is that in the two latter instances, universal jurisdiction was taken in UK law specifically because it was required by international agreement. That is not the situation in respect of the Rome statute.</p><p>Many of Christine Grahame's examples refer to countries with a tradition of universal jurisdiction in their domestic law, which is why it has been carried through to their ratification of the Rome statute. The information is difficult to find, given that many countries have not yet ratified the statute. Switzerland, for example, was mentioned, but it has not ratified it. I understand that Australia and France will not take universal jurisdiction. Many of the 139 countries that have signed the statute have not yet ratified it and some have ratified it without domestic legislation prior to ratification. The situation is complex, but the principle is that countries stick to the principles of their own legal systems.</p><p>We are not doing the minimum required by the statute, as Christine Grahame said. Our provisions are perfectly in tune with the principles and philosophy of the treaty, which attempts to build an international approach to dealing with instances where war crimes, for example, cannot be dealt with by domestic courts. Amendments 40 and 41 suggest that we turn our back on that consensus. Not only is such an approach impractical, it risks diverting us from the key business at hand, which is to establish and support the ICC.</p><p>There are also practical considerations. If a suspected war criminal with whom there was no Scottish connection were simply on a fleeting visit&#8212;shopping in Princes Street perhaps&#8212;can it realistically be expected that sufficient information could be gathered against them to meet the time requirements that are an important safeguard in our legal system?

A departure from the international consensus would surely constitute parochialism on our part. It is therefore important to focus on the Rome statute as our legislation moves through its final stage in the Scottish Parliament and particularly as we discuss amendments 40 and 41. After all, the main purpose of the bill is to ensure that Scotland and the United Kingdom are able to ratify the Rome statute on the international criminal court.</p><p>The statute is a carefully drafted document that was finalised only after many years of debate and discussion, so it represents the clearest expression of the thinking of the international community on how we should tackle the gravest of crimes. It envisages an approach that encourages individual countries to live up to their own responsibilities in the prosecution of war crimes and other crimes that have been committed by their own citizens. The preamble to the statute says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the International Criminal Court established under this Statute shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions\".</p><p>Therefore, national courts will retain primary jurisdiction. However, where individual countries are unable or unwilling genuinely to take action, perhaps for some of the reasons that Christine Grahame has outlined, where conflict has led to a collapse of the local judicial system, or where a dictatorial Government refuses to punish its own abuses, the statute envisages that the ICC will be established, as provided for in article 1,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to exercise its jurisdiction over persons for the most serious crimes of international concern\".</p><p>That contrasts clearly with an alternative approach, which the international community might have chosen to take, whereby ratifying countries would ensure that they had universal jurisdiction to deal with war criminals no matter where they were found or where the crimes occurred. Had that approach been taken, the need for the international criminal court itself would have been much less clear. That was explicitly not the consensus.</p><p>Nowhere does the statute stipulate that individual countries should head down the path of prosecuting individuals who have no connection to them.

That work has been developed by the national group to address domestic abuse in Scotland, which met earlier this month under the chairpersonship of Margaret Curran.

As the Justice 1 Committee convener said, it is the first bill to be promoted by a committee, but its greater importance lies in the fact that it will give better protection to people in Scotland who are at risk from violence and abuse, no matter what their relationship to the potential abuser is.</p><p>Combating domestic abuse is an important aim and a key part of the Executive's programme, but <place-holder colnum=\"2038\"/> it is fair to say that it is driven by the Parliament as a whole. I am conscious that many of the measures that we have taken on domestic abuse had their origin in an important members' business debate early in the session. Today, we progress that agenda through the Justice 1 Committee's bill.</p><p>Domestic abuse is a key factor in social exclusion. It has an unimaginably disruptive effect on people's everyday lives, so we must offer as much protection as possible under the law to its victims. In September, our family law white paper \"Parents and Children\" set out our proposals to reform the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, to which Alasdair Morgan referred. That act protects occupancy rights for spouses and cohabitants whose home is with the abuser and allows interdicts with powers of arrest. Our proposed changes are essential to keep the act up to date. The bill goes further than the 1981 act, as the protection that the bill provides does not depend on occupancy rights, which means that any victim of abuse can benefit, whether or not she or he lives with the abuser or has ever done so.</p><p>I note in passing that the drafters of the bill have gone to great lengths to eliminate gender-based language. Although the great majority of victims of domestic violence in Scotland are women, men can also be victims. Nevertheless, it is a fact that in 92 per cent of recorded domestic abuse cases a woman is the victim of a male attacker. That was amply borne out in the evidence that the Justice and Home Affairs Committee heard last year. It is right that the bill is comprehensive.</p><p>As I said in the debate on the proposal for the bill, we commend the work of the Justice 1 Committee&#8212;formerly the Justice and Home Affairs Committee&#8212;in considering a wide range of evidence and introducing the bill. I, too, single out the contribution of Maureen Macmillan as reporter to the committee and in many ways the originator of the bill. I also pay tribute to the constructive convenership of Mr Morgan and his predecessor, Roseanna Cunningham.</p><p>To many, the distinctions between bills that are introduced by the Executive, by members and by committees may seem unimportant and an uninteresting aspect of parliamentary procedures, but members know well that a big gap exists between the resources that are available to the Executive and those that even the best-organised member can bring to a subject. The standing orders that allow committees to introduce bills are a most important and interesting innovation in the Parliament. The committees have developed their knowledge of, and experience in, particular interests. With the non-Executive bills unit, they now have the resources to give legislative effect to their policy proposals. It is no insult to the drafters <place-holder colnum=\"2039\"/> in that unit to say that we are scrutinising the drafting of the bill and that we may wish to lodge Executive amendments at stage 2. They are likely to be technical and designed to help achieve the purposes of the bill. We will consider them further over the recess.</p><p>As members will appreciate, much legislation has financial and resource implications. As I said to the Justice 1 Committee on 19 June, the Parliament and the committee will have to bear it in mind when developing policies that have financial implications that our Scottish budget is finite. Resources that are committed to one area are denied to another.</p><p>The financial memorandum that is attached to the bill estimates that if the take-up is between 2,000 and 5,000 interdicts a year, the cost will be between &#163;800,000 and &#163;2 million each year. That money will have to be found from the justice department's budget. I cannot predict the exact terms of the financial resolution that the Executive will lodge in due course, but I fully expect it to allow the bill to progress.</p><p>Compliance with the European convention on human rights has provoked a little interest this week, so members will understand that we must consider carefully legislative competence. A virtue of the bill is that it has broad coverage. We must ensure that it is not so broad as to be oppressive and that it restricts liberty or private life only in proportion to the aim of protecting others. As with all other cases, the rights of the people involved must be balanced when the bill is used.</p><p>We all agree on the objectives of the bill: to provide effective laws and to give all the people of Scotland the protection that they need from violence and abuse. We will do our best to find the means. We are delighted that the first committee bill should be so worth while. I pledge the Executive's support for the principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255624", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to give the Executive's support to the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Bill, which is an important bill in two ways.

Managing the risk that offenders pose and safeguarding the public are about protecting our communities and are crucial in creating a safer Scotland&#8212;a Scotland in which our people feel <place-holder colnum=\"2012\"/> safer because they are safer.</p><p>Community safety links all the initiatives that have been touched on this afternoon. It also underscores other work that is being done, which will interact with the proposals in the white paper.</p><p>It is important that we remain aware that the work of improving community safety does not begin and end with our proposals for high-risk offenders&#8212;of whom, as Jim Wallace indicated, there is a relatively small number in any year&#8212;nor with the review of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. We also need to help people on the ground to act and act together to improve community safety.</p><p>That is why police forces and local councils, with our support, have set up local community safety partnerships throughout Scotland&#8212;indeed, in all 32 local authority areas. Those partnerships involve the public, private and voluntary sectors working together in tackling crime. From the grass roots to the high tariffs, all measures must work towards the safety and security of our people.</p><p>The debate has rightly focused on our new proposals for serious violent and sexual offenders, which we presented in our white paper that was published on 11 June. The proposals are comprehensive and innovative. One of the key innovations in the proposals is the new body that we propose to set up: the risk management authority. That is a new approach to assessing and managing risk. The RMA will exist to ensure that best practice is followed by every agency throughout Scotland.</p><p>A number of speakers have made the point that a large range of agencies throughout Scotland have a role to play in managing and minimising risk. That is the case. No longer can we accept a situation in which pockets of excellence are isolated throughout the country. More to the point, and as Pauline McNeill made clear, no longer can we tolerate gaps in practice in the field. The RMA will have the role of spreading best practice throughout the agencies and throughout Scotland.</p><p>The point has been made on various occasions that the risk management authority may feel that the agencies with which it is working or which it is advising have difficulty in delivering what is required of them because of problems with funding. The RMA will be able to advise and recommend to the Scottish Executive specific funding that might be required to be allocated to agencies with whom it works in order for it to deliver its responsibilities. The final decision on that funding will of course remain with Scottish Executive ministers.</p><p>In discussing the risk management authority, I would like to reassure one or two members, including Roseanna Cunningham, who spoke about the status of the RMA, specifically about <place-holder colnum=\"2013\"/> the fact that it will be a non-departmental public body, that we considered very carefully the question of whether there was any other way in which to deliver our proposals effectively.</p><p>The body of course has to be efficient and effective, and has to be independent. Believe me, following what the Minister for Finance and Local Government has announced on the matter, this is not a good time to argue for the setting-up of a new NDPB, unless it is the right thing to do. In the circumstances, we believe that that is the correct way to go.</p><p>On funding, which of course is required for the RMA to work, we have budgeted &#163;3 million for the set-up and initial running costs of the RMA in 2002-03, and &#163;5 million in the following year, within the justice budget.</p><p>The RMA will be able to provide advice and guidance whenever that is needed. When it comes to the highest-risk offenders, it will be required to ensure that the multi-agency risk management plans meet the best standards.</p><p>In response to Phil Gallie, it is true that the decision on release will lie with the Parole Board, which indeed holds that function for other categories of prisoner. That will parallel the arrangements for mandatory and discretionary life prisoners, and we believe that to be the fairest approach: it guarantees the offender's rights to a regular review of his or her detention while using the Parole Board's expertise to ensure public safety. As is the case with life prisoners, either the Parole Board or Scottish ministers can recall an order-for-lifelong-restriction prisoner for breach of conditions. If the offender is recalled, the Parole Board will have to be again satisfied that he or she does not pose a high risk, before it will consider re-releasing the offender.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255568", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Violent and Sexual Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss another aspect of the Scottish Executive's work that is aimed at protecting our communities.

The risk management authority's job is to ensure that the best possible assessment of potential risk can be made, and that the best advice can be given on the measures that may be required to manage that risk. It is right and proper that the judiciary decides whether that potential risk is an argument for a particular initial sentence&#8212;an order for lifelong restriction, or OLR, for example&#8212;and it is right that the Parole Board takes the final judgment on the balance between public safety and the level of risk, as assessed by the RMA. The role of the Parole Board is, I think, the right one. We are ensuring that the board's <place-holder colnum=\"2014\"/> role is underpinned by a much more rigorous, up-to-date assessment of risk. It is about making the quality of the Parole Board's decisions even better.</p><p>It is worth remembering that the other main element of our proposals is a sentence&#8212;the OLR. It is important to remember that it is a sentence, and that it is lifelong; it is only when the punishment part of the sentence is served, and if risk has sufficiently diminished, that the offender will be released from prison. It is in the community where an important element of the proposals will be seen at work.</p><p>The offender's risk management plan will have been drafted as soon as the offender starts his or her prison sentence, and it will travel with the offender into the community. Interventions that have been offered in prison, which are both vital and exemplary&#8212;I am thinking of those offered in Peterhead, as referred to by a number of speakers&#8212;can be continued and built upon. However, firm controls will be maintained and, should licence conditions be breached, the return to custody will be swift.</p><p>Phil Gallie said that in a previous consultation on electronic monitoring only he had expressed support for it. As I have already indicated to him, the consultation on our recent pilot produced more positive results. This morning I announced that we would develop the use of electronic monitoring. Restriction of liberty orders will be rolled out as a community sentence and provision will be made for allowing the imposition of monitoring as a condition for a probation order or a drug treatment and testing order. It will also be possible to use electronic monitoring as a condition of release from custody on licence. That links in with the MacLean committee's recommendations on the use of electronic monitoring.</p><p>All the measures that I have outlined require legislation. I assure members that that will be introduced at the earliest opportunity. I mean that genuinely. When we published the white paper, some press reports suggested that all violent sexual offenders would automatically be tagged. That is not what the white paper says. Tagging is one option, depending on specific risk factors. However, we plan to frame the provisions for electronic monitoring broadly so that they can encompass new developments, such as tracking the movements of an offender, should that become feasible in the future.</p><p>Some speakers expressed concerns about the compliance of our proposals with the European convention on human rights. The human rights of the offender must, of course, be protected. That is why we are introducing checks and balances at every stage. We would never place before the Parliament legislation that we felt was not <place-holder colnum=\"2015\"/> compliant with the ECHR. Indeed, we are not permitted to do that, as members know. I assure the Parliament that we are content that these proposals fully satisfy human rights requirements.</p><p>Concern has been expressed about the fact that the risk assessment will be able to include the facts of previous acquittals and allegations of criminality. However, presenting those facts is crucial to getting the most accurate picture of risk possible, which is in everyone's interests. The defence can challenge any part of the risk assessment that is brought before the court. That is one of the checks and balances to which I referred. When making a decision on sentencing, the sentencing judge will disregard any evidence that has been successfully challenged.</p><p>I assure James Douglas-Hamilton that we will require any offender who is mentally disordered and may, therefore, pose a high risk during the assessment period to be assessed by means of an interim hospital order before the court makes a final disposal. That assessment will be made in hospital, in secure conditions. It will cover both the mental state of offenders and the risk that they pose, and may last for up to a year.</p><p>The public needs protection from offenders who suffer from a mental disorder. Under our proposals it will be possible for such offenders to receive a hospital direction&#8212;and therefore any medical treatment that they need&#8212;but also to be made subject to an order for lifelong restriction. Once they have been treated, they will be transferred to prison to serve any remaining part of the punishment period. They will remain there until they are no longer high risk.</p><p>Finally, I turn to today's Tory amendment. I am glad that the Conservatives were able to find the generosity to leave in the motion's welcome for the white paper. Indeed, the contributions to the debate of Phil Gallie and other Tory speakers were reasoned and constructive. However, in general, the Tory amendment is rather backward looking. It smacks of an attempt to rerun some of the arguments that Tories used during the recent general election to frighten the electorate. That certainly worked: the electorate was so frightened of the Tories that it left them firmly buried in fourth place in Scotland.</p><p>The Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 included some rushed provisions that were approved during the dog days of the previous Tory Government. By comparison&#8212;even Phil Gallie admitted this&#8212;the white paper that we are debating today is the result of rigorous and exhaustive work by the MacLean committee. It synthesises best practice from around the world with our criminal justice traditions. By setting punishment powers in open court, it ensures honesty in sentencing. Through the work of the <place-holder colnum=\"2016\"/> RMA and the Parole Board, the white paper offers the reassurance sought by the public that serious sexual and violent offenders will be dealt with justly and safely.</p><p>I commend the white paper to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255568", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Violent and Sexual Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The two bodies will have different roles.

It has been claimed that the bill was rushed through unnecessarily. However, I remind members that Jim Wallace sympathised with that point in his opening speech. It is ironic that such criticism was heard today from Roseanna Cunningham, who, during last year's debate on the legislative programme, was somewhat disparaging of the priority that had been given to the bill. The International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill is the first bill to be considered by the new Justice 2 Committee, which was set up to try to expedite business. It is therefore not true to say that no measures have been taken to address the problems of timing.</p><p>As many members have said, the bill is complex. It needed careful preparation and involves complicated cross-border provisions. Moreover, it followed the UK bill for good reasons. <place-holder colnum=\"1609\"/></p><p>The two bills together had to provide a watertight package throughout the UK and, in preparing the Scottish bill, we have been able to take account of relevant developments in the passage of the UK bill. I see nothing wrong in that, as this is legislation for the world&#8212;the world that we live in, not the one that Opposition members would like to see. I agree with Phil Gallie, if only because that gives me the chance to say how pleased I am to see him back here with us, where he belongs.</p><p>As I said, we have some sympathy with the point about the tight timetable. Nevertheless, as many members have indicated, that is at least partly a consequence of the requirement for the UK to be among the first 60 nations to ratify the treaty. The Executive's desire for us to be among those first 60 nations comes not simply from our wish to express political willingness or to secure good public relations in playing our part in ratifying the treaty; the first 60 nations will form the assembly of state parties that will have a key role in shaping the structures and procedures of the new court. It is therefore more than important that the UK is among the first 60 nations to ratify the treaty. Pressure has been created by the fact that many countries are ratifying the treaty more quickly than was first anticipated. That is a welcome development, but it means that we must ensure that our ratification happens as quickly as possible.</p><p>I am pleased to close this debate, as I spent many years, in my previous job, campaigning for the formation of a criminal court. In the course of that work, I saw the after-effects of war crimes and genocide&#8212;the continuing effects some 20 years after the crimes took place in Cambodia and the situation in Rwanda only a couple of months after a significant proportion of the population had been murdered and more had been displaced from the country. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid wrote of the tragedy of an unevolved people. Perhaps he had in mind something closer to home, but anyone who was in Kigali&#8212;a city emptied of its people&#8212;in late 1994 will recognise what he meant.</p><p>The truth is that tyrants stalked such countries for 50 years after the Nuremburg and Tokyo trials, secure in the knowledge that they would never be held to account. Happily, for some of them that assumption proved to be wrong. Even in Cambodia, where Pol Pot escaped trial, the likes of Khieu Samphan eventually did not. Nevertheless, the difficulty and delay in setting up the specific tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia demonstrate powerfully the need for a standing court and properly codified procedures.</p><p>We do not believe that the ICC will be some sort of panacea, as some members have said. It will not immediately put an end to war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. However, <place-holder colnum=\"1610\"/> it should be remembered that the Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals have led to a former Bosnian Serb president handing herself in and a former Rwandan prime minister pleading guilty to genocide.

We should act according to, and reflect, that consensus. Reference has been made to evidence that was given to the committee that appeared to suggest that many other countries were accepting universal jurisdiction, but the situation is less than clear. An example that has been cited repeatedly is that of Canada, whereas, in fact, Canada has opted not for full universal jurisdiction, but for jurisdiction over persons who are present in Canada. I agree that that is different from what we propose, but nonetheless it is not universal jurisdiction. We know that other countries, such as France, will not accept universal jurisdiction and we understand that Australia will adopt the same position.</p><p>Neither our legal traditions nor the obligations that are placed on us by our international agreements support the arguments for universal jurisdiction. It is wrong to say that the bill represents the minimum standard for compliance. The Rome statute does not require domestic legislation to take jurisdiction over war criminals and many countries will ratify the statute without passing substantive domestic legislation.</p><p>In response to James Douglas-Hamilton and Phil Gallie, I point out that the combination of our domestic law and the ratification of the statute gives the reassurance that was sought. Our bill and the UK act together mean that there is no possible scenario in which the ICC would have jurisdiction over a British national or serviceman while the British courts did not. If serious allegations were made against British servicemen, the UK authorities would examine them.

I am sorry that I could not be here in November when Duncan McNeil's motion on compensation for asbestos disease sufferers was debated.</p><p>I have constituents who are suffering from asbestos-related diseases, and my sympathy goes out to all those who suffer and to their families, as well as to those who have lost people close to them through asbestos-related diseases. It is impossible to know what to say to people who are in such a position; one can only give as much help and support as possible to the campaign that they are running.</p><p>I am happy to agree with Des McNulty, that all those who were involved in securing the arrangement that is now in place&#8212;following the insolvency of Chester Street Insurance Holdings&#8212;are to be congratulated on their work. However, as Duncan McNeil said, that returns us to the latter part of the motion, which concerns the assistance that the Executive can give to prevent legal actions from being subject to delays in the courts. We must approach that issue in a way that does not interfere with the management of court business. We must leave to the courts the responsibility for deciding on the order of business and the application of procedure. Nonetheless, when we can take action we will do so. It cannot <place-holder colnum=\"1140\"/> be denied that there is scope for such cases reaching conclusions more quickly, which would be commensurate with the interests of justice.</p><p>Many of the cases that we are discussing are not easy to resolve when they reach court. We must accept&#8212;as Des McNulty does&#8212;that employers have a right to defend against claims for compensation. The medical issues can also be complicated, and there is often more than one employer involved. Moreover, some claims relate to employment of 50 or more years ago and it is difficult to establish who was doing what for which employer at that time. Both sides must cope with those complexities, but it cannot be denied that the time that is taken to deal with such matters adds to the distress of sufferers.</p><p>Nonetheless, the interests of sufferers and of employers alike require all reasonable steps to be taken to make the facts as clear as possible for the court. That should not, however, be taken as an excuse for prevarication; nor should it be used as an attempt to cause deliberate delay, such as would cause sufferers to give up on their claims. It would be even worse if the delay were to extend beyond the tragic death of some of the sufferers.</p><p>The use of blanket denials by employers has been criticised as a cause of delay. It was criticised most recently in a petition from Frank Maguire, who is a solicitor advocate, and Harry McCluskey, of Clydeside Action on Asbestos, which was submitted to the Public Petitions Committee. That petition is&#8212;as Mrs Ewing said&#8212;being considered by the Justice 2 Committee. Lord Coulsfield's proposals for the reform of procedure in reparation actions, which I shall mention again in a moment, would result in less reliance on the written case and would put more emphasis on the disclosure of material issues such as medical reports and the value of the claim. In either event, in the case of a blanket denial, employers would leave themselves open to an application for a summary decree on the ground that a defence to the action has not been disclosed. I encourage pursuers to make best use of that remedy.</p><p>I would also like appropriate use to be made by pursuers of interim and provisional awards of damages so that, at the very least, suitable arrangements for the care of sufferers can be made pending the determination of cases by the courts.</p><p>Although the management of claims by courts is, as I said, a matter for the courts, there is no reason why those cases cannot be dealt with reasonably expeditiously. Indeed, the issue of how to process reparation cases has already been the subject of thorough consideration under the direction of Lord Coulsfield. Lord Coulsfield's proposals, which are at present under <place-holder colnum=\"1141\"/> consideration by the Court of Session's rules council, involve the courts taking a more active part in ensuring that time limits for case preparation are adhered to. The proposals also include a proposal to set dates for hearing cases much earlier in the proceedings than is done at the moment. The proposals also call for fuller disclosure of the position of defenders or employers, particularly with regard to the value that they would place on a claim, assuming that liability to pay compensation was not an issue. The point of that is to encourage parties to settle earlier, because over 90 per cent of cases ultimately settle without evidence being heard. The Executive has previously stated its support for the comprehensive package of procedural reform that is proposed by Lord Coulsfield and I do so again today.</p><p>One of Lord Coulsfield's other recommendations is that pursuers' offers should be reintroduced. A pursuer's offer is an offer to settle a case for a specified sum which, if it is not accepted by the defender, could have significant consequences for the amount of legal expenses that are awarded against the defender if the court subsequently awards the pursuer the sum that was offered, or a higher sum. Those offers provide an important inducement to employers to settle claims and that recommendation also has our support. However, primary legislation is required to extend the rule-making powers of the Court of Session to enable the necessary procedure rules to be put in place. We will consider how that might best be achieved.</p><p>The rules and administrative practices of the Court of Session, where most of the cases are heard, allow 13 weeks for the parties to state their case in written pleadings, and then 19 weeks to prepare for a proof or jury trial. As members will know, that 19-week period is a target that is agreed between the Lord President and ministers. Accordingly, the court should be ready to hear those cases after about 32 weeks, which I consider to be sufficient time for even the most complex issues to be properly addressed.</p><p>That said, I am aware that most cases take longer than 32 weeks&#8212;often considerably longer&#8212;to reach a conclusion. That is usually because the court has been persuaded on the application of one of the parties that it is in the interests of justice to allow more time for case preparation. The reasons for that can be many, but the court must be alive to the need to weed out applications that are simply delaying tactics.</p><p>In response to earlier representations that were made in previous debates&#8212;which have been referred to this evening&#8212;I say that the Executive is exploring with the Lord President what further action might be taken to expedite the cases, consistent with the recommendations of Lord <place-holder colnum=\"1142\"/> Coulsfield's report. That is further demonstration of our determination to act where we can.</p><p>I ask Parliament to note the support that the Executive is already providing to improve arrangements for the management of claims by the court, while respecting the independence of our judiciary and the reliance that we place on it to uphold the interests of justice. We will continue in those efforts because there is no doubt that asbestos disease sufferers deserve justice.<place-holder time=\"17:04:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:04.</em></p>", "hdate": "2001-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13253035", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chester Street Insurance Holdings Ltd"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to speak in the debate.

I will take a moment to explain why the Executive has taken that approach.</p><p>At present, in Northern Ireland, the release of a life prisoner is a matter for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There is no system of judicial tariffs in relation to discretionary lifers and under-18 murderers as there is in Scotland. However, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is in the process of changing the law in Northern Ireland to provide that, in future, discretionary lifers, under-18 murderers and adult mandatory life prisoners are given a judicial tariff that is fixed in open court. It is expected that the order making those changes&#8212;the draft Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001&#8212;will be made soon.</p><p>The changes to the law in Northern Ireland mean that, in future, Scottish ministers will be in a position to accept restricted or unrestricted transfers from Northern Ireland on the following basis. Restricted transfer prisoners with a judicial tariff set in open court will remain subject to Northern Ireland law and will retain the judicial tariff that was set there. Unrestricted transfer prisoners with a judicial tariff set in open court in Northern Ireland will have that tariff treated as if it were a punishment part set by a Scottish court, unless it is a whole-life tariff. Amendment 2 deals in the same way with discretionary life detainees from the Isle of Man.</p><p>The new section 10A(3) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, which is inserted by section 3(1A) currently applies only to prisoners who are released on compassionate grounds in England and Wales. The effect of that is that, on transfer to Scotland, the offender will have a punishment part set by the High Court if he is recalled to custody and the Parole Board does not order his immediate release.</p><p>Amendment 3 extends the provision to prisoners who are released on compassionate grounds in Northern Ireland. During stage 2, I advised the Justice 1 Committee that provision would be <place-holder colnum=\"1099\"/> required to bring such prisoners into the new system, but that it would be held back until stage 3, in the hope that the draft Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 would have been made. Unfortunately, that has not happened yet, so the exact provisions of the legislation, which the bill should specify, are not yet settled. Amendments 2 and 3 give the Scottish ministers a power to identify the relevant provisions of Northern Ireland legislation by subordinate legislation when that is possible.</p><p>Amendment 41 inserts the relevant Isle of Man and Northern Ireland provisions into section 10(5) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, which provides that a transferred lifer who is serving two or more life sentences will not be released until he has served the punishment part of both sentences.</p><p>Amendment 21 is technical.</p><p>I move amendment 2.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13252921", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 3 &#8212; Amendment of provisions relating to transferred life prisoners"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Amendment 2 re-enacts the whole of section 10(1) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 to make the provision easier to read.

The problem with drug driving, as Mr Gallie probably knows, is the lack of a reliable roadside test, but we are investing in a pilot of a potential roadside test so that we can treat this crime with the seriousness that it deserves. That is the most important thing.</p><p>Mr Gallie also made the point that he often makes about sentencing meaning what it says. I was surprised that he talked about that in the <place-holder colnum=\"972\"/> context of the forthcoming debate on the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Bill. Mr Gallie acknowledged in previous debates that the bill will introduce punishment parts that the judiciary will set, which are, in essence, sentences that mean what they say. However, he repeated this morning that the Conservatives would continue to oppose the bill.</p><p>Richard Lochhead spoke, as he has done before, of the north-east's potential as a site for a pilot drug court. We have discussed the reasons for Glasgow being our first-line pilot, but I reassure Mr Lochhead that I was with the drugs action team in Aberdeen earlier this week and that we discussed at some length the possibilities for using Aberdeen for a further pilot. That is not to say that we will be able to use it, but Mr Lochhead can be assured that the arguments were put at some length in Aberdeen.</p><p>Gordon Jackson made what was perhaps the most important point of a short debate when he said that we should not, and cannot, be complacent about our prosecution service and the operation of our courts. If we are serious about finding answers to make improvements, those answers are likely to be complex. I will give two quick examples. Members have talked about cases that are marked for no proceedings on a time-expiry basis. Most cases that fail on that basis stem from the problem of late reporting of case to the procurator fiscal and the overwhelming majority of such cases are reported by agencies other than the police or the Executive. We must address that issue, which does not relate to staffing or resources in the Procurator Fiscal Service.</p><p>Members have mentioned cases that are lost through delays. Such cases form a small proportion of the cases in which challenges have been made. That delay follows a change in the law. We must address that in different ways. The Scottish criminal justice system works with the most demanding time scales of any criminal justice system in Europe and perhaps the world. It is a tribute to the effectiveness of the system that we meet those time scales in all but a small minority of cases. The Executive's amendment is neither hand-washing nor complacent. It is simply good sense on a serious matter.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13252469", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Justice 2 Committee will probably examine, and take evidence on, the structure of the service.

Of course, one of the themes of that movie was that, by changing slightly the way in which one approaches the recurring day, one will eventually move forward into the next day. I see that the SNP has entered into that spirit as today's debate features a change of emphasis. However, many of the criticisms that Ms Cunningham has made today were made in previous debates. Her speech did not say anything particularly different, so we are unlikely to break through into the new tomorrow.</p><p>Nonetheless, we are happy to take the opportunity to debate our justice system for the same reason as we were happy to do so before. Working to make Scotland a place where people are safer and feel safer is a priority for us. To deliver that priority, we have to build public confidence in the justice system.</p><p>The public view the system of justice as a whole and judge it based on how they feel it serves to protect them. There are some encouraging indicators. The Scottish crime survey shows that, since 1992, the proportion of people feeling unsafe walking alone in their area after dark has fallen from 39 per cent to 28 per cent. Between 1996 and 2000, the public's level of concern about crime fell across all the survey measures. The resources that the Scottish Executive continues to put into the whole justice system are bringing results in helping to increase that confidence in the system.</p><p>I appreciate that neither our amendment nor Roseanna Cunningham's motion refers to the number of police. Of course, the police are the front line of the criminal justice system. In any case, I can hardly believe that Phil Gallie will be able to resist using the rewind and replay buttons on his own ludicrous spin on police cuts. In order to get in first, I will point out that police funding is 35 per cent higher in real terms than it was 10 years ago. The number of police officers in Scotland has reached an all-time high of 15,149. The figure in March 1997 was 14,872. There are no police cuts, and we have the first indication of resources being used to bolster confidence in the justice system.</p><p>Not only the police have more resources. The number of permanent sheriffs has increased from 100 in 1995 to 129 at the end of 2000. That is another record, and that number will increase again to 136 once we have the recommendations of the recent selection board. We have also created a new statutory office of part-time sheriff to replace the temporary sheriffs, and 31 part-time sheriffs are already making a contribution to tackling delays. We have increased the number of judges from 27 to 32. It is true that the courts are under pressure. In particular, solemn business is increasing; for example, the number of indictments <place-holder colnum=\"951\"/> in the High Court increased from 1,151 to 1,478 in the single year between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, an increase of 28 per cent.</p><p>More police and clear-up rates the like of which have not been seen since the second world war mean that more criminals are being caught. That has obvious consequences for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which is already coping with the consequences of historical underfunding through the 1980s and 1990s. New initiatives also put pressure on courts, which is why, for example, in introducing a drug court to Scotland, we are careful to provide the additional resources to Glasgow sheriff court in order to allow that to happen. We want to ensure that the historical underfunding that has afflicted the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service remains entirely historical.</p><p>A general process of strengthening Crown Office resources is under way, and will continue. The provision for 2001-02 is &#163;55 million, which is 17.8 per cent higher than that for 1997. Recent claims in the press that there have been repeated cuts are simply untrue. In real terms, there will be an increase of around 11 per cent between now and 2003-04.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham acknowledged that more staff are being recruited and trained, including 20 additional lawyers this year and a further 10 next year. That is on top of the fact that the Crown Office now employs 369 lawyers, as of today, compared with 250 in January 1997. The service is also introducing improved technology, which will give it a powerful tool for dealing with an ever more complex work load. That new technology will allow information to be transmitted and exchanged more efficiently in the criminal justice system.</p><p>Public confidence in the criminal justice system is influenced by the way in which the system treats not just the accused but, above all, the victims. That is why the Scottish strategy for victims has been allocated resources to initiate action on the ground. Among its early achievements has been the completion of a major phase of the witness service in sheriff courts. That service provides general advice and support to people attending court, and has now been rolled out to courts in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. This year, &#163;860,000 has been provided through Victim Support Scotland.</p><p>The Crown Office is running pilots of its own victim liaison service, which is designed to make improvements in the flow of information to victims. That service will be operating in all regions by 2002.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee intends to undertake a proper review of those matters, which will take <place-holder colnum=\"952\"/> something like a year. We welcome that, and think that it is quite right and proper to wait and see what the committee's recommendations are.</p><p>It seems that the real purpose of today's hour-and-a-quarter debate is not to address those issues seriously. The truth is that we have to finish this debate early, because Roseanna Cunningham has a bus to catch to get to a press conference, for which today's debate is just the opener. That is not a proper use of this Parliament; it is no way to treat a Parliament, but that is not a surprise.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-1958.1, to leave out from \"with concern\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the increased resources going into the justice system as a whole; further notes the decision of the Justice 2 Committee to hold an inquiry into the operation of the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service, and looks forward to their report.\"</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13252469", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I admit that, when I first saw the SNP's choice of topic for today's debate, I was a little surprised because, as Roseanna Cunningham admitted, the last time that we debated issues relating to justice, she complained bitterly of the \"Groundhog Day\"   feeling.

Some members spoke as if any police officer who was not out walking a traditional beat was not doing a worthwhile job. That is not true. The other officers are not doing office work, because we have provided for a record number of civilian staff to free even more officers for front-line work. Some officers are in the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, which has made more than <place-holder colnum=\"296\"/> 100 major arrests and seized drugs with a street value in excess of &#163;15 million in the past year.</p><p>Other officers are in domestic abuse units or child abuse units and are targeting the crime that the Parliament has demanded should be a priority. Those officers are doing the work that Gil Paterson was right to say is desperately needed to address such crimes. Other officers are policing road traffic and saving lives, or undertaking a range of prevention duties, not only with schools and clubs, but with many agencies. Many police officers are gathering the intelligence that allows front-line officers to be deployed to the greatest effect. Are not they also front-line officers? Some are undercover and are risking their lives to infiltrate criminal networks. They are not visible, but are not they on the front line? We owe them a debt of gratitude. We should not belittle them for not being bobbies on the beat.</p><p>It seems to suit some Opposition members to talk down Scotland as being in a \"Blade Runner\"-like nightmare of unfettered crime. They counterpoise to that a vision of the police that seems to be based on PC Murdoch in \"Oor Wullie\". We are funding the development of a 21<sup>st</sup> century police force with the Scottish intelligence database, the new control centre in Lothian and Borders, the DNA labs in Strathclyde and Tayside and the restructuring of common police services to make them more effective. A properly equipped modern police force is now delivering crime clear-up rates that have not been seen since 1940. We could be discussing priority choices, but only Richard Lochhead addressed that issue briefly when he talked about the helicopter bid from Tayside and Fife.</p><p>Sophisticated policing involves not just high technology. Grass-roots disruption of patterns of crime, problem-solving policing and partnership with other agencies are all crucial. That is why we seek ways of building community safety partnerships that know where the new lighting, closed-circuit television camera or youth drop-in centre will cut local crime. Those local partnerships place policing in a positive anti-crime framework and enhance and enable efforts. As Gordon Jackson described, they engage communities in reclaiming their own neighbourhoods. I accept that the elderly often feel more vulnerable than others. I am seeking ways of engaging older people more in our community safety work. That is important.</p><p>I accept what many members said&#8212;if we want lower crime rates in the future, we must nip future crime in the bud now. We do not deny that the matter of young offenders is of great importance. That is why, across the Executive, we are taking action to support young people. Last month I visited the Tayside working in new enterprises&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"297\"/> TWINE&#8212;programme in Forfar, where the police are taking the lead in giving young offenders a fresh start by encouraging them to participate in training, education or employment.

The standard of the debate shows once again Parliament's commitment to tackling those issues.</p><p>I want to make the Executive's commitment clear. We unequivocally condemn all types of sexual assault and violence against women. We are committed to tackling those crimes and to supporting victims of rape and sexual assault through every stage of the criminal justice process, and beyond.</p><p>The motion was prompted by the outcome of a recent rape trial. Today, Parliament's concerns about the implications of the judge's ruling in that case have been eloquently expressed. Although it has been said before, I must stress that it is not for the Executive to comment on individual court cases. Judicial independence is the cornerstone of the Scottish legal system and Parliament would not want it any other way. However, we are not blind to, nor are we ignoring, the current concerns about the treatment of rape in law.</p><p>I agree that victims of rape and sexual assault need to be properly protected by the law and that all women must have confidence that they will be protected. A change in the law on rape might seem to be an attractive option. However, Johann Lamont was correct when she said that we simply do not know whether the law needs to be changed. First, we need to clarify how the law stands at present. Roseanna Cunningham was right to explain that to act before we are clear about the present position of the law would be to risk making mistakes that cannot easily be rectified later. Indeed the approach in England, to which Mr Gallie and others referred, is itself under review because it is not without problems. I will return to that.<place-holder colnum=\"83\"/></p><p>However, that is not to say that we can do nothing in the meantime. The victims of the crime must be protected. That is why we will bring forward a bill that will contain proposals to change aspects of the law of evidence for rape and other sexual offences so that the complainer will be further protected. We are considering how to improve the protection from sexual abuse of people who are made vulnerable by mental disorder. We are looking at new arrangements for the sentencing and management of serious violent and sexual offenders.</p><p>Violence against women in any context cannot be tolerated. The national strategy to address domestic abuse in Scotland, which was launched last November, recognises that domestic abuse is linked to other forms of male violence, such as rape and sexual abuse. That work will be taken forward by a working group on protection issues, which will be established by the national group to address domestic abuse.</p><p>Mention was made in the debate of the Scottish strategy for victims, which was launched in January 2001. The strategy is designed to ensure that when people are unfortunate enough to become victims of crime, they have a central place in the criminal justice system. It is a clear indication that we are committed to ensuring that victims get proper treatment, particularly where the victim has suffered a sexual assault.</p><p>Johann Lamont was right to mention the role of the police. The police are usually the first point of contact in the criminal justice system for victims of rape and sexual assault. The police must treat victims properly from that earliest encounter. The importance of tact and sensitivity in handling all victims of sex offences is now recognised by the police and is covered by extensive guidance. All probationers are given training in dealing with victims of sex offence cases, which is followed up by in-depth training at all levels.</p><p>I want to return to what has been identified as the key question of whether the law on rape needs to be changed. When Gil Paterson met Jim Wallace yesterday, Gil Paterson urged us not to lose sight of that matter and Johann Lamont's motion also makes it clear that we must move decisively. I am therefore pleased to be able to tell the Parliament that this afternoon I spoke with the Lord Advocate, who said that he had concluded his consideration of the transcript of the trial and of the trial advocate depute's report. The Lord Advocate told me that he intends to make a reference to the High Court to seek clarification of the law on rape.</p><p>At this juncture, the Lord Advocate is unable to provide details on the full terms of the reference. He has instructed that that reference should now be drafted. Some further work will be done on the <place-holder colnum=\"84\"/> precise form of the questions for the determination of the court. I should make it plain that there is no time limit on making a reference of this kind, but the Lord Advocate has instructed that it be lodged with the court next month. We cannot say how long the court will take to reach an opinion; it will properly take the time that is required for serious consideration.</p><p>This evening, we are signalling clearly the urgency with which the Executive views the matter. This is the first necessary step in addressing the issue that was raised by Lord Abernethy's ruling. It might not be the last necessary step, but it has been taken.</p><p><i>Meeting closed at 18:0</i></p>", "hdate": "2001-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rape (Lord Abernethy Ruling)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has highlighted well the varied and often sensitive issues that are associated with sexual crimes, and rape in particular.

That is exactly what the Lothian and Borders police city centre policing unit is about. This is not about having to take officers from elsewhere in the city to police the Edinburgh festival in the summer, for example.</p><p>Lothian and Borders police has just held two <place-holder colnum=\"1152\"/> recruiting days, which attracted 1,000 people who want to be police officers. That volume of recruitment gives us an opportunity to address issues such as the recruitment of ethnic minority officers, which Michael Matheson quite properly raised.</p><p>Last month, the First Minister and I visited Strathclyde police. We met an undercover squad, which is one of four&#8212;that number has risen from one. We met some of the nine community liaison officers, who are drawn from the 47 Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency officers seconded to Strathclyde police. We saw the results&#8212;&#163;600,000-worth of seized drugs, which is a fraction of the value of recent seizures. That is &#163;600,000-worth of crime that would have been committed by users to buy those drugs on the streets of Glasgow.</p><p>Although police numbers are rising, crime is not; the Scottish crime survey shows that there has been a decline of 13 per cent between 1995 and 1999. We should ask the police. Sir Roy Cameron of Lothian and Borders police said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have seen an excellent reduction in crime and rise in detection\".</p><p>Sir John Orr of Strathclyde police said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Morale is currently high with crime at its lowest level for many years and detection rates at an all time high.\"</p><p>However, we are not complacent about that improving picture. Jim Wallace acknowledged that the incidence of violent crime is much too high. That is why we will continue to support initiatives such as the safer Scotland campaign, which took 1,000 weapons out of circulation and led to a significant reduction in violent crime over the period of the campaign.</p><p>The picture that the Tories and nationalists have painted of falling police numbers and rising crime does not bear examination. What of their proposals, however? The SNP promises that it would recruit 1,000 more police. That appears to show a laudable concern for law and order but, unfortunately, it does not. It appears that the funding for those extra policemen would be &#163;25 million, which would be raised by repatriating from the Treasury the fine income of Scottish courts. The SNP promise is not an expression of concern for law and order but a convoluted point about money, and even that does not add up. The fine income of Scottish district courts in the most recent year for which figures are available was &#163;8 million.</p><p>Even if &#163;25 million was available, it would pay for the salaries of 1,000 recruits but nothing else. The nationalists cannot get their sums right. I have heard of bare-faced criminals, but those recruits would be the bare naked police officers&#8212;they would have no uniforms, equipment, vehicles or police stations. Modern policing is a bit more <place-holder colnum=\"1153\"/> complicated than the SNP suggests. That is why we are providing our police forces not only with record resources, but with the Scottish intelligence database, the extended DNA testing facility at Strathclyde, the new Lothian and Borders control room, which will release 90 officers, and the Scottish police national network, which will address the point that Paul Martin made about the access of police officers to e-mail.</p><p>The Tories, too, have little to offer. We should not forget that they have previous on this. On 15 June 2000, Phil Gallie confessed that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Crime did rise under the Tories.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2000-06-15.336.5\">[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 June 2000; Vol 7, c 336.]</citation></p><p>He is right, and it would happen again under the Tories. Their promised cuts in public expenditure are the one thing that could undermine the certainty of record police numbers. The Tories will never understand that criminal justice and social justice are inextricably linked. They cannot understand that tough talking does not cut crime. The reduction in crime is a result not just of our record investment in police numbers, but of our investment in housing and education and the creation of the highest employment rate in Scotland for 40 years.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13249532", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to accept that point, but one aspect of it is the resourcing of chief constables in order to deploy their officers more effectively.

However, I am sure of two things, both of which are reflected in the report. The first is found in the answer to the question, \"Where can we find the strength and the will to tackle drugs?\" The answer is clear: it must come from within the communities that suffer the effects of drugs.</p><p>Secondly, we must support and mobilise that strength through partnerships between parents and families, the voluntary sector, health, housing, social work, education and the police. Those partnerships are reflected in the drug action teams, which are responsible for shaping locally sensitive drug strategies and for building services around the real and changing nature of localised drug misuse patterns. Karen Whitefield was quite right to say that the committee discovered that the problem is complex and multilayered. As such, it needs a complex and multilayered response.</p><p>Our overall framework strategy document, \"Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership,\" was itself an exercise in partnership. The document was drawn up with the support of a wide range of interests and is based on some fundamental principles: inclusion, partnership, understanding and accountability.</p><p>Although the strategy was published in May 1999, it needs to evolve to meet new challenges and a fast-developing agenda.

On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of visiting the Hope self-help project in Bo'ness, which is a fine example of community involvement and commitment that was drawn to my attention by Cathy Peattie, the local MSP. The project was conceived and created by local people. It helps drug users to recover in the community and provides support for families. It provides all-round support for people&#8212;from helping them to seek rehousing to getting them on harm reduction or detoxification programmes. Everyone is treated as an individual and given the support that they need. Contact with other agencies is local and direct, so it works. The chair and leader, Jackie Johnston, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every door we knock on opens for us.\"</p><p>That is a real definition of local partnership in action. Those who have succeeded through the project are ploughing their success back into it, as volunteers and as examples for new clients. Such local initiatives have a crucial&#8212;no, an essential&#8212;part to play if we are to impact seriously on the <place-holder colnum=\"803\"/> drugs problem. I wish that I could convey to the chamber the sense of healing that is evoked by the Hope project&#8212;lives healed, families healed, a community healed.</p><p>We have to enable communities to mobilise in that way everywhere in Scotland. The large urban areas have acute social problems that can only be exacerbated when drug misuse is rife. However, we must not forget the rural areas of Scotland, which also suffer from the drug menace. The total funding for each local area represents a comprehensive package that takes account of real needs.

I am sure that the members of that committee will join me in thanking the various organisations that took time to give evidence and contribute in a valuable way. A number of points were made in that committee's report, and by members this afternoon. I shall mention a few of them, but I am afraid that I will not be able to mention them all.</p><p>Kate MacLean made a general point, which arose from the Equal Opportunities Committee's recommendation that we should insert an overarching equality statement in the bill. We are unsure where such a statement could be inserted, given that the bill's scope and long title have already been agreed with the Presiding Officer. Although we have no objection in principle to considering the idea, we simply do not know where we could insert such a statement.</p><p>The greatest discussion this afternoon has been generated by part 6, on the power to make remedial orders. Some members are concerned about the scope of the proposed powers, which they believe goes further than is necessary. However, as members heard today, the Executive has agreed to lodge an amendment at stage 2 to address those concerns. Ministers will have to have compelling reasons for using the remedial order route to remedy actual or perceived ECHR incompatibilities. They will not be able to use the remedial power to remedy an incompatibility when the reasons for taking that route are not compelling.</p><p>Some questions have been asked about how necessary it is for that power to be available. Roseanna Cunningham, for example, asked why it would not be possible to use emergency legislation to ensure compatibility and gave a couple of examples of where that route had previously been followed. Of course, the example <place-holder colnum=\"774\"/> of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 had nothing to do with the ECHR but, nonetheless, the act was remedied by emergency legislation.</p><p>I recall that some concern was expressed&#8212;not least by Roseanna Cunningham when she was the convener of the Justice and Home Affairs Committee&#8212;about the pressure that that route put on the institutions of the Parliament. There are other reasons why the power is important, of course. The current position is that, under the Human Rights Act 1998, UK ministers have greater powers than Scottish ministers to make amendments by subordinate legislation to remedy legislative provisions that are or that might be incompatible with the ECHR. The Scotland Act 1998 gives ministers the power to do so in relation to any legislation that is passed by the Scottish Parliament or by an act of a Scottish minister that is or might be compatible with the ECHR. The power is required in order to ensure that Scottish ministers have the same powers as UK ministers already have under the Scotland Act 1998 so that Scottish ministers are able to take urgent action when that is required. That will ensure that the scrutiny role in such a situation lies with the Scottish Parliament rather than with Westminster.</p><p>Phil Gallie spent some time complaining about the thinness of the bill and saying that it does not address enough of the issues that he believes it should. In support of his view, he listed a series of current ECHR challenges. The examples he used, however, such as the case of County Properties v the Scottish ministers, are mostly under appeal. In other words, the Scottish Executive disagrees with the finding of the court. That seems to be a typically perverse Tory argument. First, the Tories criticise the Executive for seeking to make our laws compatible with the ECHR, then they criticise us for not amending legislation that we think does not require to be amended because we believe that it is already compatible. First they ask us whether a law should be struck down on the \"say-so of one judge\"&#8212;David McLetchie used that phrase&#8212;then they criticise us for not caving in to such a judgment when we disagree with it, but instead appeal against it.

However, we believe that our position is correct.</p><p>I am generally pleased with the response to part 1 of the bill, which deals with changes in arrangements regarding the release of adult mandatory lifers. A lot of support for part 1 was expressed throughout the chamber. Even Phil Gallie admitted that allowing the judge to include a part of the sentence that takes account of the need to punish the criminal amounts, basically, to his mantra of having sentences that mean what they say. If a punishment part is included in the sentence, that time must be served. Given Mr Gallie's expression of agreement with our intention&#8212;I see that he is nodding his head&#8212;I hope that his comments outside the chamber will not paint lurid pictures of murderers being released early. I think he knows that such pictures would not represent the truth of the situation because, as Margo MacDonald said, the bill is intended to ensure consistent and clear sentencing, not softer sentencing.</p><p>Judges will be able to set a punishment part of a sentence that will continue beyond a prisoner's natural life if they believe that that is the correct punishment. Indeed, the current position is that, when a life sentence is handed down, the convicted prisoner can appeal on the ground that the sentence is too long but, because its period is indeterminate, the Scottish Executive cannot appeal on the ground that it is too lenient. Under the legislation, we might be able to appeal against a punishment part of a sentence if we believe that it is not as lengthy as the crime warrants. In fairness, that is an advance that helps to balance the two sides of that equation. Life will mean life&#8212;exactly as it does now&#8212;in the sense that a prisoner, even if released, remains on licence for the rest of his or her life, and is liable to be recalled to custody for a breach of licence conditions.</p><p>Related concerns were raised. Roseanna Cunningham asked about the pressure on the courts in dealing with existing convicted prisoners. There are a couple of points to make in relation to that matter. First, we have more judges than we have had in history. Secondly, the return of the judges that were involved in the Lockerbie trial will help with the work load. We believe that we can deal with existing prisoners in the court system.</p><p>A question was asked about whether legal aid would be available for existing life prisoners who require hearings to have the punishment parts of their sentences set. There is no specific provision for that in the bill, but it is clearly stated in the financial memorandum that assistance by way of representation will be available for existing life <place-holder colnum=\"776\"/> prisoners. That is something of which the Scottish Legal Aid Board is aware.</p><p>Margo MacDonald raised a question about the upper age limit for members of the Parole Board for Scotland, which is 75. That limit was set to allow retired members of the judiciary to serve on the board for a period, but that was not a matter that the Justice 1 Committee considered commenting on in its report.</p><p>It is only fair to mark one important point that was mentioned by Phil Gallie on transferred prisoners. Euan Robson called that point interesting. It is, indeed, an interesting and complex issue, which we are still considering. We will have to consider whether to lodge amendments on it at stage 2.</p><p>Comments have been made on the question to which tribunals legal aid will be made available. In his opening speech, Jim Wallace undertook that the list of those tribunals would be made available by stage 3&#8212;the point was made that it should be available by stage 2. I point out that to produce that list by stage 2 would not allow us to consult the bodies that might be affected by it. In any case, the list will not be definitive. Other tribunals or bodies will emerge at a later stage, and we will not draw a line under the matter&#8212;it is an initial exercise.</p><p>In that regard, there have been a number of references to the criticism that was voiced in the committee's report that the Scottish Legal Aid Board was not fully consulted. SLAB officials were consulted extensively, although we acknowledge the point that has been made about its members.</p><p>The interesting thing about the debate is the way in which the Tories' Europhobia has, ironically, ended up highlighting&#8212;Richard Simpson was the last member to point this out&#8212;the legislative importance of the incorporation of the ECHR into our law. It is to ensure that Scottish people have their human rights judged in Scottish courts by Scottish judges that the bill should be passed. To be frank, that seems to me to be a good day's work for a Scottish Parliament. The Tories have also inadvertently highlighted the historical role of the ECHR as part of the framework of guarantees against fascism and war in western Europe.</p><p>Last week, there was some talk of strange alliances in the chamber which, I think, upset certain colleagues. I would be happy to accept Winston Churchill into today's coalition. It seems unfortunate that the Tory members of the Parliament say that they will not follow his support of human rights.</p><p>The bill is another mark of the Executive's commitment&#8212;and that of three quarters of the Parliament&#8212;to the protection of the human rights of every Scottish citizen. The Justice 1 <place-holder colnum=\"777\"/> Committee's report recommends agreement to the bill.

It is no exaggeration to claim that openness is the bedrock of good democracy and good government. Indeed, the consultative steering group on the Scottish Parliament was absolutely clear that openness should characterise Scotland in devolution. Our proposals are designed to deliver that.</p><p>Openness should not be only on our terms. If openness is to bring real accountability, it is vital that the availability of information is not reliant on various non-statutory regimes or limited statutory ones. A number of the contributions this morning have focused on the need for legislation and have illustrated instances of information being released through codes without statutory force. It is an extremely weak argument to say, however, that because of that a statutory regime, which will ensure that that and other information in future will be disclosed, has no purpose. I will return to that point later, time permitting.</p><p>If public confidence in the effective and responsible operation of public authorities, including the Executive, and indeed the Parliament, is to be guaranteed, it is essential that we introduce a robust statutory freedom of information regime that cannot be undermined or sidestepped.</p><p>I say public authorities including the Executive and the Parliament.

Sewel motions are a device unique to our Parliament and our constitution, whereas there are examples from similar freedom of information regimes where the ministerial veto is seldom used.</p><p>Much has been made today of the exemptions. Let me repeat Jim Wallace's assurance that those are not loopholes. Exemptions are found in every freedom of information regime around the world; access to information is not, and never has been, an unconditional and open-ended right. There will always be information that must be protected against disclosure, and our draft bill provides for that. The exemptions are about ensuring that freedom of information operates to the benefit of the people of Scotland. That is why we have maintained our harm test of \"substantial prejudice\".</p><p>I will deal with the case of the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office that has been raised by Ms Cunningham and others. The reason that the Lord Advocate is exempted is because, under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, any decision taken by him or her as head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigations of deaths must be taken independently of any other person, so under the terms of that act he or she could not be overruled by the commissioner. The Crown Office is subject to freedom of information and it is the duty of the prosecution service to act in the public interest, but in many cases there are competing interests, not only those of the victim and the accused, but between victims and between victims and witnesses. We will review the nature and type of information that can be made available privately to victims.</p><p>The great exemption of Cabinet minutes, which so exercises David McLetchie, begs the obvious question: does William Hague intend to publish his Cabinet minutes if, God forbid, he becomes Prime Minister? Will he signal his intent to do so by publishing shadow Cabinet minutes now? If so, I will be first in line for the shadow Cabinet minutes <place-holder colnum=\"584\"/> for the first meeting after Ann Widdecombe's famous foray into drugs crime policy.

They bring home to us the human dimension of an event in our history that we are commemorating today. It is particularly fitting that we should recognise the wartime sufferings and sacrifices of the people of Clydebank, as in many ways they epitomise those of the people of Scotland and the wider world during the second world war.</p><p>Sixty years on, it can be hard to comprehend the effects that the blitz had on Clydebank's tight-knit community. Although the main facts are widely known and have been rehearsed this evening, some of them bear repeating. Between 13 March and 8 May 1941, almost 1,500 people died in Clydebank and around 2,000 were seriously injured as a result of the air raids. On the first night alone, under a clear bomber's moon, 272 tonnes of explosives and 1,650 incendiary bombs were dropped. On the next night, guided by the fires, the German bombers returned to deliver another 231 tonnes. All but seven or eight of the town's 12,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 30,000 people were left without shelter.</p><p>My parents recall what happened 60 years ago last night. They did not live in Clydebank, but in Leith on the east coast. They remember to this day sitting in their air-raid shelters and hearing the drone of bombers passing over on their way to Clydebank. Those bombers seared their way across Scotland and into our psyche. In those first two nights, they dropped the same tonnage of bombs on Clydebank as had been dropped on Coventry throughout the previous November.</p><p>However, statistics on their own cannot convey the personal sufferings, which are documented in the harrowing tales of survivors, or&#8212;as Colin Campbell pointed out&#8212;the random horrors of particular incidents, such as the six young cub scouts killed on their way to their Thursday evening meeting.</p><p>It is right that we should pause to reflect on the <place-holder colnum=\"539\"/> terrible destruction and loss of life and that we should commemorate the sacrifices of the brave volunteers who fought the blazes and risked or gave their lives to save others. We should pay particular tribute to the courage of the Home Guard, the Royal Observer Corps, the air-raid precaution services, the first aid and ambulance crews and the voluntary firefighters. Furthermore, it is fitting that we recall the courageous role played by the Polish destroyer that Robert Brown mentioned, whose crew helped to defend the town and saved the HMS Duke of York, which lay at berth.</p><p>The extraordinary courage shown by ordinary people during the Clydebank blitz was well summed up in a civil defence publication of the day. It said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"countless deeds were done which belong to the fighting traditions of Scotland, though they were done not by picturesque kilted figures at the charge but by drab dungareed men and women in 'tin hats'\".</p><p>I will return to that word \"drab\".</p><p>The strategic raids on Clydebank's industrial heart were designed to destroy the contribution to the war effort made by the shipyards there. However, once the initial trauma of the raids had passed, the resilient character of the people became evident. Survivors returned immediately to work in the shipyards and factories. The Singer Sewing factory, which had been turned over to munitions work, was back in partial production only two days after the bombing and in full production six weeks later.</p><p>Clydebank's productivity continued to play a major role in the war effort. John Brown's shipyards turned out warships of all kinds and converted the famous luxury liners that had been built in the 1930s&#8212;the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth&#8212;into troopships. Some say that Clydebank's finest engineering achievement was the collection of floating piers known as Mulberry harbours, which were used in the Normandy landings. Meanwhile, on the home front, the people of Clydebank began to rebuild their community. Within only seven months, 95 per cent of the immediate repair work to housing had been carried out.</p><p>The Clydebank people have never forgotten what it is like to suffer and they want to ensure that those sufferings were not endured in vain. The programme of events to commemorate the Clydebank blitz will ensure that the events of 60 years ago and their causes are recalled and that younger generations are made aware of them. Our First Minister and senior colleagues from other parties will join in those events to represent the Executive and the Parliament.</p><p>Churchill commented on Clydebank's war effort:<place-holder colnum=\"540\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The world owes a debt that will not be easy to measure\".</p><p>In many ways, the Parliament is the measure of that debt as the newest manifestation of a democracy that, as Duncan McNeil said, would have been snuffed out 60 years ago had it not been for the sacrifice of those who stood up to fascism then. The dungarees and tin hats of Clydebank's men and women may have been drab, but Clydebank's spirit shines down the years to us. We are proud to welcome their memory in our Parliament and our pledge is that we will not forget.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13247737", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clydebank and the Blitz"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Four words resonate in today's motion: death, devastation, sacrifice and resilience.

Those concern: the disclosure of information for the purposes of criminal investigation and proceedings; the extension of seizure powers of certain bodies, such as Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, to allow material to be removed for sifting; and the execution in Scotland of warrants issued in England and Wales for certain materials. We are asking this Parliament today for its consent that those provisions are included in the bill to be considered at Westminster.</p><p>The proposals on information disclosure extend and rationalise the rules governing the disclosure of information that is needed for criminal investigations. They also create new disclosure provisions for the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise, which currently cannot share information, even in criminal investigations. At present, the Inland Revenue may, for example, obtain information about drug trafficking but be unable to disclose it to the police. Some disclosure provisions currently prevent information from being shared before the start of any criminal proceedings and therefore hamper the police investigation.</p><p>The bill would amend existing disclosure provisions, which are contained in a large number of existing statutes, some of which relate to devolved matters. The Parliament would have competence to legislate separately on the disclosure of information to detect and prevent crime for matters that are not reserved. However, the bill's aim is to standardise those disclosure provisions. That is best done across the UK to ensure the necessary consistency. The Executive <place-holder colnum=\"1012\"/> therefore proposes that both reserved and devolved disclosure matters should be dealt with as a whole in the Westminster bill.</p><p>The proposals on powers of seizure would allow investigating officers to remove material from premises and individuals for sifting if that is not possible at the time of the search. For example, investigators could remove a large number of documents that they suspected included some for which they had a search warrant, and then go through the documents at their own premises to establish which ones they could seize. Although the Scottish police do not have those powers now, we do not propose that the provisions be extended to them. The current practice of sifting on the owner's premises or removing material with the owner's consent does not cause practical difficulties in Scotland.</p><p>However, the provisions in the bill also cover the powers of a number of bodies that operate UK-wide, such as HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. There are also provisions affecting the powers of local authority officials, such as trading standards officers. The Executive accepts that those bodies and officials should have the same powers to do their job in Scotland as they would in the rest of the UK. There are also certain UK bodies, notably the Financial Services Authority, whose seizure powers are exercised through police constables. To preserve the UK-wide regime for those powers, the Executive proposes that they be exceptions to the general exclusion in the bill of Scottish police officers from the provisions.</p><p>The final provision allows the execution in Scotland of warrants issued in England and Wales for excluded and special procedure material&#8212;that is, material of a confidential nature, such as personal records, journalistic or commercial material. Those warrants can be obtained only from a circuit judge in England and Wales, and a loophole in the current law means that warrants from those judges cannot be enforced in Scotland. We do not have the same problem enforcing Scottish warrants in England and Wales.</p><p>The bill would therefore amend the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to allow such warrants to be executed in Scotland. Although, once again, it would have been possible for this Parliament to legislate, the Westminster bill is the simplest and most effective way of closing that loophole.</p><p>The Criminal Justice and Police Bill includes, of course, other substantive provisions that will not apply to Scotland. This motion simply ensures the closure of a loophole and avoids any risk of creating new ones in areas such as information disclosure. It is no more than commonsense co-operation between Parliaments in our common purpose of the fight against crime.<place-holder colnum=\"1013\"/></p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the provisions on information disclosure for criminal proceedings and powers of seizure contained in Parts II and III of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill currently before the UK Parliament; recognises the practical value of consistency across the United Kingdom for information disclosure for criminal investigation, and for powers of seizure as they relate to certain United Kingdom bodies and local authority officials, and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end in this Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament; further notes that the Bill allows certain warrants issued in England and Wales to be executed in Scotland, recognises the importance of mutual execution of warrants for law enforcement, and agrees that the relevant provision to achieve this end in this Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13245024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Police Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Criminal Justice and Police Bill, currently being considered by the Westminster Parliament, introduces a range of measures to tackle crime and disorder.

Standing orders enable committees to use their expertise to propose bills to the Parliament, as the Justice 1 Committee is doing today, and to develop legislation.</p><p>I will digress for a moment. The committee's proposal may not be as modern an idea as we think. Hundreds of years ago, in the previous Scottish Parliament, the Committee of the Articles had the power to frame legislation. However, that ended in tears. As the Crown controlled that committee, it also controlled the legislative programme and, as a result, it was abolished by the revolution settlement in 1690. Indeed, in the face of opposition from William and Mary, its abolition was the first act of the 1690 session of the Parliament.</p><p>History will not repeat itself in relation to committee bills. It is worth noting that, in our Parliament, the Justice 1 Committee is the first to start down the legislative road. The subject that it has chosen is important for the welfare of Scottish people, particularly women.</p><p>The Justice and Home Affairs Committee spent considerable time gathering evidence, which it considered with care. Maureen Macmillan made a particular contribution to that process as reporter to the committee. Constructive chairmanship was provided by Alasdair Morgan and, as the convener said, by his predecessor, Roseanna Cunningham. In preparation for today, the committee also liaised with the Executive and its officials, which is appreciated.</p><p>At the heart of the proposal for the bill lies the concern to help victims of recurring abuse. Alasdair Morgan is right to say that domestic abuse is an intolerable blot&#8212;a stain&#8212;on our society. This chamber and the Executive have demonstrated before that we will not tolerate it or its apologists.</p><p>In November last year, the First Minister and Jackie Baillie announced an &#163;18 million package to provide 300 more refuge places, fund a prevention strategy and support local services. That must be matched by changes in the law.</p><p>Over the years, protective measures have been developed, from Lawburrows in 1429 through to the Protection from Harassment Act in 1997. The Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, to which Alasdair Morgan referred, was quite forward looking in its day.<place-holder colnum=\"516\"/></p><p>Each of those pieces of legislation addressed particular parts of the problem, but the gaps in provision have become clearer as society has changed and as our understanding of the problem of domestic abuse has become clearer.</p><p>In 1992, the Scottish Law Commission proposed amendments to the 1981 act. The Justice and Home Affairs Committee's report said, quite rightly, that no one disputes the need to amend that legislation. As the convener said, the Executive consulted on those proposals in \"Improving Scottish Family Law\".</p><p>Last September, in \"Parents and Children\", our white paper on family law, we reaffirmed what needed to be done. Interdicts with a power of arrest should be available to divorced partners and present and former cohabitants; they should therefore be renamed as domestic interdicts. The scope of matrimonial interdicts should be extended to cover the applicant's home and place of work, and the school attended by any child.</p><p>Those are important improvements. However, the committee concluded&#8212;I think quite rightly&#8212;that there are some people whom the 1981 act cannot reach, even with those amendments.</p><p>The committee has taken an innovative approach, and one that we applaud. It is right not to suggest trying tortuously to fit its proposals for interdict into the 1981 act. Its proposals will achieve more than reform of the 1981 act alone would ever have been able to do. That does not mean, however, that reform of the act is unnecessary. Our proposals to amend the act are complementary to the committee's proposed bill; they are not in competition with it. The committee's report recognised that. The Executive's proposals will provide an important protection in line with the needs of families in Scotland today.</p><p>We published our white paper while the committee was working up its report, but we were not able to indicate the timing of our legislation. That is still the case. Indeed, it is more than likely that, if the Parliament approves the committee's proposal, the committee's bill will reach the statute book earlier than any other way of amending the 1981 act. I think that all members would agree that it is crucial that we act with maximum speed to keep our laws against domestic abuse up to date.</p><p>The proposed amendments to the 1981 act and the proposed committee bill are further complemented by our proposals to strengthen the law on harassment, as announced in this chamber last week. That too requires a legislative vehicle to allow the attachment of a statutory power of arrest to a non-harassment order. In the debate on stalking and harassment, Jim Wallace suggested that, if the committee agreed, the protection from abuse bill might provide the most immediate <place-holder colnum=\"517\"/> legislative vehicle.</p><p>For the same reason, we have, in correspondence, suggested to the committee that its bill might also be extended to amend the 1981 act along the lines that we suggested in \"Parents and Children\". I recognise that there may be procedural difficulties in that. The scope of the bill would have to be wide enough to accommodate the extra provisions. There might well have to be a supplementary or amended report from the committee, and the committee might feel the need to take further evidence&#8212;although I would hope that that might be minimised by the extent of its previous consultation, the Scottish Law Commission's consultation and the consultation on \"Improving Scottish Family Law\", which led, of course, to our white paper.</p><p>We appreciate that the extra provisions would mean extra work for the committee and its officials. However, the work would be to an important end, and could be based on much work that has already been done by the Executive and the Scottish Law Commission, whose report contained draft sections that should give a foundation to build on. We would, of course, be happy to provide whatever assistance we could to the Parliament and the committee, if they were willing to take that course.</p><p>It would have been more straightforward if we had been able to make this proposal while the committee was taking evidence. However, only recently has it become apparent that the quickest way forward on this is likely to be with the committee's bill rather than Executive legislation.</p><p>I hope that the committee will be prepared to widen its proposals to accommodate modernisation of the 1981 act, not as an alternative to but as an addition to the measures in the report. I look forward to further discussions with the committee on this issue, either in today's debate or on a later occasion.</p><p>In any event, I am very pleased to confirm the Executive's support for the report and to commend the excellent legislative proposals that it contains.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13243460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Protection from Abuse Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to be able to give the Executive's support to this important proposal from the Justice 1 Committee for a protection from abuse bill.

However, there is law in place which, if it operates effectively, should protect people who are suffering at the hands of those who harass them.</p><p>The use of the law on breach of the peace might not be universally popular, because that might be perceived as too vague or too trivial. However, it has strengths: it is flexible; it is widely understood; it is used; and it results in custodial sentences. Indeed, as we have heard, one of the strengths of the charge of breach of the peace is that, as a common law offence, it can attract the heaviest of penalties. Roseanna Cunningham is quite right&#8212;in theory at least, the penalty could extend to life imprisonment. That brings out the weakness in Phil Gallie's point that a new offence would provide adequate sentencing. A new offence could not carry a heavier theoretical penalty than does breach of the peace. Even with a new offence, the key would lie in the way that it was applied and <place-holder colnum=\"201\"/> used.</p><p>Several members have referred to the new crime of cyberstalking. Roseanna Cunningham pointed out that an earlier solution to the general issue of stalking might have left us with cyberstalking falling outside the law. The flexibility of the breach of the peace law helps us in such circumstances. It was used last year when a man in Ayr was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for harassing a young woman using e-mail. In that case, breach of the peace involved the sending of abusive e-mails and it resulted in a nine-month jail sentence. The sheriff commented on the ability of the common law to deal with electronic harassment.</p><p>However, we can increase the effective use and application of the law. The exchange between the Deputy First Minister and Roseanna Cunningham on breach of the peace and harassment demonstrated that the measures that we have are not being implemented fully. Paul Martin made an important point that responding for victims of harassment is an obligation for many agencies, not only the police and the judiciary. We take that point and we will consider it.</p><p>Existing law can be improved. We will act to strengthen the existing legal provisions. In particular, we will add statutory powers of arrest to non-harassment orders at the earliest opportunity. No one should be in any doubt that breach of an order is serious and will be treated as such by the justice system. Breach of a non-harassment order can result in a prison sentence of up to five years.</p><p>Several speakers made points about interim non-harassment orders. Our initial reaction is concern that it would be difficult to grant such an order, breach of which could be a serious criminal offence, without the defendant being heard. However, we would like to take time to reflect on the suggestions and we will respond in writing to Roseanna Cunningham, who raised the issue first this afternoon.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the package of measures that has been outlined today is sensible and sound and moves us forward. It will improve the application and awareness of existing laws at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Furthermore, the research will improve our understanding of how a new offence might be defined and how it might work.</p><p>Above all, the package must offer better reassurance to anybody who fears that they are the victim of a stalker or harasser that protection and redress are available and that their concerns will be understood and addressed by the justice system. We all share that concern. We will move toward that aim this afternoon and will continue to do so in future.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13242570", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Stalking and Harassment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are in a position to act more positively because of this Parliament and because of committees such as the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, which will not allow us to do nothing for a further four years.

That is why so many members have taken an interest in the subject and have contributed to today's debate and to committee examinations of the proposed legislation.</p><p>When Phil Gallie intervened during my earlier speech, I replied that we do not know how many properties are likely to benefit from the bill and that to find that out would involve a long and time-consuming examination of leasehold titles in areas of Scotland where they are prevalent. However, we had the benefit of a five-minute suspension during this afternoon's business, and I took that opportunity to nip out and count them as far as I was able. The Scottish Law Commission carried out a sample survey of titles and discovered that about a quarter of them contained provision for leasehold casualties. On that basis, we could estimate that 1,000 to 1,500 properties in Scotland could be affected by the bill. That is not an insignificant number of families and households where, were we not to pass the legislation, selling the property might invoke the situation that members have described.</p><p>Several members raised the issue of compensation for the abolition of rental value casualties.

That is the direction in which we expect this type of tenure to move as well.</p><p>Because of the anomaly of the landlord getting something for nothing from a rental value casualty, the bill offers only nominal compensation based on ground rent. As a number of members guessed, we believe that some compensation should be provided under the bill to ensure that any challenge under the European convention on human rights can be successfully resisted. Article 1 of protocol 1 of the convention requires that a balance be struck between the greater public interest and the disproportionate impact that the legislation might have on an individual who is prejudiced. Compensation must be proportional to the loss, but it is clear from case law that it does not have to reflect the actual loss. A number of factors must be considered, for example, the price paid for the landlord's interest in an estate, his expectations and his input in return for payments, <place-holder colnum=\"48\"/> as well as the interests of the tenants.</p><p>The landlord gets something for nothing from rental value casualties as he benefits from investments made by tenants over the years, although he provides only the ground on which the buildings are erected. As Pauline McNeill and Gordon Jackson reminded us, Brian Hamilton admitted in evidence to the Justice and Home Affairs Committee that he acquired estates including leasehold interests in ignorance of the potential value of leasehold casualties. Such income as he has enjoyed from rental value casualties might well be considered to be a windfall.</p><p>In addition, although someone might derive an income from rental value casualties, the income stream would not be sufficiently reliable to give it a large market value. The prospect of abolition could act to drive down the value of casualties generally. Even so, the nominal compensation offered in the bill clearly does not reflect actual loss, but we believe that that is defensible under the convention in view of the public interest argument.</p><p>A point has been made on several occasions about the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000. I return to the fact that there is a package of land reform. It was clear when that legislation was passed that it would not be enacted until the title conditions bill was also enacted. I hear the criticism about the time that the process has taken, but this will add up to a comprehensive reform within the first session of this Parliament.

We should consider whether clarification is needed. We agree with the principle of that point. Christine Grahame also asked about the royal prerogative. I will again end on that charming note.

We do not know whether they own any landlord interests, but they have indicated that they are content to be subject to the provisions of the bill.</p><p>That seems to be as good a note as any on which to end my speech.

It is difficult to make an estimate. As Mr Ingram said, there are four counties in Scotland where that type of property tenancy is quite common, so there is the potential for more people to suffer in the future. The key issue is the oppressive nature of the landlords' actions, and the legislation that we are considering today will ensure that no one faces such consequences and demands again.</p><p>It is a frightening thing suddenly to be faced with a demand for up to &#163;20,000. Tenants do not know whether the demand is valid and have to seek legal advice, usually from the solicitor who acted for them when they bought the house. Not all solicitors in the areas where leasehold casualties are prevalent have been negligent. Some will have advised their clients as to their potential liability. Some, on discovering that they have overlooked a valid and enforceable casualty, may have accepted responsibility and taken action at their own expense. In some cases, however, a tenant may be being threatened with legal action by a landlord while his solicitor denies or is reluctant to admit professional negligence. During such a period of uncertainty, the owner may face the threat of eviction if he or she does not pay up. That is an oppressive and difficult situation and it is right that we should take action to ensure that no one faces it in future.</p><p>The Scottish Law Commission's report on leasehold casualties is one of a number of reports on property law that the Executive intends will be implemented by legislation. The commission's report on the abolition of the feudal system has already been put into law by the Abolition of <place-holder colnum=\"24\"/> Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000. We are now preparing to consult on the commission's report on real burdens and title conditions.</p><p>The final item in the Executive's current programme of property law reform concerns the law of the tenement. Although the commission published its report on the law of the tenement in 1998, it subsequently advised ministers that the logical sequence in which to reform the law would be to deal with abolition of the feudal system first, followed by reform of real burdens and title conditions and, finally, the law of the tenement. We intend to follow that sequence.</p><p>The Scottish Law Commission is also undertaking a review of the existing law relating to residential long leases as part of its sixth programme of law reform. It is hoped that that area will be the subject of further legislation. Taken together, the reforms amount to a comprehensive restructuring of Scottish property law, which we hope the Scottish Parliament will pass within the next few years. Today's debate is a contribution to the package.</p><p>In the course of the review of residential long leases, the Scottish Law Commission has obtained data on more than 2,500 such leases. The research has led the commission to suggest a number of amendments to the bill that is currently before Parliament. Those suggestions are intended to improve the coverage of the bill. The Executive will lodge appropriate amendments at stage 2 to give effect to them. I will summarise briefly the intended changes.</p><p>First, the bill as introduced will affect only leases granted for periods of not less than 300 years so as to avoid inadvertently catching other provisions in modern commercial leases. The survey of long leases has revealed very few commercial leases of longer than 125 years, but has found a small number of leases of less than 300 years that contain leasehold casualties. We will therefore propose at stage 2 that the bill should apply to leases of more than 175 years, which reflects the longest period of lease permitted under the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000.</p><p>Secondly, section 5 of the bill removes the landlord's right to irritate an ultra-long lease for non-payment of a trivial amount of rent. At present, section 5 is confined to leases granted for a period of 300 years or more with a ground rent of not more than &#163;100. The Scottish Law Commission has discovered some leases with a rent of just over &#163;100. We will therefore propose at stage 2 that the rent limit in section 5 should be raised to &#163;150.</p><p>Thirdly, we will propose that section 5 be amended to provide that all rights of irritancy <place-holder colnum=\"25\"/> which allow the landlord to terminate for breach of the lease by the tenant will be void. That will put beyond doubt the fact that the provision covers the landlord's common-law right to irritate a lease for non-payment of two years' rent as well as conventional irritancy clauses.</p><p>Last, in order to put beyond doubt whether certain leases with renewal or break-option terms fall within the scope of the bill, the commission has suggested that the provisions that define the length of relevant leases for the purposes of the bill should be amended appropriately. We will propose at stage 2 that renewal periods should be included when calculating the length of leases. In the case of leases with break options, the length of the lease will be treated as the full term and not the period to the next possible break option.</p><p>The changes are intended to improve the coverage of the bill and I hope that, when the time comes, the committee will give the proposed Executive amendments a smooth passage.</p><p>For the purposes of rule 9.11 of the standing orders, I advise the Parliament that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales as Prince and Steward of Scotland, having been informed of the purport of the Leasehold Casualties (Scotland) Bill, have consented to place their prerogatives and interests, so far as they are affected by the bill, at the disposal of the Parliament for the purposes of the bill.

The first three points were a Scottish Parliament, reform of the House of Lords and a guaranteed wage, all of which the current Labour Government has delivered. The punch line is that Keir Hardie's fourth election pledge was temperance.

That international thinking ought to be considered as we develop our strategy over the next year or so.</p><p>The strategy must be realistic and practical. As many members have pointed out, it must recognise that the majority of people who drink do so responsibly, with little harm to themselves or others. As Shona Robison said, the strategy must deal with the messages on alcohol, which are sometimes mixed. Mary Mulligan illustrated that point from today's press. The strategy must also address the binge culture, which is often encouraged in young people&#8212;as Elaine Murray pointed out&#8212;not only by the media, but by the way in which some drinks are promoted.</p><p>The strategy must also address the issue of adequate resourcing. However, we should examine what is already being spent. Malcolm Chisholm was honest in pointing out how difficult it is to garner information on how much is spent on dealing with the effects of alcohol. For example, Des McNulty spoke of alcohol-related brain damage in Glasgow. Greater Glasgow Health Board estimates that it spends &#163;3.3 million directly on that problem. Clearly, that sum is not included in the figure of &#163;2.5 million that was mentioned. An exercise needs to be done to ascertain how resources are being spent.</p><p>Both my department, with its responsibilities for criminal justice and licensing matters, and the health department have a significant role to play in reducing alcohol-related harm. Mr Chisholm, who chairs SACAM, has undertaken to note Christine Grahame's point and to consider the lack of criminal justice input into the advisory committee.</p><p>I also have specific responsibility for drugs strategy. A number of members have commented on the priority that is given to drugs. The misuse of alcohol and the misuse of drugs are major health and social problems. However, we must recognise that they are different. On one hand, we are dealing with a legal and socially acceptable activity controlled by regulation, where the pattern of consumption is probably the central and most harmful issue. On the other hand, we have an illegal activity that causes widespread misery to individuals and communities through consumption <place-holder colnum=\"815\"/> itself and the crime that funds that consumption.</p><p>I make no apologies for the priority attached to tackling drug misuse. However, that does not&#8212;and must not&#8212;diminish our desire to address alcohol misuse. The Executive believes that it is right to keep the national strategies separate. However, we need to ensure that there are links&#8212;particularly at local level, where drugs and alcohol overlap&#8212;in the planning and delivery of some services.

For Mr Gallie to talk in the media, as he did some weeks ago, of hundreds of villains walking free or, as he did this morning, of thousands of villains walking free, is disingenuous hyperbole at best.</p><p>I will now consider the Executive's role. What have we done and what can we do? First, the Crown has done everything in its power to prevent <place-holder colnum=\"481\"/> cases from being abandoned or lost as a result of the industrial action. Although only Glasgow district court has been singled out for indefinite strike action, Unison's days of all-out strike have had an impact elsewhere. In Edinburgh, it has been possible to double up the courts and keep them open. Not one case has been dropped. I am afraid that similar efforts in Glasgow were deliberately frustrated.</p><p>Secondly, Scottish ministers have a power under the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975 to intervene in the interests of efficiency by appointing stipendiary magistrates. However, that would be of no help while key supporting staff are still on strike.</p><p>Thirdly, we could introduce emergency legislation, but to what effect? Such legislation was introduced in 1979, but that was to deal with a national strike involving the High Court and sheriff courts&#8212;a more serious matter than this local dispute and one that involved civil business. Such a course of action would be unprecedented and, I would argue, disproportionate when only one local court is affected. In any case, we could not outlaw industrial action in the courts and we could not necessarily prevent cases from falling if a protracted strike were to produce excessive delay and associated ECHR challenges. Any objective and clear-sighted examination of the matter suggests that the likeliest solution lies in the swift resolution of the dispute or, failing that, an agreement that justice be exempted from the impact of the dispute.</p><p>Looking beyond the current situation, the Conservative motion calls on us to transfer administration of the district courts out of local authority hands. I would like to say something about current arrangements and about our review of the district courts.</p><p>The District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975 replaced a variety of local courts with the new district courts. The district courts are intentionally distinctive and reflect a careful and deliberate balancing of roles and responsibilities between central and local government. The role of Scottish ministers is essentially to do with judicial appointments. Under the 1975 act, local authorities are responsible for providing</p><p class=\"indent\">\"suitable and sufficient premises and facilities for the purposes of the District Court\".</p><p>The 1975 act also established local justice committees. One of their independent statutory duties is to assist or advise local authorities on the administration of the district courts.</p><p>Local justice, delivered by partnership between central and local government, is no accident, but a deliberately conceived part of our system of justice. It is therefore not something to be <place-holder colnum=\"482\"/> abolished lightly, on a whim or for reasons of political expediency, but it bears full and proper examination rather more extensive than can be given in a one-hour debate. That is why we announced a review of the district courts during debates on the Bail, Judicial Appointments, etc (Scotland) Act 2000. Since then, there have been a number of meetings and we hope to issue a consultation paper in the new year.</p><p>The review will address a full range of issues: the powers of the court, the handling of business and the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. It will consider afresh the respective responsibilities and roles of central and local government. We have undertaken that the review will be objective, will not take a position and will be a catalyst for discussion of the issues.</p><p>In short, we will consider all the options, including those that have been raised today. Our eventual proposals will be a serious attempt to secure the long-term interests of local justice rather than a short-term, opportunistic response to an industrial dispute.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-1404.2, to leave out from \"and calls\" to end and insert</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; recognises that the Crown has worked to protect business in District Courts and that this has proved successful except in the case of Glasgow, and urges the suspension of further action affecting the courts.\"</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: District Courts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If the case is a common law case, it is not time barred and will not fall automatically because the court is closed on the day that has been arranged.

I am also pleased that my first debate as Deputy Minister for Justice has allowed me to signal the Executive's commitment to working up a model of drugs courts for Scotland. I cannot promise that, as minister, I will always agree with the Opposition, but this is a nice start. I will probably always have the record for the quickest accusation of a ministerial U-turn, which happened before I had the chance to stand up in my new role, but I am heartened by the agreement that there has been in the debate, which has risen above the minor party political points that all sides have made.</p><p>It has become clear that, although on the <place-holder colnum=\"1287\"/> surface drugs courts seem like a simple option, they are not. Done properly, however, they represent an intensive intervention by the courts and criminal justice social work services, as well as treatment and rehabilitation services, working together. A number of important points have been made about that. Maureen Macmillan and Euan Robson are right to say that in considering the Scottish context we must consider not only our legal system and traditions, but our geography and population spread. I acknowledge that a drugs court model must be practical in rural as well as urban Scotland.</p><p>Bill Aitken is correct that a range of disposals is already available. I indicated that we intend to broaden the range, but the distinctive feature of the drugs court concept is the closer relationship between the criminal justice system, the treatment regime and the agencies that are involved. The element of specialism, to which Bill Aitken alluded, makes the drugs court concept different and more effective.</p><p>On the disposals that are being developed, I say to Roseanna Cunningham that in the spending review there are resources to help spread out arrest referral schemes. To Richard Lochhead, who made a plea for the drug problem in Aberdeen not to be forgotten, I say that that is one of the reasons why drug testing and treatment orders have been extended to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. That approach holds out the prospect of reducing the amount of drug-related crime; that will be its test. I have little interest in whose idea it was. That is a pointless argument, which Hugh Henry described rather more graphically. We have the opportunity to create an effective system. To achieve the results that we want, we must ensure that we set up systems that have the best chance of success.

It accounts for much of the commonest property crime, such as house breaking, vehicle crime and shoplifting. Some of that might be characterised as petty crime, but its impact is not petty. It robs our people not only of their property, but&#8212;worse&#8212;of their security, their peace of mind and their sense of community. Every member knows that that is the case in the communities that they represent. The truth is that such crime blights the lives of drug-misusing offenders and their families. That is why the Executive and Parliament have made the fight against drugs one of their top priorities and why the Executive is developing a coherent and effective response to the problems that we face from drug-related crime.</p><p>The key fact is that we cannot promote one initiative in isolation. We need a package of measures that addresses the problem at every stage. That was the message that underpinned my predecessor Angus MacKay's approach to tackling the problem of drugs in Scotland. I, too, intend to pursue that approach.</p><p>We need a balanced strategy that combines the two main elements. It is important to recognise that the criminal justice system can intervene at critical times in an offender's drug-using career. It is when individuals come into conflict with the law that they are often most motivated to seek help for their addictions. At those times, we must ensure that they have ready access to the help that they need.</p><p>A strong enforcement policy is key in our fight against drugs, but often enforcement has a greater chance of success when it sets out to tackle the underlying problems, as Roseanna Cunningham suggested.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13237315", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Courts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to reply to motion S1M-1303, although as Roseanna Cunningham said, perhaps it is a little early for me to be doing so.

Within that, an extra &#163;9.5 million is available over three years to make a comprehensive framework of alternatives to custody available to Scottish courts.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham spoke of the drug treatment and testing orders that are being piloted in Glasgow and Fife.

We have announced the national roll-out of diversion from prosecution schemes, which target those who are at the other end of the spectrum for drug treatment and testing orders. The schemes are an alternative to prosecution for individuals whose offending career is just starting. DTTOs give people the chance to address their drug use before they launch into a full-blown career of offending.</p><p>We also have plans to target medium-tariff and higher-tariff offenders by developing a new model of enhanced probation, which will build in drug <place-holder colnum=\"1268\"/> testing and treatment as a condition of sentence and will include regular reviews by the courts.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham made the point that the growth in drug-related crime is not peculiar to Scotland. That is true&#8212;the problems are international and it is not surprising that countries are keen to learn from experiences beyond their boundaries. A great deal of attention has centred on the north American experience of drugs courts. In that system, drugs courts are designed specifically to supervise drug dependent offenders who have agreed to accept treatment. Thus, that system's objectives are similar to those that we have set in our policy.</p><p>It would be too easy to believe that the American system could be picked up and transferred wholesale to Scotland&#8212;our legal system, traditions and culture must be respected. However, we are keen to learn from the United States and I believe that we can move forward to introduce a Scottish drugs court model. We have been working with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the issue and have commissioned research into the international experience. We will broaden our discussions on how to introduce and test that drugs court model. The judiciary and the prosecution have key roles to play and we must consult our judiciary, the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office on the roles that the judiciary and prosecution can undertake.</p><p>Drugs courts will be successful only if they form part of an overall framework. We must plan their introduction carefully and it is essential that we put in place the infrastructure to support treatment and rehabilitation services first. However, now that the spending review has provided the resources, we are well placed to develop those services. The drug action teams' role in local responses to drug problems has been strengthened during the past 18 months.</p><p>Taken together, the plans that I have outlined will provide a wide range of disposals that will be able to deal with the broad spectrum of drug-related crime. They will give Scottish courts all the options&#8212;arguably, more options than are available to the US drugs courts. Combined with the new resources that are available, our plans allow us to move forward on the idea of specialised Scottish drugs courts. That approach will be rooted in Scottish institutions and will complement existing practices. It must have the confidence of the courts and the general public alike.</p><p>For the first time, we have an opportunity to deliver a system that specialises in dealing with the problem of drug offenders, that blends enforcement and treatment and&#8212;above all&#8212;that has the possibility of being effective.

Today's debate is timely, as Susan Deacon and I have received an increasing amount of correspondence and parliamentary questions on a variety of dental issues. That is perhaps not surprising, as it is no secret that Scotland's dental health compares poorly with other areas of the United Kingdom. Levels of tooth decay are strongly related to deprivation: in surveys of dental health among Scottish five-year-olds, 12-year-olds and 16-year-olds, the poorest 10 per cent of children have 50 per cent of the decay. Around 56 per cent of five-year-olds show signs of dental disease. Adult dental health also remains poor&#8212;18 per cent of adults have no teeth.</p><p>There are, however, some positive signs for the future. Between March 1998 and March this year, registrations of nought to two-year-olds increased by more than 30 per cent, and registrations of three to five-year-olds increased by 4.7 per cent. In 1998, the level of complete tooth loss among the Scottish population was 18 per cent&#8212;the figure I just quoted&#8212;but that showed a considerable, if gradual, improvement on the 1972 figure of 44 per cent and the 1988 figure of 26 per cent. More dentists&#8212;2,112&#8212;are practising in Scotland this year than were last year, when the figure was 2,003. Those are positive signs, but the record remains poor and action is clearly required.</p><p>In our programme for government, we committed ourselves to taking steps to improve the nation's dental and oral health. They include a wide-ranging consultation on fluoridation, which I would like to spend a few minutes discussing. In May 1999, the Department of Health commissioned the NHS Centre for Reviews and <place-holder colnum=\"1109\"/> Dissemination at the University of York to undertake a systematic review of research on water fluoridation. The report&#8212;the most comprehensive ever on the health effects of water fluoridation&#8212;was published on 6 October.

People should not have to pay for private dental treatment when they wish to make use of NHS dental services. However, we must recognise that dentists are independent contractors to the NHS who are free to choose whether to accept any individual under NHS arrangements. Indeed, in some parts of Scotland, access to NHS dentists is a problem. In part, that has been caused by a reducing commitment to the NHS by some general dental practitioners.

I think that Dorothy-Grace Elder is thinking in particular about the fuel zones in Glasgow, where an attempt has been made to try to ensure that young people stay in school to have lunch, so that a range of healthier eating options is available to them. In Glasgow, work has been done to ensure that that happens without sponsorship.</p><p>The point is important. Diet is important in this area, which is why the Scottish diet action plan contains a target to reduce sugar intake by 2005. That encourages schools to take steps to ensure that meals, tuck shops and vending machines provide a range of healthy food and drink choices. I am delighted to hear about the schools that have implemented initiatives such as breakfast clubs, healthy eating vending machines, smart card systems for school meals and school nutrition action groups to encourage pupils to eat more healthily. We will continue to work closely with health boards and local authorities to develop and encourage healthy eating in schools.</p><p>The Health Education Board for Scotland also has a key role in the development of materials for dental and oral health professionals, voluntary organisations and the public on the prevention and early detection of oral health problems, including oral cancer. For example, key dental and oral health messages are promoted to the public through the publicity campaign, national smile week, which takes place in May each year. Many projects are local and involve local authorities, health boards and other organisations in promoting children's consumption of low-sugar food and encouraging regular toothbrushing.</p><p>We will provide free toothbrushes and toothpaste to all children at the age of eight months and target distribution to pre-school children aged one to three in areas of deprivation, which will total 100,000 Scots children by 2001.

That was formally recognised recently, when Susan Deacon hosted a reception in Bute House for past and present council members and their staff, but it is also fitting that this motion offers us the opportunity to mark in the chamber the significant contribution of the individuals who make up the health council movement.</p><p>Health councils were created more than 25 years ago to ensure that the views and wishes of the public and of patients were heard by the NHS in Scotland. While their work in the wards and committee rooms of the NHS has often been central to the development of the health service, it has often&#8212;as Mr Davidson was right to point out&#8212;gone largely unnoticed by the public and patients who benefit from it.</p><p>If anyone here doubts the influence of these lay volunteers, they need only consider the impetus <place-holder colnum=\"914\"/> that the health council movement has given to the concept of patient-centred care. Local health councils and their national association have long advocated such a commonsense concept, and the success of their campaign has resulted in a significantly increased demand for their services. They have not complained at that, however; they have simply got on with the job.</p><p>I will return shortly to the issue of work load, but I will first pause to underline the commitment and dedication&#8212;and, as Mr Harper pointed out, the cupboard space&#8212;of the 250 or so individuals who do an immense amount of work at any one time. The benefits and improvements that have flowed from health councils' partnership with the NHS and the people it serves can never be fully measured and, on behalf of the Executive, I am happy to salute the efforts of this small band of volunteers who, in the best traditions of public service, give so freely of their time and talents for the benefit of us all.</p><p>However, as Malcolm Chisholm was correct to say, anniversaries are not simply a time for congratulations; they also offer a chance for reflection on achievement, on successes and on failures and, most important, lessons for the future.</p><p>Twenty-five years of health council effort has taught us the value of listening and learning from patient experience. It has taught us the value of partnership&#8212;councils have forged strong links between people and communities and the NHS bodies that serve them. It has also taught us the value of progress, through renewal and modernisation. The health council movement has, like the NHS, which it serves, changed beyond recognition in its lifetime.</p><p>The Executive shares with the health council movement a commitment to listening to and learning from direct patient experience. The programme for government pledges to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"strengthen the patient's voice and . . . work to ensure that patients, and their carers and families, get the response and support they need through every stage of their care.\"</p><p>Our partners in the health council movement strongly support that commitment, which encapsulates a change in culture for which they have long argued.</p><p>A change in culture is required whereby the NHS learns to listen to and act on the direct experience of patients and carers. The message is clear. Patients and carers want a seamless approach to the delivery of care and to receive the care that they need quickly and with confidence. Only a culture of partnership can provide that.</p><p>Partnership working is at the heart of our plans to modernise the NHS in Scotland. It is a different way of developing and implementing health and <place-holder colnum=\"915\"/> social care, which will enable us to harness the ideas, enthusiasm and commitment of the staff who deliver the services and the patients and public who use them.</p><p>As several members said, involving users in the redesign and reconfiguration of services offers the best prospects of soundly based decisions that achieve sustainable improvements. A partnership with patients is at the heart of the health council movement. Patients are a part of developing the vision of the patients project, to which Patricia Ferguson referred. It is a project that will ensure that boards and trusts become and remain more patient centred and publicly accountable. It will involve more members of the public in the health service, in different ways, so that they will become more skilful and knowledgeable, as will the service professionals with whom they are involved.</p><p>When Susan Deacon met the Scottish Association of Health Councils last year, it supported that vision but felt that the challenge and work load associated with such a step change in the culture of the NHS presented the movement with some key questions about its future direction and development. In spite of the fact that, as Patricia Ferguson pointed out, health councils have gone through two major reorganisations since 1975, they agreed to do so again and to examine the need for and role of the health council movement against the background of the wider public involvement agenda. Funding has been provided for a development officer to support health councils further in that work.</p><p>With the decision to develop a Scottish health plan, we are keen to build on the unique public involvement experience of health councils and their staff. We have therefore commissioned the Scottish Association of Health Councils and the chief officers group to submit papers addressing the strengths and weaknesses identified in current patient and public involvement arrangements.</p><p>The chair of Greater Glasgow health council has agreed to be a member of a group to consider what the plan might say on policy development and public involvement. Two health council chief officers have been seconded from their posts to provide full-time support to the development of the plan. The involvement of the movement in developments is central. The abolition of community health councils that is outlined in the English NHS plan is of no direct relevance to the process in Scotland; indeed, our solution will be a Scottish one.</p><p>We remain committed to ensuring that the public and patients are fully involved in the design and delivery of our health services. We can achieve that only by drawing on the experience of the health council movement, which we are celebrating tonight.

Our knowledge is developing. We will get back to Keith Raffan, who I know takes a proper interest in the matter.</p><p>I will say a little about some of the background. Tattooing, particularly of young people, has been mentioned. The Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 makes it an offence to tattoo young persons under 18 years of age. An age limit is in place but, except in Edinburgh, as Sylvia Jackson explained, Scottish local authorities do not have specific powers to regulate skin piercing businesses. Some local authorities have taken an active interest in such businesses. As Sylvia Jackson said, that is reflected in the fact that the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health has recently produced a guidance note in response to inquiries from councils.</p><p>We should not, as Brian Monteith said, assume that those who provide skin piercing services are universally irresponsible. At the UK level, the European Professional Piercers Association and <place-holder colnum=\"853\"/> the Association of Professional Piercers have produced guidelines for their members and would have to be included in any consultation arising from our concerns.</p><p>Sylvia Jackson outlined the legal position in England and Wales, which I will not take the time to repeat. The UK Government has concluded that primary legislation should be introduced in England and Wales to give local authorities outside London specific regulatory powers. However, parliamentary time at Westminster has not yet been found.</p><p>Consent is a difficult issue, as many parents are content for their children to have their ears pierced and parents will differ from each other and from their children in their belief of what is acceptable at particular ages. The Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 states that a child under 16 does not have the legal capacity to enter into a transaction unless specifically allowed by statute, so there is some protection, at least in insisting on consent from the parent. One of the two associations to which I referred says that procedures should not be carried out on anyone under the age of 16 without parental consent. The other says they should not be carried out on anyone under the age of 18. I appreciate that that falls short of some of the concerns that have been expressed this evening.</p><p>In closing, I return to the key issue raised by Sylvia Jackson: the need to address the possible health risks of body piercing. The Executive recognises the need to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of current arrangements and to consider what different arrangements may be necessary. We are committed to conducting a consultation exercise. I confess that the commitment on that was made some time ago and that this evening's debate has allowed me to return to it. I instructed officials today to prepare the consultation exercise as soon as possible and to set it in motion before the end of the year, at the very latest. I will give Parliament a timetable for it in due course and information on how it will be carried out.</p>", "hdate": "2000-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13236215", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Body Piercing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That seems an entirely reasonable request and I undertake to do so.

That is not a new commitment. Mary Scanlon made it at the Tory party conference back in June&#8212;or did she? What she said on 26 June was that health care for the elderly would be free. However, that is not what Sutherland recommended. Three days later, she announced that nursing care for the elderly would be free.

We have developed national care standards for the first time. We have created space in this year's legislative programme for the creation of the commission for the regulation of care. We will respond to the remaining recommendations next week.</p><p>The Tory motion gives the game away. It is focused solely on the personal care recommendation.

I acknowledge Michael McMahon's role in that, and in securing today's debate.</p><p>As Richard Simpson pointed out, palliative care in Scotland is a success story of partnership between the national health service and the voluntary sector. Michael McMahon also made the important point that the principles and approach of palliative care should inform the care of all patients. The fundamental concern of palliative care is to respond to the totality of each person's needs. It should be provided in the setting which best meets those needs, whether in hospital, at home, in a nursing home or in a specialist palliative care unit.</p><p>The motion makes the link between cancer survival and the need for palliative care, and that link with cancer reflects the origins of modern palliative care, as Richard Simpson mentioned. Michael McMahon is right to acknowledge some improvements in the figures for cancer survival. For the majority of cancers, survival has increased substantially over the past 20 to 25 years. That applies particularly to malignant melanoma of the skin, to testicular cancer, to leukaemia and to colorectal cancer. It is also true of breast cancer.</p><p>International comparisons are always difficult, because of differences in population coverage, data quality and case mix. For most cancers, however, the prospects for Scottish patients who survive for up to five years after diagnosis are excellent. Driving those improvements further is, and must be, a priority.</p><p>As several members have said, cancer survival is only one element in determining the need for palliative care. I know that, for some time, the providers of palliative care have been looking beyond the traditional association between palliative care and cancer.</p><p>It is now clear, as several members have mentioned and as the Scottish Executive accepts, that the principles of palliative care have a much wider application. They should be brought into play from the time of diagnosis onwards, not just in the terminal phase of an illness. They can transform the management of other progressive conditions; motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease are the two that are most mentioned, but HIV/AIDS and our other clinical priorities, coronary heart disease and mental health, can be added.</p><p>Palliative care can bring enormous benefits to patients with end-stage heart failure. That is a clear example of a need which all too often goes unmet. That is something that our coronary heart <place-holder colnum=\"637\"/> disease task force has picked up on and will mention in its report.</p><p>The role of palliative care in relation to mental health has been fully set out in the report, \"Positive Partnerships\". Patients with severe mental illness who go on to develop a life-threatening illness must have their physical symptoms relieved. They also need psychological and spiritual support, and our ability to work together in the best interests of the patient is always tested in tackling a combination of physical and mental health needs. The palliative care approach gives the best chance of success.</p><p>The motion mentions the need to ensure that palliative care is adequately included in strategies for the care of people with cancer and other chronic illnesses. The Scottish cancer group leads and directs Scotland's cancer strategy. It strongly represents the voice of palliative care, and I can assure members that palliative care is an integral part of the development of cancer services.</p><p>Key documents are health improvement programmes, trust implementation plans and joint social care plans, which require consideration of the cutting across from the NHS to social work. However, I take on board Fiona McLeod's comments&#8212;she has now gone, I presume to Inverness&#8212;regarding social work services, and I will consider them further.</p><p>Every health board in Scotland has developed a palliative care strategy. To date, 31 hospitals in Scotland have either specialist palliative care teams or palliative care support nurses. However, we are not complacent. The Scottish Executive health department has commissioned the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care to undertake an assessment of how far the health boards' strategies embrace the palliative approach.</p><p>Further, in conjunction with the agency, we are encouraging the development of a managed clinical network in palliative care, with specific reference to pain relief. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline on cancer pain has recently been published, and the evidence base for the network is in place.</p><p>As Michael McMahon said, the knowledge is there; those are the kinds of measures that should help to spread the good practice that every speaker has said that we must achieve. We have also funded the pilot programme of hospices as resource centres and we are analysing the results so that we can roll the programme out across Scotland.</p><p>Standards are being developed for palliative care which the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland recognises as the underlying core principles of care for all patients with cancer. <place-holder colnum=\"638\"/></p><p>Those standards are being fully incorporated into the standards for colorectal, lung, breast and ovarian cancer care.</p><p>Much is said by the Scottish Executive about modernisation, and people jump to the conclusion that it must mean hi-tech equipment or new buildings. There is a place for those, but I agree with the message that has come across in the debate, that a modern NHS has to care as well as treat. Modernisation of the NHS is about making its services more caring; as has been said, that is the future of the health service in Scotland.</p><p>Palliative care is patient centred. It is very difficult, but it demonstrates that we can put our aspirations for the NHS into practice if we have the imagination and commitment to do so. The widespread support from all parties for the cross-party group on palliative care is a clear and welcome sign of that commitment, which I am sure will continue through the lifetime of this Parliament.<place-holder time=\"17:37:00\"/></p><p><i>Meeting closed at 17:37.</i></p>", "hdate": "2000-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13235626", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I too welcome the formation of the cross-party group on palliative care.

It did so last September and has done so again today. That common ground is welcome and essential if we are to build the decisive consensus that we need to turn Scotland's health record round. Ken Macintosh was right to cite the example of drink driving to show that we can change the culture in Scotland for the better.</p><p>The consensus that has been achieved today extends to our accepting the Conservative amendment, which adds to our motion. However, we do not accept the SNP amendment, which seeks to replace some of the motion.</p><p>We have seen a decisive shift in action and resources&#8212;the courage to use the significant additional resources for the NHS to refocus their distribution on inequalities. We have seen the dedication of further resources very specifically to fund public health through the health improvement fund.</p><p>The CMO's review of the public health function has ended the decline in public health medicine that Kay Ullrich referred to.

Sir David's report highlights particular concerns about young people with mental health problems, as Duncan Hamilton mentioned.</p><p>It is staggering that one in four of us will be affected one way or another by mental illness, each with their own specific problems and difficulties, yet it is an area of health that has not received the public attention that it should have. Allied to that is the high rate of suicides in Scotland, also referred to today&#8212;874 in 1999&#8212;which is deeply worrying. That is a huge problem to be addressed and has been a neglected area, but we are beginning to put that right. Mental health is a priority for HEBS and in our health promotion efforts generally.</p><p>The &#163;26 million health improvement fund that Susan Deacon announced last month includes resources for measures aimed at promoting good mental well-being and tackling suicide among young people.

It is a strength of this Parliament that it can find time to discuss a condition which, as Ms Robison said, is little understood and about which there is a lack of awareness.</p><p>Fibromyalgia is a difficult and complex condition, as all the speakers in this debate have indicated. It is true that it is not fully understood, even by some medical professionals. There has been a great deal of commitment from both professional and voluntary organisations, but gaps remain in our knowledge about its cause, diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>We heard about a number of case studies in this debate, and it is clear that fibromyalgia can be the cause of considerable pain and disability. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward, <place-holder colnum=\"254\"/> universally adopted, accepted diagnostic test for the condition. There is not even general agreement about what it should be called. It has been referred to not only as fibromyalgia but as fibrositis, fibromyositis, fybromyalgia syndrome or muscular rheumatism.</p><p>The condition is characterised by pain and tenderness in the muscles or the tissue next to the muscles. It is often accompanied by fatigue and sleeping problems. The difficulty faced by the medical profession is that such symptoms can be caused by a wide range of medical conditions, due to a spectrum of causes. In the case of any particular patient, the doctor may be unable to make a definite diagnosis. The condition appears to be most common in women, as Mr Robson said, although it also affects men and children.</p><p>Since Mr Robson's correspondence with the Minister for Health and Community Care, to which he referred, I am pleased to say that we have found some incidence statistics, gathered by the information and statistics division of the common services agency of the national health service in Scotland.</p><p>Some 2,029 people with fibromyalgia were seen in the year to 31 March 2000. That figure came from a sample of 53 Scottish general practices, taken from different communities and with a combined population of 307,741. That would give an incidence of 0.66 per cent for Scotland. The incidence referred to in the motion may be rather higher than there is evidence for, but I cannot dispute that the uncertainties surrounding fibromyalgia and the fact that the statistics depend on diagnosis by GPs may well mean that there are undiagnosed cases.</p><p>The NHS provides a range of services to which people with the condition have access, some of which may alleviate some of the symptoms. Aerobic exercise such as swimming and walking can improve muscle fitness, heat and massage may give short-term relief and antidepressant medications can help improve the quality of sleep and muscle relaxation. Many people with fibromyalgia may also benefit from a combination of exercise, physical therapy and relaxation.</p><p>The motion suggests that the condition is frequently overlooked or minimised by doctors. Let me make it clear that that should not be the case. All general practitioners receive appropriate training to help them meet the needs of their patients. Training for general practice is intended to provide the future GP with the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to provide quality services to NHS patients. That should and does include conditions for which the diagnosis and treatment are not yet well understood. That approach is designed to ensure&#8212;as Ben Wallace was urging&#8212;that future doctors have an improved <place-holder colnum=\"255\"/> capacity to respond to changing patterns of disease, changing needs and modern patterns of health care delivery. Nevertheless, I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed. The understanding of conditions with no known cause or cure should include an understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. Today I have asked the chief medical officer to look into the matter and to assure me that it is included in training for general practitioners.</p><p>The motion refers to access to benefits, which as we all know is a matter reserved to the Westminster Parliament. However, there is no condition that either automatically entitles a person to disability benefits or automatically excludes them. Everything depends on the effects that a condition has on a person's capacity, not on the name of the condition that is diagnosed. If members are aware of cases of constituents who are having difficulty with benefits&#8212;which should not happen&#8212;or insurance claims, as Mr Robson described, the best route is for the local member to take them up.</p>", "hdate": "2000-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13234422", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fibromyalgia Syndrome"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join Euan Robson in congratulating Shona Robison on her success in obtaining this debate today.

In all cases, health research funds are not ring-fenced for particular conditions. However, priorities for budgets reflect analysis of the burden of disease and of potential benefits. Within those parameters, the chief scientist's office, which is the Scottish Executive health department's principal source of research funding, is always prepared to consider well-founded applications for research into a wide variety of conditions. Indeed, the CSO is currently providing more than &#163;10,000 funding for a research project at Ninewells hospital medical school, whose work Ms Robison referred to and which began on 1 September.</p><p>That project, which is a study of bone mineral density in patients suffering from this syndrome, follows a recently completed project on the role of physical trauma in the onset of fibromyalgia.

I am pleased that so many members have signed the motion and have either spoken or sought to speak on it. That reflects the growing interest in dementia, which is a great and important thing. Dementia is a disease that many fear and misunderstand. We have to overcome such fear and misunderstanding.</p><p>The Executive agrees with the motion: the care of people with dementia represents one of the greatest challenges to health and welfare services throughout Scotland. As several members have said, there are around 61,000 people in Scotland with dementia, and as Dorothy-Grace Elder said, two thirds of that number have mild dementia and often live in the community at home or with family. The third who have moderate to severe dementia tend to be in a care home or hospital. That means that many agencies such as health boards and trusts, local authorities and the voluntary sector have a responsibility to improve the quality of care for people with dementia.</p><p>Care is a complex of early-stage service support, medication where appropriate, counselling services, respite care, home care, day care, adaptations to housing or special needs housing and sometimes long-term care, all of which have been mentioned by many members.</p><p>That matrix of services makes the \"Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland\" very relevant, as Dr Richard Simpson pointed out. Launched in September 1997, its continuing aim is to focus the efforts of all agencies to ensure that <place-holder colnum=\"62\"/> the required complex of services is available. We have already said that there is still much work to be done on implementation of the framework, and the mental health and well-being support group continues to visit health board areas to push this work forward.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposed Scottish commission for the regulation of care will have a major role in ensuring and improving the quality of care available to people with dementia, in both day care and residential care. The importance of the quality of care was mentioned towards the end of the debate.</p><p>Indeed, the National Care Standards Committee is drawing up national standards by which all services will be regulated. The draft standards on care for older people have been prepared by a working group that has been chaired by Professor Marshall, who is the director of the Dementia Services Development Centre, and are out for consultation.</p><p>It is right that the motion should acknowledge that much of the progress in dementia care in Scotland has been driven by organisations such as Alzheimer Scotland and the Dementia Services Development Centre, which is based in Stirling. We should acknowledge Alzheimer Scotland's leading role in the Alliance for the Promotion of the Incapable Adults Bill, which worked so constructively with the Parliament in the passage of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.</p><p>The Dementia Services Development Centre has done much innovative work in areas that have been referred to, such as training, and it has done some extremely important work on dementia-friendly design. Its work in both of those areas can be seen played out in day and residential care throughout Scotland.</p><p>A range of community care policy developments by the Scottish Executive will contribute to better services for people with dementia. They include joint working between agencies, supported by the modernising community care fund; the carers strategy, which was announced in November, and the developments that will flow from that; and, as Mary Scanlon mentioned, the work of the joint futures group, which will be developing its recommendations this month in four seminars around Scotland. Many of those developments are recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care of the Elderly. As has been said, the recommendations that are relevant to funding care will be progressed in the forthcoming spending review.</p><p>Mary Scanlon made the important point that those who have dementia should retain their dignity. It is central to our community care agenda that care should be designed to what users want. <place-holder colnum=\"63\"/></p><p>That holds good for people with dementia. The Dementia Services Development Centre has nearly completed a two-year project seeking to develop ways in which people with dementia can be encouraged to express their own thoughts and feelings on the services that they receive and on how service practitioners and service providers listen and act on those views. That gives an important underpinning to the improvement of the quality of care.</p><p>Such innovative work is typical of the work of the centre and is one reason why we provide it with &#163;133,900 a year. For some time, the centre has been planning a new building as the next stage in its development. More than &#163;1 million has been raised by public appeal from individuals and from organisations in the Scottish financial and business community. I am glad to take this opportunity to announce that we are contributing &#163;500,000 to allow the centre to proceed to the tendering stage.<place-holder colnum=\"64\"/></p><p>We have hardly touched on a subject that has a broad range of aspects, but time is short. The Scottish Executive acknowledges that we can do much to improve the quality of care and services that is provided for people with dementia. We have begun the process of change, but we are only at the beginning. We will continue to support that process, to which this debate has contributed.<place-holder time=\"17:18:00\"/></p><p><i>Meeting closed at 17:18.</i></p>", "hdate": "2000-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13233765", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia Awareness Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mr Chisholm on securing today's debate.

I have participated in a number of fund-raising events for Waverley Care Trust, although&#8212;unlike Margo MacDonald&#8212;I have never sung on its behalf, which is probably wise. As David McLetchie said, Milestone House is situated in my constituency. However, I must make clear the fact that it is as the Deputy Minister for Community Care that I speak today.</p><p>Milestone opened in 1991 as an 18-bed unit for men and women. It was developed as a resource to provide residential respite, palliative and terminal care for people with HIV-related illness. Interestingly, it was, I believe, the first of five AIDS hospices that were planned for Scotland but it was the only one that opened. It is designated as a nursing home, and the type and volume of the services that it provides are in response to the identified need and predictions for the course of HIV at the time.</p><p>That is true of the whole service package in Lothian for people with HIV-related illnesses, including other Waverley Care Trust initiatives such as the Solas resource centre and the clinical care that is provided by the NHS. The fact that those predictions were not realised has led Lothian Health, City of Edinburgh Council and Waverley Care Trust to review those services.</p><p>Through the effective communication of prevention messages to vulnerable groups, and through the introduction of new combination drug therapies, many fewer HIV patients develop AIDS. <place-holder colnum=\"699\"/></p><p>People who have AIDS are now living with the disease rather than dying from it. In 1999, the number of new HIV infections was 157, the lowest number since 1994. In 1999, the number of diagnosed AIDS cases&#8212;and I think that Margaret Smith cited this figure&#8212;was 54 compared to 126 in 1993.</p><p>When Milestone House opened, it was also thought that HIV was more easily communicated than has proved to be the case. Therefore, at that time there was a perceived public health case for isolating AIDS patients. As the number of new AIDS cases has reduced markedly, and is likely to remain at that level, the case for sustaining a separate hospice is much weaker. At Milestone House, the number of people who require palliative care has dropped from more than 25 a year to around seven a year, and in the first nine months of 1999 there were only three deaths there, many fewer than there had been in previous years.</p><p>That is good news, but is no cause for complacency. Any let-up in the prevention and education work would run the risk of allowing such welcome trends to reverse. That is why we continue to invest in HIV prevention. The group that is reviewing HIV health promotion will report to me in the next few weeks. However, the changes in the understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS mean that health and social care provision must be reviewed and that the delivery of services must be modernised. With that in mind, Waverley Care Trust and its two funding partners have carried out two major reviews in recent years. There has not been a rushed review or consideration.</p><p>It is the responsibility of Lothian Health and City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that appropriate provision is made. They must ensure provision for those for whom combination therapy is ineffective or inappropriate, and they must ensure that that provision delivers both respite and palliative care as well as the range of other support that is required.</p><p>The recommendations from the second review since 1998, which are being considered, propose, as David McLetchie said, that services that are currently provided at Milestone House should cease on 31 March 2000, provided that appropriate alternative respite resources have been developed and put in place to ensure the minimum disruption to users. That recommendation was made on the basis that a more flexible model of respite care provision will be required to cater for the changing needs of different populations that are living with HIV&#8212;gay men, drug users and people who have been infected via heterosexual transmission. In practice, the new service means better targeted respite <place-holder colnum=\"700\"/> support along with community-based services that are provided at home.</p><p>The proposed new service configuration was described accurately by David McLetchie, and I do not intend to go through it again. The service must be viewed alongside prevention and education work and alongside the clinical health care that, in Lothian, now requires a budget of more than &#163;2.6 million for HIV and AIDS-related medicines.</p><p>Lothian Health and the local authority are actively trying to identify a suitable site for this new type of facility, the aim being to find a site that is more readily accessible to users than Milestone House. I echo some of the comments that have been made about the tranquillity of the current site. However, the appropriate site for the delivery of the service must be a decision for Lothian Health, the local authority and Waverley Care Trust. I repeat that it is my understanding that existing services at Milestone will continue until the new service provision is established. That is clearly an important assurance to give.</p><p>The new services will have to be funded according to the appropriate criteria for health and social work services. Waverley Care Trust will, in due course, agree the funding package with its partners. Those services are delivered by a partnership of Lothian Health, the council and the voluntary sector provider, which is Waverley Care Trust. I expect that to continue to be the case, but the detail of the package will depend on the configuration of services, which is rightly a matter for the partners involved.</p><p>I understand that the review team, which included Lothian Health, City of Edinburgh Council and Waverley Care Trust, is content with the outcome of the review. Last month, the council adopted the recommendations in principle, and Lothian Health will consider the review at its board meeting next week. People have called today for a swift conclusion to the review; I think that the demands in those calls will be met.</p><p>If the case for a specialist hospice provision in Lothian is not made, I do not think that the case for a national hospice in Edinburgh is made either. Research points to people preferring to remain in their own homes and to be as independent as possible. The thrust of thinking in community care generally is against services that take people far from home and family. However, I take the point that Milestone has been used by people from outside Lothian. Currently, the number of residents of Milestone from outside Lothian is around 11 per cent&#8212;one or two residents at any one time.</p><p>I also take the point that the residents have to have access to a proper mix of services. In that light, I have asked my officials to check with all health boards and their local authority partners to <place-holder colnum=\"701\"/> ensure that, like Lothian, they have in place a proper mix of service provision for HIV and AIDS sufferers. It is their clear responsibility&#8212;as it is the responsibility of Lothian Health in Lothian&#8212;to have the right mix of services available to meet the needs of the users of those services. Needs change, and so do services. However, the principle of meeting needs does not change, and that is the principle to which we must hold as we consider this change in service configuration.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13231762", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Milestone House Hospice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have been aware of the work of Milestone House and Waverley Care Trust for many years and have visited Milestone House on a number of occasions and in a number of capacities, most recently last year as the Deputy Minister for Community Care.

Michael Matheson is right: we should acknowledge the good work that has been done and the many dedicated members of staff who work in that area. I also agree with Michael's view about what is an historic day. Lothian made a proud boast last year that no one with a learning disability in Lothian lives in a long-stay institution. By the end of this year, no one from Lothian will live in a long-stay institution anywhere in the UK.

However, Mr Hamilton is in danger of failing to lift his eyes above the immediate future to look towards the long term. Any commitment on funding made by me today would have no validity whatever in 10 years' time. It is important that we change the priority for people with learning disabilities and the configuration of services that support their lives, because such steps will still be making a difference for people with learning disabilities 10 years from now. The amendment lacks that long-term vision.</p><p>While we are still on resources, Mr Hamilton also made the point that we cannot pay for old and new at the same time. Of course that is correct, but that is exactly the purpose of the change fund. In my opening speech, I said that we will soon make clear the extent of that change fund within the spending review process.</p><p>We know that the broad policy for community care for people with learning disabilities is right&#8212;today's debate has shown that. However, we also know that being in the community is not the same as having a full and fulfilled life. Mary Scanlon and Richard Simpson both made the point that we must have confidence in the new services. For elderly carers, that is a key issue, and we must acknowledge that it is easier to have confidence in bricks and mortar than it is to have confidence in a care package. One reason the commission for the regulation of care, which will be introduced, through legislation, next year, will regulate and inspect day services and services delivered at home is to give us that confidence.</p><p>Mary Scanlon was also right to point out that the number of people with learning disabilities is growing annually. That may be because people are living longer, but I agree that more research must be undertaken, and that will be one of the functions of the Scottish centre that we intend to set up.</p><p>Many members have drawn attention to the fact that we have waited 20 years for the review. If that is the standard&#8212;we hope that it is not&#8212;we will not get this chance again in our political lives. Well, most of us will not, but I suppose that it is possible that Duncan Hamilton will get the chance again during his political life. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I do not want to <place-holder colnum=\"224\"/> think about that. The crux of the matter is that that standard is the same for people with learning disabilities. We must get it right this time for them, and that is why I welcome constructive criticism. I will address some of that criticism briefly.</p><p>Placing local area co-ordinators in local health care co-operatives is but one suggestion and we are keen to discuss how that should be organised. Tricia Marwick talked about the range of tenancies in supported accommodation. I believe that we need a range of tenure options, but Scottish Executive guidance on tenancies is clear that full tenancies should be the norm, and I will discuss with colleagues how we can ensure that that guidance is adhered to. However, the debate gives me the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the work in that area of housing associations, such as Key Housing Association, Ark Housing Association, the Carr-Gomm Society and many others.</p><p>I am pleased to say to Tricia Marwick that the chief nursing officer will review the training of learning disability nurses and their role in the light of the review.</p><p>Richard Simpson and several others talked about the importance of getting the reprovisioning process right when we consider closing institutions. That process must be transparent, it must be done with consultation, it must involve users, it must involve carers and&#8212;I say this to Dennis Canavan&#8212;it must involve staff.</p><p>Dennis Canavan spoke about what he called repatriation. I assure Dennis that location is not a funding issue. However, I say with reference to the hospital at Larbert that, because reprovisioning involves every local authority in Scotland, it is hard to see how that can happen without some bureaucracy. That situation was created many years ago, as the example that Dennis gave illustrates. The key thing when arranging packages is that people should have someone who can act as their advocate. I commend Dennis Canavan for being an efficient and effective advocate for some of the patients at the hospital in his constituency. Nora Radcliffe and Johann Lamont talked about the importance of advocacy generally, and I assure them that that is a key recommendation of the report.</p><p>Given that it is Down's syndrome awareness week, we should note that this debate has been not about people with learning disabilities, but about us. It is our attitudes that must change. Learning disabilities must be much more to the fore in our minds. We have come some of the way, but the difficult part of the journey lies ahead. Margaret Smith is right&#8212;that is a responsibility of everybody in this chamber and beyond.</p><p>In my opening speech, I spoke about the <place-holder colnum=\"225\"/> meeting of an ex-staff member and an ex-patient from Gogarburn, which took place just outside the chamber. That ex-patient's journey had taken him from Gogarburn to the doors of this Parliament. This review has opened those doors today, and we must never again shut out people with learning disabilities. Tricia Marwick was right: people with learning disabilities may not find a place in the sun, as the world can be a palace of the winds, but the world is where they want to be&#8212;the same as us.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13230456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Learning Disability Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not in danger of setting up a dichotomy, false or otherwise.

As politicians, we must take responsibility for that, or for some of it at least. I hope, therefore, that members will value the opportunity to debate this matter in its own right today.</p><p>People with a learning disability will continue to be denied the fullness of citizenship if we do not change the way in which we view them. We must overcome the public's negative views, professionals must manage less and listen more and attitudes must change. Politicians must show a lead, which is why it is important to bring the voices, the aspirations and even the dreams of people with learning disabilities to our Parliament for the first time. For too long, learning disabilities have been no one's priority; the learning disability review is about changing that.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, most European countries have been developing new, modern and effective services and support for people with a learning disability. Indeed, much progress has been made in Scotland, where we have some fine examples of innovative services. More than 4,000 fewer people live in long-stay institutions, but a further 2,000 Scots could live more independently. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, no one should be in hospital because they have a learning disability.</p><p>A learning disability is not an illness. That is the headline of the review, but at its core are values the Parliament holds high. It puts people first. It promotes social inclusion, equality and fairness, and the opportunity for people to improve themselves through continuous learning. Sadly, those are the very qualities that people with learning disabilities have often not enjoyed to date.</p><p>Anyone who thinks that the review is just another glossy document is badly mistaken. It reflects strongly the experiences of people throughout the country, many of whom have never before have been asked what they think, feel or want. It is the authentic and powerful voice of people with learning disabilities. No one who was at the launch of the review a month ago can deny <place-holder colnum=\"196\"/> that.</p><p>The previous review of services for people with learning disabilities in Scotland was carried out more than 20 years ago and addressed the balance between hospital and community care. This review, too, began by looking at those services, but it changed course almost immediately, to concentrate instead on people's lives and lifestyles. It recognised that people's lives are what matters and that services must support them. That was a watershed. It conditioned the review and the report, and I believe that it must serve as an example to this Parliament for its future thinking.</p><p>The review involved people who use services, and their carers. It involved visits, speaking directly to people in their homes and holding seminars. It also had a well used website. Users and carers were members of the national steering group and they conducted their own roadshows to bring out views and opinions. I took part in some of the visits and attended some of the conferences. I also held an interview on the website. I wanted to see and hear what people thought and felt, and that was made powerfully clear to me.</p><p>The most potent message of what is possible always comes through personal example. I think of one young woman, whom I met in Aberdeen, and her mother. They provided an outstanding example of the approach that we want following the review. The young woman has a learning disability and a physical disability. She uses a wheelchair, electronic communication and a carer whom she interviewed and appointed herself. Through her care manager, Grampian Service Brokerage, her family and, above all, her determination, she attends college, swims, goes to aromatherapy classes and works for Asda part time. It is no special job&#8212;she monitors and controls the closed-circuit television, which is bad news for shoplifters as she is particularly adept at tracking them. The one part of the job that she cannot do, her carer does. Asda gets a valued worker, she gets the chance to earn a proper wage and the shoplifters get their collar felt. A job, a home, some leisure time, a life&#8212;that is what \"The same as you?\" means.</p><p>There are 29 recommendations in the report and they all contribute in some way to what people want. People want more control and say over their lives. The recommendations would strengthen advocacy services and extend people's entitlement to direct payments. People want better-quality, more consistent and more person-centred care and support.</p><p>Under the recommendations, there would be a new type of local area co-ordinator to organise support in the community; personal life plans for <place-holder colnum=\"197\"/> everyone with a learning disability who wants one; and more help and support through short breaks. People want new opportunities that support inclusion. We need modernised day services that focus on personal development and employment. We want people to have more mainstream and less specialist supports, and more integrated and better-developed community-based services that will lead to the closure of the remaining long-stay hospitals by 2005.</p><p>Above all, people want a new vision for learning disability generally. We propose, therefore, to set up a new Scottish centre for learning disabilities. It would be a resource to support users, carers and agencies, to promote public awareness and to tackle discrimination and stigma. We also propose to set up a national network for people with an autistic spectrum disorder and to introduce partnership in practice agreements that would give a clear focus for local authorities and health boards when working together to develop services. Finally, we propose to create a change fund, to help local authorities move quickly towards the vision for people with learning disabilities.</p><p>We have sent out about 7,000 copies of the report&#8212;I had some trouble getting one for myself today&#8212;and are asking for comments on its implementation by the end of August. I make no apologies for the review taking 18 months to complete. The effort to ensure that it was accessible and inclusive was important. I make no apology for now ensuring there is the time for a wide constituency to hear and engage with its conclusions.</p><p>I attach considerable importance to the views of the Parliament's committees&#8212;the Health and Community Care Committee, the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee and the Education and Lifelong Learning Committee&#8212;and that is why I am pleased that the whole Parliament has this opportunity to discuss the recommendations. The review is the start of a 10-year journey. I want to go forward with a fair wind from this chamber.</p><p>We cannot stand still and wait. I intend to keep up the momentum. We will make an early start on setting up the Scottish centre. We expect to go out to tender soon and it is my aim to have the centre up and running this autumn. The centre is pivotal to reshaping the future. It is a key marker of our commitment to the vision of the review. I intend to entrench the user and carer perspective, which has run through the process of the review, in the work and management of the centre, which will be a key player in making a reality of the recommendations.</p><p>We have begun discussions with some of the key organisations that will be involved in <place-holder colnum=\"198\"/> implementing specific recommendations. The need for new resources to implement the review as a whole, particularly through the change fund, is being considered carefully in the current spending review. Those who might try to argue that nothing can happen without new resources are simply wrong. We expect local authorities and health boards, with their local partners, to make an early start on identifying where they can do better within the existing pool of resources.</p><p>Local authorities and health boards spend more than &#163;270 million a year&#8212;a substantial amount&#8212;on direct services for people with a learning disability. Too much of that&#8212;37 per cent&#8212;is tied up in bricks and mortar and in services that lack the focus that this review demands. The review makes very clear that the key resource issue is the priority given to people with learning disabilities and what it is spent on. That has to change if any increase in resources is to deliver what we want. The review indicates how we can spend better.</p><p>\"The same as you?\" can move learning disabilities in Scotland from negative to positive, from policy drift to a vision for the future, from people with learning disabilities being ignored to their being valued.</p><p>The solution is not easy, but in one sense it is as simple as this: someone I know who worked years ago in a long-stay hospital told me that she met an ex-patient whom she had known as one man in a ward of many. She said hello and asked what he was doing these days. The first thing he said was, \"I don't live in Gogarburn any more and I get to choose what I do.\" That's what \"The same as you?\" means.</p><p>This Parliament is accountable to the people of Scotland. They include people with learning disabilities who have made clear what they need and want. I hope that we can embrace their vision, endorse these recommendations and discuss how we deliver them.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes that the report of the Learning Disability Review, The same as you?, was issued on 11 May to a wide range of consultees, calls for the fullest possible debate on how its recommendations should be implemented, and looks forward to a future where all relevant agencies work together with people with learning disabilities to ensure that they can live as full lives as possible in our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13230456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Learning Disability Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We spoke about learning disabilities recently, in the debate on community care, but learning disabilities have not had their due place on the community care agenda.

It is not entirely neglected: 97 research projects on various aspects of dyspraxia are taking place in the UK today. Some are aimed at improving the condition <place-holder colnum=\"1199\"/> in adults; although most of the debate has focused on children, this is a lifelong condition, as Duncan Hamilton correctly said. There is also a much wider body of research into conditions such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which are associated with dyspraxia. In Scotland, the Royal Aberdeen children's hospital is doing research into dyspraxia and there are eight ADHD projects&#8212;one at Ninewells hospital in Dundee and seven at the Yorkhill hospital in this city.</p><p>Dyspraxia is not easy to diagnose, partly because it has so many symptoms that can be present in any combination. We have heard about many of the symptoms during the debate&#8212;general clumsiness, confusion between right and left, extreme sensitivity to touch, poor short-term memory and body awareness, and difficulty with learned tasks such as using a pencil or cutlery, or getting dressed.

I make the point that the map is a clinical one, not a political one. There is no standard accepted medical treatment to help dyspraxia, but educational support can help almost all children with dyspraxia; that has been graphically described during the debate. In schools, a learning support teacher is often involved. If necessary, referrals can be made to community child health and to educational psychology. A medical officer and a psychologist can see the child, meet the parents and decide what needs to be done.

Children with dyspraxia will be among those who will benefit from the &#163;12 million inclusion programme that was announced by Peter Peacock in the debate on special educational needs. Members who were in the chamber will recall that he recognised that in-service training for teachers was crucial for the early diagnosis of dyspraxia. That has been one of the points&#8212;although, I agree, not the central one&#8212;that has been raised in the debate. He pledged that resources would be made available to work towards increasing the effectiveness of in-service training.

I want to report on progress across the community care programme, update the Parliament on some initiatives and indicate some milestones ahead.</p><p>Community care services look after some of the most vulnerable people in society. A significantly falling number of vulnerable people, but still too many, live in hospitals. The vast majority of people with care needs live in the community. A relatively small number live in residential and nursing homes. Most live either on their own or with their families. A lot get help from informal carers, be they family, friends or neighbours.</p><p>Community care services have to deal with a growing case load. We are all living longer. Family situations are changing and informal care is not always available. People with severe disabilities are surviving at birth and living longer and people with high levels of dependency are now living in the community rather than in hospital. Quite rightly, the expectations of people who use services and their carers are also rising.</p><p>The aim of community care is to improve people's lives and opportunities. We aim to do that by: putting people at the centre; enabling them to be included in the community by supporting them, preferably in their own homes; providing services that are flexible, cost-effective and appropriate to people's needs; ensuring quality services by regulating care services and staff; and encouraging joint working towards a joint future for service agencies. Those are the cornerstones. But community care does not stand still. In some areas, we are doing what was unthinkable not that long ago. Community care must constantly progress and improve. That is our aim.<place-holder colnum=\"776\"/></p><p>The Executive's programme for government set out our commitments and our priorities. We have launched a strategy for carers. Next year, we will establish a social services council to increase the professionalism of the social care work force; we will also establish the Scottish commission for the regulation of care.</p><p>Last week, I launched the Executive's review of services for people with learning disabilities. People have waited for more than 20 years for this review, and many have waited a lifetime for the changes that it heralds. We are gathering responses, to further refine it between now and August, and it is my intention that this Parliament should have the opportunity, as part of that process, to debate the learning disability review in its own right.</p><p>The review proposes: a new kind of care organiser, a local area co-ordinator, to organise individualised support for people, to ensure that the services that they receive are those that they need; more access to direct payments, to allow people with learning disabilities to build for themselves the service and care package that serves them best; lifelong service planning, to manage the transitional times in people's lives. Too often, support can fail when someone moves from school to adult life, from the parental home to independent living, or when they are living on their own, when carers die and are no longer there to care for them. The review also proposes the closure of all remaining long-stay hospitals for people with learning disabilities by 2005.</p><p>Within a month, I intend to set in motion the creation of a Scottish centre for learning disabilities, to ensure that the momentum behind the review is maintained. However, I do not claim credit for the review or its launch: it was people with learning disabilities and their carers who created and launched it. The review made visits and spoke directly to people in their homes. It held seminars that people were able to attend and set up an interactive website that many people made good use of. People who use services and their carers were also members of the review's national steering group, had their own consultative group and carried out 11 road shows throughout Scotland.</p><p>That is exactly how we want to go about making the new Scotland: through genuine and comprehensive consultation, outside the usual suspects and vested interests. We want to involve service users throughout the system, and to put people's experiences at the heart of our thinking. People's experiences will not be just at the heart of the Executive's thinking, but at the heart of the thinking of every agency that is involved.</p><p>When I launched the carers strategy, in November last year, we doubled resources that <place-holder colnum=\"777\"/> were earmarked for carer services. I undertook to ensure that local authorities consult local carers organisations in developing new and improved services. That dialogue is taking place as we speak, and I have taken part in some of it. It is a tough negotiation, but a real and meaningful one that will shape the services that are available to carers throughout Scotland.</p><p>At the same time, the carers legislation working group that was promised in November, which includes carers and their organisations, has met on several occasions to develop proposals for new carers legislation. A few weeks ago, in this city, I launched the biggest-ever Scottish Executive social services media campaign to put hidden carers in touch with services for the first time. Hundreds of people have responded to our adverts in the newspapers and on local radio. They have responded to the national health service helpline, which, since 1 April, has been expanded and extended to include advice for carers. The helpline staff were trained directly by carers and their organisations. The publicity materials for the hidden carers campaign were produced in conjunction with the carers organisations. Every step of the way, we have moved this strategy forward in partnership with carers themselves.</p><p>Carers organisations have welcomed their role, but they have pointed out to me, quite rightly, that I have increased their work load. I am pleased, therefore, to announce that I am making available a further &#163;200,000 to help voluntary organisations that represent carers to play their part in supporting the implementation of the carers strategy. That will enable them to work more closely with local authorities and health boards, and with carers themselves, to develop the new and innovative services that carers need and want. I shall write to carers organisations today, to invite them to submit bids for those resources.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13228241", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate provides a welcome opportunity to restate the importance of community care to the Scottish Executive's agenda of improving the lives of the people of Scotland.

I acknowledge that it may fill a place in the continuum of caring that is not covered by other associations. That association is of the kind that could and should bid for the money I have announced. I will ensure that it is included when we write to organisations about the money.</p><p>Involving users in service design is the best assurance of quality standards, but we also have a duty to secure standards. Plans are well in hand to legislate next parliamentary year and to establish in 2001 the Scottish commission for the regulation of care and the Scottish social services council.</p><p>The commission will regulate services in a systematic, sensible and balanced way. It will cover not just those services regulated at present but also home care and local authorities direct provision. It will ensure a level playing field for providers and quality assurance for users of services. We have set up the national standards committee to prepare the ground for the commission. It is developing standards, in close consultation with all stakeholders, including users and carers.</p><p>I am pleased to announce today that I have authorised the publication of the first tranche of standards, covering residential care for older people, children and people with mental health problems. That will be sent out later this week for wide consultation. Further sets of standards will be issued in due course; home care will be included in the next set.</p><p>The Scottish social services council will regulate staff. We have two aims in that: we want to protect vulnerable people by ensuring that those providing services are appropriately regulated; but the need to encourage the professionalism, education and training of staff is at the heart of our policy. We have been very pleased by the responses received to the consultation paper. A policy paper will be issued next month containing our proposals for both bodies.</p><p>We are also making significant progress on mental health. The mental health framework is now beginning to deliver. I met recently with some of those benefiting from its implementation in Aberdeen. Success there is firmly based on user participation in the planning group&#8212;not token but 50 per cent user participation. Earlier this year, Susan Deacon and I hosted a mental health <place-holder colnum=\"779\"/> summit to hear at first hand how we should accelerate progress. The outcomes will help shape the way ahead, with the mental health and well-being support group driving progress throughout Scotland.</p><p>For the elderly, our work on care standards, on the carers strategy and on the encouragement of more user-focused, integrated services all serve to meet many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly. We will extend direct payments to people over 65 this year, extending the opportunity to purchase flexible care packages suited to their individual needs&#8212;another recommendation of Sir Stewart Sutherland's commission. Funding for care is being actively considered as part of the spending review. People need a system that is sustainable, fair and consistent, and I am determined to deliver that.</p><p>If user involvement is common to all those initiatives, so too is joint working, which has moved on enormously since community care as we know it was implemented in 1993. However, there is still a long way to go. The crux of the matter is that we must stop organisational, cultural and other barriers affecting the way in which we deliver services. I do not want to hear that the services that people need are delayed by debates or disagreements about who is responsible for providing them.</p><p>People want speedy, reliable and effective services. They want just one assessment wherever possible. They do not know or care who provides the service. They want to avoid duplication, delay and frustration. Those were the key themes of \"Modernising community care: an action plan\", and we have provided funding of &#163;7.5 million this year to back the changes outlined in that document.</p><p>There are signs of positive change, but too often change is project-based or applies only at an operational level. The level at which strategic and financial decisions are made is often where such ideas are not well developed. Agencies need to concentrate on using the knowledge that they have gained on joint working and applying it further upstream. For example, I would like programme budgets to be developed for the whole of a client group or an area, or more substantial change such as that envisaged under the Perth and Kinross Invest to Save project. Everyone now has some experience of joint working. The time for piloting and analysis has passed; it is time to move onwards and upwards.</p><p>Driving that movement is exactly the purpose of the joint futures group, which I chair. Our main task is to agree a list of joint measures that local authorities, boards and trusts should have in place, and to set deadlines by which that is to be <place-holder colnum=\"780\"/> done. The group has identified a range of subjects that are well known and well recognised. It is considering how to develop better systems and approaches for shared assessments, and how to share information better between social care, health and housing. We know that those things should be in place. They will help to overcome the professional, organisational and cultural boundaries, and they will focus on more integrated services, reducing the bureaucracy and improving outcomes for users and carers. The group is also considering other issues, such as the balance of care between residential and home care, options for charging for personal care at home and how to share best practice among the relevant interests.</p><p>There are many examples of good practice. Care services have changed enormously. Between 1994 and 1998, community care services have supported a reduction of more than 7,000 long-stay beds and increased respite admissions to residential care homes by 54 per cent. Staff numbers in home care have increased by 13 per cent, and more and more packages of intensive care of over 10 hours are being delivered.</p><p>Those figures illustrate the positive overall trends, but the examples are all around for us to see.</p><p>We have successfully closed Gogarburn hospital in Edinburgh and successfully provided alternative care services in the community. Joint working was at the heart of that. The closure plan was sustained through two restructurings in the health service and the reorganisation of local government, but the will was there to make it work, and it has worked.</p><p>In Glasgow, Inclusion Glasgow creates packages of care that comprise a mix of funding from health, social care and housing. Of 28 people who used to be in Lennox Castle, all have their own home, seven own them and some have jobs. None has returned to hospital.</p><p>In Ayr, two local NHS trusts and the local council formed a rapid response team to prevent hospital admissions and facilitate early discharge, and there is close working with all professions. As a result, between January and March this year, 819 acute bed days were freed up, there were 108 early discharges and 85 admissions were prevented.</p><p>Joint working does deliver, but it can deliver much more than better services. I do not doubt that we will hear criticism of service provision this morning. I would be astonished if we did not. Some of that criticism will be justified and some of it will not be. I do not doubt that we will hear much talk of where resources are and how many resources there are. I hope that we will also hear something of the vision and the imagination that <place-holder colnum=\"781\"/> we need&#8212;the vision that drives the best of community care in Scotland.</p><p>That vision should fire our imagination, as anyone who was at the launch of the learning disability review will know. That review started off as an examination of services, but it quickly turned into an examination of people's lives. After all, it is not only the NHS that saves lives, nor is it only surgeons who give back the possibility of participation in the richness of life, but our social workers, care assistants and home helps. It is not only the Prison Service that incarcerates but, too often in the past, the learning disabled hospital, the acute psychiatric ward and even the residential care home.</p><p>Too many lives have been lived in the shadows. The common thread in our community care agenda&#8212;its purpose&#8212;is to bring those lives out of the shadows. That thread runs through the carers strategy, the learning disability review, the new care standards, intensive home care packages and the extension of direct payments.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13228241", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to acknowledge the work that Sylvia Jackson has done with the Relatives Association Scotland, bringing representatives to meet me to discuss the role they feel that the association can play.

I am well aware of the contribution of the Epilepsy Association of Scotland and its partner organisations toward enhancing awareness of epilepsy in Scotland and improving services&#8212;as is Susan Deacon, who has met representatives of the organisation. In November last year, she addressed a Scottish Executive funded symposium on epilepsy organised by the EAS. I know that she joins me in endorsing all that has been said&#8212;most recently by Gordon Jackson&#8212;in praise of the work of the Epilepsy Association of Scotland and its partners in the Joint Epilepsy Council and of all that they are doing to improve the public perception of epilepsy.</p><p>As every member has said, epilepsy is not an uncommon condition. As Mr Watson correctly said, an estimated one in 130 of the population has the condition. The great majority of them&#8212;70 per cent or more&#8212;will lead full and productive lives once they have been assessed and started on appropriate treatment. Mr Watson made an interesting point when he said that that must mean that there are people around who could be role models for others but who, for whatever reason, feel unable to come forward. As Margaret Ewing said, it is possible to go into history to find role models. The three that I came up with are Julius Caesar, Peter the Great and Byron. I am not sure they are role models for a normal life, but the point is that it seems that only by reaching back into history do we find role models. There must be role models around now, which would help.</p><p>Epilepsy still seems to inspire fear and hostility in some people. It is difficult to imagine why. Epilepsy is not contagious and a person having a seizure is not likely to harm anyone else&#8212;the stigma attached to it is irrational and rooted in the ignorance and superstition of the past. There is no place for it in the Scotland that we want to see.</p><p>As members are well aware, the current clinical priority areas in Scotland for physical illnesses are coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer. They are the big three killers and they must be tackled first. We do not propose to add epilepsy to those clinical priorities, but that is not to say that we neglect the condition or consider it unimportant.</p><p>There has been a considerable drive in the NHS in Scotland to improve treatments for people with epilepsy. One of the initiatives that we can take pride in is the Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network, known as SIGN. SIGN guidelines bring together all the evidence about a particular condition and present a digest of best practice.</p><p>A SIGN guideline, the \"Diagnosis and Management of Epilepsy In Adults\", was published <place-holder colnum=\"772\"/> in 1997. It covers nine key topics, such as how to diagnose epilepsy, when to start treatment and choice of first drug. We are not complacent: the guidelines can be improved. Arrangements are now in hand for revising and updating the guidelines, which will be distributed throughout the NHS. I hope that that provides some of the momentum that Mr Watson called for to ensure wider adoption of good clinical practice throughout health boards and health trusts.</p><p>We are also ready to learn from work done elsewhere. One of the last publications of the English clinical standards advisory group was a report on epilepsy. We have made arrangements for the executive summary of the report, with the information that the whole document is available on the Department of Health website, to be distributed to the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>We expect both publications will be of interest to health boards and NHS trusts in reflecting and planning the provision of services for people with epilepsy in their areas.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13228222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Epilepsy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am, as Gordon Jackson put it, the man minister.

I hope that those two publications will provide momentum in bringing about the improvements for which members have argued.</p><p>Good communications between primary and secondary care are essential, as Dr Simpson said. We are seeking to promote the concept of managed clinical networks, which will benefit people with many conditions, particularly epilepsy. I know that managed clinical networks do not sound as exciting as some advances in health care, but they are a powerful way of redesigning services so that all the points at which patient care is delivered are linked. They cross traditional boundaries between primary, secondary and tertiary care and bring together all the health care professionals involved in delivering the service, which is extremely important when dealing with a condition such as epilepsy. Not only are clinicians around the country exploring the idea; the Epilepsy Association of Scotland has signalled its willingness to play an active part in the development of services. Its engagement is both <place-holder colnum=\"773\"/> crucial and welcome.</p><p>We should not forget those whose epilepsy is associated with serious disabilities or learning difficulties, or both. The Scottish Executive acknowledges that without the extensive care provided by informal carers, more people would need support from the statutory services to remain in their homes. The national carers strategy is one measure that will benefit the carers of people with epilepsy.</p><p>Least of all should we forget the small minority of people with epilepsy who die suddenly and unexpectedly&#8212;often very young, and sometimes without ever having had a seizure previously. That is why we are contributing to the national sentinel audit that is currently being carried out by Epilepsy Bereaved, to ensure that its work covers Scotland, too.</p><p>Our determination to advance our understanding of the condition is also demonstrated by the fact that the chief scientist office is currently funding two two-year research projects at a cost of some &#163;277,000.<place-holder colnum=\"774\"/></p><p>As always, we do not have time to give as much attention to this issue as everyone would like.

Apart from anything else, it is a bit of an all-embracing motion for a 90-minute debate. However, I welcome the choice of this morning's topic, which is of great importance. I have to agree with colleagues on the Scottish National party benches that it is a pity that the Tories chose not to address the motion that they lodged. Mary Scanlon spent more time talking about the Minister for Health and Community Care than about the elderly and disabled people who feature in her motion. They received no mention at all.</p><p>I welcome the debate because improving support for our more vulnerable fellow citizens is precisely the kind of opportunity offered to us by the people of Scotland almost a year ago. I join Mary Scanlon in welcoming the decision by the Health and Community Care Committee to conduct a major investigation into community care and care for the elderly.</p><p>Since last year, we have increased investment <place-holder colnum=\"319\"/> in services for older people to around &#163;2 billion. Making something of the opportunity that we have means not only spending more but spending better. It means putting people at the centre of services, listening closely to what the people who use those services have to say and acting on that.</p><p>Every time I meet representatives from older people's organisations or disability groups, they all ask for widened access to direct payment schemes, to allow them to have care packages tailored to individual needs. I confess that that is not a message that I expected to hear, but it is a pervasive one. I have listened, and the Executive will, this year, extend direct payments to people over 65. That is an improvement to service demanded by those who want to use the service.</p><p>The overriding message that I hear is that, like everyone else in Scotland, older people and people with disabilities want to live full, independent and secure lives. We do not presume that older people are passive recipients of services, but where people need support, they expect it to be flexible, appropriate, efficient, sustainable and of high quality. That is why we have focused on better and quicker decision making, helping more people to get care at home, and that is why we insist on agencies working better together.</p><p>We are taking steps to ensure that we move from rhetoric about the benefits of joint working to real changes that benefit the users of services. This year, &#163;7.5 million has been invested specifically to do that. It is unfortunate that Mrs Scanlon does not recognise that agencies can work together. Indeed, Highland Council has been able to appoint someone to lead on children's services, and there is no reason why bodies providing services for older people cannot also work together.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226903", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elderly and Disabled People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It will come as no surprise that I reject the terms of the Conservative motion.

That is why we will establish the Scottish commission for the regulation of care, which will for the first time enforce uniform national standards in all areas of care&#8212;residential, day and home care&#8212;whoever provides it. Older people themselves are being fully involved in the process of drawing up the care standards that will be used. The standards of residential care for older people will be issued for wide consultation very soon.</p><p>We have also recognised as never before that much, and perhaps most, of the care that is delivered in Scotland is provided by informal carers. As we speak, carers throughout Scotland are discussing with local authorities how the &#163;10 million that has been earmarked for carers services will be used. That is local authorities being held to account: not by the Executive, but by the people who depend on the services that the authorities provide. Carers who have never received support are responding to a media campaign to identify hidden carers. Those are not small measures&#8212;they will make big differences.

It is not the first time that he has raised the matter in the chamber, and I am sure that it will not be the last. I am glad that many MSPs have supported the motion and have spoken in this evening's debate.</p><p>One life ended through suicide is a tragedy. More than 1,000&#8212;the figure mentioned by Mr Gibson&#8212;is a huge and unacceptable waste, bringing in its wake untold grief for families, friends and loved ones. There is little point in further rehearsing the statistics that Mr Gibson gave so succinctly. We must do all in our power to stop this appalling loss.</p><p>We must consider the variety of contributing factors. Mental illness plays a significant part and contributes to about 30 per cent of the total number of suicides, of which around 15 to 20 per cent spring from severe depressive illness, and about 13 per cent from schizophrenia. However, there are other factors. Misuse of alcohol or controlled substances is often implicated, creating intolerable personal and domestic problems and loosening inhibitions, facilitating the act of suicide.</p><p>As many members have said, life circumstances cast a sombre shadow. Poverty, unemployment, inhospitable environments, money problems and <place-holder colnum=\"1515\"/> dreary housing conditions can all combine to make life seem no longer worth while.</p><p>It is worth returning to the focus of Mr Gibson's motion, that young men are particularly vulnerable. The reasons for that, which have been referred to, are correct. They may lack helpful family support. They may have poor prospects of a worthwhile job. They may lack a sympathetic ear to confide in. Indeed, they may find it difficult to confide even if that sympathetic ear is available. They therefore deserve our special attention.</p><p>Against that background, there is much that can be done, and is being done. A raft of measures are being taken by the Executive to improve quality of life, to enhance job prospects, to deal with social exclusion, and to create a climate of tolerance, support and social well-being. They are all necessary, and will help to tackle the problem. However, I agree that we need to take more specific steps. Some have already been taken. For example, in September 1998 the Government introduced important new measures to reduce pack sizes of paracetamol and aspirin, which was aimed at reducing the incidence of impulsive overdose, and introduced new warnings on labels to emphasise the risks associated with overdose.</p><p>Richard Simpson referred to the framework for mental health services in Scotland, which offers best practice in the organisation of care and preventive measures. It recognises the isolation that can lead to suicide attempts, and encourages health boards and their partner care agencies to organise programmes of assertive outreach, which ensure continuing contact with those considered to be at risk. Indeed, the framework also promotes suicide prevention projects in collaboration with interest groups and the voluntary sector, as Mr Gibson said.</p><p>Mental health is one of the three main clinical priorities for the national health service in Scotland. That is signalled in a number of ways. Spending on mental health has kept pace with general health spending over a period of years, but this is not the debate to pursue the point that Mary Scanlon made. We are increasingly conscious of the need not just to deal with mental health problems, but to promote positive mental health. Clearly, that could have an impact on suicide prevention.</p><p>There has been much discussion of research. The chief scientist office and I are open to suggestions for research that will help to reduce the suicide figure. A good deal of research is on-going. For example, the Executive is contributing to the funding of the national confidential inquiry into suicides and homicides by people with mental illness. That inquiry is examining the health records of all individuals who have committed suicide or homicide and who were in contact with <place-holder colnum=\"1516\"/> mental health services in the period up to the incident. The study hopes to identify common behaviour patterns, symptoms and so on in exactly the way that many members have referred to tonight. Indeed, the first report of the inquiry, entitled \"Safer Services\", which covered only England and Wales, was published last year. We are looking at its recommendations, and we await its next report, to be published shortly, which will cover Scotland. We hope that it will give us the information that we need to take our strategy forward.</p><p>The chief scientist office, which has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services, has awarded funding of more than &#163;135,000 in the past three years for two projects related to suicide and deliberate self-harm, but that is part of a wider national and international research effort. Indeed, the national research register lists 168 current research projects on suicide, so much research is being done, but Mary Scanlon was right: it is difficult to see what evidence there is for the effectiveness of prevention strategies. Many trials have been too small to generate conclusive findings. Even in high-risk groups, for example, those with a history of self-harm, fortunately, suicide is still a rare occurrence. Although in such a group its incidence is 100 times what it is in the general population, the suicide rate is still only one in 100. Sometimes it is difficult to move from research to practical measures.</p><p>Mr Gibson is right that there is experience elsewhere. Susan Deacon visited Finland earlier this year to discuss with her opposite numbers their approaches to a number of matters. One of them was suicide prevention, in which they have had some success. We are reflecting on the Finnish experience and whether it could be applied here. One of the lessons that was learned was that it takes 10 to 15 years to see the effect of trying to reverse such a tragic trend as that to which Mr Gibson's motion refers.</p><p>I am sorry that I cannot, in the time that is available to me, respond to all the points that have been raised, but I would like to conclude by welcoming the interest of Mr Gibson and other members in this very emotive issue. It is an issue that the Executive is determined to tackle through both general and specific measures that are informed&#8212;as is appropriate&#8212;by the available research.</p><p>It is incumbent on the Executive to listen to suggestions and we will examine those that have been made by Mr Gibson and others in the debate.<place-holder time=\"17:41:00\"/></p><p><i>Meeting closed at 17:41.</i></p>", "hdate": "2000-04-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226057", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Suicide"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to Mr Gibson for raising this difficult and serious issue.

The Executive intends to bring the provisions for attorneys and access to accounts and funds into force in April 2001. Part 5 will come into effect in the summer of 2001. As Roseanna Cunningham said, provisions on care establishments will follow in the context of our proposals for the new Scottish commission for the regulation of care, which will take over the supervisory role referred to in part 4. Our target for putting in place the commission is April 2001. However, that will depend on the legislation needed to set it up. Intervention orders and guardianship will come into effect in April 2002.</p><p>The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Bill is the first large bill on a major policy area to be passed by the Scottish Parliament. As Christine Grahame said, it will put Scotland alongside the best systems of law in the world on this subject. If the Parliament were to vote against the bill today, it would put back by years&#8212;as Dr Simpson mentioned, hundreds of years&#8212;any reform of the law protecting one of the most vulnerable groups in Scotland.

As Mr <place-holder colnum=\"1088\"/> Gallie has pointed out, amendment 144 seeks to widen the appeal provisions in section 48A. It contemplates decisions taken by a sheriff being appealed to the sheriff principal.</p><p>However, part 5 of the bill, to which the amendment refers, does not envisage that a sheriff will take decisions on medical treatment.

Moreover, section 2(6) provides a general appeal provision in circumstances where there is no specific appeal power.</p><p>Against that background, I turn to Executive amendment 155. Section 48A provides that an appeal can be made to the Court of Session with the leave of the sheriff principal. That is in line with appeal provisions elsewhere in the bill. However, in this case, there is no right of appeal to the sheriff principal and it is considered unnecessary for the sheriff principal to be involved in determining whether there should be an appeal to the Court of Session. The decision on leave to appeal to the Court of Session should rest with the sheriff.

That debate followed the comprehensive stage 1 led by that committee.</p><p>This debate provides an opportunity to address the issues again, as well as enabling the Executive, through amendments 140 and 141, to demonstrate still further its determination to ensure that the rights of proxies are given due place and that we have a framework that works well, as it is impossible&#8212;as Phil Gallie rightly said&#8212;to find a perfect solution that will please all those with an interest in the matter.</p><p>I expect disagreements between a proxy and a doctor over medical treatment to be few and far between. In most cases, disagreement will be <place-holder colnum=\"1069\"/> resolved quickly by amicable discussion. Doctors will have careful regard to objections that proxies raise and most proxies will be ready to be convinced of the need for treatment if there is such a need. When such agreement is not quickly reached, the involvement of a second doctor might well help the parties to reach a shared decision. I will take this chance to point out that, at stage 2, the Executive accepted amendments&#8212;particularly from Dr Simpson&#8212;that ensure that the second doctor is independent both of the first medical practitioner and of the health board. They will be appointed from a panel by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p><p>However, our efforts today should not be aimed at establishing the primacy of one group or the other&#8212;proxy or medical practitioner&#8212;but rather at doing our best to establish a framework in which the best decision for promoting the health of the adult can be made. The framework that we painstakingly reached at stage 2 is the right one on which to build. That framework stresses consultation, discussion and the involvement of independent opinions. It allows either party to call the decision of the other into question and it opens the appeal route to both parties and to any other person who has an interest in the personal welfare of the adult. Importantly, it allows a challenge where the nominated doctor says that the treatment should not be given. It is a framework of openness and reflection; it stands in contrast to the assertion of the right of one party or the other to what would effectively be a veto. Above all, the framework puts the rights and the safeguarding of the adult with incapacity at the centre, where they properly should be.</p><p>In practice, there are relatively few circumstances in which serious disputes could be imagined. The first, and most unlikely, of those is that a proxy and doctor could collude for their respective interests to withhold treatment from an incapable adult, with the intention of causing or hastening death. Unlike the amendments lodged by Mr Gallie and Mr Chisholm, section 47 as it stands permits anyone who has an interest in the personal welfare of the adult to challenge the decision in the Court of Session.</p><p>The second circumstance would arise if a hospital doctor believed to be necessary a treatment that the carer feared might have unwanted side effects and therefore opposed. Amendments 138 and 139 would force both parties into an unpleasant confrontation in court if the matter could not be resolved by discussion. Section 47 sets in train a mechanism for resolving the disagreement by involving an independent medical practitioner, nominated by the Mental Welfare Commission. It is not enough to say, as Mr Gallie's and Mr Chisholm's amendments do, that the proxy must give reasons for refusing <place-holder colnum=\"1070\"/> consent. Who is to say whether the reason is a good one? What sanction exists if the proxy simply fails to give a reason? The amendments stay silent on those questions.</p><p>Section 47 also gives a voice to relatives who hold no official appointment, by allowing an appeal to any person who has an interest in the personal welfare of the adult. At stage 2, however, the Justice and Home Affairs Committee considered that we should bring in greater lay representation, and the Executive amendments would enable proxies, in cases where they so desired, to bring a lay opinion into the process. That is the purpose of amendments 140 and 141. The person could be a lay person, or the adult's general practitioner, or someone from a voluntary organisation that had an interest.</p><p>We believe strongly that section 47, as it stands, is a way of moving forward&#8212;from the debate that tries to suggest that either proxies or doctors always know best&#8212;to a framework that allows the best solution to emerge for the adult with incapacity. We hope that it commends itself to the chamber today.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13224675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 47 &#8212; Medical treatment where guardian etc has been appointed"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This group of amendments revisits the comprehensive debate in the Justice and Home Affairs Committee at stage 2, concerning the right&#8212;or otherwise&#8212;of a proxy decision maker to refuse consent for medical treatment to be given to an adult with incapacity.

The Executive has not changed its view that we should reject the amendment. I will explain our serious concerns about the proposals that it contains.</p><p>Mental disorder is one of the two threshold criteria in the bill for assessing incapacity, the other being inability to communicate because of physical disability. Incapacity must then be assessed in relation to particular acts or decisions. That functional approach is extremely important. The purpose of the two threshold criteria is, as Mr Gallie said, to limit to some extent the group to which the bill applies. There would be grave risks in assessing incapacity without some kind of threshold. It is not the bill's intention to class as incapable people who merely made decisions that others thought were unwise or irrational.</p><p>The amendment introduces an alternative threshold criterion of \"mental disability\", which we consider to be imprecise and unhelpful, as it is <place-holder colnum=\"1041\"/> likely to catch too many people within its scope. Mr Gallie said that his was a broader definition&#8212;our view is that his definition is too broad.</p><p>Mr Gallie's amendment refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"impairment or disturbance of mental functioning\".</p><p>However, that concept is potentially very subjective. There is a danger that those responsible for assessing incapacity would be encouraged to take into account the quality of a person's decision-making process in determining whether they were legally incapable. Such subjective judgment could damage the rights of people whose capacity or incapacity was being considered.</p><p>The definition of mental disorder in the bill is drawn from the terminology used in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. There are considerable advantages in consistency between different pieces of legislation and in familiarity for the medical and legal professionals and others who work with those definitions. During stage 2, we said that we are prepared to review the definition once we have received the Millan committee's recommendations. If necessary, we shall amend the incapacity legislation at that time.</p><p>However, we do not think that the definition in the amendment of</p><p class=\"indent\">\"retaining the memory of decisions\"</p><p>adds anything to the bill. Further explanations will be provided in codes of practice and guidance.<place-holder time=\"14:45:00\"/></p><p>An incidental effect of the amendment appears to be the fact that it removes the requirement to try to communicate with the adult by whatever means suit them, before deciding that they are incapable. That may not be intentional, but it was considered extremely important by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee at stage 2 and runs counter to the Executive's policy that communication should always be attempted in a way that best helps the adult concerned to express themselves effectively.</p><p>If, as Mr Gallie said, the amendment has been prompted by lingering concerns about whether the definition of mental disorder covers all the underlying conditions that should be included, specifically the effects of head injuries or a stroke, our medical and legal advice is that those conditions fall within the definition. That ties in with well-known international medical terminology.</p><p>The definition already spells it out that mental disorder is \"however caused or manifested.\" \"However caused\" is intended to cover whatever physical accident or illness led to the condition causing incapacity.</p><p>The Executive acknowledges that the current <place-holder colnum=\"1042\"/> definition of mental disorder in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 needs to be reviewed and updated. That is why the committee chaired by Bruce Millan was set up to undertake that work. When it reports, we will have the advantage of the Millan committee's wide public consultation and expertise. We will then be able to maintain the advantages of consistency between incapacity law and mental health law. We will also avoid the likelihood of two changes to the existing definition in quick succession, which would be difficult for both professionals and the public to follow.</p><p>The Executive's view is that it would be most unwise to accept this change to the carefully considered definition of incapacity in the bill.

Public engagement will be judged.</p><p>Codes of conduct and accountability have been in place since 1994 and stress the importance of openness and dialogue with communities. Health board and trust members have to subscribe to the codes when they are appointed. The code of accountability makes it clear that boards and trusts are accountable, through the chief executive of the NHS and the NHS management executive, to Scottish ministers. The chief executive, as accounting officer, is also accountable to Parliament.</p><p>Board members also have a clear line of accountability; they are appointed by the Minister for Health and Community Care on behalf of the Scottish ministers. As ministers, we are accountable to Parliament. Since 1995, there has been a code of practice on openness; boards and trusts must abide by the code, which was extended in 1998 to ensure that all trust board meetings are held in public.</p><p>We do not regard the codes as sufficient; they need to be renewed. We are working towards establishing the appropriate balance of advice, <place-holder colnum=\"707\"/> guidance, training and support&#8212;mentioned by Margaret Smith&#8212;and, where appropriate, statutory provision, to create an accountable, inclusive NHS fit for the Scottish people. That work will be informed by other changes, such as the introduction of the Ethical Standards in Public Life (Scotland) Bill and the freedom of information legislation under consideration by Parliament.</p><p> If members cast their minds back to the debate of 16 December, they will remember that we are committed to widening the range of people who are appointed to the boards of health bodies so that boards are more representative of Scottish life. In that debate, Susan Deacon undertook to write to every member to ask for their help and I am happy to renew that call today. We are actively seeking people from a range of backgrounds to broaden the representation on boards. Susan Deacon has written to a wide range of bodies in Scotland to try to do that.</p><p>Most boards already have local councillors as members and we want that practice to continue. I do not say that that is enough. Indeed, Susan Deacon and I have made it clear to NHS chairmen and senior managers that they must forge open relationships with staff, patients and their families, local communities and elected representatives. They must ensure that there is constructive communication about the development of service provision.</p><p>Margaret Smith spoke about relationships with staff, particularly in the context of one of the committee's reports. At a national level we have established the Scottish partnership forum, which brings together&#8212;around, rather than across, the table&#8212;NHS staff representatives, trade unions, management and Government. That way of working is being rolled out across the NHS and local partnership forums are being formed. Structures are being introduced to bring about the cultural shift to which Margaret Smith referred.</p><p>I think the committee recognises that health boards and trusts face a difficult task in redesigning local health services to provide modern and responsive care that meets real local need. Health boards and trusts also face the difficult task of engaging and communicating effectively. There will be some hard decisions to make, some of which will be met with informed and reasoned opposition, as has been the case with local fears about the future of Stracathro. I stress once again that no decisions have been made yet about the future of services at Stracathro or at any other facility in Tayside.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13223614", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Boards and NHS Trusts (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are reviewing the system of NHS governance and looking at performance indicators and related measures of accountability.

That is particularly true if proposed changes involve mental health facilities and, in particular, facilities for mentally disordered offenders.</p><p>There is unanimous agreement on the need for a local forensic unit to serve Glasgow's population. The siting of the unit was always going to be a controversial issue that would cause considerable public and media debate. The guidance on health and social work care for mentally disordered offenders that was published in January 1999 put into effect modern thinking on care for the mentally ill. Few people these days argue that it is in the best interests of patients to keep them locked away in old Victorian institutions, miles from their families and homes.</p><p>Where possible, care should be provided in the community in an environment that maximises the possibility of rehabilitation and return to an independent life. Of course, that care has to be provided under conditions of appropriate security, with due regard to public safety. We cannot expect the public to accept that if we do not engage with them. The difficulty of getting that right was highlighted in the public debate on the proposed unit at Stobhill hospital and we must learn from that experience.</p><p>Richard Simpson's very detailed report has raised important issues for both Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Executive. We are considering the report and will respond shortly. I am confident that Greater Glasgow Health Board knows that it must learn from the experience of Stobhill when it carries out public consultation exercises in future.</p><p>Steps are already being taken in the Executive to ensure that, in future, the NHS will engage in effective dialogue with the people it serves. What does that mean? Effective dialogue and communication is about engaging, openly and transparently, the people and communities who will be affected by a decision. It cannot be done at the end of a process to inform those concerned of the decision that has been taken. It must evolve and involve.</p><p>Effective communication is about a process in which information is shared and dialogue is fostered in an attempt to reach common understanding and a shared decision. It is about recognising that when people and communities are involved from the beginning, supported and <place-holder colnum=\"709\"/> informed, they do not make irrational decisions. Real dialogue recognises that people and communities can make tough choices and take difficult decisions when they are informed about the issues and feel that they have been part of an inclusive process.</p><p>As Margaret Smith said, effective communication has to happen day in, day out, not just when major issues are being dealt with. Under our patients project, we will improve the way in which the NHS communicates with patients, their carers and their families. We will ensure that the NHS engages local communities in a partnership founded on trust, based on a willingness to share information and to consult widely and comprehensively. We will work to create a climate that ensures that NHS staff, patients and their families, and local communities and their elected representatives, are involved and can contribute to the development of the services that are provided by their NHS.</p><p>However much we change and improve the culture of consultation and dialogue, we must always remember that we need to improve and change our NHS. We must take our people with us. We must not only inform and consult them, but support and involve them in the development of the services that they use. That is not easy, but it is essential. The work of the Health and Community Care Committee is a welcome contribution to getting it right.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13223614", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Boards and NHS Trusts (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I repeat the point that the delivery of services and the balance between access and appropriate high-quality services are the substance of the acute services review.

I recognise that it is doing so in West Lothian&#8212;although not only there, as Dr Simpson indicated. I am grateful for the opportunity to make one or two points in reply, and in particular to explain the policy that applies to car park charging by NHS trusts.</p><p>I will start by making a few general points. We all know that there are very few hospitals with sufficient space to cope with the demand for car parking within hospital grounds. Car park spaces, <place-holder colnum=\"1273\"/> therefore, are at a premium. People often arrive at hospital under stress. They are not helped by selfish motorists, some of whom may not even be in the hospital, who abuse the car park system. The inevitable results include double parking, parking on yellow lines, pavement parking, the use of disabled bays by non-disabled individuals and unsafe access to main entrances at peak times. Hazards are created for staff, patients, visitors and ambulance crews. Complaints and frustrations sometimes can lead to difficult, and even violent, situations.</p><p>Hospitals are encouraged to be crime conscious, but cars parked in hospital car parks are easy targets and are often broken into and vandalised. The introduction of additional security inevitably means increased costs for trusts. No one wants the funds for that security to be diverted from the funds for direct patient care. The decision to charge for car parking facilities is one that must be taken locally by trusts. In considering proposals to charge, trusts are best placed to address all the issues in the light of local circumstances and to take account of the needs of staff, patients and visitors.</p><p>Car park charging in hospitals is well precedented throughout the UK. In Scotland, a number of NHS trusts have already introduced schemes. Those schemes had the approval of the Scottish Executive health department, and took into account the ground rules that were drawn up. Indeed, as a couple of this evening's contributors indicated, trusts and health boards have recently been reminded of those ground rules. We expect them to be applied consistently when consideration is being given to implementing charging schemes.</p><p>I am happy to re-emphasise those ground rules for Fiona Hyslop. First, any decision to charge for parking must not be driven by a desire to generate income for patient care. Secondly, the trust board must be able to justify the proposals, for reasons such as the need to cover the cost of expanding parking facilities, to make existing facilities more secure or to better manage existing facilities. Thirdly, in considering proposals, trusts are asked to consider inviting tenders from commercial contractors, to ensure best value. Finally, and above all, staff, patients and visitors need to be consulted about the proposals. Trusts are trying to improve the situation for patients but, of course, during the consultation process, they need to set out clearly the reasons for the need to charge.</p><p>St John's West Lothian Healthcare NHS Trust has significant parking congestion problems on the St John's Hospital site. Mary Mulligan and James Douglas-Hamilton have confirmed that from personal experience. The trust feels that the level of complaints and the frustration caused by the <place-holder colnum=\"1274\"/> current lack of car parking cannot be sustained. There are a number of reasons for that. The increasingly intensive use of St John's Hospital, the phased closure of Bangour Village Hospital and the increasing use of clinical services by residents from the west side of Edinburgh mean that the trust has to ensure that adequate parking facilities are available.</p><p>The trust has been considering several options, one of which is to increase the number of parking spaces from 900 to more than 1,100, and to double the number of parking spaces for the disabled to 70. However, we encourage other solutions and, as Bristow Muldoon made clear, there are other solutions that should be looked at.</p><p>In my constituency of Edinburgh Pentlands, West Lothian Council and Edinburgh City Council recently combined to secure a much-needed bus service from Currie and Balerno to St John's. In addition, I recently attended the opening of the new Pentland Medical Centre by the Minister for Health and Community Care, which includes facilities for consultants from St John's to come to their patients in the west of Edinburgh, rather than having their patients travel, and doing so by car&#8212;at least, before the bus service comes on stream.</p><p>Measures such as those, which can reduce car parking problems by reducing car use, are to be welcomed and encouraged. The trust has worked with West Lothian Council to draw up a revised timetable for public transport to ensure access from every town and village in West Lothian, so there are other options that need to be explored.</p><p>In relation to car parking and the potential for charging, we have sought and been given an assurance by West Lothian Healthcare NHS Trust that it took the decision to consider proposals for car park charging based on the urgent need to improve both the quantity and the quality of parking on the St John's site. I am further assured that any revenue accrued will be used to defray the cost of managing and maintaining the facility. The trust has taken no final decision about the way forward. It wishes to consult further and I expect it to do so. In particular, the trust will carry out a further traffic analysis survey and a survey of patients, visitors and staff.</p><p>I say to Mrs Mulligan that I expect the trust to get round the table with West Lothian Council and others who have an interest in this matter. Only then should a final decision be taken. I stress again that car park charging is a matter for local determination. I expect that West Lothian Healthcare NHS Trust will act with the interests of patients, staff and visitors at heart and will carefully take account of all the views expressed before reaching a final decision.<place-holder time=\"17:32:00\"/></p><p><i>Meeting closed at 17:32.</i></p>", "hdate": "2000-02-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13221817", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Car Parking Charges (West Lothian)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The issue of charging for car parking in hospital grounds is one that generates a lot of attention.

Many members have, quite rightly, raised that issue. We are committed to through care for prisoners after they leave prison.

We have examined the evaluations of the drug courts in the United States, to which Roseanna Cunningham referred. We believe that the drugs testing and treatment orders that are being piloted in Glasgow and in Fife strip out the most effective aspects of the drug courts in a way that is appropriate to our legal system.

I also take the opportunity afforded by the debate to acknowledge the efforts of the social work profession over the millennium and winter period. We have heard about the efforts of national health service staff a number of times, but we should not forget that it is also a time of particular pressure for social work departments in their work in community and social care.</p><p>I agree with Margaret Smith that it is an unacceptable state of affairs that committed and dedicated social workers should be subject to verbal abuse, the threat of violence or even violent attack by some of the people for whom they provide services. As Margaret said, it is unacceptable that social workers are also sometimes undermined by ill-judged and sensationalist reporting of cases in which they have been involved.</p><p>However, we need to acknowledge&#8212;as a number of members have done&#8212;that this is not an easy problem to resolve. The origins of that violent behaviour are many and complex, and we must recognise that the perpetrators are among the most damaged and excluded members of our society. Their behaviour may be fuelled by drink or drugs, which is not to excuse such behaviour. We simply need to realise, as I think we have done during this short debate, that a considerable level of understanding is required so that managers and staff can work together to reduce and eliminate the unacceptable attacks on a key group of public sector workers.</p><p>The responsibility for supporting staff who may be subject to abuse or attack rests clearly and most directly with their employers, whether they be local authorities, or voluntary or private agencies. However, we are happy to accept that the Scottish Executive also has a responsibility&#8212;we have been active in supporting those employers in fulfilling their responsibilities.</p><p>I would like to give three or four examples of the initiatives that are under way, many of which have already been mentioned by members. Margaret Smith, for example, pointed out that a year before the launch of <i>Community Care </i>magazine's \"no fear\" campaign in July 1999, Sam Galbraith&#8212;who was then the Scottish Office minister with responsibility for social work&#8212;highlighted the problem in a seven-point plan that he outlined in a speech to the annual conference of the Association of Directors of Social Work. It is good to report that the ADSW took up that challenge, consulted the local authorities and the social work services inspectorate and has now published the resource pack, \"Supporting Front Line Staff\", the <place-holder colnum=\"205\"/> publication and distribution of which was funded by the Scottish Executive.</p><p>The pack gives guidance on a number of the points that have to be addressed to improve safety for staff: practical procedures to avoid risk situations; management practices; staff training; and a comprehensive monitoring system. It also points towards examples of good practice by local authorities. It is important to acknowledge that there are such examples, not least in Edinburgh. Several members have acknowledged that City of Edinburgh Council is currently revising and improving its guidelines in response to the motion that was lodged there, but there are other examples.</p><p>I would not want to suggest for a moment that we believe that the problem will be resolved simply by producing a resource pack. The ADSW is well aware of that and has set up a task force that is currently considering what the second stage of the campaign should be. We will collaborate with the association as it decides which direction we should take. I believe that that puts us ahead of Frank Dobson's task force and maintains ownership by the profession in a very direct way. That addresses a point that was made from the Scottish National party benches.</p><p>The other key initiative that is under way is the consultation paper on \"Regulating Care and the Social Services Workforce\" that came out last December. It proposes the establishment of the Scottish social services council, which will regulate the work force and its education. It will also provide leadership for the profession and the recognition that it deserves, as several members have said.</p><p>The council will be required to prepare, publish and keep under review employers' codes of conduct and practice. That will include a code of practice for all employers of social services staff, whether local authority, voluntary or private. The code will include management responsibilities concerning the reduction of abuse and violence towards the work force. The Scottish commission for the regulation of care, proposed in the same document, will regulate the delivery of care in care settings. Part of that will involve ensuring that properly trained staff are in place and that there are proper procedures such as recording of incidents, to meet the requirements of commission inspection.</p><p>Unhappily, the statistics that have been quoted throughout the debate show that a significant group of perpetrators of abuse and violence towards staff are children who are looked after by the local authority, particularly those in residential care. Staff in that setting need to be particularly skilful and sensitive when providing care, as they are particularly at risk. That is why the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"206\"/> Executive has recently awarded a major grant to a partnership of agencies, led by the University of Strathclyde, to enhance and develop the education and training of all staff providing residential child care services. That is aimed at ensuring proper and continuing training for all residential children's care staff in Scotland&#8212;exactly the kind of measure referred to, quite correctly, by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton in his speech. We need to train people in ways of ensuring that they minimise risk to themselves in their work setting.</p><p>This has been a short debate, in which a number of issues have been raised that will return to the chamber, for example, as the legislation to set up the council and commission develops.</p><p>There is a Vietnamese proverb that translates as:</p><p class=\"indent\"> \"Those who bring light suffer burning\".</p><p>The truth is that we ask our social workers to work in some dark and difficult corners of society. It is too often a thankless and dangerous task. We will not accept that, tacitly or otherwise, and will continue to work with the profession to ensure that we minimise the risks that social workers face.<place-holder time=\"17:40:00\"/></p><p><i>Meeting closed at 17:40.</i></p>", "hdate": "2000-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13218626", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Workers and Violence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Margaret Smith for drawing the Parliament's attention to this important and difficult subject.

Honestly addressing the needs of older people demands co-ordination across Parliaments and across Administrations. It is too important a matter for us not to do that.</p><p>That co-ordination is the way in which we can build, for example, on the national minimum income guarantee that addresses the needs of the poorest pensioners and will benefit 125,000 people in Scotland when it rises next April, in line with the increase in earnings. We can build on initiatives such as the winter fuel payment for all pensioners, which is rising from &#163;20 to &#163;100, free eye tests for the over-60s and free television licences for the over-75s. Such initiatives are making the new politics work, not for politicians&#8212;there is more to the new politics than us addressing one other by name&#8212;but for our people, by adding value to the efforts of each Administration. To do that, the Scottish Parliament must strive to maximise the impact on older people's quality of life of those policy areas for which we have full responsibility. That is an honest approach, and we intend to take it.</p><p>I was glad to hear Alex Neil say that this is not just about pensions. I was surprised, however, that he found very little to say about anything else. The Scottish Executive is devoting significant energy and resources to the needs of older people&#8212;by, for example, investing millions of pounds in the warm deal to upgrade 100,000 Scottish homes. Half the social work budget of &#163;1.1 billion and nearly 40 per cent of the health budget&#8212;some &#163;2 billion&#8212;is being spent on older people.

On every occasion that I have spoken to older people, I have found that they mention the report of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care, which got a passing reference at the end of Mr Neil's speech. It seems appropriate to respond to it in this debate on older people.</p><p>Sir Stewart Sutherland's report ably analyses the problem that he and the other members of the commission identified. He powerfully expresses the views of older people over the funding of long-term care and he defuses the mythical demographic time bomb that is so often a feature of the debate around old people.</p><p>When I took up this post, I asked what older people wanted.

One of Sutherland's recommendations is that more people should be able to receive high-quality care that allows them to stay in their own homes.</p><p>There are proportionately fewer people in care homes in Scotland than in the UK as a whole.

I accept the important point that Mrs Ewing makes: this debate is not just about the scale of resources, it is about how we spend them in order to get the maximum benefit for our older people. That will mean addressing bureaucracy and systems.</p><p>People expect personal care delivered in a person-centred way, not in a bureaucratic way and they expect that care to be of a consistent, guaranteed standard.<i> </i>One of the royal commission's two main recommendations is that there should be a national care commission to ensure national standards of care, monitor trends, represent the consumer and encourage the development of better services. We already have in preparation specific Scottish legislation to meet those aims.</p><p>As was promised in our programme for government, we will legislate for two new bodies. The first will register the social care work force, regulate its training and produce codes of conduct to provide assurances on quality. The second&#8212;the Scottish commission for the regulation of care&#8212;will regulate the care that is provided. For the first time ever, home care, delivered to so many of our older people, as well as residential care, will be regulated. All providers, including local authorities, will be covered and there will be national standards drafted from the perspective of the person using the service.</p><p>The commission will be responsible for ensuring that all social care is provided to national standards. It will create a national database of care services and use that and demographic and resource data collected by the Scottish Executive to advise on trends into the future. It will have the power to investigate complaints about care services and report on them. It will advise us on changes needed to the care standards and provide advice on how those standards should be met and improved. National care standards are already under development, and the establishment of the commission will meet the royal commission's recommendation.</p><p>Sir Stewart Sutherland's commission made two further recommendations regarding carers: better services for people with carers and a national support package. He recognised that many older people depend on informal carers and that many are themselves informal carers. What was <place-holder colnum=\"1129\"/> recommended is exactly what we announced last week: a doubling of resources earmarked for carers services and setting in train new carers legislation.</p><p>The royal commission specifically identified direct payment schemes whereby users are able to purchase care packages to match their needs as a way of increasing flexibility for older people and cutting through the bureaucracy. It recommends that older people who wish it, should have access to direct payments. We have commissioned research on the present use of direct payments and the barriers to them and we expect to implement that recommendation for older people next year.</p><p>At least four recommendations of the royal commission demand for older people more joint working and more pooling of resources by local authorities and the national health service. We are already promoting those measures through implementation of the modernising community care action plan. However, the Minister for Health and Community Care and I agree that that is not happening quickly enough for our older people, as well as others who need those services.</p><p>Following a seminar with local authority and health service leaders last month, we are setting up a joint future working group&#8212;chaired by me&#8212;by the end of the year, to begin work in January, to address a range of joint working and funding issues in community care. All of its work will be of direct relevance to older people and the recommendations of the commission.</p><p>I want the group to do two further things that relate to the royal commission report. First, I want it to come to an agreement over what the balance should be between residential and home-based care; secondly&#8212;and crucially&#8212;I want it to address another point that received a passing reference from Mr Neil: charging for personal care delivered at home.</p><p>As Sir Stewart Sutherland said, the present system is perceived as unfair and inconsistent and it can cost a good deal to administer. It is a perverse disincentive to local authorities that provide intensive packages of care to people at home and a real obstacle to services being provided jointly with the NHS, which of course does not charge. I am determined to address that. The joint future group will tackle that and come up with proposals in time for them to be considered during the next spending review, which will begin early in the new year, and will reach its conclusions by the autumn.</p><p>Those are all measures that will benefit hundreds of thousands of older Scots. However, I am not forgetting the 8,000 or so people in care homes in Scotland who are contributing to the cost <place-holder colnum=\"1130\"/> of their care at present. To benefit that group, Sir Stewart recommends changes to the funding system that would cost about &#163;1.1 billion per annum for the UK, rising to &#163;6 billion by the middle of the century, and suggests various intermediate steps along the way.</p><p>As I have said, we want gradually to reduce the proportion of people in traditional care homes and to use the resources thus made available to support people more effectively at home. However, I know that there are real concerns about the present funding system for residential care. The needs of older people&#8212;including those funding their own care&#8212;and the way in which residential care is funded, will be key issues to resolve during the forthcoming spending review.</p><p>I have taken the opportunity presented by today's debate to address one of the key priorities for older people in Scotland&#8212;long-term care. Building a Scotland where every older person matters means ensuring that all older people are financially secure and that they can lead active, independent and healthy lives. Alex Neil is right&#8212;it is not just about pensions. What a pity that he did not address any of the other issues relating to older people in Scotland.</p><p>Alex Neil said that he was sending his words out to our pensioners, but words are not enough. We are taking action&#8212;now, next year and into the next century&#8212;to build a Scotland where every older person matters. The Executive will use the power of the Parliament to pursue relentlessly pensioners' issues. We will not use our pensioners to pursue the issue of the Scottish Parliament's powers.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-327.1, to leave out from \"recognises\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the Executive's vision of a Scotland in which every older person matters and every person beyond working age has a decent quality of life, and welcomes the measures the Executive has already taken and has planned to support older people in line with its Programme for Government commitment to deliver person centred health and community care.\"</p>", "hdate": "1999-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13216155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Introduction"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we have discussed, the financial resources that are going into community care will rise this year, next year and the year after.

Given the caring responsibilities that they have, that represents a considerable effort.</p><p>In a sense, we are in the presence of 500,000 Scots who look after sick, disabled, vulnerable or frail relatives or friends. Some have done so for many years; others will have, suddenly and shockingly, found themselves in the situation as a result of accident or diagnosis.</p><p>The Scottish Executive's programme for government committed us to producing a strategy for carers in Scotland. The strategy document was issued by way of a parliamentary question yesterday, so that members of the Parliament would receive it before anyone else.</p><p>The first ministerial engagement that I undertook was a carers event. I promised then to bring their concerns to the chamber. I have met many carers and have learned from them something of what caring means. It has been a sometimes searing experience. Carers will speak passionately about the difference that services have made, but they will not mince their words about the struggle to provide care for loved ones, sometimes with little support and in isolation.</p><p>Before drawing up our proposals, we discussed priorities with carers organisations in Scotland, notably the Carers National Association, the coalition of carers in Scotland, Crossroads Scotland, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and Shared Care Scotland. I want to put on record an acknowledgement of my gratitude for their help. Together, we identified four main areas for action.</p><p>The first priority of carers is that respite services should be of a better quality, more readily available and more flexible, as those services allow them to take a break with confidence and without guilt. We have therefore told the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that we expect the resources spent on those services to double.</p><p>We are identifying &#163;10 million of grant-aided expenditure for 2000-01 specifically for carers services and respite care. That doubles the &#163;5 million that is already notionally allocated for such <place-holder colnum=\"1013\"/> services in the GAE system. We have already announced that the total GAE for social services will increase by &#163;40 million next year, and it is from those resources that the additional &#163;5 million will be found.</p><p>Every local authority on Scotland will receive its share of the &#163;10 million, and local carers groups will be advised of the resources that are available to their authority for developing new services and enhancing existing ones.</p><p>Local authorities must consult local carers organisations on spending plans for those resources. We will encourage imaginative and innovative services that meet carers' needs. We expect authorities to take into account the needs of carers from ethnic minority and rural communities and those who care for someone with a learning disability.</p><p>Carers want a consistent standard of service across Scotland. We have already set up a national care standards committee to agree national standards for residential care, day care and home care services. National standards for residential respite care will be introduced in 2000 and for home-based care in 2001.</p><p>Carers are represented on the working groups already set up to discuss standards across the services and will be included in the groups that will discuss the proposals as they emerge.</p><p>It is widely believed that new carers legislation is required. I agree. I am determined to get it right and not to rush it. I have therefore decided to set up a carers legislation working group by the end of this year, on which representatives of the Scottish Executive, service users and carers, carers organisations and local authorities will work together to draw up legislative proposals for public consultation next year. Those proposals will consider the rights of carers&#8212;and users&#8212;to a direct assessment of their needs. In particular, we want and expect the legislation to enable carers under 16 to have, for the first time, a direct assessment of their needs.</p><p>All carers want more information. We can have as many services as we wish and services of the highest quality, but if carers do not know that they are there and how to access them, they are of no use. Too often, services are stumbled across almost by accident. It is no coincidence that the excellent carers centre in Perth is called Gateway. The handbook of the services that it helps carers to access includes many such services, but in the Gateway centre, carers will say that it is often an accidental meeting with someone from the centre that allows them to begin to access the services that already exist.</p><p>We must increase and open up such gateways to services. All agencies and professionals in the <place-holder colnum=\"1014\"/> caring professions have a role to play. Working with the Carers National Association training unit that the Scottish Executive funds, we will take the needs of carers into account in future training of general practitioners, primary care teams and social workers. The next planning and priorities guidelines for the national health service will require health boards and trusts to recognise carers' needs.</p><p>In spring 2000, the Scottish NHS helpline will be extended to include information on services for carers. When NHS Direct is brought on stream in Scotland, it will be extended to include social care and carers advice, as well as medical advice. Early in the new year, we will launch a leaflet and local media campaign to publicise the carers strategy and services for carers.</p><p>Too many carers remain hidden completely&#8212;the 500,000 figure that I used is a notional one. We do not know how many carers there are. It is our intention that the census in 2001 should be the first one to include a question on carers, seeking information on the time that people spend on unpaid caring. We will consider extending the Princess Royal Trust for Carers pilot project to identify hidden carers and examine the potential use of GP databases to identify and include information on carers.</p><p>The four priorities are respite, standards, legislation and information. Priorities are all very well, but carers are concerned&#8212;and have expressed that concern to me&#8212;that the impact of the strategy should be monitored. Therefore, from April 2000, local authorities will be required to report in detail on the use of the resources allocated to them for carers and respite services through community care plans and annual updates. Further, in future we will require those plans to be accompanied by a letter from local carers groups, confirming that they have been consulted in the planning and development of services and that they are satisfied that their authority's share of the &#163;10 million has been used appropriately.</p><p>In addition, we have tasked the Scottish Executive's community care implementation unit to review practice in involving carers in service planning and provision. The unit will identify and promote good practice, and&#8212;importantly&#8212;will report to me on any barriers to the development of good-quality services for carers.</p><p>Further, carers' needs will in future be included as part of the existing statutory performance indicators and assessments currently required of local authorities by the Accounts Commission. I have asked that the new, national data set that is being devised by the Scottish Executive, COSLA and the Accounts Commission to monitor social care on a national basis should include information <place-holder colnum=\"1015\"/> on carers assessments and respite care.</p><p>I mentioned young carers in the context of legislation, but they are a particularly disadvantaged group, whose specific needs we must address further. In Dundee, we are providing &#163;210,000 over the next three years to a project aimed at identifying and supporting young carers. I have asked my officials to work up proposals for research on the support that is available to young carers in Scotland and the guidance that is needed for professionals in health education and social care. In the meantime, we will make available to directors of education a young carers pack, which I expect to inform the work that is currently undertaken by guidance teachers.</p><p>It would be wrong to conclude without acknowledging the contribution that carers make. We could not deliver community care without them. They care unpaid, unsung and unwaveringly. The package is a significant step towards addressing their needs, but it is only a step.</p><p>Some people will try to calculate how much the contribution of carers is worth in cash terms, but that misses the point. Carers care because they want to, and because they love the people for whom they care. We cannot put a price on something that is priceless, or a value on what is invaluable.</p><p>Caring is what holds our society together. It is the practical, most powerful, profoundest solidarity between husband and wife, parent and child, friend and neighbour. It touches us all. Like most people, when I think of carers, I think first of my mother caring for her father, my aunt and uncle for my cousin, and my friend for his son.</p><p>We all know carers. Today, we place them at the centre of our Parliament and at the heart of Scotland. They will never go away. Whoever stands here can never ignore their needs again. I move the motion on their behalf.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the Executive's commitment in its Programme for Government to introduce a Carers' Strategy for Scotland to assist unpaid carers, and approves the Executive's proposals for that strategy.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13215931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome to the public gallery carers who have travelled from all over Scotland to be here today.

The tone of the debate has been welcome. Much of the debate has, quite properly, been about the food standards agency, because the agency in Scotland is central to our commitment.

That set-up has clear advantages for Scotland; the same advantages apply today as they did on 23 June, when we debated this matter before. We will have access to UK-wide scientific expertise, which will avoid costly duplication. We will ensure a share of the research for Scotland. The agency's funding arrangement will mean that members of the Scottish Parliament will have control and that the agency is accountable to them. The Scottish food safety advisory committee will feed information on Scottish issues to ministers, MSPs and the UK food standards agency board, two members of which will be from the Scottish committee.

It was and is about public safety. It was and is about ensuring that there are no further releases from detention of those patients whose diagnosis and condition is similar to that of Noel Ruddle. It is about closing that door-that is all. The bill is certainly not about reforming or modernising mental health legislation. That is why the insertion of \"personality disorder\" as a mental illness, which was always implicit in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, is made express in the bill. The amendments which we move, 37, 38 and 39, make it plainer still that \"personality disorder\" was included under mental illness-and it still is. It has been the aim not to change that, but to clarify it. </p><p>This is not the time or place to change that; this is about closing the door-that is all. It is not about, as some have implied, opening the doors of the state hospital to a cohort of new people with mental illnesses, whether they are currently in the community or in prison. The bill will not do that because hospital admission will still require section 17 of the 1984 act to be satisfied: it will still need to be shown that, if the mental disorder from which a patient suffers is persistent, manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct, treatment in hospital is likely to alleviate the condition or prevent it from deteriorating, and that it is necessary for the health or safety of the person, or for the protection of others, for him to receive such treatment in hospital. That is a very important sentence, although a particularly difficult one to read. </p><p>It is clearly for doctors to reach that view; in our view, the bill imposes no new responsibilities on doctors or psychiatrists in that respect. The bill affects those seeking to leave detention in hospital; it does not change the process of admission. I gave this assurance yesterday to the Royal College of Psychiatrists and I am happy to give it again in this chamber. We are closing a door; that is all. We are not opening new ones. </p><p>The Executive is in no doubt about the importance of mental health and the issues surrounding it. We well understand the complexity and difficulty of the definitions of mental disorder, and are conscious of the differing and deeply held convictions regarding such matters, even within the mental health community. That is why we will not open the door to that debate today. Involved in that debate is the MacLean committee, which is examining how to deal with serious offenders, including those with personality disorders. Also involved is the Millan committee, which is, as we asked, reviewing mental health legislation-a difficult job. We will not and must not burst in on those deliberations-they are too important. I acknowledge that even to think about such matters without beginning to stray into MacLean's and Millan's territory is extremely difficult, but to <place-holder colnum=\"246\"/> start tinkering with the definition of mental disorder now-which it may be tempting to do-would be irresponsible. Mr Millan's letter, which has been referred to and has been made available, made it very clear that he wishes us to stay out of his room for the moment. </p><p>The Minister for Health and Community Care and I will throw open the doors to the debate on modernising mental health when the time is right. We will examine all the issues fully in the light of all the experience and expertise available, but we will not do it today because this bill should do as little as possible, commensurate with its aim of improving public safety. As drafted, with the clarifying amendments, improving public safety is what the bill does, and it goes no further. </p><p>I say again: the bill does not seek to allow anyone to be admitted to hospital who could not be detained under the existing law. For those few-and it is a few-whom the bill affects, we give the assurance, as the Deputy First Minister has already done, that resources will be available for treatment which is considered to be appropriate by clinicians in the state hospital. However, we will not try to define that today, which is why Susan Deacon has asked the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to report on this matter properly and separately from the consideration of public safety, with which we are involved today. All around us are interesting and important doors that we need to open, but not today. Today, we have one door to close and these amendments will help us to do that.

It is a testing process for the Parliament because the existing law and procedures are complex, and big issues are at stake. The tone of the debate, particularly the second one, has recognised that. </p><p>Today we do not have the comfort-and we have to say comfort-of legislating when there has been full prior scrutiny and full consultation. That is the nature of emergency legislation and of the urgency with which we have been told we should act. It means that some of the important and <place-holder colnum=\"123\"/> broad-ranging issues that have been raised will not be dealt with today, but I will return to how they will be dealt with later. </p><p>It could have been so much worse. If we had listened to those-and to be fair, most of them are not in the chamber-who insisted that we should do six impossible, probably unlawful, things before breakfast, to keep Noel Ruddle in detention, while we recalled Parliament by lunchtime and legislated before tea, we would have risked tears at bedtime. We would have faced legislation so hasty that it might have been struck down on its first application. Of equal importance, we would have compromised the on-going work to modernise our mental health legislation in a right and proper manner. </p><p>By contrast, I recap some of the essential points of the emergency bill. First, it is a short bill with a clearly defined purpose-public safety. Secondly, it will introduce practical and immediate steps to close the loophole exposed by the Ruddle case. Thirdly, the protections that are essential to an approach based on the European convention on human rights are there; I am happy to assure members who have asked, that the legislation has been fully considered against the convention, including articles 7 and 5. Our view is that the legislation meets the requirements of the convention. </p><p>In that context, several members referred to the therapeutic regime in the state hospital. It is true that the sheriff criticised that regime. That is why, on 2 August when that judgment became available to me, my officials and I began to look at the best way to respond to those criticisms. It was decided that we should ask the Mental Welfare Commission to look into the Ruddle case. As members know, we did that. Its report will inform our response to those criticisms. The judgment was made that Ruddle's condition was not treatable. That was the opinion of Ruddle's responsible medical officer at that time. </p><p>Fourthly, this legislation bites as of yesterday. It will therefore apply to all future appeals in the sheriff court against continuing detention of a restricted patient. A question has been raised about the difference in timing of the different sections of the bill; I reassure members that the difference in timing for the appeal provision is to allow the Court of Session appeals procedures to be put in place. We expect that to be a matter of days rather than weeks. </p><p>As Deputy Minister for Community Care, I strongly endorse the need to act in this way to prevent serious harm to the public by the small group of patients who will be affected by the legislation. I am happy to give the assurance that has been sought by several members, that the legislation will apply only to those who have a <place-holder colnum=\"124\"/> mental disorder and who manifest abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible behaviour. The other tests, in particular section 17 of the 1984 act, will apply. </p><p>We will do ourselves and our people no service if, in passing this legislation, we jeopardise the current review of mental health legislation by the Millan committee. That is why, with a view to the longer term, we clarified the existing position that personality disorder is legally within the scope of mental disorder.

The mental health framework that was launched in September 1997 is modernising the services. The mental illness specific grant invests &#163;18 million per year in improving those services. A few weeks ago, I announced a further &#163;2 million for the mental health development fund.

We have shown, during the debate, that we are serious about Scotland's health. After all, what could be more important than the health of our nation, especially when we have so far to go? We know that from one city or town to another-even from one street to another in those cities and towns-life expectancy differs significantly. For a newborn child that one statistic can mean as much as twice the chance of surviving to the age of 15. Such inequality cannot continue. When we talk of deprivation, what is it that our fellow Scots are deprived of? They are deprived of their health and ultimately of life itself. Of course, we must tackle the poverty and inequality that are at the root of those statistics. </p><p>Sadly, there is no of course about it. I am pleased that our debate has shown so much consensus. For almost 20 years the link between ill health and poverty and inequality was denied, in the face of all the statistics and facts. However, I am saddened that some of the speakers in the debate continue to try to deny that link or to say that addressing individual responsibility is somehow mutually exclusive with recognising that link. Those approaches are not mutually exclusive. I refer Mrs Scanlon to paragraph 129 in the conclusion to the white paper, in which individual responsibility is clearly flagged up. Saddest of all, though, was the fact that David McLetchie was not only unable to engage in consensus politics on such an issue but unable even to bear to watch someone else engaged in consensus politics. David, those are the old ways and everyone else <place-holder colnum=\"53\"/> has left them behind. I think that the Scottish people will leave you behind, as they have done already. </p><p>I cite one example of how ways of thinking must change. Several Conservative members, including Mrs Scanlon, have made efforts to move in the direction of consensus. Mary said that health spending is one third of our budget. This is the key to understanding the new approach: the health department budget is one third of this Executive's budget, but every budget is a health budget. I advise Tricia Marwick that that is why our budgets include measures such as the warm deal and other measures to improve Scotland's housing.

Access to learning disability nurses for each practice is a suggestion that I find attractive, but as you will know, there is a learning disability review under way and I expect that they will have a view on that, and we will take it forward.

One reason for that is to maximise resources. The white paper pledges resources to this strategy, including resources for HEBS-there is no question of cuts <place-holder colnum=\"54\"/> in health promotion budgets. We could argue for a long time about resources, but I want to say two things quite quickly. We are investing &#163;1.8 billion in our health services over the next three years because it is one of our spending priorities, and there must be priorities in spending.
