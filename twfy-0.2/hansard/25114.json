I will bear no malice, but I will make the same appeal that I made at stage 1: think of the future. Think of your sons and daughters and grandchildren, who may well turn out to be LGBT.

Many of us recently had the privilege of meeting Samaritans from throughout Scotland who are doing immense work, in my community in Aberdeen and elsewhere.</p><p>In its briefing for the debate, SAMH asks a number of questions that I have asked myself in a previous guise as a local councillor. It asks the Scottish Government how it will ensure that local authorities and community planning partnerships are held to account for the suicide prevention work that they are obliged to carry out under single outcome agreements. SAMH calls for more transparency from local authorities and others in pointing out what they are doing. I think that that is required. I am convinced that a lot of good work is going on, but it is a subject that we do not talk enough about. We talk about relatives and friends who die of natural causes, but folk often do not talk about those folk that they have known who have taken their own lives. We must get much better at doing that.</p><p>We also have an obligation to challenge behaviour. Far too often in society&#8212;in the media, in particular&#8212;we see a stigmatisation of mental ill health. We have seen headlines galore, over many years, using language that should not be used to describe folk with mental health problems. All of us here and beyond should challenge such behaviour. We now have the new media&#8212;the social media&#8212;which Dr Milne talked about, and we see a huge amount of bullying and horrid language there.</p><p>Before the debate, I looked at some recent cases of suicide. Dr Milne mentioned the young man from Dunfermline who, after being blackmailed after using the internet, could see no way out other than to take his own life. There are countless stories out there, but one that I was really struck by had the headline, &#8220;Ballet girl was &#8216;hooked on Tumblr where users encouraged her to harm herself&#8217;&#8221;. That is beyond my ken&#8212;why would anyone do that? However, it is obvious that such behaviour goes on. That girl took her own life. We should look at ensuring that social media sites are not used to bully folk and to leave them with what they think is very little option, and I think that we can do that.</p><p>A BBC Scotland report from 22 June 2012 had the headline, &#8220;Social media &#8216;could cut suicide&#8217;&#8221;. It said that, in a study by the University of Stirling in 2009,</p><p>&#8220;one in five school children said the internet, including social networking sites, influenced their decision to self-harm.&#8221;</p><p>It went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Now the researchers say the possible dangers posed by new media could be counteracted if the sites provided support for vulnerable young people.&#8221;</p><p>In that report, Professor Rory O&#8217;Connor of the University of Stirling&#8217;s suicidal behaviour research laboratory is quoted as saying that</p><p>&#8220;The reasons for adolescent suicide and self-harm are multiple and complex. My colleagues and I see that the challenge is ensuring that new media provide support for vulnerable young people, rather than helping or encouraging self-destructive behaviours.&#8221;</p><p>I am pleased that organisations such as SAMH and the Samaritans now have a presence on Twitter, Facebook and other new media sites, because I think that that can be immensely beneficial. Interaction with such organisations on new media sites is often helpful for people who may have some dark thoughts.</p><p>The difference between the suicide rate among the poor and that among the more affluent members of society has been mentioned. Mr Coffey said that the suicide rate in the most deprived areas was more than three times higher than the rate in more affluent areas. One of my main concerns is welfare reform and the austerity measures that are being implemented under the direction of the Westminster Government. As many other members probably do, I regularly have folk come to me who feel despair, isolation and a lack of self-worth, because of the changes that have been thrust on them. We need to take cognisance of the impact of the welfare reforms on people&#8217;s mental wellbeing, and we must ensure that we do the right thing in that regard by doing all that we can to help folk who have been affected in that way. In my opinion, the best way of dealing with that would be to halt the austerity measures and to stop the worst impacts of welfare reform, and I hope that that will be possible in the very near future.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Suicide Prevention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to the organisations out there that are doing a huge amount of work in tackling mental health stigma and in trying to prevent suicide&#8212;organisations such as the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the choose life programme co-ordinators and volunteers across the country and the Samaritans, who have been mentioned quite a lot in the debate.

We in Scotland are extremely fortunate to have a publicly funded and delivered health service, and I am glad to hear colleagues say this afternoon that that is the right thing. Mr Carlaw and I often disagree but I think that the Tory party north of the border has shown a different way from the party south of the border. For example, with regard to privatisation in certain day-to-day contracts, Dr Jacky Davis of the keep our NHS public campaign south of the border said today:</p><p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t privatisation by the back door, it&#8217;s privatisation by the front door, and it is really putting patients&#8217; lives at risk.&#8221;</p><p>We are following a different path up here and I am proud that, in the main, we agree on most points.

That is why I am really pleased by the strides made by the Government in integrating health and social care. I realise that there is much work still to do in that respect but it is the right way forward.</p><p>I am glad that we have had the reviews of workforce planning tools and bed-planning tools, as they are extremely important.</p><p>Many members have talked about delivering the seven-day service, in relation to which there has been a &#163;4 million investment to look at innovative approaches. That is the right approach. There is also, of course, the &#163;50 million that has been put into the unscheduled care action plan. However, we still need to look at budgets in particular and see the shift happening a little quicker, perhaps, than it is at present in moving resource to primary care, as prevention is better than cure.</p><p>We have seen a number of Government initiatives to ensure prevention. There has been investment in telemedicine, free prescriptions, free eye tests, free personal care&#8212;as a number of folk have mentioned&#8212;and initiatives such as family nurse partnerships, which I think are making great gains out there.</p><p>Colleagues have mentioned the policy that was agreed to last week to ensure free school meals for primary 1, 2 and 3 pupils. Some folk may think that that has very little to do with health, but the chief executive of One Parent Families Scotland, Satwat Rehman, has said:</p><p>&#8220;The benefits of free school lunches are particularly important to children from low income families but poor diet and obesity affects children from all backgrounds.</p><p>Healthy free school lunches have been shown to help tackle health inequalities, as well as reducing the poverty trap faced by parents trying to move into employment.&#8221;</p><p>Those prevention initiatives are the way forward.</p><p>We have heard that the Labour Party wants a wholesale review of the health service, but that would be a wrong move.

In order to gain that transformational change, we need control of the taxation system, which currently lies with Westminster. I would have given some of our unionist opponents some credit today if they had stood up and said, &#8220;You know what? You&#8217;re absolutely right. We should negotiate with Westminster to try and ensure that any taxation raised through that policy comes back to Scotland to further fund it.&#8221; However, they have not got the gumption to put forward a proposal on that, never mind anything else.

Each individual, in a sense, needs some help and support that is critical to them in their situation rather than blanket coverage and blanket bans. It creates a very negative image of young people. I think that that is what really annoys, certainly, folk that work with young people on a day-to-day basis ... We spend our lives working with young people and we are absolutely astounded at their resilience in general terms, given what the world throws at them. We feel that there should be a much more positive message about our young people. They are an asset to the country, not a liability.&#8221;</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly that young people are an asset to us.</p><p>As the minister did at the beginning of the debate, I too want to relate a story from my time at school. I always remember a maths teacher saying about one individual pupil&#8212;let us call him John&#8212;that he was absolutely useless at maths and should spend all his time in the technical department. The guy was particularly good at designing and making things of value. What the teacher forgot was that the guy used maths skills to design those items and used maths to create the things that he made. It is a difficulty that I think we still have, that many people do not see the strength and the opportunity in others.</p><p>The minister stated that she wants to see opportunity gaps eradicated. I want to see opportunities seized and strengthened in every area in school, college, university and at home&#8212;which is also extremely important.</p><p>As many colleagues do, I think that bringing employers closer to the workplace is absolutely vital. We have good examples from across the country, but we need to ensure that best practice is carried out everywhere. Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s report has 11 pages of good practice, but I wonder how much of it is being looked at in depth by people in other areas, and whether others are following suit. All too often, we do not talk about the good things that are going on and we do not ensure that they are exported throughout the country. In some regards, a dose of common sense is required. Members have heard me talk time and again about gumption; if gumption is brought into play, that will make it much easier to achieve our goals.</p><p>Clare Adamson talked about bringing women into science. As Dennis Robertson said, engineering and technology sometimes do not have the right image. However, in recent times I have been greatly encouraged by the number of women who are being brought into life sciences. Science is a broad, broad spectrum; technology is a broad, broad spectrum; and engineering is a broad, broad spectrum, so we should be telling people much more about the opportunities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission for Developing Scotland&#8217;s Young Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the interim report from Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s commission and I am glad that we have the opportunity to debate it today.

Some companies are moving away from their former traditional markets to enter the oil and gas field.</p><p>One question that I always ask when I visit companies is what their relationship is with Scottish Enterprise, whether they have an account manager and what their relationship is with the local council&#8217;s economic development team. When I did the same thing a number of years ago as a councillor, the reports back about Scottish Enterprise were normally unfavourable. That has changed dramatically. While there is always room for improvement, the system that we have now is much better than the previous system.</p><p>I will make one plea about some of the small companies from outwith the north-east of Scotland that are trying to break into oil and gas. By doing so, I am showing that I am not completely and utterly parochial. Sometimes, account managers from elsewhere in the country do not have the oil and gas experience of those who are based in the north-east of Scotland. I would like to see better flexibility and use of resource. It would be a great boon to account managers if they were to get back-up&#8212;and an even greater boon to the companies that are trying to break out of their traditional markets and into oil and gas.</p><p>I am also enthused by the fact that the VisitScotland expo is coming to Aberdeen in April 2015. It will showcase the best of Scottish tourism and will involve tour operators and travel operators from around 40 countries&#8212;from as far afield as India, Russia and the middle east as well as North America and Europe.</p><p>Such events are often times when Scottish Enterprise comes to the fore. It may be a tourism event that is designed to boost Scottish tourism and Aberdeen as a tourist destination but, beyond that, I am sure that many folk who are there will want to do business in this country.</p><p>I have listened carefully to what others have said and I think that, sometimes, no matter what side of the constitutional argument they are on, people in this place can sometimes downplay how well we are doing.

In 2010 the coalition announced that England&#8217;s nine regional development agencies would be replaced by 39 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), voluntary consortiums of local councils and businesses. This was done two years later. It seems to have made things worse.&#8221;</p><p>It also states:</p><p>&#8220;In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved administrations run economic development, the agencies are undisturbed.&#8221;</p><p>It continues:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland is simply better at co-ordinating different arms of local and central government to deliver what inward investors want&#8212;roads for new factories, planning permissions, training packages for workforces and the like.

What I am seeing at my surgeries&#8212;I know that many other members see the same&#8212;is that the folk who are affected most by the reforms are those who have mental health conditions. People who have severe depression or who are bipolar are often put through the work capability assessment and given zero points, which means that they are considered to be fit for work.

The family believed that they had DLA for life for Sarah Jane&#8212;that was their safety net&#8212;but they are now worried that, if it is withdrawn, she will suffer a loss of independence. I can well understand why they are so worried about that situation.</p><p>According to the Sheffield Hallam University report, 55,000 folk in Scotland will be affected by the changes and are likely to lose on average &#163;3,000 a year. Many of those folk work and use their DLA to transport them to work, which gives them their independence. Without DLA, it might not be possible for them to do that.</p><p>What I cannot understand about the situation in which we find ourselves is that, on numerous occasions in response to letters from me, Lord Freud has refused to designate certain vulnerable groups and to take them out of the process. We all know that there are folk out there who are never going to work&#8212;Mark McDonald gave some examples. Why must those people thole the assessment process again and again?

Where do I begin? In my previous life as a councillor, I was often told that we could not do certain things because of EU procurement rules. That got to me so much that I decided that I would go on some training to see whether those barriers really existed, and I had the council&#8217;s procurement system&#8212;PECOS&#8212;installed on the computer in my office, so that I could track what was going on. I know that that is beyond anorakishness, but I think that it was important, because I found that a lot of the barriers that were said to be there were not there at all. I discovered that the reason why some folk took the view that they did was down to custom and practice and an aversion to risk. We need to challenge some of the custom and practice that exists around procurement.</p><p>Beyond that, we must ensure that folk know what best value and value for money are. Giving evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee on 27 March this year, James Thomson of Scott-Moncrieff said:</p><p>&#8220;On best value principles, there has been confusion in some of the responses from others. It is not about just going for the lowest-cost option; it is about having regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and delivering continuous improvement and sustainable services.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 27 March 2013; c 1971.]</p><p>I agree with his definition.</p><p>Page 3 of the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;Community Benefits in Public Procurement Guidance Note&#8221; says:</p><p>&#8220;The priority for all public procurement is to achieve Value for Money &#8230; Value for money does not, however, mean &#8216;lowest price&#8217;. It is defined in the Scottish Public Finance Manual as &#8216;the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality to meet the end user&#8217;s requirement&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>The mention of &#8220;whole life cost&#8221; and &#8220;the end user&#8217;s requirement&#8221; makes me think of the story about grandma&#8217;s 50-year-old broom. It has done a huge amount of work over its 50-year life and it has had only nine new handles and 11 new brushes. Those are the kind of things that we must think of when we make major decisions on procurement.</p><p>The proposed bill will not be a panacea, as Linda Fabiani and Tavish Scott said. We must deal with the situation in the bill and other forthcoming bills in which procurement will play a major role, such as the community empowerment and renewal bill and the health and social care integration bill. Procurement will be at the forefront of those bills, and we need to consider carefully what we do in that regard.</p><p>A huge number of the difficulties that we have are the result of a lack of common sense&#8212;a severe lack of common sense in some cases.</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee visited Ayr on Monday to hear the views of folks from Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway. A huge number of community representatives gave their views in the community engagement session and, beyond that, we had folk giving formal evidence at a meeting in the afternoon. However, some of the best conversations are always had during the breaks and at lunch time.</p><p>In those communities and throughout the country, a huge number of community organisations are doing everything possible to better the lives of the folks they live alongside. However, bureaucracies that local authorities, health boards and others have put in place are impeding the small-scale procurement that those organisations are doing.</p><p>I will give an example, although I have only one minute left in which to give it. A guy talked about his community group wanting a new wheelbarrow. They had to go around the houses to buy a new wheelbarrow. They had to get three written quotations and give them to the council for the council to decide which wheelbarrow the group could get. However, this guy had the gumption&#8212;the common sense&#8212;to realise what the wheelbarrow requirement was and where he could get it for the lowest cost.</p><p>That kind of nonsense must be dealt with.

However, the minister&#8217;s clear statement that sceptics such as RSPB Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust will contribute to the guidance on the bill is helpful. For those who are slightly reticent, we also have the review period. That has been put in place to look at perhaps extending the bill later, but it might result in restricting the bill, if that is required. I hope that the guidance will help in dealing with all such matters.</p><p>We have heard today many of the jokes that have been made in the discussion of Mr McDonald&#8217;s proposals. We have heard about the triffid bill and Christine Grahame&#8217;s privet member&#8217;s bill&#8212;there have been puns galore. A laugh has been had to a degree in some of the fora in which the subject has been discussed. However, as we have heard from the cases that have come from across the country, this is no laughing matter for the huge number of people who have been affected for many a year.</p><p>The problem is worse in some parts of the country than in others, because of the climate. As Mr Stevenson said, he has had no cases. I must be honest and say that, as an urban, city centre MSP, I have had no cases either. However, as a councillor in the past, I saw many cases in which high hedges caused huge difficulties, and such problems were exacerbated into even greater problems. Anything that can be done to resolve the disputes is worth while.</p><p>We have heard that dispute resolution has already occurred in some places because the bill was introduced. If introducing the bill has such an effect, members can just think what will happen once it is passed and the guidelines are in place. Many local authorities will not have to take the required action, because common sense will, we hope, prevail and folk will take the action that should have been taken some time ago.</p><p>The committee heard evidence about new developments, where conflicts arise not between neighbours but between owners of woodland and new neighbours. The minister&#8217;s statement that he will look at Scottish planning policy is a good idea. The committee heard from Dr Maggie Keegan about problems that the Scottish Wildlife Trust had in Cumbernauld, and committee members saw that area for themselves. That shows how easy it could be for such conflicts to arise.</p><p>People must recognise where a property that they are buying is and what might happen if it is on the periphery of woodland, some of which might not be very old and might grow substantially. Any help that Scottish planning policy can provide on that would be useful.</p><p>This has been a long journey, particularly for some of the campaigners, and 5 o&#8217;clock will bring great relief for many folk here.

The ensuing report set out a series of recommendations to improve the reporting of good practice and to support the development and use of its impact and influence. The sustainable Scotland network also made a series of recommendations that were aimed at improving the support that it can provide to local authorities. Basically, it wants more resources&#8212;nothing new there&#8212;to improve its reporting and analysis. The committee commends and supports its work and has recommended that future climate change reports to the Parliament should include a section specifically on local authorities, along with milestones by which progress can be measured.</p><p>We also recommend that the future reports of local authorities include the amount that they are spending to support the delivery of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>One example of work that is being undertaken by local government that can be shared by all concerns street lighting. Authorities are facing a triple whammy of increasing energy costs, significant increases in the distribution system charges from Scottish Power and increasingly non-compliant, out-of-date lights. Street lights and other lights, such as traffic signals, illuminated traffic signs and so on, account for 18 per cent of local government energy costs, which represents an annual figure of &#163;43 million. Work in East Dunbartonshire Council on installing LED technology and other measures has shown that annual energy consumption&#8212;and therefore costs&#8212;can be reduced by 63.5 per cent. That equates to a reduction in carbon use of 26,752 tonnes annually. Of course, significant initial capital investment is required but, given the figures that I have provided, the payback period is relatively short. We were pleased to learn that the Government has indicated that it is providing pilot funding to some authorities to take schemes forward and we look forward to such schemes being quickly rolled out across the country.</p><p>Local authorities have a significant role to play in influencing behavioural change. Like other committees, we were disappointed that the low-carbon behaviours framework was published after we had concluded our evidence taking. It is our view that that document should not be a stand-alone but should find expression in all sections of future RPP documents. Change is required across all sectors of the economy and society, if the targets are to be met.</p><p>I will stay with our theme of looking forward. We made recommendations in relation to proposed new planning guidance, new building standards and the new national planning framework, all of which are expected later this year. In each case, we recommended that explicit requirements on favouring low-carbon-emission options be included. We also want planning authorities to be required to produce a statement setting out how the implementation of development plans and planning consent for major planning applications would contribute to the reduction of emissions.</p><p>We were interested in a Government bid fund that has been made available to support local authorities that have applied for assistance in considering planning applications for wind farms. Assistance is provided to ensure that authorities have the necessary resource, policies and guidance in place when considering wind farm applications with the aim of speeding up the decision-making process. We consider that to be a helpful initiative and recommend that the Government widen its scope so that it can provide support for other climate change-related planning issues.</p><p>I see that I have only 20 seconds left.</p><p>We see opportunities in the forthcoming procurement reform bill. I hope that the Government will take cognisance of that. I also hope that more recognition will be given to communities&#8217; input&#8212;perhaps the minister will deal with that in his summing up.</p><p>I agree with colleagues that the four reports that were published last week by four committees of the Parliament provide the Government with the basis to improve the draft RPP2. We should be proud of the approach that Scotland has pioneered and do everything that we can to turn into reality the targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Local Government and Regeneration Committee was responsible for considering aspects of RPP2 relating to local government, communities and planning.

First, I went with my grandfather; I then went with the Boys Brigade, and then with the air cadets. For me at that time, I was showing my respect for the men and women who had fallen in wars that had long since happened. For a young boy in the 1970s and early 1980s, the first and second world wars and even the Korean war seemed like light years in the past.</p><p>In 1982, the remembrance ceremony was more poignant, as we thought of those who had been involved in the Falklands conflict. In recent times, the act of remembrance has changed dramatically, as we think of members of the armed forces who have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Cowdray hall war memorial, the MacRobert memorial garden and the many memorials in Duthie park in Aberdeen are now joined by Allan Douglas park, which was named after a young Northfield lance corporal who was killed in Iraq on 30 January 2006. Allan Douglas was on a routine patrol in Amarah when he was shot. Despite receiving medical attention, he later died of his injuries.</p><p>This morning, I spoke to Allan&#8217;s mother&#8212;Mrs Douglas&#8212;to seek her permission to speak about her son today. At the time, Mrs Douglas expressed her anger over the death of the son who</p><p>&#8220;just loved life, he just lived for life&#8221;.</p><p>The Douglas family last saw Allan when he came home for Christmas. Mrs Douglas said:</p><p>&#8220;He did not want to go back this time&#8212;he&#8217;d seen enough the first time he was over. He said it was a waste of time people being there, he just really didn&#8217;t like it at all.&#8221;</p><p>She went on:</p><p>&#8220;I did not want him to go there at all&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t his war.

I do not think Tony Blair should have put any young kids out there&#8212;there&#8217;s been so many of them killed.&#8221;</p><p>Naming the park after Allan Douglas is a fitting tribute to a brave young man and his family from a community that shares their loss, but will never truly understand their pain.</p><p>Families, friends and communities in Aberdeen, right across these islands and around the globe have been touched by the war in Iraq. Many grieving parents, spouses and children find it difficult to comprehend why their loved ones were killed or maimed. Casualty numbers vary, but the costsofwar.org website states that there have been more than 189,000 direct war deaths, with at least 134,000 civilians killed. The website goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;it would not be surprising if indirect death were 2 to 4 times the number of direct deaths due to violence - reaching as high as 536,000 indirect deaths over the 134,000 civilians killed directly by violence.&#8221;</p><p>A 2011 survey conservatively estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million Iraqi children have lost one or both parents.

That isn&#8217;t borne out by what actually happened,&#8217; said Lord Turnbull, then cabinet secretary.</p><p>Lord Wilson, his predecessor, told the inquiry that if asked whether there were &#8216;proper cabinet&#8217; decisions in the run-up to war, he would say &#8216;emphatically not&#8217;.</p><p>He said he remembered saying in March 2002, a year before the invasion: &#8216;There is a gleam in [Blair&#8217;s] eye that worries me.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>If only the Cabinet had had the guts to challenge Blair and to seek all the relevant information and MPs had taken a principled stand, we would not have had to face the unjust, illegal war in Iraq, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis; we would not be mourning the recent deaths of young service personnel at war memorials each November; and the Douglases would still have their son, Allan.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I should say that I am not a pacifist.

There were some cases in Grampian when folk were unavailable four times in the course of their wait. Some folk may question why that happened so many times, but I come from a part of Scotland where many people work offshore and their work sometimes does not let them go to get treatment at the times that are offered.

Our committee experienced first-hand the positive impact that effective community planning partnerships can play in delivering public services in Scotland. Community planning partnerships can only do so, however, when all those involved in the partnership are prepared to work together and are working to shared goals. To do this there needs to be a cultural change within parts of the public sector and a recognition of the benefits true partnership working can bring.&#8221;</p><p>When the committee asked whether that ambition had been met, it found that it had not been fully met and that barriers still existed.

There seemed to be more of a focus on inputs and outputs than on outcomes. Again, engagement with partners and local communities is required to ensure that we can measure outcomes properly. Such engagement is central to the future development of single outcome agreements.</p><p>Strand 2 of the inquiry looked at benchmarking, which was a bit of a dream for an anorak like me. It may have been hard going for some committee members, but they considered assiduously the benchmarking work that was going on. We had a lot of engagement with people on the issue and held a seminar on benchmarking that I think was extremely useful for all those who attended. It was a short, sharp inquiry, which considered the work on benchmarking that local government officials who are members of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers in Scotland carried out for almost three years. Progress was slow, but eventually all 32 councils bought into the work.</p><p>It is critical that the Parliament recognises the significance of that benchmarking project, because it represents the first time that all 32 local authorities in Scotland have co-operated to produce consistent data on key indicators for benchmarking. It is equally critical to recognise that the data will still be influenced by local circumstances and priorities and that that context remains important. The Parliament should welcome that benchmarking initiative and encourage councils and community planning partnership partners to use it to drive forward public sector reform.</p><p>Benchmarking allows organisations to compare their services, costs and outcomes against those of others who are undertaking similar activities and to do so over a period of time. All local authorities can therefore compare their results and costs against one another&#8217;s; in each case, it will be possible to identify which is the cheapest and which has the highest outcomes. The comparison also allows local factors to be taken into account and, crucially, it can reflect local priorities. That means that instead of the previous situation in which authorities often compared apples with pears, they will now compare apples with apples.</p><p>The committee was told that it was critical for SOLACE that benchmarking</p><p>&#8220;should drive improvement in council service delivery.&#8221;</p><p>We also took evidence from Scottish Water, which has been doing benchmarking for a number of years and which told the committee that it had contributed to annual cost efficiency savings of &#163;100 million between 2002 and 2006. Scottish Water sees absolutely no downside to the benchmarking process. COSLA has bought into benchmarking completely and utterly, and it agreed that it was desirable to collect indicators on a comparative basis across all councils and that comparative analysis seems to be the key management tool of the approach for the future.</p><p>That of course links into the Christie commission, which recognised that</p><p>&#8220;well designed external challenge can be &#8216;a catalyst for improvement where it influences behaviour and culture of providers, leading to improvements in the way that services are delivered.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>The committee will continue to monitor the benchmarking indicators as they are brought into play. I think that some are very surprised at how much interest the committee took in that matter.</p><p>I move on to strand 3 and what still needs to be done. We will continue to look at our findings from strands 1 and 2, and we will involve communities and third sector providers. It was therefore a little galling to see from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations today a little briefing that is critical of strand 3. SCVO seems to think that we will not involve communities and third sector partners, which could not be further from the truth. The committee has already committed to go on further outings throughout the country to take evidence.</p><p>So, is PSR happening in Scotland? We think that, yes, the green shoots are there, but it is not happening as fast as is needed or desired. It can be haphazard in certain places and is a bit pick and mix. It can often be driven by external rather than internal factors. There are many reasons, we are told, for the slow pace of change: legal constraints, political will, finance, different rates of development across public sector bodies, data, partnerships, CPPs, outcomes, attitudes, and long lead-in times.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with Mr McMillan.

I, too, am glad to see you back.</p><p>The High Hedges (Scotland) Bill came before the committee in October 2012. We received 90 submissions to our call for evidence. The overwhelming majority of the people from whom we heard wanted legislative action to address the irresponsible actions of a very small minority.</p><p>As part of our consideration of the bill, we held three oral evidence sessions. I thank everyone who responded to our call for evidence and all those who gave oral evidence. It did not come as a surprise to me or to other members of the committee that it was a debate that generated quite a lot of heat. There is probably not a member in the chamber whose constituency mailbag has never had a high-hedge case in it.</p><p>I also thank the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and the official report for their support and assistance, and put on record my thanks to all the members of the committee, who were extremely assiduous during the course of our discussions. Members should note that I said &#8220;assiduous&#8221; and not &#8220;deciduous&#8221;. I am sorry for that very bad joke, Presiding Officer.</p><p>The key issue was the definition of a high hedge. Some people wanted the bill to become the high trees and hedges bill; some people wanted specific trees&#8212;generally native evergreens and others such as holly, juniper and yew&#8212;to be exempt; and some people wanted anything that constituted a barrier to be included, regardless of type, origin or species, and did not see a difference between deciduous trees and evergreen or semi-evergreen hedges. We had some sympathy, but we were warned by, and agreed with, the majority that keeping it simple was best.</p><p>We accept that care is needed to avoid adverse impacts on wildlife or biodiversity, which could have a number of unintended consequences, not least for costs and workload for local authorities. A majority of the committee supports the simple definition in the bill, which follows the tried-and-tested approach taken in England and Wales. During our evidence sessions, we heard from the Isle of Man, where there have been difficulties in extending a similar bill to include other species and trees. We also heard about some of the associated costs&#8212;particularly the legal costs&#8212;of adding such provisions. Unfortunately, I cannot give definitive figures, because we do not have them.</p><p>Evidence was received on the link with tree preservation orders. Some favoured that link, but others did not like the connection. The committee agreed that the test local authorities must apply is similar to the test for the making of a TPO, and that it therefore made sense for the two to live together. If an authority decides that a high-hedge order is appropriate and action requires to be taken against a tree that is part of the hedge, it is implicit in that determination that the continued existence of a TPO is not appropriate.</p><p>There was a considerable amount of evidence on who should pay the local authority&#8217;s costs and on how much the costs could and should be. Perhaps unusually, local authorities had little to say on that, provided that the bill&#8217;s impact on them was cost neutral. Those affected by high hedges were adamant that the hedge owner should pay all costs incurred. Such a scheme is possible, but it would increase complexity and, paradoxically, costs. Under the bill&#8217;s proposals, the owners of high hedges will have to pay and will be liable for the costs of action taken to reduce the height of a hedge. The committee agreed that, ultimately, the intention was not for action to be required but for parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Under the bill, there is a financial incentive for both parties to reach agreement. The committee hopes that many disputes will be resolved amicably&#8212;indeed, it accepts that that will be the case. We have anecdotal evidence that some disputes have already been resolved because of the bill&#8217;s introduction.</p><p>Other areas that the committee considered and made recommendations about include concern that the body of expertise available to local authorities about trees and hedges is diminishing rapidly. The committee suggests that the Government should consider establishing a central tree officer so that a core of expertise is available to all local authorities. We understand that such an officer already exists in Wales. It will do no harm to see how Wales is getting on with the way in which that has been set up, from which we can perhaps learn lessons.</p><p>Another concern is that we must ensure that where the local authority is a party to an application, either as the applicant or the landowner, sufficiently independent and transparent arrangements are in place to ensure that justice can be seen to be done. Such an apparent conflict is not novel; it also occurs in planning, for example, and is successfully addressed there.</p><p>We should take advantage of the current review of planning guidance to ensure that future problems with hedges and plants are avoided. The committee recently visited Cumbernauld where we saw some woodland that the Scottish Wildlife Trust had cut back after talking to local residents. Some such disputes would not happen if they were dealt with by a planning authority at the outset. There are lessons to be learned in that regard.</p><p>We recommend that the national park authorities be made statutory consultees in all applications for high-hedge notices made within their park areas.</p><p>We believe that the legislation should undergo a full review after it has been in operation for not more than five years. That will allow the questions around the definition and fees to be looked at, and it will present an early opportunity for amendments in the light of operational experience.</p><p>Our conclusions are that the committee supports the bill&#8217;s general principles and agrees with the approach that it takes to the definition of high hedges. We have made recommendations that relate to having a central tree expert and reviewing planning policy in the area, with the national parks authorities included as consultees. We would also like to see a reasonably early review of the operation of the legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Sometimes, we think too much about those high-level issues in this place, so I want to start by talking about some of the conversations that I have had in my constituency recently about the child benefit cuts.</p><p>Just as the cuts were taking place, a woman from my constituency who has a part-time job as a cleaner and whose husband works offshore in the oil industry and earns slightly over &#163;50,000 a year talked to me about the impact that they would experience due to the money that they would lose because of the changes. A lot of folk will say, &#8220;If her husband&#8217;s earning &#163;50,000 a year, they&#8217;re probably pretty well off.&#8221; However, we all know that lots of people struggle, no matter what their earnings may be. She said, &#8220;I would not be so bothered about us losing money if I knew that the money was going to somebody in society who is poorer than me.&#8221; However, that is not the case. She said that it was particularly galling that a household in which there were two earners who each earned slightly less than &#163;50,000 would retain the benefit.</p><p>That discussion went on for some time. The lady had her head screwed on, without a doubt, because she went on to talk about the concept of universality. The Labour Party has stated that it introduced family allowance in 1946, which it replaced with child benefit in 1975. That is something for the Labour Party to be proud of. However, my problem is that, at this moment in time, I do not know where the Labour Party stands on universality any more.</p><p>The conversation with the lady in my constituency went on. She said, &#8220;If this universal benefit is going to be cut by Westminster, is the state pension going to be the next universal benefit to go?&#8221;</p><p>How can the population trust the parties at Westminster on that issue? Annabelle Ewing has already pointed out that, in his 2009 speech to the Tory conference, George Osborne said:</p><p>&#8220;We will preserve child benefit&#8221;</p><p>and other universal benefits. How can folk believe what he has to say?</p><p>Mr Rennie refused to take an intervention from me, in which I was going to point out that his leader, Nick Clegg, said, just before the last election:</p><p>&#8220;We are not putting child benefit into question.&#8221;</p><p>Once again, another U-turn from the Liberals; another failed manifesto promise. How can anyone trust the Liberals on benefits?</p><p>It is Labour&#8217;s position that really intrigues me. Members might be interested in this quote, which says that the Government</p><p>&#8220;plan to pay the deficit down on the backs of those with low and middle incomes, with a threat to universal benefits such as child benefit and the winter fuel payment ... It is essential that we defend these payments. The alternative is a dangerous erosion of the social solidarity that comes from a universal system.&#8221;</p><p>So said Ed Miliband in The Observer on 29 August 2010. Yet here in Scotland there are questions over the Scottish Labour Party&#8217;s position on universality, what with Johann Lamont&#8217;s proposed cuts commission. In today&#8217;s debate, Labour members need to tell the Scottish people where they stand on the principle of universality.

I will stick to five minutes because many colleagues have gone over ground that I was going to cover. Some members are much more expert on some of these issues than I am, including my colleague Brian Adam, who has had a close working relationship with Aberdeen airport over many a year, and Mark McDonald, who was on the Aberdeen airport consultative committee.</p><p>I had the great pleasure of having Derek Provan, the managing director of Aberdeen airport, on the board of the north east of Scotland transport partnership&#8212;NESTRANS&#8212;when I was chair. He is a man who is always worth listening to and he always bases everything that he says on fact. Of the York Aviation report, he said:</p><p>&#8220;This report shows, quite simply, that APD is damaging Scotland. It is damaging our economy, our tourism potential and our ability as a nation to bounce back from the recession. It limits our opportunities for growth in the employment market, costing as much as &#163;50 million in the process.</p><p>At Aberdeen Airport we run a real risk of losing around 200,000 passengers by 2016 through this damaging tax. Each recent increase in APD has had a dramatic impact upon what we, as airports, have achieved and could have achieved without APD. It is imperative that the UK government undertake a detailed and comprehensive review into APD with the utmost urgency, and at the very least freeze APD whilst that is taking place.&#8221;</p><p>Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said:</p><p>&#8220;We would welcome APD devolution if it enabled a reduction in costs for businesses in the region&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>I believe that it can&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;Devolution of APD would allow the Scottish Government to work more closely with Scottish airports to devise a Scotland-focused package aimed at boosting international routes, while at the same time securing the continuation of lifeline routes.&#8221;</p><p>Those are the views of some of the people of the north-east of Scotland. I am sure that many members from that region hear about the day-to-day difficulties that folks experience in trying to get to certain places. They are very much of the opinion that we need many more direct routes from Scotland to the rest of the world.</p><p>More direct flights are absolutely vital to ensure that the powerhouse economy of the north-east of Scotland continues to thrive. I am not arguing here and now for every one of those direct international routes to be from Aberdeen airport&#8212;I am quite happy to share with Glasgow and Edinburgh. We find that folk are willing to take the train to leave from Glasgow, Edinburgh or even Prestwick to get to their destination, but if they cannot do it from those airports, they take a flight to a hub airport before flying onward to their destination. My colleague Kenneth Gibson pointed out that we know for a fact that that increases the carbon footprint dramatically.</p><p>In proposals similar to those that we have seen from the Calman commission, the Silk commission, which reported the other day, said that APD should be devolved to Wales. There is no argument that says that it should not.</p><p>We know now that in January 2013 Northern Ireland will reduce the duty on long-haul flights from there to zero. I can see a situation in which a number of international carriers will move to Belfast. We will see an increase in the number of short-haul flights from Scotland to Belfast, to take advantage of those new routes. I do not want that to happen. I have no problem whatsoever with the people of the north of Ireland&#8212;not at all. I want to see their economy thrive, but I want us to have the economic advantages that we should have.</p><p>That is why I believe that it is vital that we take control over this tax as soon as we possibly can. I hope that all the other taxes will follow with the full powers of an independent Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677319", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I agree with Mr Moxham.</p><p>On Radio Scotland on 28 September, Lindsay Scott of Age Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;Means testing has been proven time and time again not to do what it&#8217;s supposed to do.&#8221;</p><p>She noted that respected institutions such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Pensions Policy Institute and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have called it</p><p>&#8220;unacceptably complicated, stigmatising and expensive.&#8221;</p><p>In The Times on 1 October, Ros Altmann, the director general of Saga, said:</p><p>&#8220;extending means-testing for pensioners would be a step in the wrong direction. It would be impractical, expensive to administer and a further disincentive for moderate earners to save for old age.&#8221;</p><p>She added that universal benefits</p><p>&#8220;ensure that all those who need money will actually get it&#8221;,</p><p>rather than pride getting in the way of their claiming it. She also said:</p><p>&#8220;the reason we have all these additional benefits is because our state pension is so low for so many people&#8221;.</p><p>She added:</p><p>&#8220;Where to draw the line would be almost impossible to determine.&#8221;</p><p>Those outside figures agree with the policies of the Scottish Government.

In last year&#8217;s debate, I said that when I was first elected to Aberdeen City Council an official asked me how many kids I had. When I said that I did not have any children, the official&#8217;s response was, &#8220;Well, you have 300-odd as of today.&#8221; That brings home our corporate parenting responsibilities. Even more daunting is the knowledge that I am now one of the corporate parents of more than 16,000 kids. That is a huge responsibility that none of us should forget. The minister referred to the corporate parent training that will be available shortly to members. I have done similar training and have done GIRFEC training, and I think that it is immensely important that, as members, we know what our responsibilities are.</p><p>In the debate last year, the then Minister for Children and Young People, Angela Constance, said:</p><p>&#8220;if something is not good enough for our own sons and daughters, it is not good enough for any child or young person growing up in Scotland.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 27 October 2011; c 2777.]</p><p>I agree entirely with that statement. We should be aspirational for all the kids for whom we are responsible.</p><p>I pay tribute to all those folks right across Scotland who work in children&#8217;s services. Mr Malik talked about social work services, which are sometimes very much put upon&#8212;as many have said, it seems that they cannot do right for doing wrong. As a Parliament, we should recognise the good work that goes on across the country in social services, pay tribute to our social workers and put in place the adequate protection that they require.</p><p>Over the past year and a half, I have had the great privilege to visit a number of services in my constituency. Just the other week, I volunteered in Barnardo&#8217;s Union Street shop with Diane and her team, who do sterling work. Also present was the lady who heads up the Linksfield residential service in Aberdeen, which is a Barnardo&#8217;s-run project that I have visited before and hope to visit again. In last year&#8217;s debate, I highlighted Aberdeen City Council&#8217;s award-winning adoption and fostering service, which also does sterling work. I make no apology for mentioning that service again.</p><p>Today, I want to concentrate on the impediments to folk becoming kinship carers. While doing research into what general practitioner contracts require GPs to do, I found an interesting anomaly. I received a letter today from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that states:</p><p>&#8220;GPs are obliged within their contractual terms (it is a national contract) to provide certain reports. The most common are medical certificates and death certificates. For others, it falls into two camps&#8221;.</p><p>It is the first camp that we need to take cognisance of. The letter refers to</p><p>&#8220;Collaborative fees where it is recognised that they do work, usually for a Local Authority, and then claim a fee, for example for fostering/adoption.&#8221;</p><p>It continues:</p><p>&#8220;GPs can say no to these requests as it is not obligatory&#8221;.</p><p>That is probably a bit of the red tape that has been talked about so much today. I hope that the minister will follow that up and try to ensure that agreeing to such requests becomes obligatory so that the right information can be sought and we can get on much quicker with fostering and adoption.</p><p>I want to highlight the difficulties that the new welfare reform regime might throw up when children are being placed. The Welfare Reform Committee visited a housing association last week to talk about the housing benefit pilot that it is undertaking. One woman highlighted the difficulties with the bedroom tax. She is a kinship carer but there is no permanency at the moment. Like many others, she is extremely worried about the impact of the bedroom tax on her ability to be a kinship carer. It will be fine as long as the legal process is on-going, but when it is finished, she might be penalised for having a so-called extra bedroom, even if she has a child living with her. I hope that we can lobby the Westminster Government very hard to take account of those silly situations.</p><p>Members have talked about early intervention and the speed of the adoption process, but I do not have the time to go over those issues. We must secure the future of the children involved because they are Scotland&#8217;s future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I had the privilege of speaking in last year&#8217;s debate on this issue, and I am honoured to be called to speak in today&#8217;s debate.

I am really glad that the Government has recognised the plight of Shetland Islands Council and has moved to try to alleviate some of its difficulties. That is to be applauded and shows that the Government has listened to the Shetland case.</p><p>The Government has listened on a number of other issues, too. As George Adam does, I want to see empty properties being brought back into use. The target is 5,500 properties across Scotland, and I hope that that is achieved. The fact that the Government has listened is shown by the fact that it has said that it will introduce the fresh start scheme. That scheme will operate similarly to the scheme that was introduced earlier in the year in Northern Ireland; it will provide 50 per cent relief for 12 months for properties that are brought back into use after being empty for a year. The Federation of Small Businesses said:</p><p>&#8220;A rates discount for properties brought back into use is a great idea that we hope can be made to deliver for Scottish town centres and high streets ... The details of the scheme will be crucial to its success and we hope that all sorts of small enterprises can benefit.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that the minister will continue his discussions with the FSB and others to ensure that the fresh start scheme is a success.</p><p>We did not hear much&#8212;I mean in particular from the Con-Dem partners&#8212;today about the situation in England and Wales. The scheme that operates there is somewhat different, and I have to say that it is not as good as what is proposed in Scotland. Robert Neill, who was a junior minister at the Department of Communities and Local Government, has said that the coalition has</p><p>&#8220;no immediate plans to reverse&#8221;</p><p>the 2008 reforms&#8212;reforms that I believe are not as good as the bill that we are debating today.</p><p>If we look around our constituencies and nearby, we see that there are, without doubt, property owners who deliberately keep their properties empty for whatever reason. They are being subsidised to do that by not having to pay the rates that they should be paying. I will give an example. In my old council ward of Northfield in Aberdeen, which is in Brian Adam&#8217;s constituency of Aberdeen Donside, there is a set of shops that have been empty for 13 years. It is not as though offers have not been made for them; for example, there was a suggestion that they could be taken over for community use, but that was rejected by the owners, for whatever reason.</p><p>Although a lot has been said about the doom and gloom in the economy, in many parts of the country&#8212;including my patch&#8212;where the recession has not hit as hard as it has hit elsewhere, we have property owners who are deliberately keeping properties empty. That has to be resolved.</p><p>As I said at the start of my speech, the Government has listened. It has listened in the case of Shetland Islands Council and it has listened to small businesses and has come up with the fresh start scheme. I hope that the Government will continue to listen to those who are affected&#8212;I see the minister nodding&#8212;and that we will see 5,500 empty properties being brought back into use sooner rather than later.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675509", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the folks who gave evidence to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and I thank the members of that committee and the clerking team.

Unfortunately, most of my bus journeys are in Aberdeen and, instead of the &#163;1.40 fare that Edinburgh has, I have to fork out &#163;2.40 for a journey, which is disgraceful. However, that is a debate for another day. I will not go on a rant about First Aberdeen.</p><p>I attended the unveiling of Aberdeen&#8217;s new hybrid buses in July with the minister. I do not often agree with the city&#8217;s current lord provost, George Adam, but he said that day:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited about the development of a greener, smarter bus network in Aberdeen. The introduction of the low-emission buses constitutes a welcome contribution to the environment in which we all live and breathe.&#8221;</p><p>The buses are spectacular in other ways, too, because there is free wi-fi on many of them. What more do some folk need to attract them into getting on the bus than being able to do their work rather than sit in the car doing nothing?</p><p>The most exciting thing for me about what is happening in Aberdeen is not the hybrid buses&#8212;although I hope that there will be more of them&#8212;but the Aberdeen hydrogen project. I thank Jan Falconer of Aberdeen City Council for providing me with a wee briefing about that for today.</p><p>As part of the project, Aberdeen City Council is supporting two strategic Europe hydrogen transport projects. They represent the first major element of the Aberdeen hydrogen project and aim to introduce hydrogen buses to the north-east of Scotland. The buses will be fuelled using locally generated renewable hydrogen, and the production facilities that will be needed to generate the hydrogen will be created. There will also be additional hydrogen for other uses, which is the second element of the project.</p><p>The project has been made possible by some significant funding from various sources. The First Minister announced &#163;3.3 million for the project&#8212;&#163;1.65 million is from the Scottish Government and &#163;1.65 million is from Scottish Enterprise. The project has also secured a large amount of European money and there is, of course, interest from various private companies. It has often been very difficult for Aberdeen and the north-east, which were seen as being particularly rich, to access European funding in any shape or form. I therefore pay tribute to Yasa Ratnayeke of Aberdeen City Council, who has secured &#163;9.2 million of European Union money for the project. His effort should be praised by the Parliament as well as by Aberdonians.</p><p>Phase 1 of the project is the hydrogen buses and the fuelling station. As I have said, it consists of two European projects: High VLOCity and HyTransit. Ten hydrogen fuel cell buses will be deployed. First will operate four&#8212;I hope at a lower cost to the passenger than is currently the case for First in Aberdeen&#8212;and Stagecoach will operate the remaining six.</p><p>This is the first hydrogen bus deployment in Scotland and it is of international significance, as Aberdeen will have the largest hydrogen bus fleet of any European city. The buses will be refuelled at Scotland&#8217;s first large hydrogen refuelling station, which will also be able to refuel passenger vehicles, as and when they become available. The buses will operate on routes into central Aberdeen, which guarantees a high profile for the project. New hydrogen-compatible maintenance bays will be prepared to allow maintenance of the vehicles by local technicians supported by international experts.</p><p>That is phase 1 of the project. I am sure that phase 2 will result in greater debate in the future, but I think that phase 1 is equally exciting, which is why I am so pleased that the Government has backed the project in the way that it has. If a significant regular demand for hydrogen emerges, it will justify the deployment of a hydrogen generation infrastructure on a scale that makes it practical for large energy companies to invest. As I said, many companies are already looking at the scheme and at the benefits that could arise in the future.</p><p>I will not go into the technologies that we are talking about, because I am not so technical in that regard. However, when somebody tells me that we can become a world leader and that the beginnings of our doing so lie in this project, if it grows in the way that it could, I will certainly grasp on to that, particularly when Aberdeen&#8212;that place that I do not mention very often&#8212;could be that world leader.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a non-driver and regular bus user, I am in the same position as Mr Biagi.

I thank them very much indeed.</p><p>The headlines in today&#8217;s Daily Record read &#8220;Heartless Tests Leave Disabled Penniless&#8221; and &#8220;The Atos Scandal&#8221;. Although I am no cheerleader for Atos, the reality is that its contract has been laid down by the Department for Work and Pensions. It is Westminster that is to blame for the situation and, although Atos is doing its bidding, it is doing so under the contract that has been written by the DWP in London.</p><p>I am sure that work capability assessments have featured in the postbag of every single member of late. I am sure that many members will have had people coming to their surgeries with their tales of woe. From my own perspective, some of the stories that I have heard are absolutely heart wrenching&#8212;it is an absolute disgrace.</p><p>Unfortunately, some folk are unwilling to have their individual cases told in Parliament, because there is a fear about going on the record. However, last week in this Parliament, at the Welfare Reform Committee meeting, three very brave individuals gave evidence. I am sure that their evidence will feature in later speeches.</p><p>The Crisis report &#8220;Single homeless people&#8217;s experience of the Work Capability Assessments&#8221; notes that almost a quarter of single homeless people have to wait more than six weeks to receive the outcome of their assessment. Given that the overall assessment process can be daunting, frightening and incredibly stressful for claimants with mental health issues, it is imperative that the time between the assessment and communication with the claimant is kept to a minimum. I agree with Crisis in that regard.</p><p>For many, work capability assessments are a frightening experience. In my opinion, assessments should be as easy and as flexible as possible in order to take into account fluctuating conditions and extenuating circumstances, but they most certainly are not like that at present. It is most concerning that service providers and advice agencies are being significantly affected due to the nature of the assessment, with citizens advice bureaux in Scotland dealing with almost 20,000 new employment and support allowance issues in 2010-11. The Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Service individual independent advocacy service has reported an increase of more than 75 per cent in the number of cases relating to ESA from October 2010 to March 2011. It is clear from those statistics that the work capability assessment process needs to be made clearer and easier for those completing the assessment. That trend is echoed in many other agencies.</p><p>We know that 76 per cent of claimants appealed the outcome of their WCA and more than 50 per cent of those people have been successful and given a higher score on appeal. Those are concerning statistics. They show that few claimants trust the decision made by their assessor, and the fact that more than half are successful in an appeal shows that the decisions were incorrect. Appealing a decision, in what can be a stressful assessment for many with mental health conditions, can lead to further health conditions caused by stress, which can trigger depression and other fluctuating conditions.</p><p>The decisions of healthcare professionals at an assessment need to be trustworthy and free from error to result in fewer appeals and an easier process. The questions and point system of the assessment need to become relevant and fit for purpose when dealing with all conditions, and healthcare professionals should be given some discretion when discussing work capability with claimants.</p><p>There are significant issues around certain illnesses. For example, the treatment of claimants with blood-borne viruses is often misunderstood. Many of those claimants feel that the healthcare professional who is assessing them has no understanding of blood-borne viruses, the treatment for them and the side effects of that treatment. Terrence Higgins Trust has offered the Department for Work and Pensions free training on blood-borne viruses, which it has not taken up. That is a disgrace.</p><p>Today, I received a letter from the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, which says:</p><p>&#8220;With specific reference to people living with Hepatitis C, we would argue that patients undergoing eradication therapy for Hepatitis C should be viewed in a similar capacity to patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Hepatitis C can be lengthy and involve debilitating side effects. Indeed patients with Hepatitis C who are in employment are often reluctant to embark on an extensive course of eradication treatment as this might necessitate being off work for a long period as treatment can be arduous and not without side effects. The same can be true of HIV positive patients who have developed complications from their disease.&#8221;</p><p>RCGP Scotland argues that those folk are in the same position as those &#8220;undergoing cancer therapy&#8221; and I agree with that.</p><p>The Atos contract needs to be looked at very carefully. A new contract with a value of &#163;206,703,507 has been awarded to undertake assessments for personal independence payments for Scotland and north England. I have received a copy of the tender for that, which was redacted. I cannot go into any depth on it. The redaction was not done particularly well, and I managed to access information that I probably should not have accessed. I will reveal that at a later date.</p><p>Finally, the DWP report in today&#8217;s Daily Record says that</p><p>&#8220;HALF of people stripped of disability benefits after being ruled &#8216;fit for work&#8217; by Atos were left unemployed and without income&#8221;;</p><p>that</p><p>&#8220;55 per cent of people who lost benefits ... had failed to find work&#8221;;</p><p>and that only 15 per cent are in jobs and 35 per cent are on other benefits.</p><p>The paper also says:</p><p>&#8220;Atos have assessed patients with terminal illnesses as &#8216;fit for work&#8217;. And thousands of victims of genuine, chronic conditions have complained of being humiliated by the company&#8217;s tests.&#8221;</p><p>That is absolutely disgraceful. The only way to deal with the matter is by the Parliament taking full control of welfare. I hope that that will happen sooner rather than later so that folk do not have to put up with those situations any longer.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673476", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Work Capability Assessments"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the organisations and individuals who have supplied us with information and briefings for today&#8217;s debate.

Like many big schemes, the city garden project is not without controversy. It would be fair to say that the proposed city centre development polarised Aberdonians&#8217; views. That polarisation was exacerbated by the many myths that were peddled about the scheme and who was likely to profit from it. Let us be honest, because as far as I am concerned the only folk who were going to benefit were Aberdonians.</p><p>However, because of that polarisation I, as a councillor at the time, put it to the council that a referendum should be held on the issue to get the true views of Aberdonians so that the people who make the decisions could take the decisions knowing full well what the views of the majority of Aberdonians were. That referendum took place and 45,301 people voted for the city garden project and 41,175 voted for the retention of Union Terrace gardens, which meant a majority of 4,126 for the former.</p><p>We have seen in recent times that referendum result being ignored by the Labour-led administration in Aberdeen. I believe that that is completely and utterly anti-democratic and goes against the wishes of the Aberdonians who took the time to vote in the referendum. Since then, we have seen a situation wherein the Labour Party does not know where it is going in dealing with Aberdeen. Some of its members say that the referendum result should not stand, because it was not a real referendum. I argue that the Labour Party legitimised the referendum by coming out as a campaigning organisation in the run-up to the vote.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672015", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aberdeen City Centre"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It may have escaped some folks&#8217; notice, but I am an Aberdonian born and bred.

I also thank the committee&#8217;s clerking team, which, as usual, was excellent in the tasks that it had to deal with.</p><p>It is fair to say that on a number of issues the committee was unanimous and that on other issues there was some controversy. I am sure that other members will bring some of that controversy into play during the debate.</p><p>I should perhaps begin with the non-controversial part of the bill&#8212;the housing support grant element. A cross-party group from the committee had the pleasure of visiting Shetland. As usual, the population of Shetland provided us with a warm welcome. Shetlanders are extremely canny people and they lobbied hard for the retention of the grant. However, it has to be recognised that Shetland Islands Council is the last council to be in receipt of that grant and the circumstances of the borrowing that it has made are somewhat strange.</p><p>As the minister pointed out, unlike most other authorities it has not borrowed money from the public works loan board&#8212;instead, it has borrowed money from its own harbour fund. Canny as the Shetlanders are, the harbour fund has been charging them interest and, in some regard, the housing support grant has been helping to pay that interest to increase the harbour fund. The committee unanimously agreed that that could not go on and recognised that the &#163;15&#160;million transitional fund that was asked for was not really a goer either. However, hats off to the Shetlanders for their lobbying efforts.</p><p>In moving from the area of complete agreement to the areas with some controversial aspects, I will deal with the housing element first. In terms of what the minister has just said, the committee would welcome the &#163;200 fine for not registering an empty property going up to &#163;500&#8212;the committee would see that as going in the right direction. The committee will look at that again at stage 2 but, quite frankly, the committee felt that a &#163;200 fine for not registering was not that much.</p><p>The committee welcomes the fact that there is local input to setting rates. Coming from a local government background, I always welcome the flexibility of allowing our local councils to do such things.</p><p>There was a huge debate about whether those moneys should be ring-fenced to be put back into housing. Again, coming from a local government background, I am not really in favour of ring fencing, but the committee fully endorsed the proposal to get the accounts after implementation to show where the money has been spent.</p><p>The longest part of my speech will probably be on the non-domestic rates proposals, because that is the area in which there was some disagreement in the committee. We certainly welcome the fact that industrial and listed buildings will be exempt from the plan. I welcome the minister&#8217;s comment that there might be a look at a relief element if a property is filled, because that was a topic of discussion in the committee. A number of organisations that appeared before the committee argued that the proposal was a bad thing, but no one likes new taxes&#8212;let us be honest about that. If it is possible to try to stop a tax, people will do everything that they can to do so.</p><p>There were also elements of discussion in the debates that were held at committee about different things happening in different areas of the country. It would be beneficial if the minister could have a look at that.</p><p>The minister rightly pointed out that the power is an enabling power only, that there are no plans at the moment to introduce it, and that if there were such plans, the matter would come back to the committee for a further look-see during consideration of the instrument that would need to be passed. That is one reason that the minister has given for there being no business and regulatory impact assessment, or BRIA. There was some debate about whether a BRIA should have taken place beforehand, and I am sure that other members will pick up on that point as the debate progresses.</p><p>There was a robust debate on that part of the bill dealing with the cost to the public sector if this measure is implemented. The minister has stated that the costs to the public sector will be &#163;1.8&#160;million. According to the Scottish Property Federation it may be up to &#163;3.6&#160;million. However, costs of &#163;1.8&#160;million or &#163;3.6&#160;million should be compared to the complete rates bill of &#163;2.3&#160;billion or so&#8212;we need to take account of that.</p><p>I have not referred to many of the other elements of the bill, but the Local Government and Regeneration Committee will discuss a number of those elements during its stage 2 scrutiny. I am pleased that the minister continues to consult stakeholders because some members of the committee were critical of a lack of consultation. I am pleased that he has said he will look at the fine for non-registration of an empty property as that was a major element in discussion. I hope that, when amendments are lodged, he will look at some form of relief for filling properties.</p><p>I look forward to the debate in committee at stage 2, which I am sure will be as robust as that which we had during stage 1. I look at colleagues as I say that. I enjoy Local Government and Regeneration Committee meetings because people are frank, but we all come out still speaking to one another&#8212;99 per cent of the time, at least. I hope that we can do exactly the same thing at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671644", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all those who gave evidence&#8212;either written or oral&#8212;to the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which helped us in our deliberations.

If she does, I would like her to meet some of the folk in Aberdeen whom I met recently, who have benefited from being on the modern apprenticeship scheme.</p><p>During his speech, Mr Gray also said that he would like every council to have a youth employment strategy and a way of dealing with the issue. I completely and utterly agree with him. I urge him to ask his colleagues in Aberdeen to back the motion of Councillor Gordon Townson on his plan for a youth employment strategy for Aberdeen.

Mr Baker is right to pay tribute to Dr George Stevenson for the efforts that he has made in that regard, and I also join the member in paying tribute to Professors McClinton and N&#8217;Dow. The campaign already has a huge amount of support in Aberdeen and the north-east.</p><p>Some time ago, UCAN was helped by a grant from the common good fund and, just recently, it received money from the Lord Provost&#8217;s Charitable Trust. It will be the main beneficiary of money raised from the Crathes vintage car and motorcycle rally, and Fraserburgh football team members decided to pose naked recently, covering their modesty with footballs, to raise money for the campaign. I, too, have made a donation. I have no intention whatsoever of posing with a football covering my bits and I am sure that that is a great relief to everyone.</p><p>Mr Baker listed many of the benefits of this robot-assisted surgery. The key thing for me is the benefits for patients if it comes into play, which I am sure will happen. The huge benefits for the patients include smaller surgical incisions, of 1in or less; less blood loss during surgery and less need for blood transfusion; reduced post-operative pain and discomfort; shorter hospital stays; faster overall recovery; earlier restoration of urinary and sexual function; and less cosmetic scarring.</p><p>There are also huge benefits for the surgeons who would use the equipment: enhanced 3D visualisation; improved dexterity; increased range of movement; greater surgical precision; improved access; consistent performance; the simplification of many existing MIS techniques; a shortened training time for MIS procedures; and less physical demand on the surgeons.</p><p>UCAN has made some great advances since it came into being at ward 44 in 2008. As Mr Baker rightly pointed out, a recent refurbishment was led and scrutinised by Dr Stevenson. Like Mr Baker, I do not know how the estate staff at the hospital coped with that. On a recent visit to the Parliament, Dr Stevenson inspected the woodwork&#8212;that is the way of the man. He is to be greatly respected for the efforts that he puts in.</p><p>I named some organisations that are rallying behind the campaign.

Ms Marra talked about the closure of some schools, but she did not talk about the 10 new schools that have been built in Aberdeen in recent times and were delivered by the SNP-led administration. That is interesting, but not entirely surprising.</p><p>There is absolutely no doubt that the debate about Union Terrace gardens has polarised the city. One reason why I called for the referendum and moved a motion at the council, which was passed, is that there was only one way to deal with the matter and that was to let Aberdonians decide what the situation should be. Last week, 52 per cent of Aberdonians voted in favour of the city garden project. I voted yes, as did many others.</p><p>I will give members a few numbers: 51.1 per cent versus 48.9 per cent. The figure of 51.1 per cent is the share of votes that Anas Sarwar received to become the Labour Party&#8217;s deputy leader; 48.9 per cent of folk voted agin. Does Labour dispute that he should be the deputy leader? Lewis Macdonald probably does, but he received only 15.62 per cent.</p><p>The usual local government election campaign has started and Labour has nothing whatever to say that is positive. It has of late punted out a leaflet called &#8220;Aberdeen Leader&#8221;&#8212;I think not&#8212;the headline of which is, &#8220;Your City, Your Say&#8221;. Labour then gives citizens an instruction:</p><p>&#8220;Vote to Retain Union Terrace Gardens&#8221;.</p><p>I am a little bit of a cynic, but I think that Labour has printed a huge number of those leaflets, canna see them go to waste and winna have them pulped, which is why we are having the debate.</p><p>It is no surprise to me or my colleagues that the Labour Party is holding up the development of our city. Ms Boyack said that we were discussing &#8220;a local planning issue&#8221;. It is not a local planning issue yet, although I am sure that it will be. The Labour Party has voted en bloc to turn down every major planning proposal of late. That applies to the third Don crossing, as has been said, and to the community stadium, Marischal college and so on.</p><p>The Labour Party has been in trouble before over possible whipping on planning issues&#8212;we saw the demise of one of its councillors not so long ago over the Kingswells stadium bid. Some time real soon, somebody will probably look at Labour&#8217;s voting records and at the fact that politics is coming into play in planning issues.</p><p>Ms Boyack said in the Evening Express this week that Labour would paint the Town house red. That is a matter for the people of Aberdeen, but I do not see that coming, because the Labour Party has gone down and down in recent times. If she wants to paint the Town house red, she will have to visit B&amp;amp;Q to get a few tins of paint and some brushes, and I am sure that she will have an argument with Historic Scotland about that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662600", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aberdeen City Council (Union Terrace Gardens)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a member of Aberdeen City Council.

I am glad that most of today&#8217;s debate has been consensual.</p><p>Something that has not been talked about at all today is evidence that the committee took at the beginning of the inquiry that blew away the myth that implementing the living wage would have a detrimental effect on equal pay and single status. The blowing away of that myth and the fact that people were talking about the living wage led to a situation in which more councils felt confident about implementing the living wage. I think that that is why we have seen other councils around the country moving forward on the living wage, and I hope that more will follow.</p><p>I will not touch on many of the issues that the convener addressed in his speech, but I will follow up on some issues around procurement. The convener said, as have many others, that the cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, has written to the European Commission on procurement. I will not bore members by going into any depth on the on-going case of R?ffert v Niedersachsen. I think that it may be a while before we get a reply from the European Commission on procurement. However, it would be wise to wait for that reply; I am sure that no member would want to breach European law.</p><p>Sarah Boyack said in her speech that there should be a living wage unit in the Government. I refer members to paragraph 135 of the report, which states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee notes the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth&#8217;s view that there is no need for the establishment of a living wage unit within the Scottish Government. The Committee took the view that the co-ordination and mainstreaming of work on the living wage across different strands of government was more important than there being a dedicated unit.&#8221;</p><p>I do not want to get my colleagues John Pentland and Anne McTaggart into trouble, but that view was agreed unanimously by the committee on the basis of the evidence that we heard. I was interested to note that John Pentland seems to have changed his mind today about that.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell was part of the unanimous agreement to the report, but she, too, seems to have changed tack today. I will not consider in any depth the comments that she made, but I disagreed with a lot of what she said.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale rightly pointed out the issue around CBI Scotland&#8217;s written evidence, which in one instance quoted only half the evidence to which it referred. In addition, the committee was most disappointed to hear the suggestion that CBI Scotland&#8217;s written evidence to the inquiry was drafted in London, and it was equally disappointed that CBI Scotland said that nobody was available to come to give oral evidence. That tells me that the folk from CBI Scotland were not going to be able to defend the written evidence that was submitted on their behalf. It is really disappointing when an organisation submits written evidence but is&#8212;I think&#8212;afraid to come to the committee to defend it. I hope that that does not happen again.</p><p>I pay tribute to John Wilson, who, over the years, has made a big contribution to the debate, as director of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and in various other capacities. He rightly pointed out that major companies in London back the living wage, including Barclays Bank. Let us be honest&#8212;in some regards, banks do not have a good record of late but, in this case, they have a very good record. That shows that there is in London a coalition of views that to pay the living wage is a good thing.</p><p>We know that John Park, too, has a very good record in the matter. I hope that we will be able to move forward on procurement, but we need some positive words from the EU. I would suggest that Mr Park read the case of R&#252;ffert v Niedersachsen, but I am sure that he has better things to do with his time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank the committee clerks, those who gave evidence to the committee and the committee members, including the convener and former members Kezia Dugdale and Mark Griffin, whom I know gave a lot to the inquiry.

I wrote to the cabinet secretary recently about a constituent of mine who has written a huge number of musicals over the years and has found it difficult to access funding from the usual bodies, including Creative Scotland and the National Theatre of Scotland. There is sometimes a certain amount of snobbery in the allocation of funds, which needs to be done away with. My constituent, Mike Gibb, recently musically adapted the &#8220;Outlander&#8221; books by Diana Gabaldon, who is an American author. All of the &#8220;Outlander&#8221; books, the first of which was called &#8220;Cross Stitch&#8221; in the United Kingdom, are entirely based in Scotland. I have to be honest and say that I have not read the books, as they are described as romantic drama, which is not quite my bag. However, the series of books has a huge fan base and has sold 20 million copies worldwide, and the musical has been staged in Dundee. Visitors from the United States managed to catch it on a Facebook site.</p><p>If our cultural and tourism organisations got together to create linkages and provide initial funding that could get returns, we could sell Scotland even more culturally and in other ways throughout the world. We need to consider carefully how we dole out funding. Far too often, it is doled out to the same things, which is not right. I hope that the cabinet secretary will agree to meet me to discuss that topic so that we can perhaps thrash it out and see whether we can link tourism with culture in making cultural grants.</p><p>This has been a brilliant debate in which there has been no disagreement across the chamber.

They were elected for the first time at the previous local government elections and one of them, John West, was 18 at the time. Those four councillors were fully engaged with the process, and I think that the fact that we had young candidates encouraged younger folk to go out and vote.</p><p>As I said when I intervened on Mrs Mitchell, 16 and 17-year-olds are engaged but there comes a point&#8212;and I do not know when it is&#8212;when a number of young folk become disengaged. We should give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote in every election&#8212;I have believed that all my days and will continue to believe it&#8212;so that we continue to keep them engaged in the process and do not have a point of disengagement. I cannot see what the difficulty is with enfranchising 16 and 17-year-olds. We have had some flip-flopping on the issue from the Liberal Democrats, who have not bothered coming to the chamber, and from some Labour members. It is time for the Parliament to have the right to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local government and Scottish elections.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658938", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Elections 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am always wary of adding to statutory burdens.

We, as a country, have lost out on many things because our cities have been competing against one another. One of the best examples is the Energy Technologies Institute: Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh tried to get it, but it ended up in Loughborough. That was a major loss for Scotland and for all three cities.</p><p>I turn to Aberdeen and will look first at connectivity, which is mentioned in the cities strategy. I will begin on a bit of connectivity for which we in the north-east have waited far too long: the Aberdeen western peripheral route. I hope that the court proceedings will be dealt with very quickly so that we can get on with the job of building that bypass and dealing with some of the other problems in the roads network. I say to Drew Smith, who mentioned the Haudagain roundabout, that nothing can be done there until the western peripheral route is in place. If we started on the Haudagain roundabout without the AWPR, the whole city of Aberdeen would be in gridlock.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw mentioned Aberdeen airport. I am extremely pleased at the level of investment in the airport in recent times, in particular for the runway extension, which has since brought us new routes to places such as Baku and Frankfurt and is good for the city and shire economy.</p><p>There is not just the airport. There has also been investment in deepening the harbour mouth, which has allowed better access because stormy weather sometimes caused difficulty in that regard. I, like my colleague John Finnie, who is sitting to the left of me, want improvements in the Aberdeen-Inverness railway and to the A96. The Government is committed to doing those things.</p><p>It is not all about connectivity. We must also consider sustainability. Other places could learn many lessons from things that are going on in Aberdeen. I have mentioned in the chamber previously the success of Aberdeen combined heat and power.

I thank the committee for its inquiry and I welcome the innovation of having the debate before the report is written. In his opening remarks, the convener said that he was keen to hear about where things work. I hope that he will get a feel for some of the positives in my constituency today.</p><p>I will talk first about positive destinations rather than attainment. In Aberdeen, we have a reasonable amount of success in that regard. The council works closely with schools, 16-plus co-ordinators, Skills Development Scotland, voluntary projects and further education colleges to ensure that looked-after young people who are leaving schools are offered a positive destination. The council is delivering the family firm approach whereby businesses offer supported placements for young people who are leaving care. The council has promoted the approach with a number of private sector partners, and several council directorates have successfully offered internships and apprenticeships for eligible young people who are leaving care. One colleague in Aberdeen said that such positive discrimination is wrong, but I argue that, if a member of our own family were leaving school, we would do everything possible to get that young person into work and would pull out all the stops to do so. I do not see why we should do anything different for our young folk who have been looked after.</p><p>In Aberdeen, 71 per cent of children and young people who were looked after by the city and who left school during 2009-10 were in a positive destination at the time of the follow-up destination survey. That compares to a figure of 44 per cent nationally. The city is ranked first among comparable authorities, with the highest number of folk in a positive destination. Lessons can be learned from Aberdeen about achieving those positive results. Some folk will say that the fact that the economic outlook in Aberdeen is better than it is elsewhere is a factor. I have no doubt that that is the case, but I still think that there are lessons to be learned. Nevertheless, we should not rest on our laurels, because the destinations survey showed that 86.9 per cent of kids who were not looked after were in positive destinations. That is 15.9 per cent higher than the figure for looked-after children, so there is still a lot to do.</p><p>Mr Maxwell also talked about joined-up working and the fact that it is sometimes lacking in certain places. In Aberdeen, all primary, secondary and special schools have a designated manager who is responsible for monitoring the position of looked-after children and identifying their additional support needs at school. The monitoring of looked-after children is a key component of the council&#8217;s quality improvement framework. The local authority also has a dedicated looked-after children teacher, who is responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating education provision for children in its own children&#8217;s unit. The teacher offers guidance and support to residential childcare workers, field social workers and young people, and also advocates on their behalf.</p><p>The most innovative thing that is going on in Aberdeen is an initiative between the council and Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland. The project is called strive and is making major moves forward. It is an innovative new programme, which is designed by Barnardo&#8217;s to help to improve the educational outcome of looked-after young people by providing them with opportunities to experience success, build their confidence and increase their motivation. The project is aimed at children between the ages of 11 and 16 who are looked after at home or away from home and who are struggling with mainstream school provision in terms of attainment and attendance or who are at risk of exclusion. The young people concerned are engaged in learning and in improving their educational attainment. The project stems the flow of looked-after young people going to negative destinations and it takes a holistic approach.</p><p>The service offers coaching out of school hours, which seeks to engage young people in inspirational, fun and structured individual and group activities to promote learning and achievement. It includes a &#163;500 learning fund for each young person, which adds freedom and focus to the coaching relationship and gives the relationship resources to make change happen. There are also one-to-one sessions with a specific school focus, which connect success and motivation from out-of-school-hours learning to school performance. The project is in its early stages and an analysis of how well it goes will be conducted. I could talk about it for some time, but I am coming to the end of my time.</p><p>I hope that the committee and the minister will look at what strive has done thus far and at what I think it can do to improve the educational attainment levels of our looked-after children. If it is shown to be a success, which I am sure it will be, I hope that it can be rolled out across the country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests, as I am a member of Aberdeen City Council, which will inevitably come up in the debate.

There might have been numerous meetings, but they have provided no answers and a huge amount is still up in the air.</p><p>At a very early stage, Aberdeen City Council instructed officers to investigate the impact that the proposed reforms would have in Aberdeen city. No one could even guesstimate the impact on the council and the economy, because the information is sadly lacking.</p><p>We could take all day to talk about particular issues and look at the higher levels of the debate, but let me turn to individuals. Mrs Scanlon mentioned the pilot on assessment in Aberdeen. If that is how assessment is going to be carried out throughout the country, I have grave concerns. I will give members an example. A woman attended my surgery recently whose claim had been rejected. What troubled me was that the assessment was of a secondary condition and not the main condition&#8212;the condition that would have prevented her from working. If that is the kind of nonsense that will occur throughout the country and pass for assessment, I am sorry but that is not good enough, and nor is putting people through that sort of torture.</p><p>Many members have hit the nail on the head: the welfare reforms are about reducing the budget by &#163;2.5 billion. They are not about the proper prior assessment of the impacts of that reduction. They are about Tory, and now Liberal Democrat, dogma.</p><p>I do not think that the reforms will lead to deficit reduction; in fact, I think that they will lead to deficit expansion as folk become more and more reliant on services when they reach crisis point. Whether members agree that there will be deficit reduction or, as I believe, deficit expansion, I think that most of us in the chamber agree that if the Government&#8217;s proposals are pushed through, they will lead to massive devastation in people&#8217;s lives in this country. In my opinion, that is unacceptable.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests.

On the day of the battle, Angus is said to have seen an X-shape in clouds in the sky, representing Saint Andrew&#8212;that is where we get our flag from.

To this day the St Andrew&#8217;s Cross is a flag which all Scots hoist with pride, and the emblem of our patron is emblazoned on many buildings and coats of arms, logos and letterheads across our country. And so it seems logical that we should mark our dear saint &#8211; the first of the apostles to be called by Christ &#8211; through a properly recognised national holiday.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with the archbishop on that point.</p><p>St Andrew&#8217;s day, however, is more than just a religious feast day; it should be about the history, the heritage and the culture of our nation. I sometimes feel that Scots abroad and Scots&#8217; descendants abroad celebrate Saint Andrew more than we do.</p><p>The first Society of St Andrew was formed in Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 November 1729. It was founded by immigrant Scots, many of them from Aberdeen and Fife, and dedicated to the relief of suffering and distress among the inhabitants of the infant colony. Twenty years later, the St Andrew&#8217;s Society of Philadelphia was started by 25 Scottish residents, to give relief to the poor and distressed. Two signatories of the declaration of independence were founder members of that society: James Wilson, a graduate of the University of St Andrews, and John Witherspoon, a native of Paisley and president of Princeton college.</p><p>I could go on listing famous St Andrew&#8217;s societies across the world, but I do not intend to do so. We have our own ancient St Andrew&#8217;s Society of Aberdeen, and I have been pleased to attend its celebrations on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, I will not be there tonight. Those are all worthy examples of celebrations of our history, heritage and culture elsewhere in the world, and of the provision of poor relief in the early days in North America. Having talked to folks abroad about this, I believe that, even today, St Andrew&#8217;s day is a bigger event in other countries than it is here in our own nation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656070", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew&#8217;s Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I pay tribute to Dennis Canavan, who saw the St Andrew&#8217;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill through the Parliament.

Compensation varies from case to case. However, all awards fall within the range of $50,000 to $100,000&#8212;or &#163;32,000 to &#163;64,000. There is also a special fund of $45 million to compensate those who were affected by testing in the Bikini Atoll and the Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands.</p><p>Since the compensation programme began to operate in 1992, more than 34,000 claims have been filed and the US Government has awarded $1.6 billion. The huge number of claims reflects the widespread effects that nuclear testing can have on a country and its people.</p><p>Although the other countries with compensation programmes have not been as forthright in their reparations, France, Russia and China also have policies to compensate their victims of nuclear testing.</p><p>In France, long-standing opposition to even acknowledging the French Government&#8217;s responsibility for nuclear testing was finally put to rest in 2009. After significant arm twisting by advocacy groups and politicians, the French Government agreed to set aside a &#8364;10 million fund to compensate cancer victims and others who were affected at the north African testing sites. There is also an amendment to the law that states that additional funds will be added if the first &#8364;10 million runs out.</p><p>The Russian and Chinese compensation packages are not quite as good as that, but their Governments have recognised their nuclear test victims.

We must do our level best to extract as much as we can from the North Sea fields over the coming decades. I agree with Sarah Boyack about carbon capture and storage. Peterhead, if the CCS project goes ahead there, has a part to play, because pumping the carbon into the existing pipeline networks could force more oil out, so that we get even more revenue. Although I agree that we should be at the forefront of CCS technologies, we are now a little behind, unfortunately. We had a stall on Peterhead previously, a stall on Longannet and we are now back to Peterhead.

I have had the benefit of a family member being in the latter. I will not say too much about those things, because another member of Aberdeen City Council will speak after me and I think that he will cover some of those points.</p><p>On enablement&#8212;I will use that word rather than re-enablement because my council colleague Jim Kiddie hates that term&#8212;there has been an &#163;800,000 investment in a new enablement service, ensuring that the occupational therapy teams are in place with the physiotherapists to keep folk at home whenever that is possible.</p><p>Nanette Milne referred to e-health and telecare in her speech. In Aberdeen, we have some of the leading lights in Scotland in that area. I agree with Nanette Milne that we are not rolling out some of the schemes quickly enough. We should look much more closely at the knowledge and skills that we have in order to roll that out a bit more. I hope that the minister will deal with that in his summing up.</p><p>A very important issue that no one has talked about in the debate is the impact of the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill and what we will try to do here in that regard. Evidence on the bill that was given at the Local Government and Regeneration Committee today showed that there will probably be impacts on aids and adaptations and there will certainly be impacts on transportation. There will also be impacts on home care budgets right across Scotland. All that will cause major difficulties if we hope to achieve what the motion lays out. It is up to all of us to scrutinise the Welfare Reform Bill to the nth degree because&#8212;let us be honest&#8212;we do not know very much about its detail. However, we do know that it will have a major effect on some of the poorest and most needy in our society.</p><p>Jim Eadie spoke earlier about learning disabilities. We still have very old-fashioned service delivery throughout the country to provide for the needs of people who have learning disabilities. There was a furore in Aberdeen a couple of years back when we closed a day centre, but it was the right thing to do, because the service that was provided there was extremely old-fashioned. We now have services that allow a level of independence for folk that was not there before.</p><p>I pay tribute to the charity Inspire, which has taken over some services and ensures that people are out and about, living life to the maximum.

The fact that I am a member of Aberdeen City Council will come up in my speech.</p><p>When I joined Aberdeen City Council, a social worker asked me how many children I had. When I said that I had four nieces but no children, that person said to me, &#8220;No, you have several hundred children of whom you are now the corporate parent.&#8221; I was a little shellshocked. I should say that I now have a nephew, too&#8212;he would never forgive me if I did not mention him.</p><p>We must all recognise our role as corporate parents. Recognising that completely changes our attitude to policy formulation and to what is best for the children of whom we are corporate parents.</p><p>I will touch on a couple of points that have been made about the financial aspects of being a corporate parent. Claire Baker and Liz Smith mentioned Dundee City Council&#8217;s overspend on children&#8217;s services. At the Local Government and Regeneration Committee today, we had the pleasure of hearing evidence on the budget from David Dorward, who is Dundee City Council&#8217;s chief executive. We talked about needs-led and demand-led social work. Mr Dorward said that he was not too troubled by the council&#8217;s overspend on children&#8217;s services&#8212;I am sure that he does not say that often&#8212;because it is needs led. The reality is that the members of his social work team, who are the professionals, have decided that the interventions that have been made are right at this time, and Mr Dorward and his finance officers have recognised that that team is right. I would not say that he was relaxed about the overspend, but he realises that it is because of needs-led requirements. That is how to deal with such matters.</p><p>Claudia Beamish said that the approach should be about putting children&#8217;s needs first and not about saving money. I say to everyone in the chamber that it can be both. Local authorities have often spent lots of money on putting children away from their areas. Aberdeen City Council did that in yesteryear, and some children were sent as far away as possible, which broke any ties they had left in their city of birth. That did neither children nor the public purse any good. I am glad that I played a part in trying to change that. It seemed far too easy for some to send children away. The approach was, &#8220;Let&#8217;s forget that problem and send them away.&#8221; We would not do that as parents, so why would we do it as corporate parents? Such attitudes still exist in some places and we must change them completely.</p><p>Another issue that used to perturb me is that we as corporate parents were happy for kids to be in residential homes that, if they were our houses, we would deem inadequate. Residential facilities need to be the best that they can be for the children of whom we are corporate parents. New-build residential homes have recently been constructed in Aberdeen. Across the country, we need to look again at what the stock provides.</p><p>During the recess, I had the great pleasure of visiting Barnardo&#8217;s in Aberdeen. I visited a number of its services. I talked to foster carers, who are some of the most dedicated people whom a person could come across, and visited its Linksfield residential home. I am mightily impressed by the work that is going on in that organisation in my home city, and ask the minister to say in her summing up what we will do to help to recruit and support more foster carers and adoptive parents. The best way of attracting folk to become foster carers is to get them to talk to other foster carers, because they are normally the most enthusiastic and passionate people, and they will tell others exactly what they can get out of fostering.</p><p>Another thing that has perturbed me over the years is the lack of joined-up thinking that there sometimes is between local authorities, courts, children&#8217;s panels and children&#8217;s reporters. In her summing up, will the minister say how she sees things gelling together a little bit better? There are opportunities in the planned children&#8217;s services bill. Will she say how she sees the bill helping us with what we are discussing?</p><p>I will never forget that I am a corporate parent.

Many of its practices and procedures differ substantially from those of English law. There is no more reason why a particular feature of Scots criminal law need be the same as any feature of English criminal law in order to comply with the requirements of the Convention as there is that any feature of either system should be the same as a feature of Russian law to achieve that purpose ...

According to it, the tax change has rendered marginal 25 projects, &#163;12 billion of capital investment, the production of 1.04 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent, and 30 per cent of investment in projects that were previously considered likely to proceed in the next decade. The reduction in production will necessitate energy imports worth &#163;50 billion, result in lost tax revenues of &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion and forgo the creation of around 15,000 jobs. The tax change will accelerate the decommissioning of 20 fields and associated infrastructure by up to five years.</p><p>Those are the key facts, but the realities are somewhat different on the ground. We can talk about numbers, but the changes to which I referred have had a major effect on people in my constituency, throughout the north-east and across Scotland. After the tax increase was implemented, it was interesting to find as we went around the doors during the election campaign in Aberdeen that people were talking about it in their droves and had real concerns about it. I am sure that members who campaigned in the city at that time know that that was the case.</p><p>I always say that when the oil industry sneezes, Aberdeen and the north-east catch a cold. Previous downturns in the industry have caused great difficulty for the area that I and others represent. Concern for the future of those who work in the industry and those who rely on it is what troubles me the most.</p><p>As my colleague Mark McDonald said, the tax increase was a bolt from the blue for the industry. Prior to the budget, there were noises that everything was going to be okay, then suddenly something different happened. Mark McDonald is right to say that what is required is stability and consultation. Situations such as this, when no consultation has taken place, can often scare companies into going elsewhere.

The reason for that is the effort that the cabinet secretary has put in over his term in office to increase police numbers. When I joined Grampian police board in 1999, officer numbers were sitting at under 1,100. In 2007, there were 1,374 officers in Grampian and now there are 1,516. That is welcomed by communities across Aberdeen and the rest of the north-east of Scotland, and has made huge impacts on tackling the kinds of antisocial behaviour that my colleague Colin Keir talked about earlier.</p><p>Beyond that, there have been innovative schemes in my area. The council created the city warden scheme, which has won national awards. I hope that the cabinet secretary will consider that work in order to determine whether it can be replicated in other parts of Scotland. Again, it has been of huge benefit to the communities that I represent.</p><p>Earlier, Alison McInnes talked about local policing. Like my colleague John Finnie, I believe in bobbies before boundaries. We have to consider carefully how to proceed because, if we continue to have eight police forces, there will be cuts in police numbers, which is the last thing that people across Scotland want.</p><p>We also need to ensure that the police co-operate with other public bodies to ensure that savings can be made. Last week, I was pleased to attend the opening of a combined medical centre and police station at Whinhill in my constituency. That is good practice. What is not good practice&#8212;I do not blame Grampian Police for this&#8212;is that there was an inability to create a joint fire and police headquarters for Grampian. That will be regretted for a long time to come.</p><p>I will move on to some local issues. In Aberdeen, there has been cross-party agreement that something needs to be done about the use of airguns. I know that the cabinet secretary is restricted in what he can do and I hope that we get all the necessary powers to deal with that sooner rather than later. I pay tribute to Councillors Norman Collie and Muriel Jaffrey, who have been at the forefront of trying to put a stop to some of the nonsense that has happened, particularly in the east end of my constituency.</p><p>I agree with Mary Fee&#8212;who seems to have left the chamber&#8212;about the situation of women prisoners. The fact that most female offenders have to go to Cornton Vale is particularly bad for families. I am pleased that the justice secretary managed to ensure the reopening of the women&#8217;s unit at Aberdeen, which is immensely beneficial.</p><p>There is some controversy about the future of the prison estate in the north-east of Scotland, especially HMP Grampian, but anyone who has ever been in Craiginches will tell us that it is not fit for purpose and that we need to improve that estate. It should have happened years ago, but Mr MacAskill has dealt with that. Although I am sure that we will discuss my scepticism about some of the issues surrounding HMP Grampian, the good thing about it is that it will have that dedicated women&#8217;s unit, so that families will not have to travel mile upon mile to visit their loved ones while they are inside.</p><p>I agree with colleagues about cashback for communities. The &#163;30 million restriction is a nonsense. Funded projects such as midnight football have made a huge difference, both in the city that I represent and elsewhere.

It reported on a study by Stephen Harris of the University of Bristol that showed that, on average, wild animals in circuses spend only 1 to 9 per cent of their time in training and the rest of their time&#8212;91 to 99 per cent&#8212;enclosed in extremely small cages. Such a cage is no place for a tiger, a bear or a lion. There are further restrictions, even within those restricted cages, in that nothing is put in the cages to keep the animals entertained. The study says that, even in the larger pens, the animals&#8217; owners do not give them anything to play with&#8212;for example, bears are not given logs to play with in case they use the logs to escape the cage. Animals are being kept in confined spaces with absolutely nothing to do. That is barbaric.</p><p>The study also considered travel sickness and stress levels among the animals. The report says:</p><p>&#8220;Travel also takes its toll, although the evidence is limited. The study cites data showing that concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol in saliva from circus tigers remains abnormal up to 6 days after transport, and up to 12 days in tigers who&#8217;ve never travelled before.&#8221;</p><p>That shows clearly that the animals are completely and utterly stressed out by travel, which is unacceptable.</p><p>I return to my original point. As a small child, I was disturbed to see animals in confined spaces. That was many moons ago. Today, we should go beyond what happened in yesteryear and ensure that no child, no adult and no animal must see such conditions again.</p><p>Jim Paice, the UK environment minister, said in the UK Parliament that banning wild animals from circuses could breach human rights legislation.

I welcome you to your new post and let me say, in the Doric manner, weel done, quine&#8212;I hope ye dee brilliantly in the job and I&#8217;m sure that ye will.</p><p>I will begin by following on from Jackie Baillie, who called for compromise from the Government. I think that there also needs to be some compromise from the Opposition in future years of the session.</p><p>I am honoured to have been elected to serve the people of Aberdeen Central in the Parliament, and I will work for all my constituents to the best of my ability. I am proud that the previous SNP Administration froze the council tax, put more bobbies on the beat and froze prescription charges. Those are issues that matter to people out there. I am also pleased that Aberdeen gained a new, state-of-the-art dental school in the previous session. We have new council houses in places such as Tillydrone, with more to come in areas such as Stockethill. I was also immensely proud to chair the 3Rs board, which has seen the construction of 10 new schools in our city, including at Mile End and Seaton.</p><p>However, I was disappointed that the previous Government&#8217;s attempt to review the local government funding formula was defeated by 31 votes to one at COSLA. That was a brave attempt by Mr Swinney to review the formula but it was, unfortunately, overturned by others. I believe that that formula required to be changed because it disadvantaged Aberdeen. I am gratified that the SNP manifesto pledged that no local authority will get less than 85 per cent of the funding average. That will benefit Aberdeen City Council by &#163;4.1 million annually, which is good news for our city and for the citizens who rely on the services that Aberdeen City Council provides.</p><p>Many people believe that the streets of Aberdeen are paved with gold but, in truth, we have poverty amid plenty. In the Ashgrove, Seaton and Stockethill areas of my constituency, more than a quarter of the population has a disability or limiting long-term illness. Although policies for which we have responsibility, such as free personal care, free prescriptions and free concessionary travel, can make a big difference, the benefits system is still entirely controlled by London. Last week in Aberdeen, all the political parties on the council united to express their concern about the proposed changes to the mobility element of disability allowance. I hope that all parties in the chamber will unite in opposition to the benefits cuts that will have a major impact on the disabled members of our society.</p><p>To change the subject matter slightly, I hope that we will also see the end of the court case that is holding up the construction of transport projects that are vital to the future and economy of the north-east. The western peripheral route was first envisaged in 1948 and our area has waited for far too long for it to become a reality. It is a great pity that two objectors are holding up that project, which has a knock-on effect on projects such as improvements to the Haudagain roundabout and the dualling of the Balmedie to Tipperty road. I notice that the transport minister is sitting here and I am sure that he will take notice of all that I am saying about those matters. I hope that the courts, too, will take notice and reach a decision shortly.</p><p>Aberdeen is the powerhouse of the Scottish and UK economies and I want that to be true for many years to come. Private and public investment in areas such as the extension of the airport runway, the deepening of Aberdeen&#8217;s harbour mouth, and the development of the energetica corridor show that there is still confidence in our area. However, that confidence can so easily be shattered by others making wrong decisions elsewhere. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8217;s decision to raise the supplementary rate of corporation tax on the oil industry from 20 to 32 per cent has knocked confidence and has already led to the cancellation of a number of projects. Optimism has plummeted.
