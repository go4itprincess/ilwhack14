The cause is worthy.</p><p>The international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation is an important marking point. The minister took an auto-defence approach, but I make it clear that we do not blame her personally. What we say is meant not as criticism but as comments on how to go forward. I hope that she accepts what is said in that spirit.</p><p>In 2013, UNICEF established that more than 125 million women and girls from 29 countries worldwide have been affected by female genital mutilation. The origin of the practices is unclear, but it is clear that they have been undertaken for thousands of years and that they will not disappear overnight.</p><p>The point of having an international day of zero tolerance for FGM is to take a strong approach and share the information that we have. We will learn from that and tackle the problem in Africa, Asia and Europe&#8212;including the United Kingdom&#8212;and in other parts of the world.</p><p>A constituent brought FGM to my attention when I became an MSP. I was horrified and disturbed, to be frank, when I began to read about it. I come from a culture in which I saw circumcision and various other mutilations that happen as a child, but I was particularly disturbed by FGM and by the fact that it is happening to very young girls. They have no choice and not only are they scarred for life but they might develop health complications, which they cannot do anything about, because the procedures are irreversible.</p><p>I therefore feel very strongly about the issue, and I have discussed it with many people. I have picked up clearly that the issue is kept very close in the community and that a lot of pressure is applied to young people, who are told that FGM is a must for them and they should not talk about it because people will not understand. Various excuses are used. The young girls are told that they will be unclean and not pure if they do not go through the process. They are almost made to feel that it is something to be proud of and they must have it done.</p><p>That is a ridiculous attitude, but people have practised FGM for so long that they believe that what they are doing is right. That is why it is important that we have stiff sentences for people who put our young through such an experience&#8212;and they are our young; there are young Scots who live here and who have to go through the experience.</p><p>I spoke to a doctor from Kurdistan, who actively campaigns on the issue. He told me that he had been surprised to find that FGM is widespread in Iraq and in particular in Kurdistan. He said that the Government there has taken robust steps to deal with the issue, through public information and conferences and by talking about the matter on television. Most important, the Government has sent out the right signal by outlawing the practice. That was a brave step for the country to take.</p><p>Although we are part of the way there, in that we have already legislated, it is unfortunate that we have not grasped how to penetrate communities and protect people. I have heard some good ideas about sharing information in schools and setting up a task force to deal with the issue more robustly, and I hope that by next year we will have had some success&#8212;I am not holding the minister responsible today, as I said, but I will certainly do so in a year&#8217;s time if there has been no success.</p><p>It is important that we send out the right signal and tell our young that the Government cares for them and will take all necessary measures to ensure their health, safety and quality of life. That is paramount. I agree with all the sentiments that members have expressed in the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882339", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Female Genital Mutilation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jenny Marra for bringing this important debate to the chamber.

Two comments will never leave me. One of them was when a member of the Commonwealth games team said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know Nigeria, but we know the UK because, in times of trouble, you have always been there for us.&#8221; That made me really proud of being British. The other comment was, &#8220;Nigeria might have the money, but it does not have the will of the people behind the bid.&#8221; I took that comment to heart, too.</p><p>When the announcement was made and the BBC was covering the events, I remember a news item from Nigeria from which I could see that the local community did not really know anything about the games. That aspiration was missing, which is perhaps one reason why Nigeria was unsuccessful.</p><p>It is hard to believe that seven years have passed since that day in Sri Lanka and that we are only a few months away from the opening ceremony, which will showcase the best of Scotland and what it has to offer, and&#8212;most important&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s people and the friendly atmosphere that I am sure everyone will enjoy.</p><p>We must congratulate Glasgow City Council, which has risen to the challenge and used the opportunity of the games to create substantial jobs through the Glasgow guarantee, new affordable housing and world-class sports facilities. That will be the legacy of the games. Glasgow has done well to achieve that, despite the setback of the Government taking &#163;150&#160;million from the city.</p><p>We must not be complacent. The legacy is fantastic and offers many possibilities for young people in Glasgow. We must build on it and ensure that everyone in Glasgow can participate fully.

As a child, I used to wonder how human beings could treat other human beings in such a way. I could never understand it, and I still do not understand it, despite the fact that I am a part of a minority community and have had a slight glimpse of what can happen when things go wrong. I have seen the heart of Europe being torn apart, and genocide taking place in the modern world. It is, therefore, not very difficult to understand and believe what happened in relation to the genocides that took place&#8212;the horror, the suffering, the pain, the inhumanity to humans. I have to say that I am still moved, to this day, when I think about the difficulties and the hardships that people went through. I was particularly moved when I saw films that showed the effects on young children. I am sure that those children carried the scars all their lives and that it was difficult and challenging for them to live fruitful and meaningful lives after those experiences.</p><p>It is shameful that, despite the experiences that we have seen, people still continue to hurt one another. I still do not understand why it happens. Kenneth Macintosh is right to point to the horrors that happen in Africa and other parts of the world today. I always ask myself why we are not learning the lessons and why these things are still going on. The United Nations does its best, under difficult circumstances. There is a lot going on in international politics. However, what happened in the Holocaust was beyond what is happening in the world today. It is very important that we never allow ourselves and other people to forget that, if we allow hatred to perpetuate, it can go to that extreme.

The value of the history and culture of any nation are often underestimated. Joan McAlpine will be pleased to know that the city of Nuremberg in Germany, which is twinned with Glasgow, celebrates with a Burns supper every year. She will also be pleased to know that the event is a sell-out every year&#8212;in fact, the tickets for the Burns supper are normally sold out a year ahead of time, so if you want a ticket, it is almost the case that somebody has to die before one can get one.</p><p>I am considering the possibility of holding a Burns supper in Lahore, which is Glasgow&#8217;s twin city in Pakistan. One reason is that the Burns supper now offers so much more than it used to. We can now get halal haggis and vegetarian haggis, which opens doors for more people to participate in and enjoy the event fully. As a councillor, I have enjoyed haggis in Glasgow city chambers. It has been either vegetarian or halal, but nevertheless I have been able to enjoy the full ambience of the Burns supper, which is important.</p><p>We need to take an international perspective. There are a lot of expatriates living all over the world, and most of them celebrate with Burns supper events. However, those celebrations are not joined up, and I am keen that we should help them to do that. It is important that our overseas cousins in places such as North America, Australia and New Zealand join up not only among themselves but somehow with us in Scotland through our tourism industry, so that we can participate with them and they can participate with us. Then it will become a homecoming in more ways than one. When the homecoming was first launched, I thought that it was a wonderful idea, but that homecoming should not only be about people from overseas coming to Scotland, but about a homecoming for Scots who are here. It is important that we realise that we have many diverse cultures in Scotland; we tend not to enjoy them to the full.</p><p>I have always felt that Burns suppers are celebrated too much by small organised groups and are not open to the general public&#8212;to my mind, that aspect has always been missing.

Gone are the days when people in prison were treated as less than human and gone are the days when we expected our prisoners to live on bread and water.</p><p>Experience in our country has shown us that if we take our prisoners seriously and treat them as human beings, there is half a chance that they will not reoffend when they come out. That is important. It is also important that we allow people to readjust to family life, because prisoners often have wives and children, and they all need one another. For a family unit to be successful, it is necessary for people to be supported through what is a difficult time. Sometimes, people go to prison who are in extremely difficult circumstances and it takes a lot of support and wisdom to help them to get back on the straight and narrow. The throughcare support that is provided at Greenock prison is an exceptional example of that, which I think that we can export, not only to other prisons but internationally. It offers an opportunity for people to learn about a worthwhile practice.</p><p>Over the years, there has been a lot of debate about whether prisoners should be treated as less than human and with unkindness because they are in prison to be punished, but there has always been the argument that prisoners are human beings. If they have erred or made a mistake, they should be given the chance to rekindle their lives, to readjust and to become valuable citizens. I am of the same mind&#8212;people should always have an opportunity to better themselves. When prisoners are released from prison, it is important for them to be able to readjust to society. Whether they are part of a family is not important; what is important is that they realise that they are human beings whom we care for and who are valued members of our society.</p><p>Time and again, I see projects such as the throughcare project at Greenock prison enriching people&#8217;s lives. In enriching those lives, we are enriching our communities. If anyone who has been affected in that way receives such support, it means that society does not have to bear the whole burden and that people can recover sooner rather than later, which is extremely important. A guilt factor sometimes comes into play, whereby people can be hesitant about admitting to the fact that they have had difficulties.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw made a very good speech.

I genuinely believe that it is a very serious issue and I know that he has very serious concerns about it, particularly in trying to help his constituents to overcome the difficult period that they have gone through.</p><p>As a young boy, I had some horrific experiences with dogs. I have seen people breed dogs for the sole purpose of making them fight each other. I have seen breeders breed dogs for the sole purpose of being violent guard dogs and the like, with no consideration whatsoever for what the outcome would be if the animal attacked an innocent person or whether the dog itself would be in danger, let alone human beings. It is horrific to experience such violent dogs and the experiences that I had will never leave me. I was once chased by a dog like that, and I can assure members that it is not a pleasant experience.</p><p>I think that what most people are now concerned about is seeing an end to there being victims of dangerous dogs, particularly in the home. I am a politician and, like the postman, I have gone to many letterboxes. I can assure you that when a dog jumps at you at the door, it gives you a fright&#8212;even at my age. There are therefore issues about how the animals are kept.</p><p>Members have suggested that it is not the fault of the animals, which is right: it is not. It is the fault of us, the human beings who are supposed to be controlling, helping and supporting those animals, training them appropriately and ensuring that they have the right attitude for living among children in particular and in human society in general. Our youngsters are at risk from dogs and we know that because we have the facts in front of us. People who have been viciously mauled by such animals carry that experience for the rest of their lives.</p><p>We need to take this topic very seriously, and I am glad that Paul Martin has brought it to the chamber today. It is important that all dogs be chipped, but I think that we need to go further than that. The people who perpetrate what I call the crime of breeding dogs specifically to hurt each other and to hurt people are the ones who will not chip the animals and who will still slip through the system. It is important that we ensure that that is not allowed. I have known people breed dogs in farms and backyards without registering or training them but deliberately making them violent and training them only to be aggressive. That happens all round the world, but we in Scotland need to take the lead once again and ensure that we address the problem in a positive way. We need to get a grip on it, not just in relation to animals coming into Scotland but in relation to farms, businesses, security firms and the like.</p><p>The police and armed forces represent a good example in that they have highly trained dogs that do not go around mauling people. It is possible and doable, but we need to have the tools of the trade, and we need to give people the tools to ensure that the problem is eradicated. We need to visit farms and kennels and ensure that shop owners and those who trade in the business are responsible and chip any animal that they sell.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dog Control Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank Paul Martin for bringing this topic to the chamber.

I was ashamed, disappointed and shocked. I could not believe that, in this day and age, people would stoop to such levels, but they did. I hope that many other departments&#8212;not only in the UK, but elsewhere in Europe&#8212;will learn that such behaviour is unacceptable and that it will not be tolerated.

People talk about freedom of speech, but at the same time we have laws in this country to protect us against racial harassment, intimidation and bullying, and I am surprised that no one has gone down that route to take the UK Government to task over its campaign.

However, people see you differently. That is the issue; that is the issue about harassment, prejudice and discrimination. We have to learn, live and teach and change the hearts and minds of people.

In September, a leading retail chain banned lads mags from its shelves after the publisher refused to put them in sensitive, modest bags. Last month, Channel 4 aired its thought-provoking documentary &#8220;Porn on the Brain&#8221;, which looked at the effect that the availability of pornography is having on our teenagers. In Westminster, the idea of pre-set internet filters to protect our children has been debated. It is a very live debate and is happening all over the place.</p><p>However, what we are not achieving is the goal, particularly in relation to The Sun. I worry that the casual acceptance of what is essentially porn in family newspapers is harming our children. When a young boy sees his father reading The Sun&#8212;I use The Sun as an example, but I hasten to add that it is not the only one&#8212;it normalises the idea that one of the main purposes of women is as sex objects. Looking at naked women and commenting on them becomes a normal activity, which is okay because dad does it. That in itself speaks volumes.</p><p>Even more disturbingly, young girls see that it is okay to pose naked for pictures because it is in the paper at home. They see it regularly and they do not feel intimidated. How can that not twist the minds of our children? How can it not make them confused about what is and is not appropriate? Why are steps being taken to eliminate searching by children for inappropriate materials when they can find such materials at home?

That is fantastic. I am really proud of our young people who took the initiative, and I am proud that they took the initiative before we did.

I use the example of Tesco, as a substantial part of such waste occurs in the processing of food. For waste to be reduced, processes will need to change. We must take steps to reduce that element of waste.</p><p>For many companies, the reduction of waste is a matter of medium-term planning. In addition, the financial investment that is required for waste companies to develop an alternative strategy will involve positive long-term decision making. That is why the uncertainty over exactly what the landfill tax rate will be beyond 2015 is an issue that we need to grapple with. When the cabinet secretary was questioned by the Finance Committee, he said that such decisions were independent of the landfill tax rate and were to do with whether the Scottish people throw away things that those companies can make profit from.</p><p>My understanding is that both things are important for companies to make long-term financial projections and plan investments such as alternatives to landfill. It is much easier for the Scottish Government to increase certainty by setting the landfill tax rates three years in advance; whether we need a crystal ball to estimate what Scots will chuck away is another issue.</p><p>On another note, the consultation responses show widespread support for the landfill communities fund&#8212;the LCF&#8212;which is funded by landfill tax. The fund allows managers of landfill sites to give money for environmental, community and built heritage projects within a 10-mile radius of landfill sites or operational depots. I believe that the 10-mile radius rule should be more flexible to enable a wider group of community organisations to access the funds and make good use of them. One or two colleagues have suggested that the radius should be extended particularly in rural areas, but I think that we would benefit from it being done right across Scotland.</p><p>The bill will allow us to develop a clear management structure, and there should be regular updates on the fund&#8217;s administration to avoid the current duplication. The tax tariff on landfill should be flexible, which would allow realistic taxation that would encourage industry to participate and invest, and allow alternative use of landfill sites so that we can have a better future for not only our industry but our citizens.</p><p>Last but not least, it is important that we recognise that the amount of waste in Scotland places an unnecessary burden on the nation&#8217;s resources. It is therefore important that we continue to ensure that we play a serious role so that industry does not carry all the burden. The Government has a responsibility to share its views and aspirations with industry and to work hand in glove with it to ensure that we take full and proper advantage of reducing our waste; the current landfill sites; the taxation levels that will be in place; and the prediction that the landfill taxes will reduce in the future. That is a good sign, but it will affect the funding of community groups, so we will need to see how they can continue to be supported in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak about the landfill tax and its implications for Scotland&#8217;s long-term future.

The commission is looking at ways of improving, from education to employment. I whole-heartedly agree that greater emphasis on vocational qualifications is important and that industry should have an input to what is taught to ensure that its needs are met. On a recent visit to Irvine with the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, we heard evidence from Barr Construction, which was eager to work with colleges to provide higher-quality industrial vocational training.</p><p>I believe that the Scottish Government is guilty of undervaluing vocational education and have serious concerns about how recommendations by the commission can be implemented, given the savage cuts to our college funding.</p><p>I feel that there is a large gap in youth employability and the skills needed to apply for jobs.

He did not have skills from school nor was his family in a position to support him.

It aims to run the project for over five years, to help young people. The participants help the FareShare Glasgow project. They learn transferable skills, build confidence, acquire training, gain work experience, create curriculum vitae, for example, and have other opportunities.</p><p>To return to my original point, I am deeply concerned about colleges&#8217; ability to offer an employability focus on vocational courses due to the lack of resources.

It is a proud moment for me because I have always been very keen to promote all that is good in Scotland and this is a prime example of that. It shows the commitment that people had over a century ago. Mr Carlaw mentioned the quality of the buildings&#8212;the quality of the example that is in front of us, which is not like the matchboxes of today. He is absolutely right. I remember the Gorbals flats being opened by Her Majesty. I was there; I took photographs. I went back to Queen Elizabeth square to take photographs of the flats being demolished.</p><p>I agree with Mr Carlaw about the quality that was laid down in Westerton. People cared about people&#8212;they cared about Glaswegians, they cared about their country, they cared about the city. Sometimes I think that that is an example to promote to our citizens today&#8212;they ought to be thinking in those terms.</p><p>Sir John Stirling Maxwell also made a huge contribution to society and there are many examples of people making huge contributions in days gone by. When I first passed the display this afternoon, I was impressed. Impressed by what? I was impressed by the commitment of the people who are engaged with Westerton, even today. I was impressed by the quality of the construction and I was impressed by the fact that we were celebrating 100 years of Westerton being there.</p><p>These are small chapters of our history that we need to be proud of and that we need to celebrate more often. We miss many opportunities by not promoting such achievements from our past.</p><p>One of the things that delights me is to look at all the constructions from the past in our cities. When one looks up at or goes into buildings such as those of some of our city councils, one sometimes says to oneself, &#8220;My God, this is a beautiful piece of engineering. This is a beautiful building&#8212;a strong, sturdy, honest-to-God building.&#8221; That is what we made in times gone past, and we need to be proud of that. We should celebrate that more often in relation to all the buildings as well as all the various organisations that were set up to support communities such as the one that we are celebrating today.</p><p>Up until I saw the display outside the chamber&#8212;I took a photograph there as well&#8212;I had not intended to speak in the debate. The reason that I was drawn to that display is that it shows the commitment that some people made such a long time ago. Sometimes we do not praise such people while they are alive and we realise how much they did for us only when we have lost them. We are always looking at ways of bringing people down rather than lifting them up, and I think that we need to start reversing that trend. I genuinely believe that, having seen how the housing association contributed to society and what it was trying to achieve by bringing in new ideas and concepts. That is wonderful. I am proud that we can celebrate that today.</p><p>I hope that we will encourage more people to come forward to be represented in this way so that we can celebrate them. We should put on record that we have celebrated all that those people achieved in the past. I had not realised that being a city of parks was unique to Glasgow. I have learned something today&#8212;something that has really made me happy&#8212;and I wanted to share that with members in the chamber and with everyone else in Scotland.

The campaign was created to encourage Muslim women to share with fellow Scots messages about anything that they feel is important. More than 400 Scottish Muslim women have participated and shared messages as part of the campaign, which came out of the work that Amina did in 2011 when it visited some 25 secondary schools in Scotland and was shocked to find that 70 per cent of young people associated words such as &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, &#8220;uneducated&#8221;, &#8220;foreign&#8221; and &#8220;oppressed&#8221; with Muslim women.</p><p>The travelling exhibition encouraged dialogue and promoted understanding of a misunderstood community and faith. I am pleased to say that 55 members of the Scottish Parliament and three ministers have pledged their support to standing up against intolerance and prejudice, by speaking out against discrimination and contributing to making a fairer Scotland.</p><p>The work in schools is funded only in Glasgow and Dundee and it is not really possible to accommodate requests to engage that Amina receives from schools outwith those areas. I suggest that if other councils want to take part, they should contact Amina to try to resolve that issue.</p><p>Since the campaign began, there has been a shift in communities. With the murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, there is a greater than ever need to promote understanding between communities. In my opinion, the best way to do that is to speak to people from different communities and to let them speak for themselves, as the campaign has tried to do.</p><p>In the discussions in schools as part of Amina&#8217;s research on efforts to combat negative stereotypes, I was surprised to learn that little was brought up by students in their normal classes. However, when it came to religious education classes, students were more open about their views and were willing to share those views with the rest of the class. That suggests that there is still a lot of work to be done, even with our young people.</p><p>Why, however, are we dealing with stereotyping of Muslim women separately from other forms of discrimination? I would like to see the work that Amina is doing in a framework in which all such organisations work together. On paper, those organisations are meant to work across equalities strands, but for some reason we are not doing that. We tend to deal with bigotry separately, but I do not understand why. In addition to that, bigotry in football is treated as a special case. Again, I ask why equalities organisations do not work together, because it is important to appreciate that all forms of discrimination are equally unwelcome.</p><p>I believe that work on challenging stereotypes with regard to racism, sectarianism or even to redheads&#8212;whatever kind of prejudice&#8212;should have benchmarking to help progress the work so that there is a clear vision for its direction and we can see whether we are, in fact, improving our lot, if one can use that phrase.</p><p>We need to start with the foundation that we are all human beings and that we are all different in many ways. I read somewhere the statement that</p><p>&#8220;you are unique, just like everyone else.&#8221;</p><p>That is what our young people need to understand first, then individual organisations can bring their separate skills together to assist one another. The issue now is that there are many organisations that have people with marvellous skills, but unfortunately because they work in isolation those skills are not transferable to other organisations and, as a result, we do not benefit from them.</p><p>I congratulate Amina on doing such a marvellous job in working among minority communities, but especially with our women, who have real issues in bringing up young families and facing up to the most difficult challenges, not only in the home but in the workplace. We must congratulate Amina on bringing to our attention the difficulties that our young people face. I make a plea that we, as the Scottish Parliament, take all possible measures to assist our vulnerable communities in working together to become a fairer and clearer nation, so that we all benefit equally.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693712", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Challenging Stereotypes"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was very happy when my motion was selected for today&#8217;s debate as I had wanted an opportunity to discuss how we in Scotland can challenge negative racial and religious stereotypes.

On my people&#8217;s behalf, I am passionate about widening access to education and support for poorer students in our communities.</p><p>I start by welcoming the steps that have been taken by the University of Glasgow to create up to 800 places over the next four years for students from low-income backgrounds. The university has received money from the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to create 200 extra places a year from 2013 to 2016. The places will be open to students from the 40 per cent most deprived areas. Although welcome, the impact of such schemes to widen access is limited. However, the difficulty is that not only do poorer students face instability, but they cannot sustain themselves with the available financial packages while they are in education.</p><p>A lot of attention has been paid to fees, but not enough has been paid to student costs. Therefore, I am glad that the debate will look at support for students entering higher education. Students are supported by grants and bursaries that they do not have to pay back. However, they must pay back loans, as a percentage of their earnings, later on in life. With the planned cuts to grants this autumn, poorer students will have to borrow more, despite their being disadvantaged to begin with.</p><p>The new arrangements will increase the amount of cash that students can borrow without means testing. That will be much more useful to students from more affluent backgrounds than it will be to those from poorer backgrounds who start off, as I have said, from a disadvantaged position.</p><p>For students from lower-income households, the new arrangements will mean that what they are given with one hand will be taken back with the other, so it is even more difficult for those people, simply because they are poorer. Students who are disadvantaged will continue to be disadvantaged; I do not see how they will benefit. However, students who come from affluent backgrounds will always have an advantage over our disadvantaged students. I have always believed that it is our job to ensure that our student community has a level playing field.</p><p>Day in, day out, I see a lot of students who have been disadvantaged not only through lack of resources, but through the choice of subjects. That has become a serious issue for Scotland. I have always believed that we are a nation that is here for our people, that we would deliver for our students and ensure that everybody has opportunities.</p><p>When I was at school, my mother went to university. She was able to do that because she had free access. That situation is changing because students are not getting places in colleges and the people who are affected are the people from the poorest parts of our communities.

However, these are the early stages: the first steps.

A lot of people use the phrase &#8220;postcode lottery&#8221; and assume that everybody understands.

We are not looking at reports, or at the fancy graphs that consultants produce; we are talking about real people with real issues. We are speaking from experience and from our hearts.

I am really privileged to take part in this debate and I thank Anne McTaggart for bringing it to the chamber.</p><p>Mary Barbour was born in 1875. She was one of seven children and her father was a carpet weaver. The year 1896 saw her marry David Barbour and settle in the Govan burgh of Glasgow. She joined and became an active member of the Kinning Park co-operative guild, which was the first to be established in Scotland. That, in itself, is impressive.</p><p>Mary joined the Independent Labour Party and the socialist Sunday school, and the Glasgow rent increases during the first world war brought her to the forefront of local political activity. The Glasgow Women&#8217;s Housing Association was born in 1914 in Govan, which is also my birthplace&#8212;like Sandra White, I was born in Govan. It is a very special place. I thought that I would add that for good measure.</p><p>It is important that we recognise the incredible appreciation that we should have for women not only now but who in that era faced up to huge challenges.</p><p>As a working-class housewife with two children and a husband, Mary Barbour was well qualified to be engaged in many of the activities that soon spread to the whole of the Clydebank area. In 1915, in one of the largest demonstrations in Glasgow&#8217;s political history, thousands of women marched through the streets of Glasgow along with thousands of shipyard engineers. As a result of that, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915 heralded a change in housing systems for the city of Glasgow, and the same progress was made throughout the United Kingdom thereafter. Maria Fyfe, whom Anne McTaggart and Patricia Ferguson mentioned, was also a hero to me and I learned a lot from the challenges that she faced as a woman.</p><p>Mary Barbour was the first woman councillor for the Labour Party elected to represent Govan on the then Glasgow town council. During her term as a Labour councillor, she fought for a range of policies and pushed for things such as wash houses, launderettes, public baths, free milk for school children&#8212;I am old enough to have benefited from that&#8212;child welfare centres, play areas, pensions for mothers, home helps and local banks. Between 1924 and 1927, she served as the Glasgow Corporation&#8217;s first woman baillie. I can relate to that, as my wife, Haleema Malik, was one of the first Pakistani women to be elected to Glasgow City Council and she also served as a baillie of the city. I recall the challenges that she faced&#8212;and, believe you me, they were some challenges. If my wife can have to face those challenges in this day and age, I cannot imagine the challenges that Mary Barbour had to face.

I have grave concerns about rising household electricity bills. The dominance of a small number of companies, concerns about the security of the electricity supply and the falling levels of spare electricity capacity&#8212;which mean that, unless urgent action is taken, costs to the consumer will continue to escalate&#8212;must be checked. The &#163;300 increase in household energy bills since 2010 means that reform of the market is very much needed.</p><p>I support some of the measures in the UK Government&#8217;s Energy Bill, but it lacks clarity and is not ambitious enough. It is a lost opportunity.</p><p>In principle, increasing investment in low-carbon and renewable energy through contracts for difference&#8212;that is a technical term that is used in the bill&#8212;could provide a sound structure to meet our electricity needs. However, further detail is needed on the contracts for difference and what the process will be for setting a strike price&#8212;that is another technical term that is used in the bill.</p><p>Those reforms are for the medium to long-term future of the electricity market. The current structure needs to be radically reformed to increase competition and reduce the cost to consumers&#8212;particularly our vulnerable, who depend heavily on having an energy supply at a reasonable, fair and affordable cost and on being able to access good advice and services from their providers to ensure that they have every opportunity to address difficulties in the future.</p><p>Six companies have 99 per cent of the market share of household energy bills. The question arises: why only six companies? The ambitious proposals to place a requirement on energy companies to pool the power that they generate and make it available to any retailer would break the dominance of the six main energy companies and allow price flexibility rather than possible price fixing, which some of our oil companies are being accused of.</p><p>Another question that has always puzzled me is why we allow energy companies to charge a surcharge if a customer wishes to move to another provider. Surely that is unfair and unreasonable. People should be free to move around and go to the best company that they wish to deal with, particularly as they pay for the service; it is not free.</p><p>I genuinely believe that, in theory, flexibility is very important, but it is even more important that the community and our vulnerable people have more than just affordable energy; they should also have companies that they can trust and which can support them in ensuring that they get good advice and information about how they can best save energy, because saving energy is a very important element. It is in the best interests of our country&#8212;although perhaps not of the companies that provide the services&#8212;that our communities are well versed in the opportunities that are available to them.</p><p>I ask the minister to address a question about the bill. Will there be additional support to communities and community groups in particular? I recently visited the Glasgow athletes village and was very impressed by measures that had been taken there to reduce the energy bill and make systems cost effective. Will any other schemes be introduced in the near future to support our communities in addressing that issue?</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in today&#8217;s debate on electricity market reform.

I felt very uneasy when I read that, because it suggests that there has been no improvement in the past decade. The report also states that 30 per cent of offenders reoffend within one year. The fact that the rate has been static for a decade and that 30 per cent of offenders are reoffending must lead us to ask where we have failed them.</p><p>One of the most striking comments in the Audit Scotland report is that</p><p>&#8220;there is a mismatch between what is currently being delivered and what is known to be effective.&#8221;</p><p>We know what is effective, but we are not doing anything about it. That rings alarm bells about why we have failed so far.</p><p>One of the report&#8217;s major recommendations calls for</p><p>&#8220;more flexibility to meet local needs and priorities&#8221;.</p><p>I hope that the project in HMP Greenock will go on to meet the local needs of prisoners and their families. Engagement with families is important, because many families abandon offenders due to shame, stigma or other issues.</p><p>The cost of reoffending to Scotland&#8217;s economy has been estimated at approximately &#163;3&#160;billion a year. However, the real costs can be calculated not in money, but in social deprivation and the shortcomings of society that result.</p><p>The use of prisoners&#8217; assets to fund programmes is a way of getting extra resources, but I believe that the quality of the programmes is much more important. Mary Fee was correct to highlight the role of family and friends in ensuring that ex-offenders get the kind of support that they might not have had for a long time.</p><p>I want to make a point about offenders from minority communities. Historically, people from such communities who have been in prison have far greater stigma attached to them. Their families are usually in denial and will not accept the fact that a member of the family has been in prison. The usual excuse for a person not being around because of that is, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s gone home to visit relatives,&#8221; which could refer to anywhere in the world. Although that may seem like a good excuse at the time, it does their kin no justice.</p><p>A person who finds themselves in difficulties, who offends and is prosecuted and incarcerated, needs support. I suggest that we emphasise that not only families but appropriate agencies support those people&#8212;in particular, people from minority communities and first-time offenders&#8212;in order to try to ensure that they re-engage with society and can play a full role in it.</p><p>I am grateful to Mary Fee for the debate today.

She said:</p><p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it&#8217;s the government&#8217;s job to cope with. &#8216;I have a problem, I&#8217;ll get a grant.&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;m homeless, the government must house me.&#8217; They&#8217;re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. It&#8217;s our duty to look after ourselves and then, also to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There&#8217;s no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation.&#8221;</p><p>I respect the Thatcher family&#8217;s loss of a mother and grandmother and I offer my condolences at this time. However, I cannot agree with her policies; we will not rewrite history because she has died. Under the Thatcher Government, poverty and inequality increased and unemployment hit levels that the UK had not seen since the great depression. Her belief in a small state and in the deregulation of the financial markets amounted to selective prosperity. It left many, including mining and steel industry communities and working families at large, feeling misled and ignored.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher may have died but, unfortunately, Thatcherism lives on. It will take decades to recover from its impact on Scotland and on the people of Scotland: unemployment rose by 16 per cent; interest rates rose in November 1990 to 13.88 per cent; poverty increased by 13.4 per cent; and inequality increased from a ratio of 0.25 to 0.34&#8212;and we are supposed to wonder whether there is such a thing as society.</p><p>Societies are built by love, care and guidance, not by destroying communities and their livelihoods. What was done by the Thatcher Government to the people of Scotland was nothing less than criminal. Destroying our fruitful steel industry and growing mining industry was unforgivable. It led to devastated communities, and we recognise that we need to rebuild our society as we know it.</p><p>So, what is society? What are society&#8217;s responsibilities and who is responsible for building societies? That responsibility lies on our shoulders&#8212;on all of us collectively. Governments will come and go, but the responsibility for building a society ultimately lies on the shoulders of individuals and communities. More important, people say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t vote for the Thatcher Government,&#8221; but we all voted; we may not have voted for her, but we all had a democratic vote. We all then suffered or succeeded, depending on where we were.</p><p>The vast majority of people in Scotland did not benefit from the Thatcher Government, so there is a lot of ill feeling towards it.

I would like to start with the words: &#8220;Bismillah-hir-Rahman-nir-Rahim&#8221;. For the record, that means: &#8220;In the name of God, the benevolent and merciful&#8221;. I also add: &#8220;As-salam alaykum&#8221;. That means: &#8220;Peace be upon you all&#8221;&#8212;and in particular upon our guests today in the chamber and their brothers and sisters at home in Kurdistan.</p><p>I add my voice to the debate and urge the Scottish Government to recognise formally the genocide of the people of Iraqi Kurdistan. I also encourage the European Union and the United Nations to do likewise, as many of the perpetrators seem to have escaped prosecution. Doing so will enable the Kurdish people&#8212;many of whom are in Scotland&#8212;to feel a sense of achievement and justice after their loss. The United Kingdom Parliament has already recognised the Kurdish genocide after the campaign led by Bayan Abdul Rahman. I congratulate her and her team on that achievement.</p><p>The genocide went on for decades&#8212;in fact, since early 1963&#8212;and it involved the deportation of ordinary Kurdish people, the use of chemical weapons in the 1970 and 1980s, and then the campaign of 1987-88 in which hundreds of thousands of innocent people died. Families were torn apart. More than 4,500 villages were destroyed between 1976 and 1988 alone&#8212;genocide at its worst, while the whole world sat back and did nothing. That we allowed that genocide to happen in our day and age is a shame upon us.</p><p>On a positive note, I am very fortunate to have made at least two visits to Kurdistan in recent years and I am planning a third. I have received six delegations from Kurdistan, who have had meetings with people including the First Minister, the justice secretary, the education secretary and many officials and members&#8212;all in a bid to do our bit in trying to correct history. I have written two reports that explore how we can offer support to our friends in Kurdistan&#8212;one of which I have presented to the First Minister&#8212;and a third report is being done just now.</p><p>On education, we are looking at establishing university campuses in Kurdistan and at students coming to Scotland to study. We are also looking at law and order and policing, as has already been mentioned. I had the privilege of visiting the police training centre in Erbil and I was very impressed with the level of training on offer and, more importantly, the feeling that I got from the young students there who felt an ownership. They felt that they could work with the community rather than the community feeling dictated to and abused by the police force. That is a new concept in policing.</p><p>We also looked at water supply and water treatment issues, and at gas and oil exploration. We are now exploring the possibility of ministerial visits to Kurdistan, in a bid to bridge the gaps between our communities.</p><p>Kurdistan is similar to Scotland. It has a population of approximately 5 million and it is a mountainous region. The shame is that, in the genocide that took place, it was the innocent people who suffered. The people who were scratching a living on the barren, hard land with no irrigation facilities were targeted with poison gas weapons. I still cannot understand how the Iraqi Government got away with it. I still do not understand why we human beings allow such things to happen internationally.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687810", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Kurdish Contribution to Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bob Doris for securing today&#8217;s debate.

People feel that some politicians cannot see beyond the next election, but I believe that long-term planning is essential.</p><p>In his evidence to the committee, the cabinet secretary John Swinney expressed his belief that planning beyond three years is difficult, given what the UK Government sets out, and there may be some truth in that. However, he will be aware that the City of Edinburgh Council has developed a 10-year long-term financial plan for key factors that influence the cost of service delivery and calculations for the overall level of savings that are required to achieve delivery. Hats off to the council. I genuinely pray that it is successful in its hopes and aspirations, because the plan is a long-term look at what it will do.</p><p>The City of Edinburgh Council depends on funding from the Scottish Government, as the Scottish Government depends on the UK Government. Why can the Scottish Government not deliver a similar long-term plan to the one that the council has developed? What plans does the Scottish Government have in place&#8212;if any&#8212;to deal with the projected funding gap? It is essential that we recognise that there will be challenges and we really need to consider a long-term strategy.</p><p>I also have concerns about the lack of long-term vision and clarity in current planning for demographic change.

A notable example concerns free personal care&#8221;.</p><p>Free personal care is important to many people. Because we are going through a change in our cultural norms, more and more people tend to live independently and more and more people do not have the ability or facilities to look after their elderly. Therefore, more and more of the elderly depend on the state to support them.</p><p>David Bell continues:</p><p>&#8220;the role of different funding streams to support frail older people lacks clarity.&#8221;</p><p>When a number of different streams support our elderly, people tend to use each other as excuses for not delivering.

There are huge opportunities.</p><p>We must do all that we can do to ensure that Scotland can draw down as much of the funding as it can do. We might not get the full &#8364;1 trillion&#8212;albeit that it will not be for the want of trying&#8212;but we must ensure that everyone knows that funds are available and helps to secure them.</p><p>My committee has also been investigating teaching of foreign languages in primary schools. Our convener, Christina McAlpine, touched on that&#8212;[Interruption.] I beg her pardon, I meant Christina McKelvie. Just the other week we learned that every year there is an underspend in the European budget&#8212;funding that would support teacher and pupil exchanges. That will not do. We must redouble our efforts to ensure that we take advantage of money that is available for good work. The people of Scotland must know that members of their Parliament are on the ball and up to date. They must have confidence that we know that money is available and, more important, how to help people to get it.</p><p>The people of Scotland must also know that we can bring about change. That is an important element. When a European law is not working, the people of Scotland must have confidence that we will do everything that we can to fix the problem. That is our job.</p><p>During the debate I got the impression that each committee member is dedicated to ensuring that the EU works for us in the best possible way. I am encouraged by that positive sign.</p><p>Let us not forget that Scotland has much to offer the European Union, whether through our colleges and universities, our primary schools or the can-do attitude of our businesses, which are at the forefront of the renewable energy sector and are pushing the boundaries in that regard. Scotland has a lot to give to the European Union family.</p><p>We heard from committee representatives about the initiatives and action that their committees are taking. We heard about the seven-year European Union budget and the future of the common agricultural policy and what it means for our farming industry, our landscape and even our dietary needs.</p><p>We should not forget our equality duties. My committee is the first&#8212;if not the only&#8212;committee to undertake equality training. I encourage other committees to do that.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has stressed the need for change. There are opportunities and challenges to Scotland that are afforded by developments in the energy sector, including a North Sea grid to connect Scotland&#8217;s energy generation to Europe, or the various proposals in renewable energy. EU infrastructure policies, whether on broadband or ferry links, will have a significant impact on peoples&#8217; daily lives.</p><p>What happens next? The committee&#8217;s work is on-going. The debate has offered only a snapshot of what is possible. I, too, am passionate about what we can achieve and the differences that we can make by being in the European Union. Let us see how much of that &#8364;1 trillion budget can be brought home to Scotland.</p><p>Why am I keen to see that happen? Many of our small and medium-sized companies are hungry for investment. We need to encourage and support not only small and medium-sized companies, but community groups that bring so much to, and do so much valuable work for, our communities. That support may come from agencies, and Humza Yousaf referred to two organisations that support minority communities. I am also keen to see what other organisations can provide support not only in identifying funding, but in supporting people in acquiring it. The bottom line is that we need to ask where the funding is going and why we are not getting the most benefit from it. Our committee is working hard to ensure that we not only identify means of bringing the funding home, but that we ensure that the funding delivers on the ground. I hope that other committees will support our work&#8212;as we support their work&#8212;in ensuring that that happens.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684898", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Union Priorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Just last week, the European and External Relations Committee considered a report on the latest developments in the EU budget.

The debt arrangement scheme has been an important statutory tool over the past nine years, and we recognise that fact. However, the economic situation has changed since the creation of the scheme, and not just banks but other high street lenders are now on the scene&#8212;high street stores, building societies and the like&#8212;which present many opportunities for many people to acquire debt.</p><p>When people need money urgently, even a 1,000 per cent interest rate does not put them off if they do not know other places to go to. Communities among the minority communities, in particular, suffer greater hardship. I am referring to communities who are not very good at English, incomers to Scotland, refugees and the vulnerable in society among us.</p><p>Data from citizens advice bureaux state that 400 people a day are coming to them for debt advice. That gives us some idea of the number of Scots who are currently worried about debt. The misery created when people go bankrupt or when families suffer hardship is untenable. People who find themselves in that trap always find that there are fewer places to go to for assistance and, without better financial literacy, things could get much worse.</p><p>With the introduction of universal credit, I fear that many vulnerable people will choose to pay off high-interest debts rather than their rent and that, in itself, that will have huge implications, which could include family evictions, homelessness and all sorts of difficulties for our society as we know it. We need to recognise that a lot of people out there have difficulties in managing resource and that, without statutory assistance, they will face even greater difficulties. Hence, introducing proper legislative safeguards is important.</p><p>I believe that raising awareness of affordable alternatives such as credit unions is a matter of urgency, on which we must take action. In the past, many people perhaps felt that credit unions were for small debts that might be incurred by families in housing associations or by the vulnerable in society. I can assure members that credit unions provide a vital support line for many families in Scotland today. Given the user-friendly attitude of the credit unions, they need to be commended for the work that they do. They do fantastic work, which many families benefit from. Therefore, I believe that credit unions need to be supported even more now than they have been in the past.</p><p>In conclusion, debt is a serious issue, so I am glad to take part in today&#8217;s debate on the motion and our amendment regarding what is a really worthwhile scheme. It is very important that we support our communities, and the debt arrangement scheme is one of the best things that we can do.

In this case, as in others, the merger would have impacted on more than just the companies involved. It would have impacted on suppliers&#8212;small companies&#8212;that engage with them. Sometimes that effect is not clear and the total number of job losses cannot be calculated. In the cases that are cited in the motion, such as the merger of RBS and ABN AMRO, the devil was in the detail. In a time of economic instability, lessons need to be learned about the weaknesses in the system of regulating mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>I believe that the House of Commons Defence Select Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the merger and its potential impact on Scottish jobs was important, but the big threat that was perceived to exist to jobs on the Clyde was the uncertainty caused by the lack of defence orders and the threat that Scotland might leave the United Kingdom.

Historically, Governments have not played that role. We have allowed companies to make commercial decisions by themselves, but when a merger would impact on jobs and the growth of industry, I think that we have a role to play, primarily to provide assistance. When companies go overseas, all sorts of shortfalls are left in Scotland. I cite the example of the wind farm manufacturing industry that we no longer have in Scotland. Although we might be one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to renewable energy, we do not have a leading manufacturing position. In many cases, imports are being considered.</p><p>We need to export; without exports, we will not grow. The Scottish Government needs to have a policy that sets out what it is willing to accept as far as mergers are concerned.

I welcome the opportunity to speak in today&#8217;s debate on improving employability. The Finance Committee&#8217;s report focuses on youth employability and mentions those who are experiencing high levels of multiple deprivation. However, there is a great deal of diversity within that group and one size does not fit all: it never has and never will.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with the report that there is a need for a support package that is flexible enough to deal with the variety of needs that young people face. One issue that should be recognised is the large impact of youth unemployment among ethnic minority young people, as the unemployment rate is approximately twice that of the indigenous community. Modern apprenticeships are a good first step towards combating that, but Skills Development Scotland figures show that visible ethnic minority communities have only 1.2 per cent of young people in modern apprenticeships, which is very sad.</p><p>We in Scotland need to get our act together and work to reduce unemployment. The Government needs to get out there and find companies that would be interested in investing in Scotland and in giving our skilled, willing and hard-working workforce an opportunity to prove themselves. Businessmen such as Willie Haughey, and Glasgow City Council, have supported the modern apprenticeship scheme.</p><p>Those efforts are very welcome and they are to be encouraged right across Scotland. Time and again, we fail to recognise the important role that industry can play. We fail to recognise and understand the contribution that is made by many businesspeople. We have never gone out of our way to encourage them or to congratulate them on the efforts that they make on our behalf.</p><p>I also ask the cabinet secretary whether the youth employment policy has been equality impact assessed. It would be interesting to see the findings of such an assessment. Many of the schemes that are mentioned in the report are focused on school leavers, colleges, and people who are dropping out of higher education. However, the report does not address many issues in other communities that still have young people who have left their first-time employment and have not been able to get re-employment in jobs that they are trained to do.</p><p>I remind the cabinet secretary about the cuts that have been made to college funding. I know that it is a sore point, but it is an important one. It has been recognised that there was a shortfall in funding and the First Minister had to apologise for that. Although I do not wish to ask the First Minister these questions, I have absolutely no hesitation in asking the minister and the cabinet secretary what they are going to do about that. The shortfall was recognised. Will they reinvest that amount in our colleges? Will they add that amount to next year&#8217;s college budget? Let the First Minister&#8217;s apology not be a hollow one; let us put things right.</p><p>Our colleges do a wonderful job; no one has questioned that. Our colleges have done much, so it was quite sad when the cabinet secretary suggested that some courses were perhaps not worthy of support. I do not believe that there is any college course that is not worthy of support. People talk about flower arranging not being important but, believe me, they soon find out how important it is when they try to get someone to put together a bouquet for them.</p><p>No training course should be undermined. We insult our young people when we do that. Not everybody will be a rocket scientist, but everybody is part of the community, they are part of our responsibility, and they are part and parcel of the structure of Scotland. They must be supported. If they want to go to college and do such courses, that is exactly what should happen.</p><p>As a nation, we have proven ourselves time and again. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind or, I am sure, in anyone else&#8217;s, that, given the opportunity, our young people can produce, perform and outdo anyone else. That is a matter of record. I am not boasting just because I am Scottish. It is down in black and white and it is part of history. We can do it if we are given the opportunity.

The forum looked at a number of issues, including accessible transport, the food strategy, volunteering and the ticketing strategy. We need to look at the forum&#8217;s work in detail to see what can be learned from the successes and mistakes of the London games, including the mistake that gave rise to anger about empty seats at sold-out events.</p><p>On the food strategy for the Commonwealth games, I welcome the appointment of a food project manager&#8212;or a food tsar, as the newspapers call her&#8212;whose remit will include helping Scottish food and drink suppliers to tender for contracts at the events. I urge the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council to ensure that the provision of specialist products such as halal food is given careful consideration as part of the strategy.</p><p>The London 2012 equality and diversity forum supported the launch of a website&#8212;www.inclusivelondon.com&#8212;that highlighted a range of accessible services, hotels and modes of transport. I feel that such a resource would be useful for people who want to come to the Glasgow games, and I would like to know whether anything along those lines is planned.</p><p>I have some questions about the inclusiveness of the Glasgow 2014 volunteering strategy. The volunteering publicity says that people can volunteer only if they are eligible to work in the UK. That means that people from the A2 countries&#8212;Romania and Bulgaria&#8212;who are not eligible to work in the UK at the moment but who will be eligible to do so from 1 January 2014, will not be able to register to participate as volunteers in 2014. That issue needs to be looked at.</p><p>I turn to the question of who owns the games. I listened carefully to John Mason, who, like me, is a former member of Glasgow City Council, and I am surprised that he wants to take away the credit for the games from Glasgow. They are Glasgow&#8217;s games. It was Glasgow City Council that bid for the games and which worked hard to win them.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate, particularly as I have campaigned for Pakistan International Airlines direct flights between the twin cities of Glasgow and Lahore. Air passenger duty for that route would now be &#163;65 for an economy passenger, which is an increase of more than 8 per cent in the past year. I am convinced that there is sufficient demand for the Glasgow to Lahore route, and there is certainly spare capacity at Glasgow airport, but the recent above-inflation increases on already high aviation taxation make it hard to encourage airlines to invest in Scotland. It is important that we take steps to address that issue.</p><p>The Scottish air route development fund was one of the great success stories of the previous Labour-led Administration in the Scottish Parliament. An independent study in 2009 by the transport consultancy Scott Murray put the total net economic benefits to Scotland of the Scottish air route development fund at over &#163;450 million over a 10-year period, including nearly &#163;35 million of benefits from the setting up of the Glasgow to Dubai link. There were real benefits. The fund grew tourism, sustained businesses and created jobs. Therefore, it was very disappointing that the first act of the incoming Government in 2007 was to scrap that fund.</p><p>The Government could do more to overcome the obstacles. It has been in power for the past five years, and there is still little sign of any progress in that direction. Surely there are ways to meet the European Commission&#8217;s concerns. The Scottish Labour Party proposed an air route marketing fund, and I would be delighted if the Government took up that idea.</p><p>Glasgow Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s top priority for air is not air passenger duty, but route development activity. It argues that, to increase both the number of direct flights and access to major air hubs, Glasgow needs international promotion. That in turn would grow both inward and outward travel markets. I agree with Glasgow Chamber of Commerce that air passenger duty is only one part of the jigsaw, and again encourage the Scottish Government to engage positively with the European Commission to bring forward proposals to develop more direct air routes from Scotland, particularly to developing markets.</p><p>It is not only about our air links; we also need infrastructure. During my term in Glasgow City Council, I promoted the Glasgow airport rail link. It is critical that, if we are to become a successful partner on the world economic stage, we need a proper infrastructure that supports our airports and air links. That in turn will increase our productivity and employment opportunities and, more important, business opportunities.</p><p>We need to encourage businesses to look at Scotland as a destination. It is very good for us to say that we are open for business, but we need to have the tools for people to come in and do that business.</p><p>I recall a particular incident in which an Australian businessman came to Scotland to develop and build a hotel in Glasgow. The first thing that he complained about was the transport from the airport to the city. That disappointed me, as I had gone to a lot of trouble to encourage him to come and take up a project and develop it in Glasgow. It disappointed me that he opened his remarks not with the words, &#8220;How are you, Mr Malik?&#8221; but with &#8220;That&#8217;s a terrible situation you&#8217;ve got here. You can&#8217;t even get to the city from the airport.&#8221; I remarked to myself that there were quite a few ways of getting there, but nevertheless, the point was made.</p><p>It has always remained in the back of my mind that such issues are important. Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure and our air links are important, and the duty and the increased levels of duty that have been proposed are unrealistic. We are already isolated from the rest of Europe. We need to be able to control the cost of people coming to and going from Scotland. One of the biggest challenges for us is that the aviation companies need to have a free hand in competing fairly and reasonably across Europe. Therefore, I suggest that the minister should bring forward proposals on how he will address the issue with the European Union to try to assist us in overcoming those difficulties.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677319", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Passenger Duty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Good afternoon.

I hope that it overcomes the issues that it currently faces, and I hope that the situation does not affect staff morale and students&#8217; academic futures.</p><p>I have always been keen to promote the value of Scottish colleges, in Glasgow, in Scotland and internationally. Scotland&#8217;s Rural University College works in Lahore and other cities in Pakistan, and the City of Glasgow College works in Karachi and Lahore. We have a proud history of engaging with cities and countries overseas, and I thank our colleges for the wonderful job that they do and for facing up to the current challenges.</p><p>There can be no doubt that colleges provide access to education to a diverse range of people, through flexible learning models and a broad subject choice. That flexibility has an effect on social mobility. People from minority communities and people with disabilities benefit from college education, and students from diverse areas attend colleges and universities.</p><p>Several college mergers have taken place, and there will be more. In previous mergers, there has been support for our colleges to enable them to transfer to the new model, but that will not happen on this occasion. We are saying to our colleges that they will have to deal with those issues with current resources, and that is a huge challenge for colleges in a time of cuts. We are going through such a harsh economic situation just now, and saying to colleges that they must deal with the matter themselves places a huge burden on them.</p><p>As young people have to compete in an increasingly harsh labour market, there is a rising demand for college places. We have heard that there is a waiting list of people who want to go to colleges to retrain. I have heard various comments today about &#8220;hobby courses&#8221;, but I do not know what those are. To me, any learning is learning, and when people learn, they can apply themselves.</p><p>We give a lot of credit and credence to industry and businesses, but we do not seem to understand that we are a country of entrepreneurs. There are people who are self-employed, who earn a great deal of respect and money for this country. They also need education, and such education does not need to be focused, as we need people to be able to choose subjects. Flexibility and choice of subjects are important, as the fewer subjects we have, the less we have to offer and the more we deny our young the opportunities that they need.</p><p>I do not really care what happens down south, or in Ireland, Iceland or the Netherlands. I care what happens in Scotland, and in Glasgow. I know that our young need jobs, and that they need to be professional. If we want to attract industry from overseas, we need a professional workforce, and for that we need colleges and courses. To pretend anything different is useless, and we should not go there.</p><p>It is very important for us to ensure that we represent the needs of our communities. The idea of pulling parties down and trawling through people&#8217;s figures is not what this is about. We need to do a job, in the sense that we want to provide for our young and for our future, and we can do that only if we provide a service.</p><p>There are challenges with regard to how we deal with those issues. One or two members in the chamber have asked Opposition members, &#8220;What would you do to fund colleges?&#8221; The Government should not bring forward a policy, go through this charade of a debate, and then just pass it on. It should speak to people and share ideas, and come up with conclusions and solutions that are fit for purpose.</p><p>We all say that we have free education in our universities, but what about our colleges? If people cannot get into a college, they will have to pay to go somewhere else, so it is not free. Free is only free if someone can get access and can have the opportunity to study, and they will not get that if we go down the road that we are going down just now.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to speak in the debate, because I have always been involved in higher education.

Twenty-three per cent of Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children are in Glasgow and Glasgow has the highest proportion in Scotland of its children being looked after, with 3.2 per cent of the under-18 population in the care of the local authority. That figure is more than double the Scottish average of 1.5 per cent and is higher than the figure in any other part of Scotland.</p><p>Last year, I spoke about the incredibly poor education outcomes for looked-after children. The evidence shows that establishing stability and permanence early in a child&#8217;s life can generate an improvement in their life chances. I welcome the efforts that have been made to improve the quality and consistency of decision making on permanence but, along with Barnardo&#8217;s and the NSPCC, I would like major improvements to be made in the speed of the process.</p><p>There are three areas in which further improvements are required. The first is in establishing a care plan for permanence. It is vital for the welfare of a child that early and effective decisions on permanence are made once that child enters the looked-after children system.</p><p>Secondly, a study by the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration found that, for 92 per cent of the children in its sample, it took more than two years from their first becoming involved with services for them to be adopted. In one case&#8212;as has been highlighted&#8212;the process took more than 10 years, which is a ridiculous amount of time.</p><p>The third area in which improvement is required is in assisting with the adoption process. I would be interested to hear from the minister what steps are being taken to encourage the minority communities in Scotland to participate in the adoption scheme. If she does not have the answer today, I will be happy to receive it at a later date&#8212;I do not want to put her on the spot. Many of our communities in Scotland have traditionally been welcoming of looking after siblings and other relatives. That care package is extremely important. We need to stop the bureaucracy taking too long.</p><p>I will give an example of my experience of the process. After two years of interviews&#8212;including interviews of my children&#8212;training, visits and people coming to my place and my parents&#8217; place, I was eventually told that I was not a suitable adopter. The reason that was given was that I work too hard. I got very worried, because I have two children. I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not taking my children away, are you?&#8221; My children are okay&#8212;they can stay with me, even though I work very hard&#8212;but I cannot adopt anyone else.

Such cases should make all members of the Parliament ashamed.</p><p>I also have concerns about local authorities, which will be placed in a difficult position as a result of the year-in, year-out squeeze on their budgets. I would like the minister to assure the Parliament today that councils have sufficient funds to do the job.</p><p>I now come to roads and road safety. Our motorways and trunk roads are suffering because of a lack of maintenance and a lack of joined-up work between contractors. I give the example of the M8, where there are hardly any cat&#8217;s eyes and white lines are missing or have been totally eroded, so it is in a dangerous state. I want the minister to explain why he has allowed that level of poor workmanship on the M8. I travel on that road frequently and I find it quite dangerous during the hours of darkness.</p><p>Last but not least, we have a responsibility to continue to build on the good practices that we have developed over our historic years. Resource will be a huge issue for service delivery. Many members have mentioned potholes. It is easy to say that potholes are local authorities&#8217; responsibility, but if we do not give local authorities money, they cannot do anything about them.</p><p>I would appreciate the minister&#8217;s commitment to assisting councils around the country to achieve the goals that I have mentioned.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to speak in the debate.

However, as a former councillor in Glasgow, I am aware of local authority licensing boards&#8217; responsibilities in granting gambling premises licences under section 153 of the Gambling Act 2005. There is a strong case for giving local authorities increased powers and more flexibility to limit the number of betting shops in their areas. Gambling might not be a direct responsibility of the Parliament or the Scottish Government, but we are right to discuss it, because it affects our people and their quality of life, particularly when people develop a gambling problem.</p><p>The most recent gambling prevalence survey pointed to a number of facts that increase a person&#8217;s risk of developing a gambling problem. Of particular interest to me was the fact that people from an Asian ethnic background are three times more likely to have a gambling problem than is someone from a white ethnic background.</p><p>The issue is also one of social justice. People who are in poor health are four times more likely to have a gambling problem, as are unemployed people. Those with severe money problems are 12 times more likely to have a gambling problem than are those with no money worries.</p><p>The motion refers to Harriet Harman&#8217;s acknowledgement that the pendulum has swung too far in respect of the number of gambling premises. Her main concern is about the growth in high-stake rapid-play B2 machines, and I support her call for lower limits on stakes for those machines and on prize pay-outs.</p><p>We must take all possible steps to safeguard our communities against the dangers of gambling. As I come from Glasgow, a major issue for me is that some areas have so many gambling shops that social activity is limited and so people feel obliged to gamble.</p><p>John Mason referred to the frightening way in which gambling shops encourage customers&#8212;especially younger people&#8212;to gamble. More and more machines are being used to attract young people, who sometimes mislead themselves into thinking that they are playing a game, although real money is used. They do not have enough resources to start with.</p><p>I press the minister to share with Westminster our fears and concerns about the legislation and to ask for the issues that we face in Scotland&#8212;and, I am sure, throughout the country&#8212;to be addressed.

I am particularly concerned about the 27 per cent slump in new business accounts in the construction industry, which bears out what Ken Macintosh&#8217;s amendment says about the pressures faced by that particular sector. The cabinet secretary is quite right to point out that there are issues there, which I accept. We need to address those issues and we are not doing that adequately.

They all say that they would rather have a longer period than the suggested three months, and that the percentage drop will actually discourage investment.</p><p>People in small industries, companies and organisations are terrified of having their properties lying vacant.

Some fire brigades and police services have achieved very high-quality standards that I would not want to see eroded by some of the other services that perhaps have been lagging behind and are trying to catch up to that standard. It is important that the local authorities that have made huge investments and have been prudent and professional do not feel that they have lost a quality of service that has taken a long time to build. It is important that confidence remains in place.</p><p>I have had discussions with various people and I had the opportunity to sit on the Strathclyde police authority and the Strathclyde fire and rescue board. The amount of work and the diversity in the services is amazing. Policing is not only about attending to a fight in a back court or chasing a robber in the street. It is about everything from community safety to liaison and supporting communities.</p><p>Our officers are overstretched as it is. When an officer comes on duty, he or she has almost back-to-back inquiries. Because of the huge challenges that they face, officers do not really have the opportunity to mix with communities that they had in the past. However, the job is one that most officers enjoy and they do it well under difficult circumstances. Obviously, our job is to ensure that we protect that historic engagement with communities. I learned amazing things about what Strathclyde Fire and Rescue does for communities while I was on the board: fire alarms, community safety&#8212;things that were not done in the past. Those things have helped to save many lives. The credit for that goes to our officers in the field. That is why it is imperative that we continue to build on the standards that we have achieved historically in Scotland. I am pleased to say that I genuinely believe that our services are envied around the world because of those standards and the level of quality that we provide.</p><p>We have an opportunity to ensure that we can share that good practice by selling quality training to people around the world. We can do that by ensuring that our training facilities are in place. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue is building a purpose-built centre for training its own officers. That facility could also be used to deliver services to others. Tulliallan could also be used&#8212;it is a place that delivers the finest training opportunities. It has done so for people from overseas in the past. I want to see that service retained and built on so that our officers can share good practice around the world. That would not only support us here on a national level but promote our badge overseas as being a country that engages with people in a positive way. We used to do it, but that role changed over time and we need to rekindle that effort.</p><p>I also believe that there will be opportunities for our young people when we have a national service&#8212;we can be more focused on what we deliver for them. There is a lot of youth unemployment and we need to try to change that trend.</p><p>The Government promised another 1,000 officers on the beat. It has been suggested that most of them are working in back offices&#8212;yes, that happens, but it is not our job to micromanage. Our job in the Parliament is to ensure that we put the mechanism in place to deliver that service. It is up to the senior officers to ensure that they improve that service. If there are shortcomings, it is our job to support those officers so that they can overcome those difficulties. We need to be positive and focused and, when people bring shortcomings to our attention, we should deal with them. We should not be ashamed of doing that.</p><p>I wonder whether there is also an opportunity to enhance the service in terms of our ambulance services. Currently, the Scottish Ambulance Service board shares its medical director with the NHS 24 board. Why are we not doing something similar elsewhere? Is there any mileage in the proposed Scottish fire service being amalgamated and merged with the Scottish Ambulance Service, or in the Scottish Ambulance Service merging with NHS 24.</p><p>At the end of the day, we are talking about our uniformed services and about services to our communities. We are talking about focusing our resources to ensure that we have the best of services on the street, so that our communities benefit from the most efficient services possible. Let us not restrict ourselves to the fire and police services&#8212;we should also examine the Ambulance Service. That would enhance the quality of the service that we already have. It would also allow us the opportunity to look at the Ambulance Service from a different perspective and to see what mileage there is to enhance that service&#8217;s quality as well, because that service is also overstretched. I believe that there is a job to be done there as well.

It is a historic event, and I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate her.</p><p>It is right that we are debating the key European issues today, as much of the business of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s committees is affected by decisions that are taken in Brussels. The people of Scotland must know that its Parliament in Edinburgh is looking after their interests and that we are listening to their concerns and adding strength by carrying their message to Brussels. To fulfil that role, we must always ensure that the people of Scotland know what is happening in Brussels and how it affects their lives. We must use all the resources that are at our disposal, including our officials in Brussels, our representatives in the Scottish and United Kingdom Governments and our members of the European Parliament.</p><p>I take on board the comments that Patricia Ferguson and Jamie McGrigor made about the timing of the report to the Parliament.</p><p>In our role, we must listen carefully to what is going on and consider how things can be developed. Once we know what is going on, it is essential that we get into the right rooms in Brussels&#8212;the rooms where the issues are prepared, debated and ultimately decided on. We have the resources at our disposal to do that job.</p><p>We have heard from representatives of other committees about their intentions to act, and we heard from Christina McKelvie and Fiona Hyslop about how we intend to take forward our programme. We heard about the common agricultural policy, which has such an influence not just on our farmers but on our countryside and our environment. The common fisheries policy&#8212;there is a lot of fishy stuff going on there, by the way&#8212;is undergoing much-needed reform, and the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee is working to ensure that the changes are right for Scotland.</p><p>Also important to Scotland are the opportunities and challenges that are afforded by developments in the energy sector, be they in the North Sea grid initiative to connect Scotland&#8217;s energy generation to Europe or the various proposals in the field of renewable energy. We must develop strong and positive links in that area.</p><p>Europe is an essential funding source for Scotland. As has been highlighted, my committee is currently engaged in examining two major funding streams: the structural funds and the horizon 2020 fund for research and innovation. We will report to the Parliament in due course on those funding streams, but it is important to note that they will be vital for Scotland&#8217;s recovery.</p><p>EU policies on infrastructure for broadband and ferry lines will have a significant impact on the daily lives of the people of Scotland. We will monitor progress on those issues. Jamie McGrigor mentioned the importance of broadband in rural areas. I assure everyone here today that broadband is important for us all, throughout Scotland, because we are competing in the international arena and the speed and reliability of broadband are critically important in that regard. We need to work hard to ensure that we deliver a positive service.</p><p>What happens next? This debate is only a beginning. The serious work for many of us has already begun and we have not a moment to lose. We must ensure that Scotland gets its fair share of funding; that its voice is heard and understood in Brussels; that we are able to warn of impending challenges and upcoming opportunities; and that we play our part in building the Europe that we want to live in.</p><p>I have noted a reluctance by UK ministers to engage fully with the Scottish Government, which is very unhelpful. We are partners and it is disappointing that that happens in a partnership. Communication between partners is important, but currently it is at best poor and sometimes non-existent. An example of that was the use of the veto by the UK Prime Minister, with no consultation or notification for the Scottish Government. I think that that was outrageous at the very least.</p><p>We live in a new world with new challenges, with people demanding higher levels of accountability. The Governments in London and Brussels need to recognise that new reality. We have to learn the lessons that other Governments have failed to learn. When Governments fail to listen to their people, they pay a very heavy price. I hope that we do not have to do that.</p><p>I am grateful to the members of our committee. It has been a huge pleasure to serve on the committee, because very valuable and positive work has been done. We have had many presentations from witnesses, who gave us expert advice. However, it is important to recognise that the reluctance to which I referred earlier means that we sometimes undersell ourselves. We cannot afford to do that. My message to the Government is that we need to ensure that we are a strong team, but we can do that only if we talk to each other. The cabinet secretary may wish to comment on that. However, she has already given a very good presentation on the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663597", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Union (Priorities for 2012)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I speak in support of the committee&#8217;s report, I congratulate our convener, Christina McKelvie, on arranging equalities training for our committee, which is a first in the Parliament.

We will face similar, historical difficulties here.</p><p>However, I want to talk about another area. There is a moral responsibility for some of the larger landholders, particularly in Scotland, to register in order to kick-start the process. That would be welcome. Some of the larger landholders, such as the Scottish Government itself and the Ministry of Defence, need to lead by example.</p><p>I got a few ballpark figures on ownership from the Scottish Parliament information centre today. In Scotland, the MOD owns approximately 23,500 hectares, and has 541 hectares, or thereabouts, of land on lease. It also has training rights over a further 120,000 hectares&#8212;land for non-exclusive use in military training. That is a lot of land, and I wonder how much of it is registered. The MOD also owns sites of great value, including grade A, B and C listed buildings, and sites of special scientific interest, protected areas, conservation areas and wetlands of international importance. With the shrinking of the armed forces, what will happen to those sites? Will they be returned to the national parks or to communities? Recently, I watched a programme about how the Victorians left us wonderful parks in our cities, which their descendants enjoy today. Will some of the MOD&#8217;s sites be left to future generations of our children and grandchildren to enjoy?</p><p>The important thing in all of this is registration. If large corporations and other large landholders are encouraged to register, some of our smaller landholders will be encouraged to do so, too, particularly those in our farming community who are challenged at the best of times, and this is a difficult period for them. To support our smaller landholders, I suggest that we ensure that they at least have free registration in the first instance, especially families who have inherited difficulties and have the complicated task of clearing up previously undone business.</p><p>Online registration is very important. I was recently overseas, and saw that India and Pakistan&#8212;countries that have been in business for fewer than 70 years&#8212;are going down that route. We have a lot to learn from some of the people overseas who have already done this. Registration is absolutely fundamental if we are to have proper, accurate records, and we should all be able to access information about who owns what. Without that accuracy, neighbours who have had good relations for generations can fall out over small differences.</p><p>I emphasise that we need to lead by example and ensure that our house is in order before we encourage others.

Creative industries are an important driver in the economic growth of Scotland, and we should use them to encourage inward investment. In particular, we should do more to support our film industry.

We have more than 150 diverse communities, and our museums and galleries&#8212;including the Riverside museum and the Kelvingrove art gallery and museum in Glasgow&#8212;are great assets in attracting visitors. The museums are free, thanks to Glasgow City Council, as are many similar museums and galleries around Scotland. What assurances can the cabinet secretary give in her summing up that she will work with councils to ensure that museums maintain a free admission policy?</p><p>The recent success of Scottish artists&#8212;in particular, Glasgow artists&#8212;in the Turner prize competition presents an opportunity. The Turner prize exhibition is now held outside London every odd year and attracts 15,000 visitors. I hope that the Scottish Government will join me in backing Glasgow as a preferred location for the 2015 exhibition, cementing Glasgow&#8217;s reputation as a vibrant centre for the arts and boosting our economy.</p><p>Many people around the world recognise the bagpipes and tartan as symbols of Scotland. However, visitors to our country and our shops&#8212;for example, those in the Royal Mile, not far from here&#8212;find it easy to buy bagpipes and kilts that are made overseas. We must do more to protect quality and locate manufacturing; more could also be done on labelling the products to ensure that visitors can tell the difference between quality, hand-crafted Scottish products and mass-produced imitations that are made&#8212;usually with cheap labour&#8212;thousands of miles away.</p><p>I will stay with the theme of products. I am keen for visitors to the Commonwealth games to be encouraged to see as much of Scotland as possible. Could each city have its own range of official memorabilia that was available only in that city, to promote visits to those destinations?</p><p>The three-year cultural plan offers a fantastic opportunity to showcase Scotland to the world. Work must be done to secure major events beyond 2014, which I hope will include the 2015 Turner prize exhibition in my own great city of Glasgow.</p><p>We have an opportunity. We all talk about culture and many events, but a lot of historical facts are attached to our cultural diversity. My colleague Drew Smith jokingly talked about the Olympic rings coming to Glasgow, but he made an important point. Our Glasgow youngsters know only one type of ring, and getting another type of ring to Glasgow would be important. He talked about George Square and the squinty bridge as locations. They are wonderful sites&#8212;the squinty bridge is near the television studios, which could use it as a backdrop. The rings could be outside Central station, where a lot of travellers from all over will arrive. Those small details make a difference.</p><p>Glasgow is the heart of Scotland; it is the steam engine. A lot of good things happen there and come from there. Glasgow represents people throughout Scotland. That is not an Edinburgh or Glasgow issue&#8212;it is just reality.</p><p>I want to concentrate on our young, who still do not have the diverse opportunities that they should have. For example, Glasgow has two bagpipe manufacturers. The bagpipes are a Scottish instrument and they are played mostly in Scotland, yet Pakistan makes more bagpipes than us. Why is that? We need to encourage our industry by supporting it to continue to create high-quality goods. We must ensure that, on the high street, people recognise the difference between quality and what is second best.</p><p>I am keen to know whether the Government can help our industries.

What is coming back? Are they just documents that are signed and put away, or will we actually get some trade from them? We have some limited cultural exchanges, but a lot of expense goes into the issue. A lot of trade delegations go out, but it is important that we as a Parliament assist the cities in coming up with a structure that is more useful, productive and focused on what we are trying to do.</p><p>Cuba has twinning agreements with more than 50 countries. It does not trade with them; they are bits of paper. We need to avoid that approach and ensure that our twinnings are meaningful and not just cultural exchanges. We have to learn from each other. The cities growth fund and the Government&#8217;s economic strategy are just as important as the twinnings.</p><p>I listened to Drew Smith talk about our infrastructure and transport. One thing that is dear to me is the Glasgow airport rail link. It would be a very important piece of infrastructure for this country. That is true for all our airports: we need good, positive transport infrastructure so that our businesses can be encouraged and we can encourage others to come here to develop. If our infrastructure is poor, people will be reluctant to come. Companies do not have money to burn, and they are looking for safe havens. They cannot find a safer, more developed and hungrier country to develop in than Scotland, but we must have the infrastructure in place to encourage them to come here. That is why it is so important.</p><p>We have recognised the skills, ability and positive things that there are in cities in Scotland.

Glasgow has around 10 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s children and young people, but it has more than 20 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children, which I understand is the highest proportion of any area in the country. Glasgow therefore has a particular interest in the issue, but the debate is important and timely for every member in the chamber, wherever they come from in Scotland.</p><p>I declare an interest as a member of Glasgow City Council. In Glasgow, the proportion of looked-after children who achieve five or more Scottish credit and qualifications framework awards at level 4 or above is 24 per cent, in comparison with 72 per cent of children who are not looked after.</p><p>I welcome the progress that the Scottish Government and previous Scottish Governments have made in having care plans produced for nearly all looked-after children and in having such children included in the strategic priorities of most local authorities. However, more needs to be done. The trend during the past few years has been an improvement in attainment and exclusion levels, but looked-after children still lag too far behind on those measures.</p><p>Further progress is at risk of being stunted if cuts continue to be made to support staff in our schools. Scotland has lost 115 support staff from its schools in the past year, and an astonishing 1,452 support staff from its secondary schools in the same period. Perhaps the minister will tell us in summing up how we will improve outcomes with 1,600 fewer support staff.</p><p>Recommendation 6 in the recent European and External Relations Committee report from session 3 states that the committee is concerned about the</p><p>&#8220;poor linguistic performance of the Scottish population&#8221;</p><p>and refers to people having two native languages and language skills. A case in point is the facility for Punjabi in our schools. At the moment, there is no provision for Punjabi speakers in our schools. We do not allow them to use Punjabi in examinations because the Scottish Qualifications Authority claims that there are not sufficient Punjabi speakers and that there is insufficient demand for the language. However, after English, Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Scotland. I do not know how the SQA has come to that conclusion and I ask the minister to comment on that. I am hopeful that the minister will take steps to address the issue for the Punjabi-speaking community. We go on about encouraging languages, yet we fail our community in that way.</p><p>In spite of an increase in assistance for looked-after children, progress is still too slow and is in danger of grinding to a halt because of budgetary constraints. I welcome the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s inquiry and I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say about addressing the issues.</p><p>Education is very important and we tend to put pressure on agencies to provide support for our young people, but we are perhaps not supporting the parents. A lot of parents&#8212;in particular, single parents&#8212;find it very difficult to bring up children and to support them in their education. There must be some provision for them, and we must support our schools in delivering that provision, as there does not seem to be any other window of opportunity. Young parents engage with schools more readily and regularly. Therefore, I ask the minister whether she can try to find some support to enable schools to provide additional support for single parents and parents who are experiencing difficulties, so that we give those children a fair opportunity in life.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate, particularly as I am a Glasgow MSP.

As a Glasgow councillor for 17 years, I particularly want to commend Glasgow City Council for its efforts in successfully bidding to host this international event, which will showcase our great city and our great country.</p><p>I will let others speak about the sporting aspects of the games and the objective of increasing participation in sport, as I am sure that others are better qualified than me to talk about that. I want instead to touch on four other aspects of the games: the lessons to be learned from history about infrastructure, the ways in which we can promote Scotland to the Commonwealth, how we can use the games to enhance community cohesion, and how we can maximise the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>I welcome the update paper, &#8220;A Games Legacy for Scotland&#8221;, and the work that is being done to ensure a lasting legacy for Glasgow and Scotland.</p><p>We need only look back to the Commonwealth games in Edinburgh in 1986 to see how a potential legacy can be squandered. Meadowbank stadium is decaying and is destined for demolition. The train station across the road, which was opened specially for the games, lies empty and unused, and the tracks that once linked the stadium directly with Waverley station have been lifted. If there was a legacy of the Edinburgh games, it was civic debt, as they lost the city &#163;3 million on expenditure of &#163;14 million.</p><p>On the promotion of Scotland to the Commonwealth, I believe that the games present a great opportunity to strengthen the Scottish brand abroad, enhance the image of our country and renew friendships with other nations. I therefore welcome the partnership between VisitScotland and VisitBritain to promote Scotland during the coming Olympic year. Perhaps the minister will explain how that increased visibility can be sustained beyond the London Olympics.</p><p>On community cohesion, the Parliament will be aware that Glasgow&#8212;and Scotland more broadly&#8212;is home to many thousands of people with a connection to the Commonwealth countries. However, I have not yet heard mention of how communities can be encouraged to engage in the games and, in particular, provide support to athletes and supporters from countries with which our citizens have a link. That would help to celebrate the fact that we are one Glasgow, woven together by many diverse threads.</p><p>I feel strongly that the commercial benefits that may be gained from the games should not be solely the preserve of large, multinational corporations. The legacy update document states that Scottish businesses have won 133 of the 171 contracts that have been awarded through the Glasgow business portal. Perhaps the minister could tell us how many of those 133 contracts were won by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>I fear that small businesses find the tendering process for games contracts complex and somewhat daunting. We need to redouble our efforts in that regard and ensure that as many of our smaller firms as possible can tender for contracts, and that they can compete on a level playing field with larger companies. By ensuring that smaller firms get their fair share of the contracts, we will go a long way towards ensuring that the financial benefits of the games find their way into local communities in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland, which will give a boost to our economy.</p><p>It might be possible to engage with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to explore the possibility of bringing together councils throughout Scotland to support our potential heroes&#8212;when they are selected&#8212;by providing free use of sporting and events facilities, and even free transport if that can assist them.</p><p>The Commonwealth games present a great opportunity to promote Glasgow and Scotland to the Commonwealth, but we seek benefits for the city&#8217;s wellbeing beyond the last race in 2014. I welcome this debate as part of the process of securing that legacy.

People&#8217;s hopes and aspirations develop early on in life and if they do not get the right breaks at the right time, we suffer as a community. I was one of the very fortunate people who enjoyed education in Scotland, going to primary school for a short time, going on to secondary education, leaving without many qualifications, going overseas for employment, coming back and going to college and on to university. I am grateful for that opportunity and our young deserve those opportunities that we all cherish so much.</p><p>What is more important for society today is where we&#8212;and Scotland&#8212;go from here, what we want to aspire to and how we want to take the journey. One of the best ways of taking the journey is through education. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that education forms a very important element of development. Time and again, I see how education builds strong character and contributes to our economy in more than one way, and that is why I am very keen to see education progress in the future. Our young deserve something very important&#8212;education not only at school, but also at colleges and universities.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are shortcomings in our further education system: we have seen subjects being dropped and choice being reduced. Another important and serious question is why have we allowed that to happen and how can we change it? I keep saying to myself, negative politics is unhelpful; we need to find solutions. We have a responsibility to find solutions and if we do not come up with them, we fail our generations again and again.</p><p>I want to give a few ideas about how we might contribute, particularly through education. I genuinely believe that the British Council is not doing a fair job for Scotland. I do not think that it is engaging enough with people overseas to encourage people to come to Scotland for further education, which would help our education system. We have embassies all over the world. What are they actually doing for us? Who are they sending to Scotland? It is very important that we get those departments to account for what is happening, because unless we have investment in these industries, we will suffer and our generations will suffer, and that should not be allowed.

I continue to enjoy the services in our hotels&#8212;I call hospitals that because the only time that I get a rest is when I am in hospital. As a patient in hospital, I have noticed the tremendous work that all the people there do. Every one of our staff does tremendous work for us in what we accept are extremely difficult circumstances. I know for a fact that no member would disagree with that.</p><p>The important issue is how we retain and develop that service. I have reams of figures for all the cuts that departments face. Cuts are a reality. I have been in politics for 17 years and I have not experienced a year in which a cut has not been made. I have seen cuts and cuts. A lot of times, I have wondered when the cuts would stop. I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel&#8212;the tunnel is circular and there is no light at the end of it.</p><p>We need to start thinking outside the box and to ask how we deal with the situation. One way of dealing with it is to develop the service. We are proud that the national health service is one of the best health services in the world. We are also proud that we work with people overseas, but we have done so through token gestures and not seriously. We do not invite patients from overseas to come here, as is done in other countries. Australia, India, China and now Malaysia all sell facilities. We should look at encouraging such trade, if we are looking for new input to inject cash into our hospitals and our service. If we do not have money at home, we must look for it elsewhere. The market is global and we must compete.</p><p>At home, we have a lot of issues. We have people from 140 communities who travel all over the world and return with all sorts of challenges for us with diseases. Recently, I was in Lahore in Pakistan. It is a twin city of Glasgow, which has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Punjab Government. The Chief Minister there sent a message to the Scottish Parliament in which he asked the Parliament for assistance in dealing with dengue fever, as people out there have been challenged by a new outbreak. At a meeting there, I realised how fortunate we are to be protected by so much. However, we are also vulnerable. Developing our international links and encouraging such trade would be helpful.</p><p>I plead with the cabinet secretary&#8212;although I know that I do not have to, as I am pushing at an open door&#8212;to save the service.

First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Glasgow for electing me to represent their interests in the Scottish Parliament. It is a huge pleasure and privilege for me, as a Glasgow lad who always wanted to come to this chamber. At long last, the people of Glasgow have offered me the opportunity. I hope to do them proud.</p><p>I wish well the people who did not make it to the Parliament&#8212;whether the ex-MSPs or the new hopefuls. I also congratulate the Labour Party, because at long last it has managed to get somebody from an ethnic minority into this chamber. That is a welcome development, and I hope that the party can build on it. I hope to help the party in that aim.</p><p>I give particular thanks to all the community groups that are working so hard out there on our culture, our needs and our quality of life. Under very difficult circumstances, they do a lot of vital work for communities&#8212;the type of work that local authorities and the Parliament could not do. The amount of effort that people put into voluntary work is wonderful. I would like to thank them, and I hope that they will continue with their work.</p><p>Culture has changed in Scotland. It has moved away from being Americanised and anglicised; it has become Scottish, and more and more so. We are finding our roots. We are not just bagpipes and haggis; we have a lot more to offer from the important elements of our heritage and culture. When we talk about having one police force and one fire service, that is heritage, growth and looking forward. We are moving forward and getting our communities to come with us. We want better achievements and a quality of life that we can be proud of and can share around the world. For example, our fire service and our police force have started to train people from overseas. That is a very welcome new development. It means that we are encouraging those services to look for moneys from outwith the local authorities and the Government; they are now earning money because they have expertise to offer.</p><p>Sometimes we forget that we are a nation of inventors. Historically, we have done great and wonderful things, and we now need to embed that idea in our youth. We have a huge bank of expertise and young talent in this country&#8212;people who are itching to get on and do something. We want to build our economy, and the only way we will do that will be to give people opportunity. That is incumbent on us: we have to find new ways of encouraging young people. We do not wish our young people just to give up, so we must establish something for them.</p><p>One way of doing that will be to deal with our traditional friends. We Scots have many wonderful relationships around the world, and I will mention a few places with which we have worked historically: Bahrain, China, Indonesia, India, Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Those are all people with whom we have worked, and we need to welcome them back to Scotland. I think that they have forgotten where we are. We need to tell them where we are and that we are open for business. We need to tell them that we are here as their friends and that we wish to work with them.</p><p>The work of our universities and colleges has been very encouraging. They have done tremendous work in promoting Scotland as a destination for education and expertise. They have shown dynamism for Scotland, but we sometimes forget that our universities and colleges need support. They do something that the Parliament perhaps cannot do&#8212;they can form one-to-one engagements with our friends overseas. They can encourage them to continue to come to this country as a destination for quality education. Also, while they are out there doing that job, they can promote Scotland as a destination for development, for industry and for inventions. We are open for business; this is the gateway to the new world.</p><p>We want our young people to be proud of us and of themselves, and the only way that we will achieve that is by ensuring that they recognise where their roots are, what their culture is, what their nation is and how they can make this country alive again. We need something that is bubbling, and that is going to happen only if we stimulate our industry and our economy by working with people.</p><p>It is important that the countries that I have mentioned realise that we are genuinely open for business and want to come and engage with us. We will also go to them if they want us to go there. We need to do that.</p><p>We are an industrial nation, not an agricultural nation; we need to have industry and to manufacture. We need to do things that will stimulate our economy, and the best way forward is through bringing our people together with us.</p><p>I am encouraged by a lot of what the cabinet secretary said, but I would like the Government to get our young people, our institutions and our colleges and universities more involved. We need to involve private industry, in particular. We must support our industries to encourage our economy.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649457", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Culture and External Affairs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
