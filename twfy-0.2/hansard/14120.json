I thank Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland for submitting the petition, and I thank the clerks, Dr Sarah Nelson, who acted as the committee&#8217;s adviser, and all the witnesses who provided both written and oral evidence for consideration. In particular, I thank those young people who provided written evidence on their experiences. Without that evidence, we might have missed a vital element of what we are trying to do, not only as a Parliament but as a society, to address the issues.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland called for new research into the nature and scope of child sexual exploitation in Scotland. The petition was considered at a time when there was a national spotlight on high-profile cases, with allegations of child sexual exploitation being investigated. The minister referred to the Savile inquiry, but at the time there were also national press reports of cases in towns and cities in England and elsewhere.</p><p>The committee noted that a number of working groups have been established, with researchers commencing work on the issue, but we still felt that it was important for the committee to take on the issue and carry out its own investigation in order to add to the debate and to identify cross-cutting issues without referring the petition on to the Education and Sport Committee, the Justice Committee or whoever else. The committee considered ways in which to fully investigate the issues behind the petition, and we felt that they required a detailed inquiry and a committee report to be presented to the Parliament.</p><p>The issue under discussion&#8212;child sexual exploitation&#8212;is not an easy subject area to address, nor is it straightforward to find a solution to it. Good practice is taking place in Scotland, but it is disjointed and there is a lack of key agencies taking a leadership role. As has been stated, it is not a comfortable subject, but the role of a Parliament and its committees is to highlight wrongdoing and demand action when appropriate, especially if that involves protecting victims.</p><p>The availability of data is critical to this difficult subject area, as was noted by the national working group for sexually exploited children and young people when it visited Scotland in October 2013. It reported that estimates gained from agencies showed that the number of young people accessing services could be anything from 64 to 300 annually. It also found much concern about underreporting, and I share that disquiet.</p><p>As other members have stated, the committee recommends that</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish Government should develop a National Strategy for tackling child sexual exploitation&#8221;.</p><p>Such a strategy must bring together the different departments of Government to tackle the issue in the most appropriate way.</p><p>The Scottish Government commissioned the University of Bedfordshire to continue its work of piloting and monitoring its self-evaluation tool with a local authority. The committee&#8217;s work in that area highlights the need for some direct action, especially in relation to young people in residential care. We heard that there are intrinsic risks for looked-after children, and evidence that was provided by Who Cares? Scotland highlighted that</p><p>&#8220;The issue becomes about the young person rather than about the perpetrators who are involved with them.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 11 June 2013; c 1433.]</p><p>That raises issues about the powers that exist to protect young people, which require further clarification particularly with regard to looked-after children and the stigma that is associated with such exploitation. The committee&#8217;s recommendation that</p><p>&#8220;the Care Inspectorate should make CSE a detailed area of inspection for local authorities and all organisations that accommodate children&#8221;</p><p>is therefore to be welcomed.</p><p>Other members referred to the serious issues around protecting vulnerable young people. I have no doubt that the associated media coverage of the sexual abuse and exploitation of young people in recent months has shone a light on the darker parts of society, which are frankly shocking and at times difficult to believe.</p><p>The case studies with which Barnardo&#8217;s and Eighteen and Under provided the committee detail the serious problems that are associated with looked-after children. The committee&#8217;s report highlights the common perception that CSE involves female victims and male perpetrators. The committee is well aware that there are male victims&#8212;indeed, the convener mentioned a young male victim of sexual exploitation in his opening speech&#8212;but it also noted Professor Stalker&#8217;s evidence, which showed that</p><p>&#8220;boys are disproportionately represented among disabled children and young people who had been abused&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 29 October 2013; c 1749.]</p><p>in comparison with their representation among abused young people without disabilities.</p><p>I draw the minister&#8217;s attention to the committee&#8217;s recommendation on reporting where it is identified that young disabled children have been sexually abused. That information is not normally entered in official records, so we are asking that those records be updated and the evidence entered to give a fuller picture of the way in which young disabled children are dealt with.</p><p>One of the committee&#8217;s key recommendations is</p><p>&#8220;that development of a national strategy takes account of young men as a particular target group.&#8221;</p><p>Although we found the evidence difficult to listen to, our experience in no way compares with the suffering that some of our young people in Scotland have to endure daily. More work with front-line voluntary sector organisations is needed, because the evidence from such organisations was compelling, and the work that they do often goes unrecognised by statutory agencies.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to raise awareness of the fact that more must be done to reduce instances of child sexual exploitation, and&#8212;more importantly&#8212;to bring an end to such exploitation in Scotland. I welcome the work of the minister and the Scottish Government, but more needs to be done to ensure that we rid society of this crime and that perpetrators are dealt with in the most appropriate manner. I welcome the committee&#8217;s report.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Public Petitions Committee since 2008, I found the petition one of the most challenging that I have faced, given the subject matter that we discussed.

Every member will have their own experiences of dealing with constituents with debt problems. Some might be having trouble maintaining their home or paying their bills, while others might be suffering financially from the present financial situation or as a result of, say, relationship breakdown.</p><p>The bill builds on existing statutory debt solutions and previous legislation. It is worth observing that the trend in pursuing one statutory debt solution&#8212;namely the debt arrangement scheme&#8212;has been growing. Demand for the scheme has clearly increased between 2005 and 2012, with more debtors taking it up, and it is now becoming a common feature of society. I am sure that all of us will have heard the radio and seen the television advertisements for it, and I have no doubt that it has contributed to the 14.7 per cent decrease in personal insolvencies.</p><p>Many people would like to pay what they owe, but the situation gets ahead of them. It would perhaps surprise a lot of people that those who fall into debt are not always the type of people who our normal prejudices would suggest. I know people who can run the finances of firms and their work extremely well, but when it comes to personal finance, it is another matter&#8212;there can be a bit of a blind spot.</p><p>There is no doubt that, as a result of recent tough economic times, people who could once service and manage debt are finding it increasingly difficult to do so. In many respects, we are dealing with a society that is changing over the years and experiencing structural changes, but it is important to recognise that the Scottish Government is attempting to tackle these matters head on.</p><p>I am reassured that the desire to provide compulsory money advice and the requirement for financial education are at the heart of the bill. Such support is invaluable for those who find themselves floundering in a sea of financial troubles. Nigel Don referred to the fact that financial education is a requirement for a modern Scotland if we are to progress as a nation. I also support Nigel Don in saying that the Scottish Government&#8217;s description of the bill as a financial health service should be considered apt.</p><p>The trend for credit card companies to consistently take minimum payments from customers creates a situation in which overall debt takes significantly longer to reduce. The home-owning democracy and credit boom that have been promoted in Scotland since the 1980s have come at a price, especially in times of financial downturn. As I have stated, debt levels have increased. That can be attributed to rising demands, whether from finance agreements or energy costs. Real wages have not increased correspondingly in recent times.</p><p>In many instances, there has been real concern that the processes involved in bankruptcy have been unnecessarily bureaucratic and that, although those in the know will have a good idea of how to protect themselves, the ordinary debtor can be at a loss and may not always know who to turn to.</p><p>As I have stated, we all know about constituents who are, frankly, at their wits&#8217; end and have resorted to ignoring phone calls or not opening mail when debts have been passed to enforcement companies. Being confronted by correspondence from enforcement companies or phone calls to employers, which a Labour colleague mentioned earlier, can be very intimidating, particularly for vulnerable people, and can lead to further health and social problems.</p><p>Lenders need to be aware of the demands from those in the wider community, who own many of the financial institutions as taxpayers. Those same institutions want action to pursue their debts.</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee stage 1 report quite rightly invites the prospect of both the UK and Scottish Governments having discussions with the financial sector on increasing contributions from the industry for debt advice. It is important that, in that report, the committee supported the idea of completeness across debt solutions. That is an important principle. People who are in debt are not stupid, but they need to make informed decisions. The need to find the right solution that tackles the debt management issue should be enshrined in legislation.</p><p>On capacity issues for those who offer advice to people, including money advisers, it is important that minimum standards are maintained for the consumer. I am reassured that the bill&#8217;s intention is to support people in paying their debts while recognising the events that lead to financial difficulty. A balance has to be struck that protects creditors with respect to debtors acquiring additional assets, with a procedure put in place to make it easier for the case to be reopened.</p><p>The bill has received broad support from practitioners such as Money Advice Scotland and the Association of British Credit Unions Ltd. I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to the issue, and it is worth highlighting that the Accountant in Bankruptcy expects to be able to meet the associated costs from within its existing budget.</p><p>I ask Labour members to reconsider their opposition to the bill at stage 1 and to use the opportunity at stage 2 to lodge amendments that they feel would be relevant to the bill&#8217;s progress.</p><p>I welcome the stage 1 debate and the broad principles that are contained in the bill, and I look forward to the bill making the necessary progress through the Parliament and affording the necessary protection to those who are genuinely trying to tackle debt issues.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22817002", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this stage 1 debate on the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill.

It is one of those debates that are like Edinburgh Corporation buses: three come along in a week. I am grateful to Kezia Dugdale for her members&#8217; business debate last Thursday lunch time, which was part of the overall discussion about how we deal with debt in Scotland.</p><p>The debate also acknowledges the important work that the Scottish Government undertakes, not least with its 12 days of debtmas campaign. It is vital that the role of credit unions and the approach that they take are considered in contrast to the approach of payday lending firms.</p><p>The thrust of the campaign is people not being pressured, especially at this time of year, into taking out expensive loans&#8212;especially high-interest, short-term loans&#8212;at the expense of good financial decision making. Only last week, the Office of Communications stated that television viewers were exposed to nearly 400,000 payday loan adverts last year alone. In 2011, there were 243,000 such adverts, but, within the space of a year, that increased by 64 per cent.</p><p>The Scottish Government campaign at this festive period is therefore essential in offering serious balance and engaging with the public. Furthermore, according to the minister&#8217;s speech in the debate this afternoon, almost 18,000 people have visited the campaign website, with almost 1,300 having engaged in internet searches for their local credit unions.</p><p>It is important that the Financial Conduct Authority, which takes over the regulation of payday loans in April, examines advertising, especially pester power. Ofcom stated that, on average, children watched more than 70 adverts from payday lenders.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that credit unions have evolved over the years and that they are expanding and growing. I come to the debate having witnessed at first hand the work that they do in Central Scotland. I regularly try to meet up with credit unions throughout Central Scotland during the year to find out what new developments are taking place.</p><p>The work that credit unions do in Central Scotland is assisted by the fact that they can demonstrate a real difference for many communities and get people, especially those in deprived areas, to develop the savings habits that are necessary for, and consistent with, good credit union practice, in contrast to the position of payday lenders.</p><p>Credit unions need the necessary framework to develop in a practical sense. They are distinct bodies. There are both large and small credit unions in nature and operation. We must ensure that smaller credit unions are given the necessary support to provide the assistance that their current and future members need and to deliver real benefits to those who need them.</p><p>Furthermore, when we talk about necessary expansion and more services being offered, we must acknowledge that volunteers and staff in credit unions need to be upskilled to meet the requirements of the growing sector.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22817122", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: 12 Days of Debtmas Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members across political parties who signed my motion and are here to listen to the debate.

I understand that the Scottish league of credit unions has been discussing such a matter with the Scottish Qualifications Authority and hopes to move that forward in the new year.</p><p>The sector in this country is relatively small compared with the sectors in the United States and Australia, where credit unions serve almost a third of the country&#8217;s population. It is to be welcomed that many employers support their employees&#8217; credit union membership. I know that a good many employers do that here, but the approach needs to be promoted more robustly. The potential of credit unions has been recognised by both Scottish and United Kingdom Governments, which have emphasised the role that they can play in countering payday loan companies.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work that credit unions do in encouraging people to save and take out loans with them, offering a real alternative to expensive payday loan lenders. Figures from StepChange Debt Charity show that the average monthly income of a StepChange client in Scotland is &#163;1,190 compared to the average payday loan debt of &#163;1,400. That level of monthly repayments leaves people with no money to live on and pushes them further into debt. It must be remembered that behind those statistics there is a human face to the financial pressures.</p><p>Credit unions can take a longer-term view, rather than offer a short-term fix, when compared with the approach of the existing banks and building societies. Glasgow Credit Union has recognised the real problems in the traditional banking sector and is now able to offer mortgages to its members that are tailored to second steppers. That relates to the point that Kezia Dugdale raised. Not all credit unions have the financial wherewithal to provide such loans, and we must cater for both large and small credit unions.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s new banking strategy recognises that credit unions can and should compete with commercial banks in the financial services sector. I am aware that the regulation of financial services is a reserved matter. Nevertheless, the Scottish Government clearly has a role in developing solutions, particularly with regard to legal matters that have an impact on credit unions, and in ensuring that the partnership role is maintained.</p><p>I recognise the good work that is being undertaken by credit unions throughout Central Scotland and beyond, and I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government has placed a high priority on assisting credit unions to deliver not only an alternative but mainstream financial provision that will assist many communities throughout Scotland.

If my memory serves me correctly, the first debate in which I spoke was on housing. I welcome any debate that allows for greater discussion and scrutiny of the issue of housing.</p><p>In many ways, the current direction of housing was set by the Scottish Government in its discussion paper in 2010, &#8220;Housing: Fresh Thinking, New Ideas.&#8221; When we examine housing and the issues surrounding it, we need to consider the historical context. Over the past 30 years, the UK Government has repeated policies of large-scale voluntary stock transfers, which have produced many changes in the provision of social housing.</p><p>Moreover, there was a constant push by the two Liberal-Labour Administrations in Scotland towards large-scale voluntary stock transfers of housing stock being marketed as community ownership. Some might say that that was pushing the model of community ownership a bit too far. In fact, we had Wendy Alexander, as a Labour housing minister, pushing for the right to buy to be extended to housing associations.</p><p>The critique offered by Labour&#8217;s motion chimes with a well-worn theme developed previously. There was criticism that the housing association grant has been reduced. Richard Baker just referred to the HAG. I remind members that the grant is a public subsidy. When it first came into existence, it was not supposed to be there for ever and a day. Throughout the previous Liberal-Labour Administration, it was on a downward path. There needs to be recognition that the Scottish Government&#8217;s capital budget was reduced in substantial terms by the UK coalition Government, hence the reason for looking at these budgets and the HAG funding that is being made available to housing associations and others.</p><p>That issue ties up with the wider issue of housing affordability. People cannot afford rents at the current rates in the private rented sector. Patrick Harvie alluded to that. The current financial climate brings more financial pressure to those in the private sector who are trying to keep a roof over their head. More people are applying to council housing waiting lists and looking to social housing to get a roof over their heads. In that respect, I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government, through various discussion papers, has highlighted fairer rents, although rent setting is limited in many respects to the landlords from whom individuals rent their homes.</p><p>Additionally, it is worth noting that the community growth area where I live, which was proposed in 2006 by private developers, is finally going out to consultation this month. The possibility of delivering 2,600 private houses in an area of essential housing need has been continually delayed by local authority inaction and failure to sit down with the developers and discuss the issues surrounding the developments. In relation to house building, we must consider what is hampering such developments, including the issue of the international financial crisis and the effects of the situation that we faced in 2008. There are housing developers who have been keen to move forward and develop housing but who have been hampered because local authorities have not had the vision to take on those developments and look at how they can assist house builders to go ahead.</p><p>The Scottish Government does not operate in a policy vacuum. Scotland is severely constrained under the current devolved settlement. That is even more apparent in respect of the benefit changes that have been announced by the UK Government since its emergency budget in June 2010 and almost every subsequent financial statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. A more responsive and effective welfare system is not helped by arbitrary changes in the benefits system, such as the so-called bedroom tax.</p><p>I will address Alex Johnstone&#8217;s point about the wonderful policies pursued by successive Conservative Governments. The right-to-buy legislation that was introduced in 1979&#8212;it is actively promoted and supported by some in this chamber&#8212;has meant increased waiting lists for social housing since the legislation was enacted. That has clearly had an impact on the achievement of homelessness targets that were set for local authorities under housing legislation.</p><p>It is important that we advocate a position of tenure neutrality. In Scotland, we have had for far too long a tenure policy rather than a fully structured housing policy. Only now, with the changes that the present Scottish Government has made to the right to buy, might we get an influential game changer that will assist people now and in future generations.</p><p>I welcome the debate&#8212;[Interruption.] Does Duncan McNeil want to intervene?</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22784886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Since I was elected, and despite what the Labour Party states in its motion, it should be noted that the Scottish Government has brought numerous housing debates to the chamber.

The organisation is run by the community and has a small dedicated staff team of one full-time worker and a couple of part-time workers, who bring together 120 volunteers. Those volunteers deliver a community cafe, which in 2013 had more than 12,000 visits. The cafe also helps with the delivery of meals to elderly and vulnerable people in the community, which assists more than 180 people to live independently in the community.</p><p>The organisation has delivered a village park play area, which was a &#163;0.5 million project that the council said could not be done. That project was designed and delivered by the community on behalf of the children and teenagers in the community. The body also organises four events a year, including a gala day. This Saturday, there will be the switching on of the Christmas lights in the village square. It also operates an autumn group, of which I am a member, as it is open to anybody over the age of 50. It also assists young people to complete the Duke of Edinburgh awards and creates employment opportunities for people who live in the area.</p><p>The organisation delivers training courses, with more than 60 local people participating in first aid, flexible learning, information technology and catering skills courses. Those opportunities are opened up to community members and allow people to apply for employment in other areas. The organisation also delivers community transport in the village and the surrounding area.

It seems a bit like groundhog day, but I would be happy to have a debate on the issue every day if it meant that we could eradicate poverty.</p><p>As someone who formerly worked for the Poverty Alliance and who experienced childhood poverty, I recognise the issues that many people are facing. I know that poverty is unacceptable in modern 21st century Scotland, so in many ways it is sad that we find ourselves discussing the subject when its awful reality and associated consequences should have been despatched to history.</p><p>I am aware that, over the years, members from around the chamber have initiated debates on poverty. I remember the time that a good friend of Jackie Baillie&#8212;one John Park&#8212;quite rightly made reference to the fact that while politicians talk about in-work poverty, people in the real world talk about trying to make ends meet.</p><p>Poverty should not be underestimated, as it has a lasting impact on our children&#8217;s educational achievement and it results in failure to develop Scotland&#8217;s potential for growth, especially as regards people&#8217;s individual progress. In the most deprived areas of Scotland, 11 per cent of pupils leave school without any qualifications, whereas the figure for the rest of Scotland is 3 per cent.</p><p>The factors that drive poverty are diverse, but more challenging than ever. For far too long, we have relied on various welfare to work schemes&#8212;or should I say workfare, to use the phrase that is being used this week&#8212;to somehow solve poverty without there being a real rise in the incomes of those who are in or out of employment.</p><p>Poverty is wasteful, because the problems that it creates mean that we as a society regularly try to catch up, and we create projects of various types to tackle the symptoms instead of the root causes. One of the strengths of Scottish Government policy with regard to poverty in the recent past is the acknowledgment that poverty is multifaceted. It is quite right that that emphasis be acknowledged.</p><p>It is a poor indicator of society that we have, in my lifetime, had soup kitchens and the creation of food banks to distribute food parcels. I record my thanks to and appreciation of the various organisations that gather food and distribute it to those who are most in need, but the reality is that we should not have to do that. The income levels of those households should be sufficient to live on and survive without depending on handouts from charitable organisations.</p><p>Constituents and some employers keep telling me that there is confusion about the living wage and the national minimum wage and about why the figures vary so much. In yesterday&#8217;s debate, we raised the issue of how the living wage could bring in for households a meaningful income that would allow them to survive. I am not saying that that income would be handsome, but it would be a step in the right direction to securing the prosperity of households.</p><p>I am the convener of the cross-party group on credit unions and recognise the good work that credit unions do in encouraging people to save and take loans with them, particularly in the light of Jackie Baillie&#8217;s comment about payday loan companies and the problems that they currently cause.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s new economic strategy recognises that opportunities should be created for all Scotland&#8217;s people to flourish. I hope that the national performance framework, which has cross-party support, can assist in reducing the income gaps in our society and provide better social cohesion.</p><p>I thank the organisations that continue to advance the campaign to eradicate poverty, and I highlight their useful contributions to the debate on tackling poverty. I wish them every success in the campaign to eradicate poverty as quickly as possible, and look forward to the day when we can show that we have resolved the issue of poverty in Scotland once and for all.</p><p>I congratulate Jackie Baillie once again on securing the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698430", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Challenge Poverty Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jackie Baillie on securing the debate.

I realise that today&#8217;s debate follows on from a well-developed theme that was unveiled to the public and Labour Party members at the Labour Party conference in Brighton last week. However, today&#8217;s debate also comes a day after the latest increase in the national minimum wage, which has increased by 12p an hour&#8212;in percentage terms an increase of 1.9 per cent.</p><p>This is an important debate because it shows that the crisis centred on the cost of living leads to a wider discussion about economic growth and what type of society we want to live in. The growing inequality in our society that has been encouraged over recent decades has had a particular impact on those families and individuals who are on the lowest incomes and who suffer the worst effects of poverty.</p><p>I had to pinch myself last week when I realised how times have changed. I remember as part of my previous employment attending meetings of the Trades Union Congress national minimum wage enforcement group, where we discussed with officers from the Inland Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions how the minimum wage might impact on people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>I also remember being phoned in 2006 by consultants who asked me who I thought would be the best person as incoming chair of the Low Pay Commission. I suggested Rodney Bickerstaffe&#8212;in 2006, the Labour Party was still in power&#8212;because I felt that it would be better to have someone with a real commitment to both low-paid families and the national minimum wage. Unfortunately, the then Labour Government decided that Rodney Bickerstaffe was not the person to lead the Low Pay Commission. Instead, the Government once again appointed someone from the private sector to take on the role. The Low Pay Commission has an important role in setting the national minimum wage, but that role has been hampered by business interests, with their dead hand, ensuring that the minimum wage does not rise in line with the commitments that have been given by the Scottish Government to introduce the living wage for every worker in the government service.</p><p>I made a genuine intervention during Jackie Baillie&#8217;s speech about the setting of the minimum wage. The minimum wage was &#163;3.60 an hour when it was introduced. The trade union movement at the time asked for a rate of &#163;5 an hour, but that was rejected. If we do the calculations using the higher figure, we can see that, if the increases had had the same impact since the minimum wage was introduced, we would now be discussing a minimum wage in excess of &#163;7 an hour. That would have a real impact on people on low incomes.</p><p>I find myself more surprised that, according to well-informed commentators, even the present number 10 policy unit realises that any economic growth will not make an impact on all sectors and areas of the economy, particularly for those in low-paid employment. There is even talk of number 10 seriously wanting to examine the possibility of increasing the national minimum wage. As is always the case in British politics, however, the dead hand of the Treasury is apparently resisting such an attempt.</p><p>As some members will know, I had a members&#8217; business debate at the start of September on the Oxfam report, &#8220;Our Economy&#8221;. One of the many striking statistics in that report referred to the past 25 years, when the incomes of the top 1 per cent of earners in the UK increased by up to 117 per cent in real terms, compared with an increase of just 47 per cent for the poorest 10 per cent.</p><p>On the issue of energy prices, I have previously stated in the chamber that ordinary consumers have not so far been best served by the current marketplace for energy, particularly electricity. In the period since 2004, there has been an increase of more than 60 per cent in electricity bills. Along with others, I recognised back in May 2011 that the big six energy companies needed to be held to account by the public for their continual price hikes, particularly in light of the impact that they have on low-income households and on tackling fuel poverty. It was important for the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, of which I was a member at the time, to scrutinise that issue and the pricing behaviour of the energy companies.</p><p>At present, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets does not have the power to peg energy prices. I welcome Ed Miliband&#8217;s commitment to peg those prices if he gets into power, but we have a real opportunity to make changes next year and to set the agenda for the future of Scotland, tackling the real issues of deprivation and poverty and ending once and for all the situation that we have encountered as part of this better together great union that is the United Kingdom. The policies of the past 20 to 30 years have not had a real impact on people living in poverty. When we see fuel poverty increasing today, we must question whether or not there is another way. That other way is a choice for the people of Scotland next year to take real powers into their own hands and get a Government that is prepared to deliver on policies that benefit everyone in society, not just the 1 per cent of top earners.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to debate the Labour Party motion on the cost of living.

I should also point out that, at the beginning of the year, I had the opportunity to meet at the Pearce Institute in Glasgow representatives of certain organisations&#8212;Tea in the Pot and GalGael&#8212;that are mentioned in Oxfam&#8217;s &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; report. I found the discussion enlightening and the report reflects a number of issues that were raised with the Local Government and Regeneration Committee.</p><p>I welcome those in the gallery who are listening to this debate and thank all members from all political parties who signed my motion and allowed the debate to take place. Although my interest in tackling poverty is of long standing, it has been strengthened by Oxfam&#8217;s work in this area, especially its &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; report. In many ways, this debate is important in that it not only examines the economy in a traditional sense with reference to economic growth but highlights the vital point that growth and trickle-down economics are not reaching everyone in society, particularly those on the lowest incomes and suffering from poverty&#8217;s most debilitating effects.</p><p>For example, the report refers to the fact that, over the past 25 years, the top 1 per cent of United Kingdom earners have had real-terms income increases of up to 117 per cent while the incomes of the poorest 10 per cent have increased by only 47 per cent. The report highlights the need for a new vision of prosperity, underlining its arguments with approaches taken by various Governments and Oxfam partners around the globe and recognising the requirement to look beyond gross domestic product.</p><p>We must also ensure that community empowerment is not just a slogan that is utilised when we want to impose top-down community engagement. The fact is that society has evolved over the years. However, like the report, we need to recognise that the economic orthodoxy is failing many of our people and communities.</p><p>The gaps in equality are not just the result of people not working hard. As the report highlights, more than 40 per cent of those who live in poverty are in work. As I have stated in the chamber on numerous occasions, a step change is required in tackling the blight of in-work poverty. As the report highlights, in-work poverty as a proportion of all poverty in Scotland is on the increase. The number of people in in-work poverty has grown from around 255,000 to 280,000.</p><p>I come to the debate from a background of involvement in the voluntary sector, but I have also witnessed first hand the work of various agencies that have operated in Central Scotland to try to alleviate poverty. Some of those organisations have been very successful in creating opportunities for communities, but it is clear that others have failed to deliver. Where there have been issues about the success or otherwise of those organisations, we must allow communities the space and opportunity to learn from the mistakes and move forward.</p><p>It is significant that the idea of a living wage, which I have previously debated in the chamber, is gaining traction. Recent research by the Jimmy Reid Foundation quite rightly sums up the difficulty when it says that the issue is</p><p>&#8220;not a problem of high taxes but of low pay&#8221;.</p><p>As the &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; report details, businesses in the United Kingdom that pay below the living wage cost society between &#163;5.9 billion and &#163;6.3 billion a year in extra benefits and lost taxation. One need only look at the role of Barclays Bank, which is not normally a financial institution that I would rush to praise, in implementing the living wage in London.</p><p>On financial institutions, the financial crisis that developed over five years ago has meant a need to develop real alternatives, such as credit unions, to provide an alternative to payday loans. The work that credit unions do in Central Scotland demonstrates the difference that they can make in many communities. They help to get people, especially in deprived areas, to develop their own solutions rather than fall prey to doorstep lenders or payday loan companies. People talk about community empowerment. That is real action.</p><p>The difficulty is that some communities or interest groups can lobby better than others. There needs to better monitoring of how public moneys are spent and where they deliver the desired outputs for the communities that they are supposed to serve.</p><p>The co-operative sector is small in Scotland compared with other European countries, but that was not always the case. Strong mutual businesses such as building societies had a sturdy community ethos but were lost to many communities because of financial greed. As businesses, co-operatives and social enterprises can and should take a more long-term view rather than be short term in their approach, and they should not try to mirror the private sector.</p><p>As has been stated previously, it is vital that we as a society do not repeat the same mistakes and that we start to learn from the past. Regeneration should not involve just looking at the physical built environment. There may well be a point in building new houses, but the basic community structure needs to be in place. A relevant focus should be placed on community or localism, as some people in another place would put it. However, that may well lead us into another and more substantial debate about what we actually mean by &#8220;community&#8221;.</p><p>I recognise the good work that Oxfam is doing throughout various communities in Scotland and throughout the world. In particular, I welcome its contribution in stimulating the debate on the future direction of Scotland and addressing the issues of deprivation and poverty that many thousands of individuals and families face. &#8220;Our Economy: Towards a new prosperity&#8221; is the starting point for many of us to re-examine what we want to achieve in a prosperous independent Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695616", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oxfam&#8217;s &#8220;Our Economy&#8221; Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I draw members&#8217; attention to my declaration in the register of members&#8217; interests.

I am glad to say that we are joined by members of the cross-party group, who are sitting in the gallery and listening with interest to the debate.</p><p>The growth of credit unions throughout Scotland is, in itself, noteworthy. There are now 108 credit unions and, since 2007, there has been a significant growth in membership of 47 per cent. That goes to show that the debate is important in many ways.</p><p>The expansion of credit unions not only highlights the vital role that they play but underlines the approach that the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments have taken in recognising that the community banking sector needs to be placed on an equal footing with its equivalents around the globe.</p><p>Although credit unions have evolved over the years, it is important to recognise, as the credit union expansion project does, that a step change is required. The Department for Work and Pensions has contracted the Association of British Credit Unions Ltd&#8212;which is more commonly known as ABCUL&#8212;to modernise credit unions, in effect, by growing them through achievable monthly growth targets and new savings products.</p><p>It is significant that the expansion project will be staged. For example, the Scottish credit unions that are currently taking part in phase 1 of the project include 1st Alliance (Ayrshire) Credit Union and Pollok Credit Union, and further credit unions will join the project on 1 August and 1 November this year.</p><p>The work that credit unions do in central Scotland can be demonstrated. They have made a real difference in communities by getting people&#8212;especially in deprived areas&#8212;to develop the savings habit. However, the report that Civitas issued at the start of the week underlined that much more work needs to be undertaken on growth. The credit union movement needs to grow because it is relatively small in comparison with the sector both in the USA, where credit unions serve a third of the country&#8217;s population, and in other countries. In the USA, many employers offer credit union membership as a condition of employment.</p><p>The potential of credit unions has been recognised by the Scottish and UK Governments, which have emphasised their role in countering the payday loan companies and many high street retailers that charge annual percentage rates that are well above the 29.9 per cent that store cards charge.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work that credit unions do in encouraging people to save and to take out affordable loans. They serve as a long-term alternative to the expensive payday loan lenders and high street retailers. It is worth saying that the Office of Fair Trading has been criticised as &#8220;ineffective&#8221; by Westminster&#8217;s Public Accounts Committee when it comes to payday loan companies, as only two such companies have had their lending licences revoked.</p><p>For many families and individuals who live on low incomes, credit unions are a cornerstone in the development of viable alternatives to financial services providers such as banks. As strong mutual businesses, credit unions can take a longer-term view, rather than the short-termist approach that traditional banks and building societies take.</p><p>Recent research by Lloyds Banking Group highlighted the problems that second-steppers are having in the mortgage market. It found that they could not move on and were trapped in their first-time-buyer home. It noted that many people are being forced to borrow from their parents&#8212;otherwise known as the bank of mum and dad&#8212;to fund their deposits. Glasgow Credit Union has recognised the problem and is offering a mortgage that is tailored specifically to second-steppers.</p><p>In its new banking strategy, the Scottish Government recognises that credit unions can compete with commercial banks in the financial services sector but, as the think tank Civitas has highlighted, there is also a need to recognise that credit unions often make a loss on loans of less than &#163;1,000, because of the administration fees that are applied.</p><p>Although there is a need for credit unions to develop stronger levels of participation, as was agreed in the &#163;38 million credit union expansion project, it is still vital that the ethos of credit unions and mutuality is not lost. We have seen the demise of building societies and the recent developments at the Co-operative Bank, which took on large loan debts from Britannia Building Society and is now facing the consequences of that deal. Those situations highlight a worrying fear.</p><p>I know that the regulation of financial services is a reserved matter. Although the Scottish Government can clearly play a role in developing solutions, especially with regard to legal issues, the fact that the issue is reserved has an impact on credit unions and on ensuring that they can maintain their partnership role.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work of credit unions not only in central Scotland but throughout the whole of Scotland. The fact that they are decentralised and based on mutuality means that they retain a focus that other financial services providers seem to have misplaced.</p><p>I note and welcome the high priority that the Scottish Government has placed on credit unions delivering not only alternative but mainstream financial provision to assist many low-income communities. They offer a real alternative to the multinational banking system that is currently in crisis. We have to give people, particularly those in low-income communities throughout Scotland, the opportunity not only to save but to borrow in a way that is credible and which gives them rates that they can afford and a sense of security.</p><p>We must take forward the credit unions&#8217; case. I hope that the Scottish Government will work alongside ABCUL and others to ensure that there is real growth in Scotland&#8217;s credit union sector and that local communities can make us proud by engaging in what is a real alternative to the payday loan companies and others who make their fortunes out of the poor and those on low incomes.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694240", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Credit Union Expansion Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members from across all the political parties who signed my motion to allow the debate to take place.

I have a particular interest in the subject as a member of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which recently took evidence from the minister on the issue. During the meeting with the committee, the minister gave some insight into the finer detail of the proposals and was able to offer us some useful assurances on the direction and focus of the development of the SPP and NPF3.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to praise the minister on the decision to consider NPF3 and the SPP in tandem. I am sure that I am not the only one who has become bogged down in the ever-more confusing raft of planning legislation and guidelines when dealing with constituency cases. Efforts to co-ordinate guidelines will undoubtedly&#8212;I hope&#8212;bring greater clarity.</p><p>With regard to NPF3, I commend the focus in the draft that has been placed on economic benefits and jobs during consideration of proposed developments. It is important to place economic factors at the heart of all major decisions, particularly during this time of austerity.</p><p>I also welcome the nod to the regeneration of town centres, although, as I highlighted to the minister during a committee meeting in May, I caution that proposing major new developments might conflict with the Scottish planning policy&#8217;s focus on existing town centre regeneration, which Anne McTaggart has just highlighted. In particular, I note that the proposals for Ravenscraig, for example, might conflict with the Scottish planning policy. In fact, the developments would effectively create a new town that would bridge the geographical gap between the existing towns of Motherwell and Wishaw, which could create greater problems for those towns. I raised that point with the minister at the committee meeting in May, and noted that the current proposals for the Ravenscraig development include housing, education facilities and the possibility of a new retail centre.</p><p>I appreciate that the proposed developments will bring massive benefits to communities throughout the central belt, but so too would developing areas that have, throughout recent years, suffered significant decline. I am not suggesting that we halt all major new developments, but any potential conflict should be ironed out in the new framework, and a better balance found.</p><p>During the minister&#8217;s appearance at the committee, I also sought assurances that the guidance that was issued in December will be more precise about how planning authorities make decisions. For example, I noted that autonomous decision-making between local authority areas has, at times, been inconsistent, particularly around the erection of wind turbines. That leads to confusion and uncertainty for people who live in communities on the borders of neighbouring authorities. Clarity for all concerned is crucial as NPF3 and the SPP are taken forward.</p><p>I was pleased to hear from the minister that the Scottish Government will work with community council liaison officers and Planning Aid for Scotland to ensure that communities are provided with the help and support that they need to engage fully in the planning system. We are, however, not just talking about communities. It is essential that all who are involved in the planning process, from the Scottish Government to local authority planning departments and developers, work closely together to bring about the speedy disposal of planning applications. The creation of a more cohesive and inclusive approach to the planning process will bring about better efficiency and decision making with minimal delays.</p><p>I highlight that point by talking about a discussion that I had with a developer last Friday about an area that has been identified as a community growth area. The developer has been having problems in meeting not the planning department of a local authority but other departments to identify the community gain and obligations that will be on the developer when they go ahead. That is leading to delays in building houses. We need to ensure that local authorities work collectively with developers so that such developments can go ahead speedily for the economic benefit of all concerned.</p><p>A good approach to planning can bring many benefits at national and local levels. Bringing planning policy back to communities is an important step forward. The publication of the &#8220;National Planning Framework 3&#8212;Main Issues Report and Draft Framework&#8221; in April 2013, prior to NPF3 being put out for consultation, is a step in the right direction that provides an avenue through which communities that will be affected by proposed national developments can at an early stage make known their opinions.</p><p>The fact that NPF3 and the SPP are being put out to consultation simultaneously will, I hope, prove to be cost effective and might limit consultation fatigue, as well as going a long way towards ensuring a more cohesive approach as we move forward. The minister must bring confidence to all those who are affected by planning decisions that their views are heard and taken on board prior to decisions being made.</p><p>I thank all the organisations that have contributed to the debate and look forward over the coming months to further discussions on the issues that have been raised today.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693618", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework 3 and Scottish Planning Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome today&#8217;s debate on the Scottish planning policy and the national planning framework 3.

I come to the debate with the background of being one of the three co-conveners of the cross-party group on chronic pain, along with Jackie Baillie and Jackson Carlaw, and as a member of the Public Petitions Committee, which considered the petition that Susan Archibald lodged on the cross-party group&#8217;s behalf to take forward the issues that the group has highlighted in relation to chronic pain. That petition has clearly brought important issues into the wider public domain and partly helped to initiate today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>It is estimated that 800,000 people, including 70,000 children, suffer from chronic pain at varying levels. Healthcare Improvement Scotland provides no definitive figures on the numbers of people who are affected by chronic pain but, according to the Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network, the problem might affect approximately 18 per cent of the population at some point during their lives.</p><p>I recognise that the Scottish Government considers that the best way in which to fully investigate the issues behind chronic pain is to adopt a Scottish service model. The Government accepted some four years ago that long-lasting pain is a condition in its own right but, that said, there has been criticism of health boards in relation to taking the necessary action in a wider Scottish context.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made a commitment to provide two-year funding to start up local service improvement groups. The requirement for better data collection has been recognised for benchmarking. In addition, the chief executive of NHS Scotland has proactively looked for feedback from all health boards on how progress towards the four key recommendations is being assessed. I touched on the first recommendation in mentioning the Scottish service model for chronic pain, and the cabinet secretary rightly identified that we also have to look at the social model of care for sufferers of chronic pain.</p><p>I will spend some of my time talking about the second recommendation, which is about working with patients and the voluntary sector. Although health boards need to develop a stronger level of participation by patients, some people could argue that patients can be moved around for treatment, so we need to look carefully at whether the treatment plan is patient centred. Some members of the cross-party group have made the criticism that there is little patient representation. The Scottish Government clearly has a role in developing solutions on that. The role can be successfully implemented only if organisations work jointly on a shared programme.</p><p>That is just one aspect of the approach that is needed if we are to ensure better service delivery for people with chronic pain. Another concerns what is happening on a practical, day-to-day basis. Although I recognise the good work that is taking place at the Buchanan centre in Coatbridge, which is a primary care facility, it is centralised, which leads to problems with patients accessing the facility, especially if they stay in outlying villages in Lanarkshire.</p><p>The most basic building block of the NHS is the general practitioner. GPs have a vital role in developing an holistic approach. I note that the need for their assistance in developing an approach that delivers local clinics run by GPs with a specialised interest is going to be answered by 10 GPs who have registered an interest in Lanarkshire.</p><p>I note and welcome the fact that the Scottish Government has placed a high priority on each health board delivering a plan that covers all areas of chronic pain. The Government is already committed to providing the appropriate residential accommodation, especially for patients whose chronic pain is severe, and that should limit the impact on people who are at risk now and in the future.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to highlight chronic pain because, behind the talk of data collection, we must remember that we are talking about real people who, at many levels, are just trying to get through the day and through their lives. Chronic pain has an impact not just on individuals but on their families. It affects people&#8217;s day-to-day activities and whether they can hold down a job. We must remember that, if people are to be active in their communities, they need services to be provided by the health board and others to enable them to do that and to continue leading fulfilling lives, rather than finding that their condition has a debilitating impact on them.</p><p>We look forward to a time when chronic pain is taken seriously not just by the people who suffer from it but by all those who are involved in delivering services, such as health boards and others. That will ensure that, when we move forward as a society, those individuals feel that they are part of that society.</p><p>I look forward to the initiatives that the cabinet secretary is taking and I look forward to a time when Scotland has a comprehensive chronic pain service that is provided in every part of Scotland, with health boards playing a vital role and with GPs being seen as front-line service providers for many patients. There should be a co-ordinated approach to ensure that all patients, no matter who they are, receive the treatment that they deserve and require.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s motion on chronic pain.

I trust that the debate will assist in speeding up the pace of the reform that is needed in the electricity marketplace.</p><p>A significant element of the UK Energy Bill relates to security of electricity supply and increasing opportunities for investment. Members talked about fears down south that the lights will go off.</p><p>As I have said before in Parliament, the householder has not been best served in the current marketplace for energy, in particular the electricity market. The customer must be at the heart of the reform process&#8212;not an afterthought. Since 2004, electricity bills have increased by more than 50 per cent, and further hikes are expected in the near future. Many people have had to make tough decisions about how they spend their money in these most challenging times.</p><p>According to the report of the Economic and Social Research Council&#8217;s poverty and social exclusion in the United Kingdom survey, in which 2,700 individuals in Scotland were surveyed, one in six children in Scotland lives in a home that suffers from damp or that is not adequately heated. Furthermore, in its report, &#8220;Keeping the heat in Scotland&#8217;s homes: How to make energy efficiency schemes more appealing to consumers&#8221;, Consumer Focus Scotland noted that nearly one in three Scottish households is fuel poor. Both reports show the scale of the problem that low-income households face, so I welcome the funding mechanisms that the Scottish Government has put in place to try to deal with issues to do with fuel poverty.</p><p>It is clear from the details of the Energy Bill that the current constitutional arrangements about what is reserved and what is devolved create problems. Although energy matters are generally reserved, the Scottish Government has a role in relation to aspects such as the design of contracts for difference. The Scottish Government anticipates that if it is to deliver its policy focus, a consistent regulatory landscape is appropriate.</p><p>Electricity market reform is part of a wider energy agenda on development of a low-carbon economic strategy, which aims to make Scotland more capable of resisting the volatility that is associated with ever-increasing energy prices.</p><p>The debate is well timed, given that Scotland can have an increasing role on the global stage. The country has the potential to produce a quarter of Europe&#8217;s offshore wind energy. The prospects for Scotland&#8217;s economy are dependent on using renewables, particularly in the context that the global low-carbon economy is forecast to grow to &#163;4.3&#160;trillion by 2015. I am hopeful that principles in the UK Energy Bill will better signpost a future of increased investment by developing the principle of a market in delivering generation capacity. The substantive aim of making Scotland a leading centre for low-carbon investment is associated with that development.</p><p>There are a number of issues that we have not covered and that have not been covered in electricity market reform. The Conservative amendment raises the issue of tariffs, but consumers also face problems with other issues and we must address them in the future. It is fine to say that we must get the reforms right for the market, but we must also get them right for the consumer, because many consumers are being asked to pay for the reforms.</p><p>If the Energy Bill that the UK Government has introduced does not make the correct reforms&#8212;reforms that benefit consumers, in particular people who are on low incomes and who are in fuel-poor households&#8212;it will fail to address some crucial issues that many people face, not only in Scotland, but throughout the UK.</p><p>I look forward in the coming months and years to progress on many of the issues that have been discussed in the debate.

It is an important committee, as it is regarded as one of the key public access points to the Parliament, as highlighted by this afternoon&#8217;s debate. The committee has examined petitions that have brought issues of importance to wider awareness. That is illustrated by the petition from Professor David Crichton, who has highlighted flood insurance problems and, in particular, the problems associated with flood-damaged property. The committee actively considers ways to fully investigate the issues behind petitions, whether that be through a detailed inquiry and report, as in the case of petitions on access to cancer treatment, or a debate such as this one on the problems of flood insurance.</p><p>The solution to the issue under discussion is not to be found at local level and is not straightforward. The Scottish Government clearly has a role in developing solutions that are in the Scottish interest, as detailed in the petition, although that role is restricted. As members have said, that is principally because financial services, including insurance, are currently a reserved matter, although the sector is important to Scottish industry.</p><p>As many members have said, the Association of British Insurers does not intend to renew the agreement that it made with the Scottish Government in December 2008. The agreement, which is due to lapse in a couple of months&#8217; time, relates to the provision of information about how to access flood insurance and is particularly important for low-income households. Much has been made of access to flood insurance. Alex Johnstone spoke about &#163;5,000 excesses. Such issues hit those on the lowest incomes the hardest, and particularly those who are struggling to get into the housing market. Every mortgage company tells people that they must have property and contents insurance before they get a mortgage. If the cost of insurance policies becomes prohibitive and individuals cannot afford them, how will they get into the housing market?</p><p>The insurance policies are excessive and insurers keep on hiking up prices and excesses. It is all very well for an insurer to say to someone that they can sell them a household insurance policy for a &#163;300 premium, but the excess becomes prohibitive and it takes only one flood risk to knock the family right off and, potentially, for them to end up losing their home. That is only one aspect of the costs to such households of the agreement on reinstating flood-damaged property.</p><p>Other members have already referred to the fact that the Scottish Government has been engaged in regular dialogue with DEFRA, as the minister outlined in his speech, about how to ensure the uptake of reasonably priced insurance. The issue is reasonably priced insurance.</p><p>The UK Government statement of 11 July 2012 on flood insurance has created some substantive issues, as detailed by the petitioner. There are serious issues with the assertion that any renewal of the agreement would somehow hinder the development of a free market in flood insurance. That is assertion over fact. The statement does not detail the problems that are associated with climate change.</p><p>The ABI does not recognise that it should have a degree of corporate social responsibility on the matter. The most basic building and contents insurance policy asks at least two questions on flooding when a consumer seeks home insurance. In particular, it asks whether the property to be insured has had a history of flooding over the past 10 years.</p><p>In its consideration of the petition, the Public Petitions Committee noted that the Scottish Government had already commissioned the University of Dundee to research matters associated with the petition, especially flood insurance and the impact on those who are more at risk and are attempting to access house insurance.</p><p>The petitioner raised another important issue with the committee: the fact that legislation exists that allows insurance companies to recover the costs that are associated with flood damage. The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 allows insurers to sue a developer for recovery of any flood claim costs. The committee asked the ABI whether insurers companies had raised any cases to recover any flood costs. It responded:</p><p>&#8220;No, we are not aware of any occasions when the ABI has sued a developer for the recovery of flood claim costs. We do not believe that this is because insurers are unaware of the Law Reform Act 1985. Insurers would need to prove that planning permission was given due to negligence on behalf of some party, maybe the planner or the developer or both, probably based on their assessment of the risk of flooding. This would never be easy.&#8221;</p><p>We know from the situation south of the border that housing developments are being built on identified flood plains. Scottish householders are being asked to pay the cost of those developments. Does the same legislation exist south of the border to allow the insurance companies to challenge developers and others and recover some of the costs that are associated with flooding in those areas? As other members said, it is clear that developments have taken place south of the border on flood plains and that every person who is looking for household insurance is being asked to pay the price.</p><p>Nigel Don and Marco Biagi raised issues with people being able to sell on their homes if they have been affected by flooding. That is an important factor, particularly in historic towns such as Stonehaven. Those are not new estates that have been built in the past 25 or 30 years but historic towns and there are issues for the people who live, and the businesses that operate, in such town centres.</p><p>As my colleague Angus MacDonald indicated, someone would need to be a climate change denier not to accept that we are faced with coastal, river and flash floods and the build-up of surface water throughout Scotland. We must tackle those issues. He did not go into quite the detail that he has gone into in the committee on the fears about, and dangers at, Grangemouth, which is a major industrial complex, or the impact on the economy of not only the area but the whole of Scotland if something serious were to happen there.</p><p>I put on record my appreciation of all the emergency services that attempt to deal with the effects of flooding when it happens. We should show our appreciation for the organisations that step in to try and alleviate the worst effects of flooding in particular areas.</p><p>I welcome the actions by the Scottish Government on this issue to date and look forward to a positive outcome that resolves many of the concerns raised in Professor Crichton&#8217;s petition on flood insurance.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to debate the petition, the work of the Public Petitions Committee before Parliament and the opportunity to stress some of the issues surrounding the petition. I look forward to many of the issues being resolved as early as possible and to the satisfaction of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak as a member of the Public Petitions Committee, the role of which has evolved over the years.

The evidence that was provided to the Scottish Affairs Committee clearly identified that people were blacklisted for expressing the most basic concerns about health and safety in their workplace. Professor Keith Ewing produced a report for UCATT entitled &#8220;Ruined Lives: Blacklisting in the UK Construction Industry&#8221;. I found the report&#8217;s evidence compelling, and its main title&#8212;&#8220;Ruined Lives&#8221;&#8212;really says it all. It refers to situations in which gossip somehow becomes fact, which can only lead to discriminatory practices.</p><p>Neil Findlay rightly highlights in his motion the construction sector and some of its bad practices. It must be remembered that many people still do not know whether they have been a victim of blacklisting and that many other industries carried out blacklisting.</p><p>There was recent action by the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office against the Consulting Association, but its activities were clearly just the tip of the iceberg, because they followed almost 90 years of similar practices, including those of the Economic League since 1919, which highlighted particular workers and discriminated against them. That meant that people who were in work and people who were applying for work were discriminated against, so some people could not even apply for jobs. For example, I know of a case in which someone was told not to bother applying for a job in an industry because they were blacklisted.</p><p>The difficulty is that much of the evidence was not available to many workers. I have met many trade unionists over the years who told me that they were blacklisted but could not prove it. All that they were told when they applied for a job was that they were not suitable or that no job was available. Even when they knew that they were well qualified and could do the job, they were denied the opportunity even to apply for a job. For a number of years, employers have been able to pick and choose on the basis of hearsay, as I said when I intervened during Mr Stevenson&#8217;s speech, or a person&#8217;s involvement in political or environmental campaigns.</p><p>It is clear that the practice has gone on. We must all condemn it and move forward. That means that we must identify the companies that we know engaged in the process, given the evidence that we have. The difficulty is that we do not have evidence of the work that the Economic League carried out and the blacklisting that took place while the league existed.</p><p>I support the Government&#8217;s stance on the issue. The procurement reform bill should include provision to ensure that we tell employers that we will not condone such practice and will take whatever action we can to stop it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690122", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Blacklisting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare that, as my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests shows, I am a member of Unite.

Neil Findlay is right to identify what happened in South Yorkshire and the fact that South Yorkshire Police referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. There can be no doubt that after the allegations surrounding Orgreave and, in particular, Hillsborough, there are lessons for policing not just in Yorkshire but elsewhere, including Scotland.</p><p>The debate is important. It should be remembered that next year will be the 30th anniversary of the miners&#8217; strike. Scotland has an industrial heritage that was built on the work of miners and we must realise that we owe them a legacy that is open and honest. I do not want to be accused of being misty-eyed; in all industrial disputes there can be wrongdoing on both sides, but this was no ordinary industrial dispute. The allegations of widespread collusion by police officers at Orgreave do not inspire confidence, especially when miners were sacked as a result of being found guilty of breach of the peace charges while they were on picket duties.</p><p>The &#8220;Coal not dole&#8221; slogan during the strike became a reality of &#8220;dole&#8221; for many thousands of sacked miners after the dispute. Miners suffered real hardship, and not only in financial terms. Many families and relationships were lost during that time, which is a longer-lasting cost.</p><p>One of the lasting images of the miners&#8217; strike is of Yuill &amp; Dodds Ltd lorries, which looked more like armoured personnel vehicles, flying through picket lines at Ravenscraig. The strike and its aftermath have a particular relevance for Central Scotland; nearly 300 people who were protesting at the entrance of the site were arrested on 3 May 1984 at Ravenscraig.</p><p>Neil Findlay is rightly looking for justice now and in the future. It is a moot point whether the Scottish justice system is robust enough to take criticism, particularly when&#8212;as has been highlighted by various media outlets&#8212;a significant number of those who were arrested did not have any previous convictions to their names. I am encouraged that Scottish Government ministers have advised people that they can take grievances about alleged miscarriages of justice to the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland or to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p><p>Some people might wrongly see this debate as an attack on the police.

For the committee, it is useful to hear from others who are not engaged in its week-to-week discussion or the investigations that it carries out.</p><p>The committee is in a fortunate position in that, as was mentioned earlier, five of its seven members have served as local councillors and so bring collective experience not only of how local government works but of how community planning partnerships work at a local level. We have heard examples of that from members who have participated in the debate.</p><p>We must ensure that the committee brings to the inquiry the experiences not only of people who have sat on local authorities but of the others who have contributed to the debate either through the committee&#8217;s fact-finding visits or the submissions that a number of people have made as we have considered the issues through all three strands of the inquiry.</p><p>Unfortunately, like two other members of the committee, I joined the committee only last September, so I missed the strand 1 deliberations, but I am sure that I have helped by contributing to the strand 3 discussions.</p><p>In his opening speech, the convener tried to set out what strands 1 and 2 tried to achieve. In strand 2, we considered benchmarking and related issues.</p><p>Benchmarking is clearly important. A number of members mentioned it in their speeches. Local authorities have accepted that it is needed. The committee has heard evidence that local authorities will set out 48 strands and that&#8212;by the end of next month, we hope&#8212;they will report on the reporting mechanisms that they have worked out for them.</p><p>We hope that, for the first time, that will give us a consistent approach to the gathering and delivery of information. Too often in the past, local authorities delivered figures that did not compare with those of other local authorities. This time, we will have a set of figures and data that we will be able to compare across local authorities.</p><p>That data will also take on board the issues that John Swinney and others mentioned about the delivery of services in rural authorities versus in urban authorities. COSLA and others are considering how we set the families of local authorities so that we can measure performance accurately across the services that each local authority provides.</p><p>The committee was also fortunate to take evidence from Sir John Arbuthnott and Robert Black. That was quite enlightening, because we heard Sir John Arbuthnott&#8217;s deliberations on the Clyde valley review that he carried out. We saw the local authorities in that area being brought together to try to get some joint service delivery. However, we have heard&#8212;I have made this point in committee&#8212;that the eight local authorities have developed a pick-and-mix approach to joint service delivery, with some authorities taking issues on board and others leaving them to one side.</p><p>North Lanarkshire Council&#8217;s submission mentions social care services, social transport and other initiatives that it is looking at with other local authorities in the Clyde valley. It also mentions national schemes such as Scotland Excel and myjobscotland. Those initiatives are taking place across the board and they are part of the public sector reform that is taking place.</p><p>Given that John Pentland knows North Lanarkshire quite well, I was surprised by his comments about the Scottish Government setting up all these arm&#8217;s-length external organisations. We know that North Lanarkshire Council is about to set up another ALEO and transfer out services against the wishes of the public in many respects. As politicians, we have to be wary about what we pick on, because there are areas in which local elected members are involved in transferring services because they see that as the best way forward.</p><p>The feedback from communities on community planning partnerships has not always been good. Agencies and local authorities say that the process is working, but to many people it is a tick-box exercise, or a rubber-stamping exercise. We have heard about that from communities. I am talking about people at the grass roots, not the third sector or what are in many respects the senior voluntary sector organisations. We have had views fed to us from local community activists who are delivering services on the ground, such as the tea in the pot project in Govan, which we heard from when we visited Glasgow last week. For a small amount&#8212;less than &#163;10,000&#8212;it is delivering key services to women in the Govan area. We need to consider how local voluntary organisations that deliver key services to local communities are being treated within the community planning process and how they engage in the delivery of services.</p><p>The minister is right. The issue is about engaging with communities and about communities understanding the budgetary constraints, but the reality is that many of the community activists who are delivering key services are excluded from the discussions and the debate about how the bigger budget is divided up. I am sure that the committee will welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure that the public sector agencies work more closely together to ensure that delivery is consistent across the board.</p><p>As I said, the committee heard Sir John Arbuthnott and Robert Black set the scene in the lead-up to strand 3 of the inquiry. However, we must remember that public sector reform is not only being discussed in the Parliament. We read various academics&#8217; views on public sector reform in the Sunday newspapers, and that adds to the debate on where as a country we are going on the delivery of services by local government and on tying in all the other agencies that are out there. We heard examples today of joint healthcare projects and joint procurement by local authorities and health boards. We need to examine such services and consider whether they are delivering on behalf of communities, as they claim to be.</p><p>As I said earlier, it is unfortunate that although some of the agencies and senior staff who are involved think that they are delivering the best possible service, the reality is different. As many MSPs will know from their surgeries, questions are being asked about how such services are delivered on the ground and how communities can engage in delivering better services.</p><p>The committee heard a lot of evidence from organisations about where they are going. There is still a lot of work to be done by the committee, but I hope that it will report before the end of June. We will bring that report to the chamber and I hope that the Parliament will accept the work that has been done by the committee and the clerks and the people who have provided written and oral evidence. I hope that we will pull together something that the Scottish Government can take on board and that will address the concerns and issues that have been raised by the general public. I look forward to the Scottish Government engaging openly with the committee to ensure that we get it right for everybody in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who contributed to the debate.

It is worth reinforcing the point that the Scottish Government deserves credit for creating a degree of security and sustainability in local government budgets, and its strong commitment in that regard should enhance local government spending priorities. After all, from 2008 to 2012-13, local government&#8217;s budget has increased by nearly 9 per cent.</p><p>Since 2007-08, all councils have frozen council tax rates and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to continuing support for that move. We will have to wait and see whether local authorities, too, support the continuation of the freeze, which, I should point out, saved the average band D household more than &#163;300 in the period from 2008 to 2012.</p><p>The more than &#163;591 million revenue allocation for North Lanarkshire Council is not to be dismissed lightly. I note that, unlike the previous Labour-Liberal Executive, which clawed back local authority efficiency savings, the Scottish Government has since 2007 allowed authorities to retain them for spending on priorities in their areas and has given authorities the opportunity to invest in their strategic priorities and increase service provision as they deem necessary.</p><p>As has been mentioned, there has been much discussion about the resource allocations. It is worth pointing out that, as Sarah Boyack indicated, local government expenditure is being squeezed in cash terms by 0.2 per cent in the 2013-14 budget; however, that should be seen in the light of a real-terms cut to the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. It could be argued that existing budgets should be prioritised and take account of the best practice that many local authorities throughout Scotland have already established.</p><p>The arguments that have been made by local authorities about the financial settlement are rather ironic, given the difficulty of comparing this year&#8217;s figures with those of previous years as a result of the removal of fire and police service budgets from the settlement. That money will now be paid directly to the agencies concerned, and local authorities will have to take account of the fact that those budgets have been withdrawn from their settlements. We look forward to seeing how that will work out in future years.</p><p>Other issues are worth further examination, but I have to say that the issue of executive pay in local government is a real concern for me. Scrutiny of the parameters for those pay levels looks increasingly self-serving, and the area needs to be addressed. For a start, the right tone needs to be set in this financial environment and at a time when many local authorities are still trying to deal with equal pay and single status claims that have been outstanding since 1999.</p><p>To provide some context to the debate, I point out that the Government is taking account of reality outside the chamber and, as the cabinet secretary has mentioned, is addressing the issue of the social wage by encouraging&#8212;I was going to say &#8220;insisting&#8221;, but I meant &#8220;encouraging&#8221;&#8212;local authorities to introduce it for all local authority employees. That must be welcomed. Many people, including low-paid workers in local authorities, are benefiting from the cabinet secretary&#8217;s decisions, particularly with regard to continuing the freeze.</p><p>I support the motion on the order that has been placed before Parliament, look forward to discussing the issues further and hope that the Opposition will face up to the reality with regard to budgets and make a positive contribution to the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2013 [Draft]"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the debate on the order, we must recognise the cabinet secretary&#8217;s contribution in obtaining significant financial outputs to accelerate key priorities for the Scottish people.

I believe that the Scottish Government is attempting to develop a holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to have the debate, although fuel poverty and its consequences should have been consigned to the dustbin of history. Poverty and fuel poverty have been around for a long time, and the complexities of this aspect of poverty are, shamefully, still embedded in all too many of our communities.</p><p>Since the mid-1980s, progress to tackle poverty has relied on few mechanisms. The hope has usually been that economic growth would trickle down to the poorest in society or that the increasing dynamic of welfare-to-work programmes would by itself solve working-age poverty, without any meaningful change in the incomes of those who remained out of work.</p><p>It needs to be recognised that household budgets have been and are under severe strain. From 2006 to 2011, electricity bills increased by 54.9 per cent and gas prices increased by 80 per cent. That has resulted in many people having to make tough decisions about how they spend their money in these most difficult times.</p><p>Fuel poverty is an important issue&#8212;even more so when we consider that the aim was to eradicate it by 2016. When that target was set, nobody expected rising prices and falling earnings, which have drawn more households into fuel poverty.</p><p>In relation to fuel poverty, one strength of policy in the recent past has been the acknowledgement that poverty is multifaceted. The emphasis on social exclusion is welcome, but that agenda was nothing new to some of us&#8212;especially those who have worked on the issues for a number of decades.</p><p>It is worth observing that utility companies are distrusted more than banks in the minds of consumers such as small businesses. An ingenious Britain survey said that just 28 per cent of firms trust their energy supplier, whereas a third trust banks.</p><p>The Which? report &#8220;The Imbalance of Power&#8221; revealed that consumers face an increase of as much as 17 per cent in electricity prices. Only one in 10 could spot the cheapest deal, which highlighted how confusing the market is. When the Consumers Association showed people simplified energy tariffs in the style of petrol forecourt displays and asked them which was the cheapest, the number who could spot the answer shot up to nine out of 10. It is clear that something must change.</p><p>Given the diverse nature of fuel poverty, the policy mix needs to be flexible in its approach to tackling it. As a society, we have to understand and tackle the problems of fuel poverty. We must take every step that is possible within the powers of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament to eradicate this blight in Scotland, and we must urge the UK Government to raise its game in dealing with some of the root causes of poverty.</p><p>I welcome the motion that we are debating today and indeed the long-standing commitment to the principle of poverty proofing policy. Although the initiatives to retrofit and improve insulation standards in homes have to be welcomed, we also have to ensure that fuel prices do not continue to outstrip the financial benefits to households of mitigation measures that are put in place to alleviate fuel poverty.</p><p>I have no doubt that fuel poverty will continue to be a major concern to all in the Parliament. I look forward to the minister providing regular updates on how the programme to tackle fuel poverty over the coming period, particularly up to 2016, will benefit the people of Scotland. We should all be concerned when, in this day and age and particularly at this time of year, many people, and particularly pensioners, face the real hazard of having to decide whether to heat their homes or to feed themselves. As other members have said, the situation that we face is one that we should not be facing in the 21st century. The more measures that we can put in place to eradicate fuel poverty, the better. We must give families in Scotland security and ensure that they do not have to live in the desperate situation of having to decide whether to heat their homes, feed themselves or clothe their children.</p><p>Clearly, the issue should concern everyone in the Parliament and outside it. I look forward to the continuing work by all the agencies and organisations, and work both inside the Parliament and outside it.

It is important to recognise, as the motion does, the value of the coal industry in Scotland and the fact that coalfield communities are relevant to modern-day Scotland. As Adam Ingram stated, despite the decline that has been visited on the coal industry, it still contributes significantly to the Scottish economy and it has a future with the right support and encouragement.</p><p>This debate is important for some of us as, it should be remembered, next year will be the 30th anniversary of the miners&#8217; strike and the subsequent actions by Margaret Thatcher, which some would argue led to the demise of the coal industry in Scotland and other parts of the UK.</p><p>Scotland has an industrial heritage that we should be proud of and we must realise that no community should be left behind, especially when traditional industries such as mining are looking forward to a brighter tomorrow.</p><p>It is vital that we offer traditional mining communities a sustainable future, as the preceding generations deserved nothing less. It is worth noting that the case for a growing Scottish coal industry is based on the use of the latest CCS technology. Therefore, what many people regard as a dirty industry could find itself renewed.</p><p>It is also worth observing that coal is being shipped into Scotland from overseas and transported across central Scotland from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Longannet in Fife. If the charges on the transportation of coal are imposed, I estimate that, on the 23 journeys that are made daily, six days a week, they could add &#163;2 million to the cost of transportation. That cost will not be borne by taxpayers, as Murdo Fraser rightly said, but by the consumers who use the energy that is produced.</p><p>There is more that we can all do as individuals for the low-carbon economy and there is more that the UK Government and the Scottish Government can deliver on policy development. I am therefore encouraged that the Scottish Government has carried on the good work that it started when it published the discussion paper &#8220;Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland&#8221; back in March 2010.</p><p>The advancement of a low-carbon economic strategy will also aim to make Scotland more capable of resisting the volatility that is associated with ever-increasing energy prices. The future is clearly geared towards a low-carbon economy, which is even more apparent considering the aim to almost completely decarbonise road transportation by 2050.</p><p>Many parts of Ayrshire and Lanarkshire that are highlighted in the motion suffer from deep-seated levels of poverty and, as a consequence, depopulation is also a factor. Of course, it would be remiss not to state that there is an issue of hidden unemployment.

Scotland needs to have reindustrialisation as a vital part of our economic future.

As other members have stated, the inquiry looked at important areas of employability and current initiatives, including modern apprenticeships, the evaluation of such key initiatives, and the scrutiny of whether such initiatives and interventions are successful.</p><p>There are good current examples of improving employability. There is the partnership between Whitehill secondary school and Milnbank Housing Association in Dennistoun, for example. That project has existed for a number of years and has latterly taken a more formal approach. Milnbank Housing Association has been funded from the housing association wider role funding that the Scottish Government has provided.</p><p>On the detailed responses to the examination of employability issues, a significant amount of committee time clearly centred on the need for creating sustainable employment. I was heartened that the Finance Committee&#8217;s scrutiny was not strictly confined to young people, although youth employment is and should be a serious concern for everyone. In its evidence to the committee, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges quite properly highlighted its unease about 29 per cent of people aged over 24 having no qualifications.</p><p>The Finance Committee&#8217;s report highlights the elements of success for employability and the factors that do not assist disadvantaged individuals. Some people might say that a higher element of public support and intervention should be required for older people. The report highlighted the issue of the accessibility of certain programmes, with</p><p>&#8220;even those aged over 20, being excluded.&#8221;</p><p>The Finance Committee states that it would welcome clarification from the Government on how decisions were reached on the age limits for the opportunities for all scheme and the reason why the community jobs Scotland scheme is open only to 16 to 19-year-olds. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employability and Sustainable Growth alluded earlier to some reasons why that decision was made. I hope that we can examine that in more detail and look at whether UK Government programmes are addressing the serious employability issues of those aged over 19.</p><p>In terms of developing the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to a person-centred approach, the landscape is complex and, as the report states, that is in no small part</p><p>&#8220;due to the split of responsibilities between the UK and the Scottish Government.&#8221;</p><p>The Finance Committee notes in its report the number of different programmes and strategies. The Scottish Government hopes to address the matter through better alignment of Scotland&#8217;s employability services. However, I feel that some of the language used to describe the various strategies and programmes is not useful and could be said not to develop public awareness or a sense of public ownership. The Finance Committee considers it crucial that investment in assisting individuals into employment is made with a long-term commitment.</p><p>With regard to its evidence-gathering sessions, the committee not unsurprisingly referred to the number of young people not in education, employment or training. The report notes that the estimated figure of 31,000 16 to 19-year-olds not in education, employment or training has remained static for more than 10 years.</p><p>Some of the issues surrounding employment are outwith any Government&#8217;s control. In that regard, we have only to look at the growth in zero-hours and part-time contracts in the private sector, particularly the retail sector. I am aware that in the lead-up to Christmas, a number of retailers were recruiting young workers not through Jobcentre Plus but through Twitter and other accounts, and offering zero-hours or five-hour contracts. That is not a welcome sign for young people&#8217;s experience of employment. We must ensure that the employment that is offered is meaningful and that it does not lead to individuals finding themselves in in-work poverty. We must ensure that employers take full responsibility for ensuring that those they employ do not find themselves worse off through working. In that regard, Elaine Murray referred earlier to workers in rural areas who would be worse off if they took certain jobs.</p><p>A number of my constituents in the Central Scotland region, which has multiple areas of deprivation, are not in sustainable employment and may face the prospect of in-work poverty or finding themselves out of work. Constituents who are over 50 do not find that there is a particularly friendly climate for finding employment in the modern working environment. A number of constituents who have approached me about their concerns in that regard find it difficult to get work and feel that they have been left on the scrapheap after working for 20 or 30 years. As I have stated before, youth employment is important, but tackling it should not be done to the detriment of those who are looking for opportunities to reskill and retool themselves for employment in our communities.</p><p>I welcome the Finance Committee&#8217;s &#8220;Improving employability&#8221; report and have found the opportunity to debate it thought provoking. We need to ensure that we have a robust mechanism to evaluate current skills and employment initiatives so that they are up to date and meaningful for the people of Scotland and for the many people who are trying to find employment in this modern society.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "All members have their own experiences with regard to improving employability in the modern workplace and how training and developing skills impact on achieving employment.

I know his long history of promoting the issue, and look forward to working with him on his member&#8217;s bill.</p><p>Over the years, members and committees of the Parliament have initiated various debates on the living wage. The motion refers to the Institute for Public Policy Research and Resolution Foundation report, which highlights that the</p><p>&#8220;UK stands out as having one of the highest incidences of low-wage work&#8221;</p><p>among advanced economies.</p><p>The factors that drive poverty are diverse but are still nevertheless more challenging. For far too long, we have relied on hoping that economic growth will trickle down to the poorest in our society or that the various welfare-to-work schemes will solve working-age poverty without a change to the incomes of those who are in or out of employment. The living wage is to be welcomed as part of a policy mix that needs to be flexible but not confused in tackling in-work poverty. As the Local Government and Regeneration Committee stated in its report on the living wage in Scotland in February this year,</p><p>&#8220;it is not, in itself, a panacea and will not be sufficient, on its own&#8221;.</p><p>The living wage requires better co-ordination. The fact that the Scottish Government is committed to paying those on low incomes a living wage of &#163;7.45 an hour from April next year has to be welcomed as a first step to having a living wage adopted by all employers in Scotland. That is of great assistance to the campaign.</p><p>Although some could well have described the public sector&#8217;s record on the living wage as patchy, the private sector has a real job of work to catch up with the agenda that has been set. The Institute for Public Policy Research and Resolution Foundation report clearly highlights that few companies in retail or food services have been committed to becoming living wage employers. It is worth highlighting that new research by Incomes Data Services suggests that bosses of the FTSE 100 companies made an average of &#163;4&#160;million a year in the 12 months to June this year.</p><p>I have stated on numerous occasions in the chamber that there is a requirement that we seriously assess what a citizens or basic income should be. That issue needs to be examined more fully and progressed, as the living wage may not always address the fundamental problems of the economy and individual households.</p><p>It is ironic that while the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, made his intention clear in his announcement&#8212;which must be welcomed in some respects&#8212;that the living wage will be introduced and uprated in London, very few of the London boroughs in which Conservatives are in control have signed up to the living wage. I look forward to the Conservatives signing up to the campaign in London and elsewhere.</p><p>That takes us to the essential point that private sector employers&#8212;or employers more generally&#8212;do not have to endorse the living wage because, unlike the national minimum wage, it has no legal status behind it. Members have debated that in the chamber in the past. If we are serious about a living wage, we must ensure that forcing employers to pay it becomes a legitimate imposition on them. In fact, there is now confusion about the living wage and the national minimum wage and about why the figures vary so much. My colleague Christina McKelvie referred to the uprating of the national minimum wage on 1 October this year, but she did not say that the upratings for 18 to 20-year-olds and for those under 18 never happened; the uprating was only for those over 21.</p><p>In welcoming this debate, I take the opportunity to thank the Scottish living wage campaign, among other organisations, and Peter Kelly, who is in the public gallery, for their tireless work on the issue. Peter has been involved for more years than he would probably care to remember in campaigning on low-wage issues and for the living wage. I look forward to being involved in the wider debate and, as I said earlier, in the debate on John Park&#8217;s proposed bill when he introduces it to Parliament.</p><p>Finally, I have a question for the minister. When looking at Scottish Government contracts, can the minister check with his colleagues on what can be done to uprate the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board&#8217;s rates of pay? The Government has some responsibility for that body, which currently does not pay the living wage.</p><p>I thank the members involved for this debate and I look forward to future debates on the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Kezia Dugdale for lodging the motion and John Park for stepping in.

Equally, I know that various agencies, including the national review of town centres, have been involved in the discussion around how best to regenerate town centres.</p><p>There was general agreement by the Local Government and Regeneration Committee of the principles as outlined in the legislation, although some clarification of the proposals was desired.</p><p>Clearly, some sectors of the business community, such as the Scottish Retail Consortium, are not satisfied with regard to the business rates relief issue. The proposal has been described by some as contentious. With regard to the proposal that businesses will get a 10 per cent discount on unoccupied properties, the actual situation is that business have not shown sufficient incentive while they have received a 50 per cent discount on unoccupied properties.</p><p>I know that the minister gave a commitment at stage 2 that confirmed the Government&#8217;s intention to introduce future regulations to reform empty property rates relief and create a new incentive for new occupation of long-term empty shops and offices. The fresh start scheme aims to provide business rates relief for a year and encourage new occupants of offices and shops that are lying empty.</p><p>At stage 2 of the bill, the Government allayed the concerns that were noted during the stage 1 debate, particularly in relation to the fine for not registering an empty property going up from &#163;200 to &#163;500. I know that that is a matter of discretion for local authorities, but I hope that the minister keeps it under constant review and thinks about whether the revised figure is sufficient, as it is not even a week&#8217;s rental income for some owners.</p><p>The light-touch regulation that is associated with the landlord registration scheme came in for some criticism from me and others in the previous session of the Parliament. I trust that we can move forward and that the legislation assists in that process.</p><p>The intention of getting empty properties back into use is of real merit as, according to Shelter, there are around 23,000 long-term empty houses.

I have known Hugh Henry for a long time, and I know well that the protection of vital employment rights is one of his priorities.</p><p>I share the sentiment behind the motion&#8217;s aims, but there is a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu about the debate, because Hugh Henry introduced the Protection of Workers (Scotland) Bill in the previous session of Parliament, which was unfortunately defeated at stage 1. Mr Henry&#8217;s motion is similar to the early day motion 574 that was tabled in the House of Commons by Graeme Morrice MP, so it might be a case of where Hugh Henry leads, others follow.</p><p>I have spoken in the past about Scotland&#8217;s rich industrial heritage with regard to the workers memorial day. In modern Scotland, many work locations might have changed, but the threat of assault, whether verbal or physical, is very real. The trade union USDAW&#8217;s freedom from fear campaign understands that the situation with regard to abuse and violence at work is not the same for all.</p><p>Many employees in the retail sector are female, and in the current economic climate they occupy very responsible positions. In small shops that sell alcohol and tobacco, staff might be left on their own but they still have a duty to challenge people who are buying alcohol and tobacco and they face the threat of verbal and physical abuse if they refuse to serve customers who cannot prove how old they are. We have to protect those staff from verbal abuse and violence by ensuring that their workplaces are free from such threats.</p><p>I do not know about other members&#8217; experiences, but when I go out to the shops I find that it is not unusual to see only one or two people in the shop without any real support on the floor. I know that Hugh Henry&#8217;s aim, and that of the motion, is that all public-facing workers should have the same level of protection as workers who are covered by the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005.</p><p>Unfortunately a distinction was created in 2005, although it was not of my making, and that is still the reality today. Hugh Henry has clearly outlined that the 2005 act covers workers in the emergency services, but many workers in the retail sector feel that they have no protection from abuse. Threats are made by individuals, particularly when they are challenged for proof of age. In addition, we are seeing an increasing number of threats from people who are challenged when they have been caught shoplifting. We have to address that serious issue and ensure that workers feel safe and secure in their workplaces.</p><p>The motion implies that the public have become more intolerant of violence and assault, as shown in the decrease in the number of incidents. However, as Hugh Henry pointed out, the difficulty is that statistics that are coming out now show that in some areas the numbers are increasing. It would be difficult to determine whether that is due to the economic circumstances that people are facing.</p><p>Employers have a duty of care to their employees and they should ensure that their staff do not find themselves in a situation in which they could suffer violence and abuse. I recognise the work that trade unions have undertaken in conjunction with First ScotRail on its current public awareness campaign on the railways. I congratulate them on their contribution to making the travelling public aware of their campaign.</p><p>I genuinely look forward to the day when all workers in every sector can carry out their duties without fear of verbal or physical abuse. I trust that we will all do all we can to reach that objective in Parliament.

I trust that the debate will assist in increasing the pace of the reforms in the electricity market, especially as the Scottish Government has placed the low-carbon economy at the heart of its economic strategy.</p><p>The objectives of the UK Government&#8217;s draft energy bill place significant emphasis on security of supply with regard to electricity and increasing investment. It would be remiss of me not to put on record my concerns about how the consumer has not been best served so far in the current marketplace for electricity. The consumer should be at the heart of any reform process, not viewed as an inconvenient afterthought.</p><p>In the period from 2006 to 2011, consumers&#8217; electricity bills increased by 54.9 per cent. That has resulted in many people making tough decisions about how they spend their money in these most difficult times. Any future policies must ensure that the issue of fuel poverty is tackled.</p><p>In looking at the details of the UK draft energy bill, I have concerns about the mechanism for contracts for difference. That seems to me to be akin to the financial derivatives that were used in the mortgage market. It could be argued that such financial engineering might not be the best approach to adopt. There is a need for clarification of the proposed mechanism, especially when the whole purpose of the reform process is to provide price certainty and vital investment.</p><p>When it comes to growing a low-carbon economy, all of us can do more. That applies not just to us, as individuals, and the energy companies, but to the Government and the policy focus that it can deliver. Electricity market reform forms a vital part of the development of a low-carbon economic strategy that will aim to make Scotland more capable of resisting the volatility associated with ever-increasing energy prices. Growth that is sustainable in the long term is vital in taking our country forward. A robust electricity market should be part of that sustainable and growing future.</p><p>Of course, the future of Scotland&#8217;s energy needs should not include new nuclear generation as part of the energy mix. The UK Government continues to believe that nuclear power is a financially viable option, despite the decommissioning costs and the financial subsidy that is demanded by the nuclear industry.</p><p>The debate is opportune. Scotland will play an increasing role on the global stage, given that, as a country, we have the potential to produce a quarter of Europe&#8217;s offshore wind energy. The prospects for Scotland&#8217;s economy are dependent on the utilisation of renewables, particularly in a context in which the global low-carbon economy is forecast to grow to &#163;4.3 trillion by 2015.</p><p>As I have said previously in the chamber, Scotland is constrained under the current devolved settlement. That is made even more apparent by the transmission charging regime. The present system discriminates against Scottish interests, as is demonstrated by the fact&#8212;which other members have mentioned&#8212;that Scottish energy generators have to pay through the nose to connect to the UK national grid.</p><p>I am hopeful that the draft UK energy bill will better signpost a future of increased investment by developing the principle of a capacity market in respect of energy generation. That will help to ensure that companies have sufficient capacity to focus their attention on growing the market and the economy. An associated development is the substantive aim of making Scotland a leading centre of low-carbon investment. I am optimistic that other companies will follow the example of Samsung Heavy Industries and invest in Scotland.</p><p>The debate is timely and I look forward to many of the issues that have been raised being taken forward in the coming months and years. I hope that the UK and Scottish Governments can develop a reform agenda in the electricity marketplace programme that provides real benefits for the people of Scotland and ensures that Scotland can play a major role in Europe by becoming a powerhouse for future energy production.</p><p>I support Rhoda Grant&#8217;s amendment, because I think that it is extremely important that we look at grid connection charges and how they affect our communities in the Highlands and Islands. Tackling fuel poverty is also particularly important. We cannot continue to have a policy that results in electricity prices rising at a time when household budgets are decreasing. Dealing with fuel poverty should be at the heart of any energy strategy that is taken forward by the Scottish Government or the UK Government.</p><p>I support the motion and the amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672407", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the motion in the name of the minister, Fergus Ewing, and the debate initiated by the Scottish Government.

The bill builds on the previous legislation, which dates back to 1979. It attempts to bring a degree of modernity to the law and restates the law on the registration of rights in the land register.</p><p>It was clear to me and probably to other committee members that, since the introduction of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979, progress on land registration has been uncomfortably slow. I welcome the minister&#8217;s statement today that the keeper hopes to have around 80 per cent of property titles registered by 2017. Nevertheless, there are still concerns regarding land registration and when we will see a complete land register of Scotland, which committee members made known at the committee. We attempted to get some dates or timetables into the bill towards which the keeper could work, and I am glad to hear from the minister that the keeper hopes to have the registration of land ownership and title up to 80 per cent by 2017. I welcome that advance.</p><p>One of the bill&#8217;s key objectives is to create the fastest possible method of efficiently completing land registration for the whole of Scotland, with sufficient safeguards being built in, in order to strengthen the overall process. There has been concern that the current procedure is overly bureaucratic and it has been argued that confidence needs to be developed, so the introduction of electronic conveyancing is a welcome move in developing new processes.</p><p>There is a human cost to these matters that needs to be reflected upon. I hope that the bill will go some way towards tackling disputes about land ownership and registration. As Murdo Fraser intimated, examples of disputes about land ownership and boundaries were brought to the committee during our evidence sessions, and members were able to give examples from their postbags of constituency inquiries that they have received regarding title and ownership of land and property. In some cases, new owners have found that they do not actually own the property that they thought they owned.</p><p>As I stated when the bill was debated in the chamber at stage 1, a key aspect of the proposals is the creation of a statutory offence of making a materially false or misleading statement to the keeper. I know that the minister and the Solicitor General for Scotland believe that that measure is a vital part of the bill as it will give them legal powers to deal with organised crime. The committee received a written submission from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland that supports section 108 of the bill.</p><p>I recognise that there is a significant problem, and the bill attempts to address some of the concerns about the process that have been identified, particularly in relation to the tackling of fraud. The oral evidence that the Solicitor General, Lesley Thomson, gave to the committee, which was reflected in its stage 1 report, highlighted the importance of the creation of an offence to deal with organised crime.</p><p>I am aware that officials from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Scottish Government met the Law Society of Scotland to discuss the scope of the offence in section 108. It is desirable that the Solicitor General ensures that there is regular dialogue with the Law Society on what further guidance and advice can be provided to solicitors once the bill has become law.</p><p>I welcome the stage 3 debate and the wide-ranging principles that are contained in the bill. I was glad to hear that the committee convener found our consideration of the bill an education. I think that all members of the committee found it an education, either as home owners or landowners. I thank all those who provided oral or written evidence to the committee. In particular, I thank Andy Wightman for his insight into the land ownership issues that arose in the debate. I also thank the committee clerks and SPICe for their support and assistance, as well as my colleagues on the committee for their work in enabling the bill to reach this stage of the legislative process.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668114", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As deputy convener of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I sat through a number of evidence-gathering sessions and read a number of the written submissions that were made to the committee in its examination of the bill.

One overriding objective of the proposed legislation is to have the fastest method of completing land registration efficiently, with sufficient safeguards built in to maintain robustness.</p><p>The committee held five evidence sessions, during which the automated registration of title to land system was raised as an issue. I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to raise with the keeper the matter of an upgrade. Behind such mechanistic processes, there is usually a human cost that needs to be considered. I hope that the proposed legislation will go some way towards tackling that issue.</p><p>There are also issues with prescriptive claims. The committee discussed how to deal with such claims and how they should be advertised. One solution that I came up with is to use the same process as is used in planning applications, so that anyone who makes a prescriptive claim would have to notify neighbours on surrounding land, who could then intervene or comment on any acquisition that was sought through a prescriptive claim.</p><p>Section 108 concerned the Law Society of Scotland and others. It is a key principle of the bill that giving the keeper a materially false or misleading statement will be made a statutory offence. I recognise that the Solicitor General for Scotland, Lesley Thomson, and the minister believe that the measure should be enshrined in legislation so that they have the legal force to deal with serious and organised crime. I also recognise that there is a significant problem. The bill attempts to address some of the concerns that have been identified with the process, particularly in relation to organised crime, in relation to which redress has been somewhat limited.</p><p>In oral evidence to the committee, the Solicitor General highlighted the importance of creating an offence to deal with structured criminality. That evidence was reflected in the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report. I welcome the Solicitor General&#8217;s desire to discuss with the Law Society of Scotland what further guidance and advice could be provided to solicitors when the proposed legislation becomes statute.</p><p>I welcome the stage 1 debate and the broad principles in the bill. I look forward to the bill coming back to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. I thank all those who provided written and oral evidence. I also thank the clerks and the committee adviser, as well as my fellow committee members, who scrutinised the bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662970", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak as a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, which held a number of evidence-gathering sessions as part of its detailed examination of the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill.

As he said, such debates are like corporation buses, as we would say in Glasgow&#8212;two come along at once.</p><p>I had prepared a speech to read out, but it does not cover some issues in relation to the living wage that are fundamental to women&#8217;s employment rights. The Scottish living wage campaign is commendable; we discussed the historical campaigns in the chamber last week. Organisations have raised awareness of the living wage, highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and taken forward the fight&#8212;lately, through launching the Scottish living wage campaign. That has put the issue into the minds of all politicians and everybody else in society.</p><p>John Park said that &#8220;in-work poverty&#8221; is a political term that politicians use. I remind him that the phrase was coined about 10 years ago by a number of people who were working to try to eradicate poverty and particularly in-work poverty. We recognised that, despite the introduction of the national minimum wage, people were still being forced into jobs that did not provide enough income to take them out of poverty. UK Governments have pursued the agenda that work is the route out of poverty, so putting people into poverty through work is the wrong move.</p><p>Today is international women&#8217;s day. We must look at other issues that affect in-work poverty, particularly for women. In some local authorities, the campaign still goes on to ensure that women who are entitled to equal pay receive their entitlement.</p><p>There are other employment rights issues. If people go off sick after they enter new employment, they automatically receive statutory sick pay. Figures have been cited for what can be earned under the hourly rates for the minimum wage and the living wage, but when people receive &#163;75 or &#163;76 a week&#8212;that is from the second week; the amount in the first week is half that&#8212;their in-work poverty is exacerbated. We do not have a system to back up people who are put into employment that does not give them fair and proper conditions that would protect their rights and protect the children living in affected families from poverty that is exacerbated in that way.</p><p>We must look at other issues that face women workers in particular, such as short-time working, part-time working and the zero-hours contracts that many people find themselves in. In some respects, Margaret Mitchell was right to raise childcare provision. An issue is what we as a society are doing by forcing women into work but not providing adequate childcare at a cost or free to the women who require it most, but she must take up that issue with her UK colleagues. She must ask them what they are doing to ensure the correct childcare provision for the women and men whom they are forcing into low-paid employment.</p><p>As we have all recognised, the minimum wage is in effect low-paid employment. If we are arguing that the living wage should be the norm, then the minimum wage is not the norm. We have to think about what the Parliament can do for the people who are living in those conditions. Hopefully, through John Park&#8217;s bill, we can take the debate forward and not only extend the living wage to those people who work for local authorities, NHS boards or the sub-contractors who work for those bodies, but ensure that it becomes part of the norm for every worker in Scotland, tied into proper, decent employment rights that protect workers when they take up employment.</p><p>I welcome this debate and look forward to future discussions on the living wage and the ways in which we can resolve the issue of poverty as well as in-work poverty.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662943", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate John Park on bringing the debate to the Parliament.

Based on the experiences of my wife and others, I completely agree with the petitioner Andrea MacArthur&#8217;s argument that inconsistent treatment, ambiguous testing and inaccurate diagnosis currently stand in the way of effectively managing the condition, which has a huge impact on those associated with it.</p><p>As I said during the committee&#8217;s meeting on 15 November, which is when the petition first appeared before us, I have had the opportunity over the past few years to speak to members of the MS Society in Lanarkshire. I have been surprised to hear that those who suffer from both MS and pernicious anaemia are subject to a variety of medical treatments by their GPs and other medical practitioners. Indeed, variations in treatment occur not only between, but also within GP practices, with some GPs or practice nurses following the SIGN guidelines and others treating patients on an individual basis, according to need.</p><p>It is clear that, while three-monthly treatments, as outlined in the SIGN guidelines, may work for some, they definitely do not work for everybody. That raises serious questions about whether the SIGN guidelines are fit for purpose.</p><p>The focus must be on the individual. We must put the individual at the centre of managing symptoms that can have a huge impact on their lives. Every person is different and requires treatment to manage the symptoms associated with their condition, and they can react differently to the medication they receive and the efficacy of the benefit derived.</p><p>In written evidence to the committee, NHS Lanarkshire noted that only in exceptional situations would vitamin B12 be administered more frequently than on a three-monthly basis. Based on evidence heard by the committee and on my experience, I suggest that many patients require treatment on a much more frequent basis, depending on the nature of their condition. It is therefore crucial that all relevant best practice guidelines are reassessed to guarantee that patients&#8217; needs are best met.</p><p>I look forward with interest to the results of the Pernicious Anaemia Society&#8217;s survey of the experience of its members&#8212;I understand that it is due to be published this spring. Such research will be critical in moving the debate forward and will go some way to improving our collective understanding of not only the condition as it affects sufferers, but the problems faced by carers in seeking assistance from medical professionals.</p><p>In his evidence to the committee, Martyn Hooper, the executive chair of the Pernicious Anaemia Society, stated:</p><p>&#8220;The test for pernicious anaemia is about 50 per cent accurate, but vitamin B12 deficiency is current in about one in 10 of the population.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 15 November 2011; c 232.]</p><p>That is extremely worrying.</p><p>I realise that pernicious anaemia is a complex condition and that the symptoms can easily be mistaken for other neurological conditions, such as MS. However, problems with testing have resulted in patients having to wait for years to be correctly diagnosed, which can consequently lead to devastating health and social problems.</p><p>I thank the Pernicious Anaemia Society for and congratulate it on its production of the film &#8220;Living with the Fog&#8221;. It is clear that more work must be done to raise awareness of pernicious anaemia and vitamin B12 deficiency.

In fact, any debate that highlights low pay and its connection with poverty should be of interest to all members and people beyond the Parliament. The consequences of poverty&#8212;especially its complexities&#8212;still blight many of our communities.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report clearly shows the context and scope of the various living wage campaigns, which are somewhat diverse in nature. They have clearly had an impact on the national minimum wage rate, which is set by the Low Pay Commission and is currently &#163;6.08 for workers aged 21 and over. The Scottish living wage is currently calculated at &#163;7.20 per hour.</p><p>As I have stated previously in the chamber, 29 organisations in London&#8212;including the mayor of London Boris Johnson, the Greater London Assembly and Barclays Bank&#8212;have fully embraced the implementation of a living wage. Darren Johnson, a Green Party member in the Greater London Assembly, made a freedom of information request, which was published in March 2009. He found that only four London boroughs out of 32 were incorporating the living wage into their procurement policies. However, with the Olympics approaching, things have moved on and many authorities in London are now adopting the living wage as a formula for calculating contracts.</p><p>Although the Scottish Government and other public sector employers, such as many local authorities, have endorsed the living wage, it is not enshrined in statute, unlike the national minimum wage.</p><p>The committee spent a considerable period of time in its inquiry on procurement issues. Those are critical to the implementation of the living wage because, if it were to be stipulated in procurement contracts, employers would be contractually obliged to pay their employees at that rate or face action for breach of contract.</p><p>That brings us to EU procurement law and, as the committee&#8217;s report highlights, possible European restrictions on, and challenges to, stipulating that the living wage be incorporated into all public sector contracts. The relevant law&#8212;the public sector, or classic, directive 2004/18/EC&#8212;was implemented in Scotland by the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006. The key principles behind the directive stipulate that EU member states or &#8220;contracting authorities&#8221; must award contracts on the basis of commercial, non-discriminatory and objective criteria.</p><p>I note that the committee&#8217;s report refers to the submission by Mr McGuire&#8212;a partner in Thompson Solicitors&#8212;that payment of the living wage could be included as a contract performance clause. The report further states that the Scottish Government has written to the European Commission on that, and I await with interest the Commission&#8217;s response.</p><p>The committee recognised that much more needs to be done, although the living wage is to be welcomed as part of a policy mix for tackling in-work poverty that needs to be flexible but not confused.</p><p>Promoting a living wage requires better policy co-ordination. That is highlighted in the recommendation that</p><p>&#8220;the Committee &#8230; calls on the Scottish Government to use its experience, expertise and good relationship with COSLA and with local government generally to seek to encourage the further introduction of the living wage&#8221;.</p><p>As a society, we have to tackle the problem of poverty&#8212;particularly in-work poverty&#8212;at source, take every step that is necessary to eradicate that blight on Scotland and urge the UK Government to ameliorate some of its excessive policies when dealing with poverty.</p><p>As part of my long-standing contribution to the discussion about having a diverse policy mix, I have stated in the chamber previously that it could be argued that due consideration should be given to the idea of a citizen&#8217;s basic income, which would reduce the stigma associated with benefit take-up, for example. Moreover, it could be argued that a living wage may fail to tackle poverty. Under the present system, a living wage and consequent increases in workers&#8217; incomes could lead to a reduction in entitlement to working tax credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit, leaving workers again in a poverty trap.</p><p>I welcome today&#8217;s debate and its focus on advancing approaches to address poverty, particularly in-work poverty. I look forward not only to a day when all public bodies and authorities adopt the living wage for all employees but to a day when the living wage becomes the standard rate throughout the private sector and when we as a society can eradicate in-work poverty and poverty for all citizens in Scotland. I look forward especially to the debate that will take place in the chamber next Thursday evening on a motion that John Park has lodged, which will allow us to advance further arguments and consider the issues around the private sector&#8217;s failure to protect not only the pay of its workforce but its pensions and other benefits.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest.

During that debate, the Government, as well as many members, highlighted the investment opportunities and economic opportunities that having that bank in Scotland would provide.</p><p>In its fresh thinking and its programme for government, the Scottish Government has quite rightly spelled out the need to modernise and energise the industrial landscape of Scotland. The recent unemployment figures clearly show that much more needs to be done on aiding the economic recovery and growing the economy. The figures for unemployment were up in December 2011, and there is a time lag on those figures. It is worth observing that the Office for National Statistics shows that, at 4.1 per cent in January 2012, the jobseekers allowance claimant count, seasonally adjusted in Scotland, is the same as it was in January 2011.</p><p>With regard to future indicators, it is worth highlighting the Bank of Scotland&#8217;s latest purchasing managers index, which is for January. It highlighted further increases in output, with the PMI up from 51.2 per cent in December 2011 to 51.4 per cent in January this year. Growth was underpinned by activity in Scotland&#8217;s private sector, increasing for the thirteenth month running in January, with the overall pace of expansion picking up at its fastest rate for four months.</p><p>The purchasing managers index report highlights that new business in Scotland is increasing at a solid rate, with service providers witnessing strong month-on-month increases in new business and new work growing at a robust pace.</p><p>Looking to the future, I believe that there is more that the Scottish Government can do, although Scotland needs the tools for the job of investing in the built environment.</p><p>With regard to getting Scotland to move forward, the need to attract significant investment is fundamental, and the Scottish Government has signposted its commitments, in particular the need to advance a Scottish growth strategy that focuses on growth sectors and marketplaces.</p><p>This debate on Scotland&#8217;s economy and recovery must be put in the context of the harsh political agenda that the UK coalition Government is developing, with its focus on cuts being essential. The &#163;2 billion cut that households in Scotland are predicted to undergo as a result of the proposed Welfare Reform Bill clearly indicates the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to those living in the poorest households in Scotland. The autumn statement of 2011 was focused on growth, but the reality is that the facts did not bear that out. Growth is flat, and the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast is for a UK growth rate of 0.7 per cent this year.</p><p>Only additional tax and spending powers for the Scottish Government and Parliament will do the necessary job of stimulating economic growth in Scotland. A key undertaking of the Scottish Government is to deal with the realities of renewing Scotland&#8217;s growth prospects.</p><p>As I have stated previously in the chamber, maintaining the principle of the public pound is vital to achieving best practice, with procurement an important component. It is even more relevant today, given the current economic setting, especially with the on-going eurozone troubles continuing to influence the economic growth prospects of the UK and the rest of the world. The Scottish economy&#8217;s growth prospects and the Government&#8217;s strategic policy objectives do not operate in a policy vacuum.</p><p>Scotland is severely constrained under the current devolved settlement. That is even more apparent given the changes to the Scottish block grant that the UK Government has announced.</p><p>The growth of Scotland&#8217;s companies has been severely tested by the recent economic environment and individual sectors have been increasingly exposed to current economic trends.

I also welcome the mainly consensual nature of the debate in the chamber.</p><p>Before I move on to the main part of my speech, I want to refer what Kevin Stewart said about the role that Aberdeen has played. I was reminded that in the 1970s, when oil exploration was first taking place in the North Sea, the UK Government of the day decided to locate its main oil department&#8212;Britoil&#8212;in Aberdeen. Therefore, there is a history of UK Governments realising the benefits of locating departments near or close to energy resources.</p><p>That situation links to the issue of the green investment bank&#8217;s location. I recognise that the UK Government&#8217;s criteria for the location of the bank are centred on ensuring that it has international links, a financial centre and, of course, good research capacity. As Gavin Brown said, there are 11 universities within an hour&#8217;s journey of Edinburgh, many of which play a vital role in renewable energy and low-carbon developments. The Scottish Government has placed the low-carbon economy at the heart of its economic strategy&#8212;I believe that that is how we should look forward as a nation&#8212;which should fit well with the policy context of a green investment bank.</p><p>The Scottish Government previously set out the need to harness renewables. That was followed up by practical action in the form of the national renewables infrastructure fund, with a commitment of up to &#163;70&#160;million. In highlighting the job opportunities from the development of green investment in Edinburgh, we should be aware that the report prepared for the UK Government&#8217;s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills by Vivid Economics in October 2011 clearly emphasises the importance of unlocking finance and ensuring the implementation of green economic objectives. There is more that all of us&#8212;including the energy companies&#8212;can do to take us in the direction of an economy that is based on sustainable growth, on which the Government can deliver through the detail of its policies.</p><p>Given its respect agenda, the UK Government should recognise that the City of London, although an important international financial centre, is not the only financial capital in the UK. Locating the green investment bank in Edinburgh would ensure that a highly trained workforce with specialist expertise was utilised to the full. Edinburgh has expertise in asset-backed financial services that maintains its pre-eminence in fund management.</p><p>The Scottish Government has shown its commitment to meeting targets under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The location of the green investment bank in Scotland would assist creation of a necessary step change in low-carbon delivery. The development of a green economic strategy aims to make Scotland&#8217;s economy more resilient and capable of resisting the volatility that is associated with ever-increasing energy prices.</p><p>Promoting growth that is sustainable in the long term is vital in taking Scotland forward. A sustainable economy is dependent on achieving capital injections. The report produced by Vivid Economics stated that investment by pension funds in renewables is rare and referred to two Danish pension funds taking a 50 per cent stake worth $1.1 billion in Denmark&#8217;s largest offshore wind farm as an exception. According to a 2011 KPMG report, only 20 per cent of industry experts expected pension funds to play an active role in renewable energy over the following 18 months.</p><p>I hope that the siting of the green investment bank in Edinburgh will lead many fund managers to realise that they could start investing pension funds and other finances that are available to them in the economic and environmental developments that are required if we are to meet our green targets.</p><p>Scotland has a role on the global stage, given that it has a quarter of Europe&#8217;s offshore and wind energy potential. I note that the aim of the Scottish Government&#8217;s low-carbon economic agenda is that 60,000 jobs will be created by 2020. The prospects for Scotland&#8217;s green economy are healthy, particularly given the financial context that the global low-carbon economy is forecast to grow to &#163;4.3&#160;trillion in the next four years.</p><p>I hope that the establishment of the green investment bank in Edinburgh will ensure that companies are able to tap into growing market sectors of the economy, such as renewables.</p><p>A key component of ensuring that Scotland has a global reach is a real sense of renewal in respect of Scotland&#8217;s capital infrastructure needs. The Scottish Government is committed to developing the climate challenge fund, and funding of &#163;10.3&#160;million is in place for 2011-12. That will no doubt ensure that Scotland develops an international profile for its development of a greener economy.</p><p>The debate is timely. I look forward to the green investment bank being sited in Edinburgh. I hope that we can develop a financial context that delivers an energy future that ensures real benefits for the Scottish people. I also hope that Scotland can not only play a major role in developing low-carbon technologies in Europe but become a powerhouse for capital investment funding for energy production in Europe. That can be achieved if we get the green investment bank in Edinburgh and are able to drive forward the low-carbon economy that Scotland is striving to create. The &#163;3 billion from the green investment bank would ensure that we had the funds to stimulate the involvement of other financial sectors in the development of low-carbon technologies.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the motion in the name of Fergus Ewing and the debate initiated in the name of the Scottish Government to have the green investment bank located in Edinburgh.

It is worth acknowledging that the Scottish Government&#8217;s emphasis differs from the UK Government&#8217;s approach to business regulations and especially from the UK Government&#8217;s somewhat prescriptive highlighting of the importance of deregulation.</p><p>The importance of regulation should not be diminished. After all, a somewhat poor and lax UK regulatory framework gave us the financial banking crisis that has caused the systematic problem that has impacted on the global economy, the consequences of which we must all live with. Even now, confidence in the financial system is not especially helped by recent events, such as the demise of the MF Global financial group, whose client moneys are unaccounted for.</p><p>The Scottish Government has a better-regulation policy, which of course focuses on sustainable growth. Many business organisations complain to me about business bureaucracy that puts roadblocks in their way. As in most things in life, it is the little things that matter for enterprises such as south Dalziel church studio, in Motherwell&#8212;a good, local social enterprise&#8212;which cannot publicise itself effectively because of restrictions that the local authority planning department has placed on it.</p><p>The regulatory review group&#8217;s report this year takes up that issue&#8212;I am disappointed that the minister is not in the chamber to hear this point. The report states:</p><p>&#8220;We will also continue our work with Local Authorities and COSLA although the future of the Regulatory Forum, including the work of the 5 work streams, remains unclear. Local Authorities play a key role in delivering better regulation across a wide area for businesses so have to be engaged and fully committed to the five key principles of better regulation. Consistency is one aspect which is central to that.&#8221;</p><p>My colleagues David Thompson and Angus MacDonald, also made that point.</p><p>Work must be done with other agencies and local authorities to ensure that the regulations introduced by this Parliament are carried out as they were intended to be and not as defined by 32 different local authorities or&#8212;as we heard in an earlier example&#8212;by head teachers in various schools deciding on what local policy on health and safety should be. Work should be carried out consistently throughout Scotland. When examining the future of the regulatory framework, we must be careful about what we wish for. A consistent approach to regulation is needed, and I know that that is a key principle for the Scottish Government.</p><p>In contrast, the UK Government seems to want to get rid of red tape. No one likes red tape, but that emphasis on deregulation can be extremely dangerous. Significantly, the employment regulations announced in the autumn statement involved reviews of tribunal hearings and a shortening of the collective redundancy process. Loosening employment protection legislation is not a guaranteed way of creating jobs. In fact, the evidence suggests that there is little correlation between job protection laws and actual employment levels. With regard to laying firm foundations, it is worth observing that the World Bank put the UK on a high rating for ease of doing business. Some people might say that the perception of an overregulated economy does not quite match the reality.</p><p>The Scottish Government still has lessons to learn, and the support offered by the regulatory review group will be invaluable in supporting better regulation. The group&#8217;s 2011 annual report states that it has worked with organisations that enabled it to progress matters. It notes in particular the work that it has undertaken with SEPA. We need to address the problems identified by businesses, but that should involve a measured, fact-based approach, rather than opinion dressed as fact.</p><p>Regulation clearly has a role in any market economy, and a regulatory framework is also required to ensure that matters are conducted in a transparent manner. As I have said, we need to strike a balance between the interests of business and those of the wider society. The Scottish Government has a good track record of ensuring that the practical priorities of business are given an increased focus. The development of an online, one-stop financial information service will signpost a better investment basis for Scotland&#8217;s business sector.</p><p>I look forward to the proposed bill on better regulation, and I embrace today&#8217;s timely debate. I hope that many of the issues that have arisen will be taken forward to create a regulatory framework that strikes the necessary balance between the vested interests of business and those of the consumer and wider society. I hope that it will not provide an excuse, under the guise of cutting red tape, to dismantle many of the advances that have been made in employment regulations and rights to protect workers in Scotland and the UK.

The issue is very important to me, as well as to other members present, as my wife was finally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988. MS is a debilitating illness that affects the lives of individuals and their families dramatically. The MS Society notes that almost twice as many women as men have MS. Scotland has the highest incidence of MS per head of population in the world. As yet, we have no national register of people with MS, so the numbers affected are not easily quantified, but we know that more than 10,500 people in Scotland have MS.</p><p>The first report on the MS incidence register, published in September this year, noted that of those diagnosed in 2010, 9 per cent had waited more than six years to have their MS diagnosed. Early intervention is crucial in tackling the onset of MS and, although there is no cure at this time, some referrals and admissions to hospital can be avoided through adequate early intervention and treatment. I understand that the assessment and treatment of MS are often complex, but that does not mean that we should not continue to strive for faster diagnosis and comprehensive support services for those living with MS throughout Scotland. The MS incidence register should provide a useful tool for redesigning services to ensure that they accurately reflect the needs of those living with MS throughout Scotland and, in turn, raise the standard of treatment.</p><p>The clinical standards for neurological health services, published in 2009, should, if adopted correctly, provide a higher quality of healthcare throughout Scotland, regardless of where individuals live, and eliminate the postcode lottery that has for too long denied many diagnosed with MS access to the best treatment available.</p><p>A number of excellent support services are available to people throughout Lanarkshire, including the Haven, which is based in Blantyre. It works with NHS Lanarkshire and other local support services to lead and deliver excellent support and advice programmes for those affected by MS and other long-term conditions, without the need for a referral. If an individual cannot travel, the Haven at home service brings highly trained professional services to where they are needed. The MS Society in Cumbernauld works in conjunction with the Haven and its staff, and so does the Revive MS Support centre in Glasgow, as part of its outreach work.</p><p>Airdrie hospice provides essential physiotherapy services and counselling for people in the area. NHS Lanarkshire now has in post a specialist MS nurse. That is crucial in providing advice and support to those affected by MS and is useful in promoting self-management of the condition, thereby avoiding hospital visits and admissions and preventing relapses. In accordance with the clinical standards, NHS Lanarkshire is meeting the minimum standard for a multidisciplinary team specialising in MS.</p><p>More must be done to support the holistic endeavours of initiatives such as the Haven, which gathers specialist knowledge of MS within a social model of care that is rooted in the community. In my experience, what is apparent is the lack of comprehensive information about what is available in the community. Services often fail to connect with the individual who is struggling to cope with their condition. The Haven must be congratulated on its information pack, which is now available to be given to people on diagnosis. People are vulnerable at that time, as they experience the emotional effects of being diagnosed. Those effects can be severe and can render people unable to process verbal information at the time.</p><p>Given the complex nature of MS, it is crucial that those affected are aware that symptoms may be linked to illnesses other than MS that can be treated, instead of jumping to the easy conclusion that MS symptoms have worsened. Self-management courses provided by organisations such as the MS Society offer individuals the opportunity to learn to manage their condition effectively in their day-to-day lives. We must ensure that those courses are widely available in order to keep people as well as possible.</p><p>The variable and fluctuating nature of MS itself makes life unpredictable for sufferers and their families. The condition affects people in many different ways and impacts on many different areas of their lives including work, relationships and families. Therefore, it is crucial that advice and support are offered to the family of those living with MS, as they will most likely take on the role of primary carer at various times. The Haven must be congratulated on the work that its children&#8217;s services do, providing fun activities that young carers would otherwise be denied.</p><p>I once again congratulate Rhoda Grant on bringing the debate to the chamber and look forward to a successful outcome in delivering MS services throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis (Better Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Rhoda Grant on securing this much-needed members&#8217; business debate.

I am pleased that the Scottish Government has highlighted the issue of how it needs to prioritise Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure in its detailed infrastructure spending programme.</p><p>The Scottish Government, in its current thinking and programme for government, has spelled out the need to reindustrialise parts of Scotland. When we consider the future, we see that there is more that the Scottish Government can do. However, Scotland needs the instruments to do the job of investing in our physical environment. In moving Scotland forward, it is vital that we attract investment, and the Scottish Government has flagged up its key commitments, especially the need for a Scottish growth strategy, focused on growth sectors and markets.</p><p>This debate on the impact of the autumn budget statement on Scotland&#8217;s economy and on the targeting of capital investment has to be put in the context of a highly political agenda being advanced by the UK Government, with the focus on cuts being all important. Economic commentators, especially Professor Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College, have criticised the UK Government&#8217;s approach. The UK Government&#8217;s financial policies&#8212;with their focus on the age of austerity and &#8220;We are all in this together&#8221;&#8212;are starting to ring hollow. I note that last week, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was trying to downplay the impact that the UK Government&#8217;s budget cuts would have.</p><p>In considering the autumn statement, we can see that the promotion of growth is clearly not happening. In fact, growth is flat. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts a growth rate of 0.9 per cent this year, followed by 0.7 per cent in 2012. Overall, it is estimated that the autumn statement policy announcements will cost the Exchequer a mere &#163;30 billion in total over the next three years, from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Equally, Mr Osborne intends to pay for some of the increased infrastructure spending that he announced by lower spending on public sector pay and tax credits. During the three years from 2012-13 to 2014-15, the autumn statement will raise capital spending by &#163;3.76 billion, while current spending will be cut by &#163;3.82 billion.</p><p>The unionist parties have constantly failed to recognise that the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget has been cut by &#163;1.3 billion and that &#163;800 million of the cuts directly affect the capital budget elements in the Scottish Government&#8217;s financial settlement.</p><p>In that context, I welcome the UK Government&#8217;s recognition that, under the current legislative framework, the Scottish Government is severely limited in its borrowing powers. The Scotland Bill, which is undergoing parliamentary scrutiny and contains proposals to extend the current borrowing powers and introduce new capital borrowing powers from 2013, might be a step in the right direction. The proposed transfer of additional powers on taxation and spending to the Scottish Parliament is welcome.

Although the motion that we are debating today did not receive the same level of support, the issue that Jim Eadie has brought to our attention is not about who the monarch wants to marry; it is a wider issue about a 300-year-old act that is still being imposed on Scotland and the rest of the UK and about meaningful discrimination against Roman Catholics which, as other members have said, relates to other debates in Parliament to address some of the worst aspects of sectarianism in our society.</p><p>David McLetchie was right. We can download the speeches from 1999 and see that Lord James Douglas-Hamilton gave an award-winning speech, in which he raised some very important points. He asked whether there should be legislation that blatantly discriminates against a Christian religion. That comment and the rest of his speech should be read by every member so that they are aware of the issues that were being discussed in 1999 and which we are still trying to resolve 12 years later.</p><p>The current position is quite clear. The heir to the throne can accede to the throne if he or she marries someone of any faith, or even an atheist, but not a Roman Catholic. Jim Eadie is correct in his assertion that the proposed reforms for the monarchy that were announced at the Commonwealth heads of Government meeting in Perth, Australia do not go far enough. It is worth noting that, although Parliament discussed the matter 12 years ago, we are still no further forward in resolving the issue.

We still have to take the debate forward.

That should include not relying solely on prescription drugs as the automatic default position for treating those with mental health conditions.</p><p>As part of the consultation exercise, it should be noted that people who live with family members who suffer with mental health conditions are not always provided with the necessary support, which can, and often does, leave them vulnerable.</p><p>To provide a comprehensive approach, it is crucial that local authorities and other public agencies work closely with local services on the early detection and treatment of mental health issues, particularly in the education system. The 2009 Audit Scotland report on mental health services noted that one child or adolescent in 12 has a mental health problem.</p><p>A focus must be placed on implementing effective preventative measures for young people who are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems, who include those who live in deprivation, children who are in care and young offenders. More must be done to recognise vulnerable children and to ensure that, when they are identified, adequate child and adolescent mental health services are provided. The NHS Health Scotland children and young people&#8217;s mental health indicators that are due to be published later this year might well provide useful insight into that.</p><p>Training people in the education system to recognise and support young people who display signs of mental health conditions would be an effective way of ensuring that quick referrals are made to the relevant services and would provide familiarity at what is already an anxious time for young people.</p><p>The need to continue to consider the range of services that are available for the prevention of suicide remains apparent. Through the choose life programme, organisations such as SAMH are working with the Scottish Government to reduce the suicide rate by 20 per cent by 2013. Suicide rates have been on a downward turn, but there continues to be a significant problem, particularly for males. In 2010, the male suicide rate in Scotland was just under three times that for females. SAMH has drawn attention to the fact that suicide prevention training should be expanded beyond the NHS to include the wider community, given that people who attempt suicide may not necessarily have been in previous contact with the mental health system.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the Scottish Government&#8217;s strategy for the future is being developed despite substantial cuts at Westminster. Therefore, attention must also be paid to the effects that changes to the welfare system may have on those who suffer from mental health problems in Scotland.</p><p>In 2010, a report by the University of Glasgow entitled &#8220;Scotland Incapacity Benefit Claimant Profile&#8221; said that 45 per cent of incapacity benefit claims were made on the basis of a mental health condition. The changes brought about by the UK Government&#8217;s Welfare Reform Bill will have a significant impact in areas such as North Lanarkshire, where an estimated 19,900 people claim incapacity benefit. Of that total, 8,620&#8212;or 43 per cent&#8212;have been identified as having a mental health condition.</p><p>In a letter that was printed in The Guardian on 31 May 2011, leading mental health charities and senior consultants from the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed serious concerns about the rapid rate of incapacity benefit reassessment resulting in a huge amount of undue distress to people with mental health problems. There are real dangers that the complex nature of mental health problems will not be accounted for through work capability assessments, and it is crucial that everything that can be done is done to alleviate those concerns.</p><p>I welcome the debate and the contributions that have been made across the chamber, and look forward to our developing a strategy that encapsulates all the issues that members have identified.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mental health is a vital issue that deserves to be discussed, particularly given the growing recognition that one in four people in Scotland will experience a mental health problem in their lifetime&#8212;a figure to which some members have referred.

The Scottish Government has previously spelled out the need for harnessing renewables. That has been followed up by practical action in the form of the national renewables fund, with the commitment of &#163;70&#160;million.</p><p>At this point, it would be remiss of me not to put on record my acknowledgement of the substantial contribution that was made by Jim Mather when he had ministerial responsibility for enterprise and energy in the previous session of Parliament, particularly in terms of what he did to highlight the job opportunities that are presented by the development of a low-carbon economy in Scotland.</p><p>All of us&#8212;individuals, energy companies and the Government, in terms of its procurement policies&#8212;can do more to secure a low-carbon economy. Therefore, I am heartened that this Government has carried on the good work that it started when it published its discussion paper, &#8220;Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland&#8221;, in March 2010.</p><p>The Scottish Government has shown its commitment to meeting targets that are associated with the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Equally, the development of a low-carbon economic strategy will aim to make Scotland more capable of resisting the volatility that is associated with ever-increasing energy prices.</p><p>The future is clearly tending towards a low-carbon economy, and that is even more apparent when we consider the aim to have almost complete decarbonisation of road transport by 2050.</p><p>Promotion of long-term sustainable growth is vital to taking our country forward. A low-carbon economy is part of that sustainable and growing future. Of course, the future of Scotland&#8217;s energy needs should not and does not include nuclear energy as part of the energy mix.</p><p>This is an opportune debate with regard to Scotland having a role on the global stage, given that we have a quarter of Europe's offshore and energy wind potential. In that regard, I note the aims that the Scottish Government has set out in &#8220;A Low Carbon Economic Strategy for Scotland&#8221;, which states that 60,000 jobs could well be created by 2020, including 26,000 jobs in the technologies that are associated with low carbon.</p><p>The prospects for Scotland&#8217;s low-carbon economy are healthy, particularly in the context of the global low-carbon economy&#8217;s being forecast to grow to &#163;4.3&#160;trillion in four years' time.</p><p>As I stated previously in the chamber, Scotland is severely constrained under the current devolved settlement. That is even more apparent with regard to the topical issue of transmission charges. The present charging system discriminates against the Scottish interest. That is apparent when we consider the heavy price that must be paid to connect to the UK national grid.</p><p>Energy, including renewables, is one of the growth sectors that have been identified and links up with the new strategic priority of a transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>I welcome the pledge to introduce a single point of information for businesses on Government financial support. An online one-stop finance information service is a development that will signpost a better investment approach for Scotland&#8217;s business sector and companies that might wish to locate in Scotland. Hopefully, that will ensure that companies will focus on growing market sectors of the economy, such as the low-carbon economy.</p><p>In addition, a key component of ensuring that Scotland has a global reach is to ensure that we develop a sense of renewal in respect of Scotland's infrastructure. Associated with that development is the substantive aim of making Scotland a leading centre of low-carbon investment.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government is committed to developing the climate challenge fund, and that funding of &#163;10.3&#160;million is in place for 2011-12. That will no doubt ensure that Scotland develops an international profile in terms of the low-carbon economy.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to caution the Government not to rush to meet its targets by approving waste-to-energy plants, such as the proposed pyrolysis plant in Coatbridge. Those developments must be treated with caution, and any approvals should be subjected to severe scrutiny to ensure that we do not follow the wrong pattern on the wrong investment in the wrong developments in Scotland.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is timely, and I look forward to the progression of many of the issues that we are discussing this afternoon in the coming months and years. We can develop a programme that delivers a low-carbon society and brings real benefits for the people, especially those on low incomes. Scotland can play a major role in developing low-carbon technologies, and it can become a powerhouse for future energy production in Europe.

An example of such funding is the establishment of the &#163;70&#160;million national renewable infrastructure fund, which will aid the delivery of 28,000 jobs. There is more that the Scottish Government can do in examining the future, but Scotland needs the tools to do the job of investing in our human capital as well as the physical investment.</p><p>Promoting growth that is sustainable in the long term rails against the increasing short-termism that some key financial institutions have exhibited. That said, I am encouraged that people in the City of London are now actively talking about kilt-edged, rather than gilt-edged, securities that can be launched as a way for people to invest in Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure needs. That was reported in the Investors Chronicle on 14 June 2011. The need to attract investment is paramount, and the SNP&#8217;s manifesto flagged up key commitments, especially the need to take forward a Scottish growth strategy. The debate on that&#8212;especially on targeting capital investment&#8212;represents a welcome one on Scotland&#8217;s direction, although it must be put in the context of a highly political agenda that the UK Government is advancing, with a focus on a plan A of cuts being all-important.</p><p>Many economic commentators, including ex-members of the Bank of England&#8217;s monetary policy committee&#8212;most notably, Professor Blanchflower&#8212;have criticised the UK Government&#8217;s approach. The UK Government&#8217;s plan lacks the necessary flexibility, despite the assertion by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, that an element of flexibility is built into the UK Government&#8217;s financial planning assumptions. It is notable that the UK growth figures are being constantly revised downwards almost daily&#8212;or so it appears.</p><p>The UK political parties have consistently failed to recognise that the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget has been cut by the UK Government. Moreover, &#163;800&#160;million of those cuts directly affect the capital budget elements in the Scottish Government&#8217;s financial settlement. In that context, I welcome the UK Government&#8217;s recognition that, under the current legislative framework, the Scottish Government is severely limited in its borrowing powers, to put it mildly. The proposals to extend the current borrowing powers in the Scotland Bill, which recently progressed in the UK Parliament, and to introduce new capital borrowing powers from 2013 are a step in the right direction, but that step should have been taken earlier.</p><p>A key Scottish Government undertaking is to deal with the practicalities of renewing Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure. On 26 May 2011, the First Minister stated in the chamber that investment is critically important in the process of renewal and regeneration. He referred to investment that</p><p>&#8220;will prepare our nation to meet the challenges of the future.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 26 May 2011; c 70.]</p><p>The Scottish Government does not operate in a vacuum with its legislative programme and key policy objectives. There is a need to recognise that household budgets are under severe strain with inflationary pressures. Gas prices have increased by more than 80 per cent over the past five years, and electricity prices have increased by almost 55 per cent over the same period. Fuel poverty is an important issue&#8212;even more so when we consider the aim to eradicate it by 2016. When that target was set, nobody expected that rising prices and falling earnings would draw more people into fuel poverty. I welcome the First Minister&#8217;s commitment to the social wage, as outlined in his speech.</p><p>The growth of Scotland&#8217;s companies has been severely tested in the recent economic climate, with certain sectors being increasingly exposed to the economic downturn. That has, in turn, led many small and medium-sized enterprises to use short term or variable debt, such as business overdrafts. I therefore welcome the &#163;55&#160;million that has been allocated through the Scottish loan fund, because that is real money that will have a direct impact, on the ground.</p><p>I appreciate the need for today&#8217;s debate and hope that many of the issues that have arisen will be taken forward in the coming months and years, that we can develop a programme and strategy that benefits all sections of Scottish society and that the Opposition parties, both in the chamber and outside, are prepared to engage constructively with the Scottish Government and its programme to drive forward real benefits for all of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate, which has been initiated by the Scottish Government, and I am glad that it has highlighted how it intends to move Scotland forward through its programme for government.

It was clear that not all local authorities have taken a vigorous approach to landlord registration. I know that discussions have taken place with legal authorities about prioritising prosecutions in relation to registration, where the law has been flouted.</p><p>Members are only too aware of their own experiences of private rented housing and of their constituents&#8217; experiences. The Local Government and Communities Committee generally agreed on the principles in the bill, but that was not achieved without clarification of the proposals as outlined.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s fundamental aim is to provide detailed regulation of the private rented housing sector, which will secure tenants&#8217; rights in that increasingly important sector of the housing market. As I said in the stage 1 debate, the committee recognised that</p><p>&#8220;overcrowding is a significant and serious issue&#8221;.</p><p>In practical terms, concerns have been raised about the implications of how the bill tackles overcrowding and about the obligations on local authorities. In its stage 1 report, the committee detailed the concern about whether local authorities will have the financial resources to make the bill work in practice.</p><p>At stage 2, the bulk of the examination of the bill related to overcrowding statutory notices. The Government allayed the concerns that were noted at stage 1, and two non-Government amendments were agreed to.</p><p>In considering the mechanics of a bill&#8217;s progress, it is always necessary to remember the hard-fought campaigns that people and organisations have undertaken to shine a light on the problems that they deal with daily. As part of the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s work, I&#8212;along with Frank McAveety and Anne McLaughlin&#8212;made a visit to Govanhill that showed us that people and communities still face landlord blight and that communities are prepared to call time on shameful and, to be frank, unpleasant landlord practices.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee was presented with clear evidence of the scale of disputes between landlords and tenants in the private sector. Illegal evictions and repairs that had not been undertaken were only a few of the problems that were highlighted in evidence sessions.</p><p>Part 4 of the bill enables a private landlord to apply to the private rented housing panel for assistance in accessing property to comply with the repairing standard. That is welcome. Part 4 also requires private landlords to provide tenants with a tenant information pack, which is a welcome measure and will help tenants to understand their rights and landlords&#8217; obligations under tenancies.</p><p>Mary Mulligan referred to private landlords and obligations in relation to carbon monoxide testers, as well as monitors for gas and electrical equipment. I, too, make a plea for any future Government that comes in to look at the installation of hard-wired fire alarms. A Strathclyde Fire and Rescue report states that the majority of fatal fires in 2009-10 occurred in flats and that there were a total of 23 preventable deaths in house fires in the local authority areas that constitute the Strathclyde area. That is an obligation that should be put on private landlords and other landlords.</p><p>In terms of making communities safer, I hope that the bill will make landlords aware of their responsibilities.</p><p>Although the bill will address some of the concerns that have been identified about what can be described, at best, as a level of consumer dissatisfaction with private sector landlords, extra diligence by local authorities is required.</p><p>I welcome the stage 3 debate and the bill&#8217;s key principles. I look forward to the bill coming into force, as I believe that it will have a positive effect in reducing the number of rogue landlords. It is important to understand that the bill is aimed at rogue landlords; it is not aimed at the vast majority of landlords who carry out their duties, work with tenants in a meaningful way and provide a useful service to Scotland.</p><p>I thank all those who provided both written and oral evidence during the various stages of the bill. I also thank the committee clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre, the minister and his civil servants, and my colleagues on the Local Government and Communities Committee, who have made this a worthwhile bill.

It is unfortunate that we debated similar issues this morning.</p><p>Since its formation in 1999, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust has sought to improve the lives of people who live in coalfield communities and has targeted its resources on the most deprived 20 per cent of areas. The trust has benefited from more than &#163;15 million from the Scottish Executive and Government since its inception. That has enabled it to conduct valuable work in areas including Fife, Clackmannanshire, the Lothians, East Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and my area of North Lanarkshire to increase access to employment and lifelong learning and to promote community welfare and support services.</p><p>In many parts of Fife, Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, former mining communities suffer from deep-seated poverty as a consequence of the mining industry&#8217;s demise. Depopulation is also a factor. The narrow economic base in those areas makes them far more susceptible to the worst effects of the economic downturn, which shows little or no sign of easing in the near future, in the present economic climate.</p><p>The trust has awarded &#163;371,000 of funding to 25 projects in North Lanarkshire since April 2008&#8212;the average award per project is just under &#163;15,000. The trust channels much-needed funding into community projects, but the 2009 EKOS report &#8220;Evaluation of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust Activity in Scotland&#8221; notes that the trust&#8217;s influence goes far beyond direct funding to assisting groups with organisational and service infrastructure, which enhances those groups&#8217; long-term prospects.</p><p>Key projects throughout North Lanarkshire have made a difference to the community. Funds have been given to groups and organisations. In December 2008, over &#163;85,000 was given to Glenboig Neighbourhood House Life Centre to support its work over a two-year period. Members of the neighbourhood centre are in the gallery tonight. I should declare that I, too, am a member. The funding helped to further develop plans for a new custom-built centre and a community transport scheme for the village where I live.</p><p>Since 2008, there has also been support for the Gartcosh parent and toddler group and Auchengeich Amateur Boxing Club, alongside large funding for St Patrick&#8217;s Furniture Project, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Unemployed Workers Centre and Recap in Cumbernauld. I must also not forget the &#163;4,893 that went towards the building of the Auchengeich memorial garden. On 20 September 2009, the First Minister unveiled a plaque in the garden to mark the 50th anniversary of the pit disaster that took the lives of 47 miners. As Helen Eadie indicated, we owe a debt not only to the miners who gave their lives to deliver coal for the people of Scotland but to former miners who live on today and to the families of the miners who gave up their lives.</p><p>As the only organisation that is devoted solely to the social and economic regeneration of coalfield communities, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust has successfully channelled substantial investment into community-led project activity in coalfield areas in my constituency and throughout Scotland. However, there is no doubt that more still needs to be done to improve the lives of those living in these areas. Scotland has an industrial heritage of which we should be proud. It is essential that no community should be left behind. Deprivation in Scotland continues to be disproportionately concentrated in coalfield communities and it is therefore fundamental, particularly at present, that these communities are supported to ensure a viable future. That would be for the benefit of older and future generations. I look forward to the continued work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.</p><p>I come to my advert of the evening, Presiding Officer. In addition to supporting the Glenboig Neighbourhood House Life Centre, I support the funding bid that the Auchengeich retired miners group is making to re-establish the bowling green in the area. That will help the sustainability of Auchengeich Miners Welfare and Social Club, of which I am proud to be a member.</p><p>Clearly, these are emotional issues and emotional times. We have to ensure that the Scottish Government finds the resources to allow the work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust to continue. That support is needed by future generations in these communities. As I indicated, many of these communities are isolated from the main towns and cities of Scotland. They have to have support. The financial support that has been provided over the past 12 years has been a substantial element in allowing these communities to develop their own strategies and centres. It has allowed communities to take forward the issues that are most important to them.

The committee&#8217;s role has evolved down the years. In 2009, at the end of a year-long inquiry, the committee produced a report on the public&#8217;s perception of the petitions mechanism.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee is an important committee of the Parliament, particularly given that it is regarded as one of the main public access points for the Parliament. That is why it is critical to demonstrate positive engagement with the public. As other members have stated, the committee has examined petitions that have increased awareness of important issues, such as the petition that examined domestic violence against men and the one that highlighted housing conditions in the Govanhill area of Glasgow. The committee visited Govanhill as part of its inquiry.</p><p>The committee has never been shy about considering how it can work better. The committee commissioned research from Ipsos MORI, which followed on from a well-established principle that the committee adopted in 2006. Ipsos MORI used the methodology of qualitative research among the general public, with an emphasis on how the process works. The research identified an understandable link between awareness and knowledge of the petitions system. It also found that the Parliament&#8217;s approach needs to be more innovative, but that its use of e-petitions was commended. However, we must ensure that progress is maintained.</p><p>As members have mentioned, the Public Petitions Committee has a good track record of going to other parts of Scotland&#8212;no other committee has done so much work throughout Scotland&#8212;which has ensured that the Parliament does not become Edinburgh-centric. Those external committee meetings had open microphone sessions to gather the views of the public who attended.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee strives to be open and transparent. It must ensure that it meets that important aim, especially because, in interviews conducted by Dr Carman, who looked at the work of the committee between 1999 and 2006, interviewees were concerned about a perceived lack of transparency and the lack of an appeals process.</p><p>The committee has played a role in political reform, which is why other Parliaments have shown such an interest in its workings and the workings of the petitions process. I notice that, a couple of days before the Irish general election, Fine Gael has adopted the policy of establishing a public petitions system in the Irish Parliament.</p><p>There has been a welcome development, in that some local authorities have considered establishing public petitions committees in their areas. For example, Renfrewshire Council has moved that forward. Many of the issues that are brought to the Public Petitions Committee could and should be dealt with locally. Many petitions that have come before the committee while I have been a member of it have been about matters that could have been addressed at a more local level.</p><p>The many petitions that come to Parliament allow the public to make representations to Parliament on a range of issues, whether they are Scottish or international in origin. It is important that petitions are not restricted, especially when it comes to the issue of devolved versus reserved matters.</p><p>I welcome this interesting opportunity to debate the role and work of the Public Petitions Committee. We need to ensure that we have a strong, modern public petitions mechanism that is meaningful to the people of Scotland. I look forward to the Public Petitions Committee continuing to take forward issues of importance to the people of Scotland, no matter how obscure, national or international they are. I, too, put on record my thanks to the other members of the committee, the committee clerks and all those who gave evidence and provided the committee with written evidence during the past three and a half years.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions Committee"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members in the chamber&#8212;committee members and the many members who have come through the doors on a Tuesday afternoon to support petitions from constituents and others&#8212;will make their own observations on the operation of the Public Petitions Committee.

However, it should be noted that the 2007 local government elections were held under the new single transferable vote ballot.</p><p>The Gould report reviewed the general administration of the 2007 elections and made several recommendations. The report is quite clear in advocating the separation of parliamentary and local government elections. The decoupling of those elections was enacted in the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2009.</p><p>The holding of a referendum on the alternative vote and the elections to the Scottish Parliament on the same day runs the substantial risk of doing a disservice to the public in Scotland. It is not as if we have not been in this situation before.</p><p>Although the Electoral Commission&#8217;s response to recent developments was not wholly negative, it maintains that</p><p>&#8220;The Government must support the Commission in putting in place a robust process to ensure ... planning for 5 May 2011&#8221;.</p><p>Furthermore, the commission states that</p><p>&#8220;Adequate provision must be made for appropriate public awareness&#8221;</p><p>to support voters&#8217; understanding of the voting process.</p><p>The same point could have been made four years ago in the run-up to the Scottish Parliament elections. Lessons must be learned from the previous elections, and the Gould report on the 2007 elections states quite clearly that there was cause for serious concern about how the elections were conducted throughout Scotland. The Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill attempts to address the need for change and challenges some of the antiquated election practices that we use. Clearly, the Parliament believes that the decoupling of elections is the way forward.</p><p>It is bad enough to hold the alternative vote referendum on the same day as the 2011 election, courtesy of the UK&#8217;s Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill&#8212;we face the prospect of the coalition Government driving through the referendum as policy. However, as part of the coalition of the willing partnership agreement, the UK Government is also committed to holding the UK elections on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections are scheduled to take place in 2015.</p><p>As I said in the chamber on 9 October 2008, &#8220;Scottish Council Elections 2007: Results and Analysis&#8221; by Bochel and Denver, which was published by the University of Lincoln in 2007, offers some useful background to provide context for the debate.</p><p>I welcome the general principles of the bill.

I should also at this point put on record that I would have preferred the various pieces of housing legislation to be covered in one comprehensive housing bill but, as a mere back bencher, my suggestion fell on deaf ears.</p><p>The main policy thrust behind the bill is to amend the private landlord registration scheme and to improve tenancy rights for private rented tenancies. The bill contains important provisions, particularly on addressing problems of overcrowding. On a Public Petitions Committee visit, I, along with the then convener and constituency member, Frank McAveety, and my committee colleague, Anne McLaughlin, saw at first hand the intolerable and frankly inhumane conditions that some families are having to endure in the private rented sector in Govanhill.</p><p>That said, the Local Government and Communities Committee&#8217;s report sets out concerns about whether local authorities have sufficient financial powers to make the legislation work in practice. The current maximum &#163;5,000 fine for letting, or attempting to let, a property without being registered is not acting as much of a deterrent. Under the bill, however, the maximum penalty for being an unregistered landlord will increase to &#163;50,000. In the past, local authorities have been less energetic in their approach to private landlord registration but the bill, I hope, indicates a desire to adopt a more proactive approach.</p><p>As a councillor in the past and now as an MSP, I know that many areas have been wrecked by the proliferation of buy-to-let landlords and their letting agents, who are not always concerned about legal statute and have no commitment either to other residents in the area or, indeed, to the area in which they let properties.</p><p>The fact is that we must address the issue of unregistered landlords. Indeed, in its report &#8220;Landlord registration in Scotland: three years on&#8221;, Shelter Scotland rightly highlights issues that are faced by many private sector tenants, including repairs not being carried out, problems with hidden fees, and illegal evictions. Evidence to the Local Government and Communities Committee made it clear that not all councils are properly using the fit-and-proper-person test that is set out in current legislation, and that enforcement action by local authorities is at best patchy and in some cases non-existent. The committee&#8217;s report on the bill states that the committee</p><p>&#8220;remains ... concerned that there is a lack of consistency across the country&#8221;</p><p>in that respect. For example, North Lanarkshire Council has not issued any penalty notices and, as has already been mentioned, in Edinburgh only one case involving a private landlord has been successfully prosecuted.</p><p>I also point out that, each year, a significant amount of housing benefit goes into the private rented sector. In the North Lanarkshire Council area, which I represent, there are 4,620 private sector recipients of housing benefit and it appears that, based on the average award, a total of &#163;422,000 is allocated to the private rented sector in that area alone.</p><p>The bill proposes to provide detailed assurances for all private sector tenants. In committee, I was struck by how much the need for such a provision was evidenced by those who responded to the consultation on the bill, especially in relation to the quality, safety and impact of HMOs that breach planning law.</p><p>At this point, I caution members that they should not confuse HMOs with the issue of overcrowding; they are distinctly different matters. The committee report states:</p><p>&#8220;overcrowding is a significant and serious issue&#8221;,</p><p>and a number of organisations, including Shelter Scotland and the Scottish Council for Single Homeless, were concerned that the problem of homelessness might be exacerbated if local authorities do not have a duty to deal with people who are displaced through an overcrowding statutory notice. In its report, the committee seeks the Government&#8217;s assurance that it will assess and review any potential impact on homelessness.</p><p>The bill also attempts to address tenants&#8217; concerns about what they can expect with regard to rent payments; the introduction of the compulsory tenant information pack will go some way towards achieving that aim.</p><p>I note from press reports on Monday that the minister announced the new Tenancy Deposit Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2011, which aim to protect tenants in the private rented sector from having their deposits wrongly withheld by landlords and letting agents. I seek clarification from the minister about why that laudable aim is not part of the bill. I look forward to greater scrutiny of the regulations at a later date.</p><p>I welcome the stage 1 debate and the broad principles in the bill, and I look forward to its coming back to the Local Government and Communities Committee for further scrutiny. I thank all those who provided written and oral evidence on the bill, as well as the minister, the committee clerks and my colleagues on the committee.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In speaking in this debate at stage 1 of the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill, I should say first of all that I have examined the issue not only as a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee but as a member of the Public Petitions Committee, which considered a petition on a range of housing issues, particularly private rented housing sector problems in the Govanhill area...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Wilson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80405", "house": "4", "member_id": "80405", "person_id": "14120", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Central Scotland"}, "section_id": "22643591", "hpos": "267", "gid": "2011-01-27.37.13", "epobject_id": "22643604", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-01-27.37.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14120+section%3Asp#g37.13", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80405"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member give way?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Wilson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80405", "house": "4", "member_id": "80405", "person_id": "14120", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Central Scotland"}, "section_id": "22643591", "hpos": "276", "gid": "2011-01-27.37.22", "epobject_id": "22643613", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-01-27.37.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14120+section%3Asp#g37.22", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80405"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member give her party&#8217;s view on the United Kingdom Conservative and Liberal Democrat Government&#8217;s policy of starting to cut benefits by 10 per cent for people who have been unemployed for a year or more?</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member give her party&#8217;s view on the United Kingdom Conservative and Liberal Democrat Government&#8217;s policy of starting to cut benefits by 10 per cent for people who have been unemployed for a year or more?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Wilson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80405", "house": "4", "member_id": "80405", "person_id": "14120", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Central Scotland"}, "section_id": "22643591", "hpos": "280", "gid": "2011-01-27.37.26", "epobject_id": "22643617", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-01-27.37.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14120+section%3Asp#g37.26", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80405"}, {"body": "<p>I take this opportunity to thank members who have signed my motion, which recognises the importance of St Andrew's day and encourages more public bodies throughout Central Scotland to recognise it as a public holiday.</p><p>Held on 30 November each year, St Andrew's day commemorates Scotland's patron saint and was made a Scottish bank holiday as a result of the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007. The bill generated an unprecedented level of support in the Parliament, with 75 MSPs from all parties signing up to support the proposal within one month of its introduction, and the Parliament subsequently passed it unanimously at stage 3.</p><p>However, the 2007 act fell short of Dennis Canavan's intentions. Although St Andrew's day does now constitute a bank holiday in Scotland, the act made it voluntary, so employers are not obliged to give their employees time off. The act states that, if St Andrew's day falls on the weekend, the St Andrew's day bank holiday should take place on the following Monday, 1 or 2 December. It was hoped that, as more employers granted St Andrew's day as a holiday, pressure would be put on other employers to do the same. That has not been the case, despite the fact that Dennis Canavan's consultation exercise generated 85 per cent support from the respondents.</p><p>Some employers recognise St Andrew's day as a holiday, including the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government, which give staff a bank holiday&#8212;albeit that they will do so on different days this year, with the Scottish Parliament closing on Friday 3 December, while the Scottish Government has chosen to give staff Monday 29 November as the St Andrew's day holiday. The Scottish Government used St Andrew's day in <place-holder colnum=\"30985\"/> 2008 to mark the beginning, and St Andrew's day in 2009 to mark the end, of Scotland's homecoming celebrations, the Government-sponsored year of events marking the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns's birth.</p><p>However, local authorities have been reluctant to grant the same benefit to their staff, with only a few offering it as a bank holiday. The answer to a parliamentary written question from Margo MacDonald in November 2009 highlighted the fact that only Angus Council, Dumfries and Galloway Council, Scottish Borders Council and Renfrewshire Council acknowledge St Andrew's day as an official school holiday. Aberdeen City Council makes it an in-service day to allow pupils to celebrate with a day off. That highlights the fact that, at present, the local authorities throughout Central Scotland do not adhere to the principles of the 2007 act by providing a holiday, although individual schools hold celebrations in various forms to acknowledge St Andrew's day.</p><p>The ad hoc basis on which the act is being applied in Scotland does little to suggest that a blanket approach will be achieved without further legislation to make 30 November a compulsory bank holiday in Scotland. Granting full bank holiday status to St Andrew's day would bring Scotland into line with many other countries in Europe. More than 90 per cent of countries in Europe mark their official national day with a public holiday, including Bastille day in France and unification day in Bulgaria. St Patrick's day became an official bank holiday in Ireland under the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903 and is celebrated both north and south of the border, as well as by many cities in north America.</p><p>Full public holiday status for St Andrew's day would not only allow Scots to celebrate their much-recognised national identity, but would bring Scotland more into line with other European countries in terms of narrowing the public holiday gap.</p><p>The potential economic benefits that could be generated in sectors such as retail, tourism and entertainment by more organisations providing St Andrew's day celebrations as a bank holiday is also an important consideration. In 2005, the Scottish Retail Consortium estimated that retail sales on a bank holiday can increase by as much as 80 per cent.</p><p>All Scots are proud to acknowledge their national identity and to celebrate Scotland's fantastic history. Having been confirmed as patron saint of Scotland in the declaration of Arbroath in 1320, St Andrew has become a figure who is widely recognised as part of Scotland's heritage, and he is reflected in the national flag, which embodies the St Andrew's cross.<place-holder colnum=\"30986\"/></p><p>St Andrew's day is used by the Scottish Trades Union Congress every year to raise awareness of diversity throughout Scotland. It reflects a day of national importance with a march and rally in Glasgow.</p><p>St Andrew's day is celebrated by people all over the world, in much the same way as people celebrate St Patrick's day, but workers and those in the education system here are not granted the same privilege of a day off to celebrate. It is therefore disappointing that it might be true that St Andrew's day is celebrated to a greater extent by people outside Scotland.</p><p>I congratulate all the organisations and communities throughout Scotland that have organised events over the coming days to celebrate St Andrew's day.

The timing of this debate is crucial. In 2010, the roof over someone's head should be a right, not a privilege.</p><p>It is worth noting that since the stage 1 debate, the private rented sector provisions have been removed and included in the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill. The main policies of the <place-holder colnum=\"29931\"/> bill are the improved regulation of social housing and the right-to-buy reforms.</p><p>Many social landlords need to do more with regard to the promise to eradicate homelessness by 2012. For example, North Lanarkshire Council effected 162 evictions between April 2009 and March 2010. Only three of those were for reasons relating to antisocial behaviour; the rest were for rent arrears, and it is debatable whether those evictions were based on genuine rent arrears or on technical arrears. The Scottish Government has, quite rightly, placed an emphasis on whether more could be done to protect tenants of social landlords. In March 2010, the consultation document, \"Eviction of Tenants in the Social Rented Sector\" was published. That led the Government to introduce amendments that strengthen tenants' rights by introducing pre-action requirements before eviction proceedings.</p><p>With regard to the spirit of the bill, in the shape of the reform of the right to buy, the bill proposes to end the right to buy for all new tenants, with the removal of the right to buy from newly supplied social housing. I and some other members sympathise with those who wanted to go further with the restriction of the right to buy.</p><p>It is good to see the last vestiges of Thatcherism in Scotland continuing to defend the right to buy, despite the housing waiting lists bulging with families looking for four and five-apartment cottage-type housing&#8212;the very homes that were snapped up with a 60 per cent discount under the right to buy. That is a concept that the Conservatives have continually promoted. Although my committee colleague David McLetchie pontificates about the benefits of the right to buy, he has never addressed the social costs of the right to buy and its impacts on Scotland.</p><p>The bill also establishes the Scottish housing regulator and its functions. I am satisfied that the bill ensures that the regulator has the primary role of regulating the housing functions of local authorities. Ensuring the good practice and performance of social landlords is a key element of the bill.</p><p>On the intention to move to risk-based and proportionate regulation, I, like some of my fellow committee members, have some reservations about the lack of inspections. Anyone who has read the reports of a registered social landlord's inspection visit knows that they are valuable for scrutiny purposes and are published for everyone to see. As the committee stated, self-assessment must be a meaningful, robust and transparent process that fully involves all tenants.</p><p>The bill's intention to give the Scottish housing regulator detailed powers to set performance <place-holder colnum=\"29932\"/> targets for social landlords is most welcome. On analysis, it has been an issue for me for some time that, when local authorities talk about sharing services, there is a need for an approach that places the emphasis on housing associations coming together, particularly against the current economic backdrop. I am assured that the proposal to extend the period for pressured area status from five to 10 years, together with local authorities self-designating rather than relying on ministerial approval, will speed up the whole process.</p><p>The storm clouds continue to gather, especially considering the impact from the UK Government's comprehensive spending review and emergency budget. As I stated in the chamber in June, the proposal to cut by 10 per cent the housing benefit paid to anyone who is registered as unemployed for more than a year will not be reversed. The Prime Minister seems determined not to give concessions on that cut, and the assessment of local housing allowance by the Department for Work and Pensions means that the average loss will be in the region of &#163;9 to &#163;12 per week as a result of the emergency budget.</p><p>In finishing, I say that it is good to see the bill go forward today but, like others in the chamber, I have been slightly disappointed. We could have taken a more radical approach and had a comprehensive housing bill before us. As other members have said, there are issues in housing that need to be tackled, particularly in the private rented sector. I hope that the new bill that the Government has proposed will do that.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21052573", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members know that housing is important; it is one of the priorities of our daily postbag and our surgeries.

Its discussion paper, \"Housing: Fresh Thinking, New Ideas\", correctly refers to some <place-holder colnum=\"28621\"/> interesting questions associated with the challenges to a large number of people who are on waiting lists, and with how housing can act as an economic driver.</p><p>In examining why the Scottish Government has launched its discussion on housing and issues surrounding the housing strategy, we must consider the historical backdrop. Over the past 30 years, the UK Government has had repeated policies of large-scale voluntary stock transfers, which have produced many changes in provision. Moreover, in the recent past, there was a push by the previous two Scottish Executives towards large-scale voluntary transfers of public-sector housing, marketed as community ownership. Some people might say that that was pushing the concept of community ownership a bit too far.</p><p>In terms of the consultation paper, \"Investing in Affordable Housing\", there has been criticism that the housing association grant has been reduced. Currently, registered social landlords such as housing associations do not have to comply with the centralised rent-setting regime. Although some housing associations&#8212;especially those that have expanded through stock transfer&#8212;can calculate annual rent increases according to the retail price index plus 1 per cent, a great many housing associations do not set their rents at RPI plus 1 per cent. The housing association grant is a public subsidy, and when it was introduced it was not supposed to be there for ever and a day. Throughout the previous Administration, the grant was on a downward path.</p><p>That issue ties up with the wider issue of housing affordability. In the current financial climate, people cannot afford rents at the current rates in the private rented sector; therefore, more people on waiting lists will look to social housing to obtain a house. In the area where I stay, North Lanarkshire, the number of applicants on the housing register as of 31 March 2007 was 12,851 and the number of applicants on the register at 31 March 2009 was 17,698&#8212;an increase over the period, despite the fact that North Lanarkshire Council tried to change the housing waiting list criteria for people who were applying for a council house. In that context, I welcome the fact that the consultation paper highlights the need for fairer rents although, as I stated earlier, rent setting is limited to landlords.</p><p>The Scottish Government does not operate in a vacuum in setting its policy objectives. As members have said this morning, Scotland is constrained under the current devolved settlement. That is even more apparent in the housing benefit changes that were announced by the UK Government in its June 2010 budget. A more responsive and effective welfare system will not be achieved through arbitrary changes in <place-holder colnum=\"28622\"/> housing benefit, whereby anyone who is in receipt of jobseekers allowance will have their housing benefit reduced by 10 per cent after being unemployed for 12 months or longer.</p><p>Although some members welcomed and supported the right-to-buy legislation that was introduced in 1979, it has meant increased waiting lists for council housing since it was enacted, and that has clearly impacted on local authorities' ability to meet the homelessness targets that have been set for them under the current Scottish housing legislation. The burden of responsibility to house people who present as homeless currently lies with local authorities, which has real implications for the tenants who are on the authorities' housing waiting and transfer lists. I have a constituent who has been waiting 18 years for a house transfer but keeps being told by the local authority that they cannot get the house that they are after because someone has presented as homeless and is a greater priority for the local authority. My constituent ends up losing out and not getting a transfer.</p><p>As stated by Gavin McCrone and Mark Stephens in their 1995 publication, \"Housing Policy in Britain and Europe\", the housing structures in Scotland are unique. Both those academics advocate a position of tenure neutrality. I suggest that, in Scotland, we have for far too long had a tenure policy rather than a fully structured housing policy.</p><p>Scotland has been severely tested by the recent economic climate, and households in all sectors have been increasingly exposed to the economic downturn, which has led to significantly higher levels of short-term or variable debt. Since 1997, personal consumption has been correspondingly more sensitive to interest rate movements, which has affected people's ability to service their mortgage payments at any given time. The repossession rates in Scotland are therefore likely to increase, although we have not seen the level of repossessions that was expected and had been predicted. Such an increase will place further strains on the provision of housing, particularly in the social rented sector.</p><p>I welcome today's debate and look forward to many of the issues that arise being taken forward in the coming months and years. We can develop a real housing strategy that benefits all sectors in society, and we can offer individuals real choice and opportunity so that they can choose the tenure and ownership sector that they want rather than having it forced on them through the provision of whatever housing is available.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997167", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The present Scottish Government has brought a number of housing debates to the chamber since May 2007, and I am glad that the trend has continued.

I believe that the Scottish Government is attempting to develop a realistic approach to summary justice reform, and the report by Sheriff Principal Bowen contributes to that process. Like other members, I <place-holder colnum=\"27768\"/> do not bring to the debate a legal background, and it has been some time since I was a member of the Justice Committee.</p><p>In the summary justice reform model that it produced in 2007, the Scottish Government set out that it wanted to improve the effectiveness of the courts in Scotland and to ensure that only cases that should go to court do so. In essence, Sheriff Principal Bowen's report gets to the heart of substantial legal issues. It raises the prospect of legal aid provision for jury and sheriff cases being reviewed, which would support the timely resolution of such cases.</p><p>Although I do not have a legal background, I have some knowledge of legal issues, especially in the context of modern workplace and employment law. I believe that Sheriff Principal Bowen's recommendation on the introduction of a new compulsory business meeting to bring together the Crown and the defence to discuss a case at an early stage in proceedings will result in a fundamental change for the better, as others have said. If justice in the wider context is to warrant continued public confidence, it must be seen to work smarter and more effectively.</p><p>By establishing a wide-ranging reference group at each stage of his review, Sheriff Principal Bowen quite rightly embedded ownership of the review, while recognising that the role of sheriffs in dealing with serious criminal cases has changed over the past 20 years. There has been a substantial change in the complexity and volume of cases. By 2008, the number of persons indicted for proceedings in the sheriff court had risen to 8,022.</p><p>Sheriff Principal Bowen quite rightly commented on existing good practice by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in local areas and gave the example of the good-practice initiatives that the COPFS in Inverclyde undertook, which were rolled out nationally.</p><p>As others have said, the report makes a number of practical recommendations, which include, significantly, widening the use of television links between courts and prisons, making greater use of standby arrangements for witnesses and ensuring continuity of sheriffs in cases.</p><p>The Scottish Government has recognised the growing demand for change in procedural matters. The review of sheriff and jury procedure builds on the experience of the Bonomy and McInnes reviews. Modernisation should be welcome. Despite the desire to ensure that uncomplicated cases are disposed of more quickly, the review had to be mindful of the need to ensure that there is robust assessment of more complex matters.</p><p>Some people may say that, against the backdrop of the aim to simplify dealings, Sheriff <place-holder colnum=\"27769\"/> Principal Bowen indicates that there could well be a case for bringing sheriff court processes in step with High Court procedures by introducing preliminary hearings, which have reduced the number of abortive trial diets, with resultant savings to the court services. However, Sheriff Principal Bowen did not recommend that as a necessary step change because he did not believe that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the essentially simple issues in a large number of Sheriff Court cases justify elaborate and lengthy pre-trial hearings.\"</p><p>The costs associated with the legal system have been much in the spotlight, and I know that the intention of the review is to seek longer-term savings.

I know from the experiences of my constituents that there is nothing worse than people taking time off to undertake their civic duty. A key recommendation is to cite witnesses to give evidence in a case only once it is known that it will proceed to trial. That will, I hope, ensure an element of trust and reduce the level of inconvenience to people who are constantly being called away from their place of work when they are not required to give evidence.</p><p>As others have already said, such necessary procedural changes will, we hope, mean that the proposal of statutory time limits for sheriff and jury cases in line with the 140-day limit in the High Court will guarantee better benefits.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20862522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive Question Time &#8212; Health and Wellbeing: \"Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the cabinet secretary on the motion.

In my experience, those problems relate largely to housing issues.</p><p>As other members have said, the Local Government and Communities Committee held a number of evidence-gathering sessions when considering the bill. The bill's main policy thrust is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to improve the value that social housing delivers for tenants\".</p><p>That includes reform of the right to buy and improved regulation.</p><p>Some aspects of the bill aim to put into legislation the recommendations that were made by the repossessions group regarding protection of unauthorised tenancies. Although there was cause for concern regarding the power to introduce secondary legislation, as the Local Government and Communities Committee says in its report, I know that the Scottish Government will endeavour to produce more detailed proposals now that the repossessions group has made its recommendations clear.</p><p>The committee recognised that much more work needs to be undertaken on the landlord registration aspects of the bill. The Government proposes to increase the penalty for an unregistered landlord to &#163;20,000. It is clear that a less-than-robust approach has been taken towards private landlords in the past. That said, <place-holder colnum=\"27605\"/> the recent announcement by the Scottish Government of increased investment in Govanhill indicates its desire to adopt a more proactive approach.</p><p>I know from the experience of my constituents that many areas are blighted by a proliferation of buy-to-let landlords who are not concerned by antisocial behaviour legislation&#8212;or by any legislation, for that matter. Unregistered landlords need to be dealt with. During evidence sessions, it became apparent to the committee that enforcement action by local authorities under the landlord registration scheme is patchy at best&#8212;in some places, it is non-existent. For example, in one year, South Lanarkshire Council issued 334 rent penalty notices, whereas North Lanarkshire Council issued none. The figures also show that there were no reports to procurators fiscal by any Scottish local authority regarding any private landlord.</p><p>I come now to the meat of the bill and the reform of the right to buy. I might be one of the Stalinist tendency to which David McLetchie referred&#8212;although I do not often call myself a Stalinist. The Conservatives' homage to privatisation in the form of the right to buy is clear. The figures cited in the committee's report indicate a complete reversal of fortune for public authority housing provision, with only 326,000 dwellings in 2009 in comparison with more than a million dwellings in 1979. I argue&#8212;and have stated in the chamber previously&#8212;that we have had not so much a housing policy as a tenure policy in the past. The home-owning democracy that was promoted from the 1980s comes at a significant and, at times of economic uncertainty, increasingly human cost.</p><p>The bill proposes to end the right to buy for all new tenants. As a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee, I was struck by the support for that proposal from witnesses and people who responded to the consultation. The bill also attempts to address some of the concerns about service delivery for tenants, especially where tenant participation is regarded as a box-ticking exercise, rather than as effective community empowerment.</p><p>Best practice and performance among social landlords are key elements of the bill. The role of the Scottish housing regulator will have real significance.</p><p>Many housing associations are undertaking financial viability exercises and, in relation to scrutiny, I have been concerned for some time that many RSLs that operate in the same locality are paying high salaries to directors or chief executives. Remuneration levels in the sector are high: for example, &#163;48,000 to &#163;57,000 for a director of a housing association with a stock of about 300 houses. The February 2009 issue of <place-holder colnum=\"27606\"/> <em>Social Housing </em>highlighted the issue of salaries among the top 25 Scottish RSLs. On average, staff costs increased by 8.5 per cent in 2008. The proposal to give the Scottish housing regulator detailed powers to set performance targets for social landlords is to be welcomed.</p><p>I note from yesterday's emergency budget that housing benefit will be capped at &#163;250 a week for a one-bedroom property and at &#163;400 a week for a four-bedroom property, although the UK Government was referring mainly to rent levels in London. Yesterday's announcements also contain a proposal to cut by 10 per cent the housing benefit that is paid to anyone who has been registered as unemployed for more than a year. That will have a significant impact on income levels for local authority provision and the registered social landlord sector.</p><p>I welcome the stage 1 debate and the broad principles of the bill, and I look forward with interest to scrutinising the amendments that the Government and members will lodge at stage 2. I thank everyone who provided written and oral evidence. I also thank the committee clerks, SPICe and colleagues on the committee, who assisted me in reaching a better understanding of the issues that the Parliament must tackle to resolve some of the major housing issues in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20861155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In today's debate, members will draw on their own experiences, especially of dealing with constituents who come to their surgeries with a range of problems.

However, providing similar services to male victims of violence in the home would ensure that all victims of such violence are catered for with the vital services that they desperately require.</p><p>The Scottish Government has recently taken a small but significant step to provide a service to male victims. On 17 April this year, the men's advice line was extended to cover Scotland, as well as operating in England and Wales, as was the Respect helpline, which aims to assist perpetrators of domestic abuse in changing their behaviour. However, much more needs to be done to ensure that male victims are provided locally with services that meet their needs and, importantly, that mainstream services that regularly come into contact with victims of domestic violence&#8212;such as the police, social work, housing, health and victim support&#8212;are trained to recognise the needs of male victims as well.

Training and services tend to adopt a gendered approach, reflecting higher reporting by female victims. That approach has a negative knock-on effect, in that it reinforces the proposition that only women can be victims of domestic violence while assuming that generalised services will meet the needs of male victims. For example, I was concerned by the written response that the Public Petitions Committee received from the social work services at the City of Edinburgh Council.

It is also worth reinforcing the point that the Scottish Government deserves credit for creating a degree of sustainability for local government budgets. The relationship between COSLA and the present Administration has been enhanced by the concordat and remains strong.</p><p>Council tax rates have been frozen by all councils since 2008-09, and additional funding of &#163;70 million has been included in the budget settlement for each year, including 2010-11. Over four years, the council tax freeze will have saved the average council tax payer &#163;240. Each local authority will receive money in addition to its 2010-11 revenue allocations. Most noteworthy is the fact that councils are entitled to a share of the &#163;70 million for maintaining the council tax freeze. The fact that moneys are being made available for the council tax to be maintained at current levels should be welcomed by all members, especially in the current financial downturn.</p><p>It must be recognised that local authorities have had on-going problems in levering in capital receipts. The shortfall in capital receipts is a problem for local government, but it is clearly not <place-holder colnum=\"25218\"/> unusual given the recessionary pressures in the current marketplace. Arguably, a council tax freeze ensures that councils throughout Scotland are required to maintain prudent financial management so that they better manage the additional resources that are being made available by the Government. For example, the total revenue support of &#163;667 million for North Lanarkshire Council is not a sum to be dismissed lightly.</p><p>The base budget for my local authority&#8212;North Lanarkshire Council&#8212;shows that, in the period up to 2010, efficiency savings of &#163;15 million were achieved. Thanks to the present Scottish Government, such efficiency savings are retained by the local authority, unlike previously, when budget settlements clawed back any efficiency savings. The retention of those savings enables further investment in strategic priorities and increased service provision, as deemed necessary by each local authority.</p><p>In local government in Scotland, there is an on-going debate, especially when we approach a new financial year or an election, about whether enough money is being made available. There has been much discussion of resource allocation, but it is worth stating that local government expenditure will rise in cash terms by 2.93 per cent in 2010-11, despite a real-terms 1.3 per cent cut to the Scottish budget.</p><p>I assert that local authorities need to provide much more clarification on the extent to which risk management procedures are in place. Indeed, I would argue that existing budgets that are already in place should be prioritised, with recourse to take account of best practice.</p><p>The argument of many local authorities on the settlement is, to my mind, more about garnering more monetary resources than it is about utilising existing resources better. A number of issues are worth further examination. Performance-related pay in local government is an issue of real concern to me. Scrutiny of the parameters that have been set on PRP suggests an increasingly self-serving approach. In 2008-09, PRP payments in North Lanarkshire totalled &#163;192,000. That issue needs to be addressed, especially if the right tone is to be set against the current financial backdrop. Given that people quite rightly criticised the level of executive pay in the banking sector, as was witnessed in various Treasury Select Committee hearings at Westminster, local government performance management and executive pay merits future analysis and detailed scrutiny. Unfortunately, sometimes perception is reality.</p><p>I support the amendment order and look forward to its being approved this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20756486", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2010"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In examining the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2010, it is important to recognise the contribution of the cabinet secretary, who has accelerated the Scottish people's key priorities in terms of financial outcomes.

Members will be well aware of their constituents' problems in retaining their home, particularly in the current economic climate, and Cathy Jamieson portrayed them eloquently. I am glad that there is general agreement in the chamber on the need for measures to avoid home repossession wherever possible.</p><p>The main driver of the Scottish Government in bringing forward the bill was to offer greater protection to the home owner. Clearly, that is desirable, particularly given the economic backdrop to the debate. In practical terms, the bill aims to put into legislation in part 1 of the bill the recommendations of the repossessions group and in part 2 proposals in respect of bankruptcy. The bill aims to enhance debtors' rights under the Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001 by extending protection to people in all repossession cases that involve residential property.</p><p>The stage 1 debate saw recognition that agreement differed on the provisions in part 1 and part 2. During the bill's passage, a number of members said that the Council of Mortgage Lenders' figures on repossessions needed to be made available in Scotland. I was reassured when the Scottish Government said that it was endeavouring to pursue the matter by writing to the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Financial Services Authority to get the figures for Scotland prepared and released. Like the minister, I express my disappointment at the Council of Mortgage Lenders' decision not to release the figures. Clearly, the Council of Mortgage Lenders <place-holder colnum=\"23745\"/> does not understand the role of Government and Parliament in dealing with housing issues in Scotland.</p><p>As I said in the debate on the bill back in December 2009, behind the repossession figures there is \"a human price\". Significant issues remain with loans that are secured against the family home. Concern has been expressed that the process will be overly bureaucratic&#8212;lenders claimed as much. Secured creditors are concerned about the potential additional costs of raising repossession cases in the courts. However, financial lenders and institutions need to be aware of the wider demands of society. There is no point in simply talking about corporate social responsibility; they have to do some real work on that theme, particularly in relation to debt.</p><p>Importantly, the committee supported the principle of enshrining the pre-action requirements in legislation so that they would have legal force. The bill imposes a clear obligation to ensure that the lender has considered alternatives to repossession before it raises an action. The bill addresses some concerns that have been identified in England and Wales about the process of voluntary pre-action protocols where borrowers have limited redress to lenders. The overarching objective of the bill is clear and unambiguous protection for vulnerable home owners.</p><p>Part 2 is probably the most contentious aspect of the bill. One provision, the certificate for sequestration, aims to introduce a new route into bankruptcy that does not require a debtor to show insolvency. A debtor will be able to apply to an authorised person for a certificate, with which they can petition for bankruptcy. The Government acted on committee concerns that further information should be sought on the work that would be required of the Accountant in Bankruptcy and on its new role in the route into bankruptcy provisions. I welcome the fact that the minister acted on his commitment: amendment 43 at stage 2 leaves it open to insolvency practitioners to take on that work. It is worth noting that the Government said that it is committed to continued dialogue with the credit reference agencies on their concerns about the need for all necessary information to be included in the register of insolvencies.</p><p>I welcome the stage 3 debate and the key principles that are contained in the bill. I look forward to the bill being passed at decision time. I believe that it will have a positive effect in reducing the number of domestic repossessions in Scotland.</p><p>I put on record my thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence during the stages of the bill. I also thank the clerks, SPICe, the ministers&#8212;Alex Neil and Fergus Ewing&#8212;and <place-holder colnum=\"23746\"/> my colleagues on the Local Government and Communities Committee.

In the current economic climate, there is a need for measures to avoid home repossession.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee held a number of evidence-gathering sessions in its examination of the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill. The bill builds on the establishment of the debt action forum and its discussions since January this year. Part 1 aims to put into legislation the recommendations of the repossessions group and part 2 contains proposals on bankruptcy.</p><p>As the committee details in its stage 1 report, there was cause for concern about whether the consultation on the bill was adequate, particularly as there was no formal three-month consultation period. The committee acknowledges that there is a difference between parts 1 and 2 of the bill and, on balance, believes that the consultation on part 1 was sufficient.</p><p>In the evidence sessions, it became clear to the committee that the repossession figures that the Council of Mortgage Lenders produces should be made available for Scotland. That is why paragraph 113 of the committee's report notes:<place-holder colnum=\"22376\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee is very concerned that the Council of Mortgage Lenders is not able to provide figures relating to the numbers of repossessions in Scotland.\"</p><p>As some members will remember, since the 1980s, there has been a cry to establish a home-owning democracy in Scotland. However, that comes at a price, especially in times of recession, and it is a human price. Behind the repossession figures there is a human face that we need to reflect on. I hope that the bill will go some way to tackling that. There are significant issues about other loans that might be secured against the family home. The spectre of redundancy hangs over everyone, and the fear of repossession hangs over many people at present.</p><p>Concern has been raised that the new processes will be overly bureaucratic. Some lenders claimed in evidence that they will not use them. However, the lenders should be aware of the demands from the wider community, who in turn actually own many of those financial institutions as taxpayers. Those same institutions want to foreclose and repossess the homes of people who are affected by the recession. Surely I am not alone in recognising the supreme irony of lenders advocating such a position in the current difficult economic times. It is important that the committee supported the principle that pre-action requirements should be enshrined in legislation so that they have legal force. The bill also attempts to address some of the concerns that have been identified with the process in England and Wales, where borrowers have limited redress to lenders.</p><p>There are capacity issues for money advisers and those who offer advice to people who are at risk of having their homes taken over by lenders. I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government has made available &#163;3 million for advice services, some of which will assist in funding representation for people who face the threat of repossession. The advice services that are funded must be available throughout Scotland.</p><p>Part 2 is probably the more contentious part of the bill. The measures on the certificate for sequestration aim to introduce a new route into bankruptcy that does not require a debtor to show insolvency. A debtor will be able to apply to an authorised person for a certificate that means that they can petition for bankruptcy.</p><p>It should be noted that a number of bodies with vested interests have issues with part 2. It was disappointing that the final report of the debt action forum stated that the stakeholders in the forum had varying views on the proposal to widen access to bankruptcy and to allow people to apply for their own bankruptcy. That report states that the proposal was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"supported by some Forum members.\"<place-holder colnum=\"22377\"/></p><p>The committee's stage 1 report states that further information should be provided on the work that will be required of the Accountant in Bankruptcy and its role in the new route into bankruptcy. The evidence to the committee, which is reflected in the report, centred on the financial costs. Blair Nimmo from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland noted in evidence that there will be a cost to the public purse and that the measures</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will increase the size of the public sector\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 4 November 2009; c 2565.]</p><p>I welcome the minister's commitment to consider the role of insolvency practitioners and the capacity issue relating to the Accountant in Bankruptcy.</p><p>Credit agencies raised concerns over whether the register of insolvencies will include all the necessary information. That led some to state in evidence that the bill could increase the cost of borrowing for Scottish consumers. The Local Government and Communities Committee and the Finance Committee acknowledge the concerns that have been highlighted and note the need to continue a dialogue with stakeholders who remain concerned about the financial suppositions, particularly in respect of the current role of the <em>Edinburgh Gazette.</em></p><p>I welcome the stage 1 debate and the broad principles in the bill.

It is important, when evaluating the committee's report, to acknowledge that the committee spent a significant amount of time examining the issue. As other members have stated&#8212;it is worth reinforcing&#8212;the committee concentrated its scrutiny on equal pay in local government, although there are, no doubt, many wider issues for other employers and sectors of employment.</p><p>The committee held evidence-gathering meetings on four separate occasions.</p><p>Before discussing the detailed findings of the committee's report, it is important to look carefully at the origins of the problem with equal pay in local government. As other members have stated, the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970. However, anyone with even a modest knowledge of the matter will know that equal pay is a complex issue, especially for local government.</p><p>A key issue that is identified and recognised in the committee's findings&#8212;this was highlighted during the evidence sessions&#8212;is the lack of significant progress on the issue, especially given that single status should have been implemented by April 2002. That date was not met and, according to COSLA, single status is still to be implemented by six local authorities&#8212;10 years after the original agreement. I am sure that the local government lobby has made, and will continue to make, representations on why that situation was allowed to happen.</p><p>Of course, the supreme irony is not lost on those of us who have experience in local government: local authority chief officers received a 14 per cent pay increase in the blink of an eye in 2002-03, on the back of the McIntosh report. Meanwhile, many lower-paid female workers are still waiting for their claims to be assessed. That is, perhaps, a case of priorities.<place-holder colnum=\"20161\"/></p><p>The failure to settle early has led to many legal aspects, including a number of legal rulings that have had an impact on equal pay and single status. That is particularly true of the July 2008 ruling on Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council v Bainbridge and Others, which centred on whether pay protection arrangements that favour male employees could be justified. In that case, the Court of Appeal ruled that such pay protection could not be justified, but it stated that the verdict was not a blanket ruling. In that context, it is no surprise that the committee report comments that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there appears to be no end in sight and that as soon as one set of problems is resolved, another set arises.\"</p><p>Therefore, the committee report recommends that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a payment matrix could be put together with the trade unions to deal with Bainbridge issues.\"</p><p>There was also a great deal of discussion in the committee on the need to equality-proof single status. That is also reflected in the report.</p><p>As the report details, the committee is concerned about the costs to local authorities arising from equal pay settlements. The committee wrote to all 32 councils to ask them a number of questions, including about their current position, but not all the local authorities responded. Many seemed to be reluctant to provide detailed information on key questions, in particular on the number of equal pay cases that have been settled and on the number that are outstanding.</p><p>I am satisfied that one of the committee's key recommendations is that all the relevant parties be brought together to discuss the settlement of claims at the earliest opportunity. It is worth noting that the Bainbridge judgment throws up potential cost implications for all local authorities. That said, there is a need for better planning by local authorities: for example, East Renfrewshire Council has made no provision for Bainbridge, whereas the City of Edinburgh Council confirmed that it has set aside between &#163;15 million and &#163;20 million over the next three years to meet the cost of Bainbridge claims.</p><p>In gathering evidence, the committee spent a considerable amount of time questioning witnesses. That was a useful exercise in drawing out some of the important points that needed to be scrutinised.</p><p>The conclusions in the committee's report highlight the committee's concern that&#8212;as Jim Tolson mentioned&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"these delays may have led to low-paid women workers losing out. These workers ..., as a result of the delays in settling, may have left or retired without being aware that they could make a claim\".</p><p>There has been a wider debate both inside and outside the Parliament on equal pay. The report's <place-holder colnum=\"20162\"/> recommendations seek further action to end discrimination. In getting to the heart of the matter to ensure that the issue moves forward, I am pleased that the committee emphasises the need to restore trust between all parties in the process. Once trust is lost, it is very hard to regain. Therefore, the landscape of equal pay in local government is difficult terrain. However, while the debate continues, the meter continues to tick. Every hour that goes by adds another potential hour of additional cost to equal pay settlements.</p><p>I welcome the general principles in the Local Government and Communities Committee's report. I thank the committee members, clerks and those who, by providing evidence, tried to ensure that the committee held a meaningful inquiry on equal pay in Scottish local government. I look forward to an early settlement for all concerned and I commend the report to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 1 October 2009: \"Equal Pay in Local Government\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I had some pleasure serving on the Local Government and Communities Committee during its inquiry on equal pay.

I served on the committee briefly as a substitute, but liked the experience so much that I asked to be a member.</p><p>Members will have their own experiences of how the committee deals with petitions. The emphasis of the inquiry into the petitions process was more on the public's perception of the mechanism&#8212;hence the reason for a year-long inquiry. The committee's report asks whether the inquiry was needed; the clear answer is yes. That need was even greater given that the committee is regarded <place-holder colnum=\"19861\"/> as one of the public's main means of access to the Parliament. The need to engage with the public is paramount.</p><p>As other members have stated, three principal issues were considered in the inquiry: the awareness of the existing process, participation levels and the essential role of the scrutiny that the committee undertakes. A significant amount of evidence was submitted during the inquiry, and the committee commissioned research. That followed a well-established principle, which the committee adopted in 2006.</p><p>The research study centred on public engagement and highlighted the innovative nature of the model that the committee has used&#8212;for example, e-petitions are allowed. Ipsos MORI used qualitative research among the general public as part of the methodology. The research identified a clear link between awareness and knowledge of the petitions system and people's reactions to it. It noted that, once participants in the focus group were informed of the main features of the petitions process, their reactions were fairly positive and they agreed that petitioning would be worth a try.</p><p>The fact that a petition that has only one signature can be discussed and commented on needs to be examined. Some people might say that more public support should be required before a petition is brought to the committee.</p><p>The inquiry process involved the committee going out to other parts of Scotland, rather than just meeting in the Parliament in Edinburgh. It was agreed that those external meetings would be in the south, west and north of the country. The committee must bear in mind the important aims of openness and transparency, to use two well-worn buzzwords in the modern political lexicon, and a key recommendation from the committee's point of view is that there is a requirement to develop public awareness and, especially, to promote the option of petitioners and others talking to us using videoconferencing. Not surprisingly, the committee also referred to promoting information on the process of public petitioning and meaningful engagement with communities.</p><p>I welcome the recommendation that local authorities should introduce petitioning processes. Marlyn Glen mentioned that. Renfrewshire Council and Stirling Council, for example, have taken that forward significantly. Another important political principle is accessibility, and proper decentralisation is vital to ensure that issues are aired and communities are effectively represented. Many petitions that have come before the committee during my membership of it are clearly on matters that could find a focus at a local level.<place-holder colnum=\"19862\"/></p><p>From the committee's perspective, I welcome the statement from Tricia Marwick on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on how it will support the redevelopment of the e-petition system and the use of other methods of communication with the public.</p><p>Soon, more than 1,300 petitions will have come to the Parliament. The public should be allowed to make representations to their Parliament on a range of issues, whether Scottish or international in origin. It is therefore important that petitions are not restricted, especially when it comes to considering devolved or reserved matters.</p><p>I appreciate the work that the committee clerks have done in delivering successful events throughout the country, and compliment the Parliament's education unit and broadcasting team, and, in particular, its security staff who have had to follow us around the country to enable external meetings. I welcome the report and have found it interesting to debate the role of the Public Petitions Committee.

Nevertheless, I welcome any debate in the chamber that focuses on low pay and poverty. It is shameful that the consequences of poverty, especially the complexities involving aspects of poverty, are still with us in our communities. The factors that drive poverty are more diverse but equally challenging. Progress on tackling poverty, particularly in the past 30 years, has relied on several devices. Governments have hoped that economic growth will trickle down to the poorest people in our communities or that the various welfare-to-work programmes will solve poverty without a change in the incomes of those who are in or out of employment.</p><p>The debate about the living wage moved forward in people's minds on 22 May when the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced that he was increasing the London living wage by 15p to &#163;7.60 an hour. Since 2005, some 29 organisations across London, including Barclays Bank and the Greater London Assembly itself, have implemented the London living wage, but the Conservative mayor of London has no power to impose the proposed wage on employers or organisations.</p><p>The living wage clearly has an impact on the national minimum wage, which is set by the Low Pay Commission and whose current rate of &#163;5.73 is due to rise to &#163;5.80. The measure, which was introduced in 1999 by the United Kingdom Labour Government, deserves a lot of credit as an attempt to alleviate in-work poverty. How the introduction of a living wage would, for example, affect Unison's proposition that the full national minimum wage should apply to all workers aged 16 and over remains unanswered. As for the implementation of the living wage in London, a freedom of information request by the Green Party London Assembly member Darren Johnson showed that only four of the 32 London boroughs have incorporated a requirement to pay the wage into their procurement policies.</p><p>Some have argued&#8212;and considerable research has shown&#8212;that the proposal for a citizen's basic income should be explored more fully, as such a move would reduce the stigma associated with, for example, the take-up of benefits. In an influential article in the <em>Financial Times</em> of 21 April 2009 entitled \"Surprising case for basic income\", Samuel Brittan noted that support for the idea came from an unusual source&#8212;the United States policy analyst and libertarian Charles Murray&#8212;and I feel that it would make a vital contribution to <place-holder colnum=\"19808\"/> achieving economic and social justice for those on low pay.</p><p>Given the diverse nature of poverty, the mix of policies to tackle the problem should be flexible but not confused. I have previously cited research on poverty in the chamber. According to Abigail McKnight in her essay \"Employment: tackling poverty through 'work for those who can'\" in John Hills and Kitty Stewart's book \"A more equal society?: New Labour, poverty, inequality and exclusion\", single adults without children are not only the group in deepest poverty but the group with the greatest poverty gap. We as a society have to understand and tackle the problems of poverty, take every possible step and use all the Scottish Parliament's powers to eradicate this blight&#8212;and urge the UK Government to raise its game in dealing with some of the root causes.</p><p>I welcome the motion and reiterate the Scottish National Party's long-standing commitment to poverty proofing, which dates back to 2000.

Since the programme became operational on 27 November 2006, it has sought to engage prolific offenders in intensive support and treatment, through community-based outreach, to reduce criminality. The programme, which is funded by Glasgow community planning partnership, is a community safety initiative and brings together the work of Strathclyde Police and Glasgow addiction services.</p><p>In conjunction with existing services, and in recognition of worrying statistics on repeat offending, the programme was designed to provide an initial intervention to tackle addiction-related offending; integrate substance-misusing offenders into mainstream addiction services; improve quality of life; and promote training or employment opportunities and overall community safety. The project built on the success of similar initiatives in England, such as the tower project, which was implemented in Blackpool and Fylde in 2002 to tackle drug-related crime.</p><p>The programme has achieved real success in achieving its aims. An evaluation, which was published in July 2008, suggested that targets that were set at the outset are being met. There has been a 28.51 per cent reduction in offending rates, which equates to a reduction of approximately 270 crimes per year.</p><p>It is clear that the decrease in criminality among service users throughout greater Glasgow has wider community benefits, including a decrease in <place-holder colnum=\"17823\"/> antisocial behaviour, improved community safety and savings in the cost of health, criminal justice and victims' services. For example, in 2006-07 the Scottish Prison Service estimated the average cost of a prisoner place in Scotland to be &#163;31,000 per annum. Persistent offenders place a substantial burden on the prison service, in relation not only to capacity but to cost. However, for people who have been involved in the programme, time spent in custody has fallen from 30.2 days to 7.4 days per annum. The reduction is welcome, particularly during this period of economic uncertainty.</p><p>I have taken an active interest in the prolific offender programme, so I was pleased to meet project leaders to gain a more detailed understanding of the work that is being done and of what has been achieved since the project began. Most significant, perhaps, was the fact that two service users were in attendance, each of whom had their own experiences of the programme to share after struggling for some time with drug addictions and repeat offending. Both had found the programme extremely valuable in transforming their lives. Since engaging with the project, one of them had found employment, while the other was applying for a place on a training programme. By working with the project, both have achieved commendable goals relatively quickly and have re-established good relationships with their families, which were previously problematic. Both individuals praised the joint working approach of Glasgow addiction services and Strathclyde Police; they had found the tracking service fundamental in bringing about their initial engagement and subsequent re-engagement with the programme.</p><p>The 2008 evaluation process showed that those two service users are not alone in their opinion. Feedback from a spectrum of service users remained extremely encouraging. It was highlighted that involvement in the prolific offender programme had had significant results for service users' lives, providing stability to people with chaotic lives and ensuring retention in treatment. Service users also reported improvements in their physical and mental health, and improved access to training and employment opportunities. That feedback was reflected in the accounts of the individuals whom I had the pleasure of meeting, whose lives had been transformed after they engaged with the programme. In fact, both went so far as to say that the programme may have saved their lives.</p><p>Community-based projects like the prolific offender programme go a long way towards addressing the needs of those who are usually missed by traditional policies. Understanding and dealing with the underlying problems will undoubtedly have a significant impact not only on <place-holder colnum=\"17824\"/> offending rates, but on the quality of life of those who are in the grip of substance abuse. Much can be taken from the continued success of the programme, but perhaps most important are the partnership and information-sharing aspects, which appear to have been fundamental throughout the project's implementation. Through engagement with the police, social workers and addiction services, offenders have had a reliable support network to work with, instead of against.</p><p>Following the success of the prolific offender programme throughout Glasgow, similar services are being initiated elsewhere. For example, in February 2009, the opportunity to reduce criminal activity project came into force throughout Peterhead and north-east Aberdeenshire. With a similar approach to the prolific offender programme, ORCA brings together Turning Point Scotland, the Aberdeenshire criminal justice addictions team and Grampian Police to provide support services in the local area for persistent offenders with drug or alcohol problems.</p><p>Given the success of the prolific offender programme and similar initiatives, we must ensure that funding continues to be made available for those projects to continue, so that they can improve the lives of those who are in the grip of substance addiction and stuck firmly in the perpetual circle of criminal activity. The work and commitment of Strathclyde Police and Glasgow addiction services, along with the social work teams, should be highlighted, as they develop and continue to deliver that valuable project to those who are in the most need of intervention in the city of Glasgow. Given that the benefits go far beyond those who are immediately involved in the programme and extend to the wider community, the development and implementation of similar initiatives throughout Scotland should be encouraged.</p><p>I thank again those members who allowed the debate to take place and those who have stayed to participate in it.

The number of rejected ballot papers in the 2007 local government elections was significantly higher in comparison with the corresponding numbers in the 2003 and 1999 elections, although we must bear in mind that the 2007 local government elections were held under an STV system.</p><p>The responses to the Scottish Government's consultation show that there is a high level of support for decoupling local government and Scottish Parliament elections to address apparent voter confusion. As other speakers have said, there is a crossover between the conclusions of the Gould report and the research that was conducted by other organisations. The Gould report was quite clear in advocating that Scottish Parliament and local government elections be separated. The high number of rejected ballot papers in 2007 caused much concern about the integrity of the process. That issue is dealt with in studies by the Electoral Reform Society, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Scotland Office, and in the Scottish Government's response to the Gould report.</p><p>The important principle as far as the electoral process is concerned is that the two sets of elections should not be held on the same day. In a vote on 10 January 2008, the Parliament expressed its will that local government and Scottish Parliament elections should be decoupled.</p><p>As was stated when the Parliament debated the Gould report on 9 October 2008, if we wish to provide some background to the debate, we need only examine \"Scottish Council Elections 2007: Results and Analysis\" by Bochel and Denver, published by the University of Lincoln in 2007. That research states that there was an increase in the number of rejected ballot papers in the 2007 local government elections compared with previous local government elections, although the increase was not as great as that in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. In the opinion of Bochel and Denver, given that most people were unfamiliar with the use of an STV system in multimember wards, a rejected ballot paper rate of 1.83 per cent did not seem unreasonable.</p><p>The fact that the evidence that was given to the committee centred on turnout is reflected in its report. In his evidence, Tom Aitchison of SOLACE noted that pre-2007 returning officers were split down the middle: some believed that decoupling would allow local issues to be focused on at local government elections, whereas others argued that the two sets of elections should continue to be held on the same day.</p><p>The committee's key recommendation is that the UK and Scottish Governments should continue <place-holder colnum=\"17459\"/> with their efforts to improve levels of voter registration. I note that a public campaign is under way to get voters to register. In his evidence to the committee, Tom Aitchison said that between 3 and 5 per cent of potential voters do not register to vote.

No doubt there will be many debates about housing in the future.</p><p>In examining why the Scottish Government has launched its consultation on housing and the right to buy new-build housing, we need to consider the historical backdrop. Over the past 30 years, UK Governments and Scottish Executives have repeated right-to-buy policies and small-scale and large-scale stock transfers and have produced many changes in the housing landscape. That issue links up with the wider issue of housing affordability. People cannot continue to afford rents at the current rates in the rented sector market and the current financial climate, so more people on waiting lists will look to social housing to obtain a house.<place-holder colnum=\"16856\"/></p><p>With regard to delivery mechanisms, some people might say that the well-established housing lobby should address the ever-increasing pay hikes in the social housing rented sector, especially at the senior management level. Remuneration levels in that sector are high&#8212;salaries of &#163;48,000 to &#163;57,000 for a housing association director with a stock of around 300 houses, for example, seem rather excessive. In February 2009, the journal <em>Social Housing</em> highlighted the salaries of the top 25 Scottish registered social landlords. On average, staff costs increased by 8.5 per cent in 2008.</p><p>The Scottish Government's announcement of a &#163;50 million investment in council housing throughout Scotland and the announcement that North Lanarkshire Council will receive &#163;1 million from that funding stream should be most welcome. I notice that that local authority has not issued a media release that welcomes that expenditure.</p><p>What is the point of building council houses that will be sold and of reducing the ability of future generations to house people? The result of the right-to-buy legislation has often been that stock that has been considered to be among the best council housing has been sold.

I will try my best.</p><p>In debating the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009, it is important to acknowledge the cabinet secretary's input in promoting key priorities for the Scottish people in terms of the key financial outcomes. Other members have stated, but it is worth reinforcing, that the Scottish Government deserves credit for creating a degree of sustainability for local government budgets. Council tax rates were frozen in all councils in 2008-09 and additional funding of &#163;70 million has been included in the budget settlement for 2009-10. Each local authority is getting money in addition to its 2009-10 allocation. It is most noteworthy that local authorities are entitled to a share of &#163;70 million for maintaining the council tax freeze. Especially in the current financial climate, <place-holder colnum=\"16152\"/> all members should welcome the fact that the council tax is to be maintained at the current level.</p><p>There has been a continuing problem with local authorities levering in capital receipts. However, given the recessionary pressures that we are witnessing in the marketplace, it is not unusual that capital receipts shortfall is a problem for local government.</p><p>A council tax freeze ensures that councils throughout Scotland have to maintain prudent financial management and better harness the additional resources that are made available by the Scottish Government. Total capital support of &#163;43.4 million for North Lanarkshire Council is not a sum to dismiss lightly. The base budget from my local council, North Lanarkshire, showed that for 2008-09 the authority achieved efficiency savings of &#163;10 million. Unlike in previous situations when budget settlements clawed back efficiency savings, local authorities retain such savings, thus enabling further investment to be made in strategic priorities and increased service provision, which are determined by local authorities in their own areas.</p><p>There is always debate about whether local government has enough money, especially as we approach a new financial year. As other members highlighted, there has been much discussion of the resource allocations, although it is worth restating that local government expenditure will rise in cash terms by 4.5 per cent in 2009-10. There needs to be much more clarification from local authorities to ensure that risk management procedures are in place. Indeed, I could argue that budgets that are already in place should be prioritised and should take account of established best practice in local government.</p><p>In the chamber on 11 December last year, I highlighted my concern about the public authorities' potential loss on investments in Icelandic banks. The Scottish Government has announced that it will issue statutory guidance not to make provision in its 2009-10 budgets for any potential loss on investments in Icelandic banks. Those banks' exposure is the latest glaring example of the public pound not being protected in a sufficiently robust manner.</p><p>A number of issues are worth further examination&#8212;for example, I am concerned about performance related pay in local government. Scrutiny of the parameters that are set for PRP makes it look increasingly self-serving. In terms of setting the right tone, that area needs to be addressed, particularly with the current financial backdrop. As witnessed recently in the Treasury Select Committee hearing at Westminster, people have rightly criticised the level of executive pay in the banking sector. However, performance management and executive pay in local <place-holder colnum=\"16153\"/> government merit future analysis and detailed scrutiny. Sometimes, perception is reality.</p><p>To provide some context to the debate, an increase in cash terms in local government revenue allocations by 5.15 per cent for South Lanarkshire Council and by 5.03 per cent for North Lanarkshire Council merits praise. The Government is taking account of reality outside the chamber, with real money for public services.</p><p>I commend the amendment order and look forward to the benefits that the new funding arrangements for local authorities will deliver for vital services throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14894372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "How does anybody follow a speech like that?

Cumbernauld is very much a new town, whereas the Moodiesburn area includes the settlements of Stepps, Chryston, Muirhead, Auchinloch, Cardowan and Gartcosh. The two designated areas have different needs, but a recurring theme is the requirement for affordable housing for rent, especially in the current economic climate. However, the need to stop the decline in the availability of affordable housing stock is fundamental in both areas.</p><p>An identified objective in North Lanarkshire Council's local housing strategy for the years 2004 to 2009 was to consider applying for pressurised area status. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, certain criteria must be met before Scottish ministers can agree to designate an area as a pressurised area. The most important of those is the need for social rented housing.</p><p>The level of right to buy varies in the different areas of North Lanarkshire. In Moodiesburn, approximately half of all North Lanarkshire Council's stock has been sold under the right to buy. In Cumbernauld, well over 70 per cent of the stock has been sold, through a combination of right-to-buy sales, stock transfers and the sales to <place-holder colnum=\"15837\"/> private companies that were undertaken by the Cumbernauld Development Corporation.</p><p>North Lanarkshire Council identified the two local housing market areas of Cumbernauld and Moodiesburn as being particularly pressurised. The local authority estimates that the number of tenancies that will be affected by the granting of pressurised area status will increase from 1,020 in 2007 to 1,916 by 2012.</p><p>After undertaking a consultation process, the local authority issued a letter on 10 November 2008 to all council tenants to advise them of the application for pressurised area status, which would suspend the right to buy. On 30 January 2009, the Scottish Government wrote to North Lanarkshire Council's head of housing services to advise her that the local authority's request had been granted and would be effective from 2 February 2009. As other members are only too well aware, in an area with pressurised area status, the right to buy is temporarily suspended for new tenancies and for tenancies that began on or after the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy on 30 September 2002.</p><p>I am aware that one of the local authority's main reasons for proposing Cumbernauld and Moodiesburn for pressurised area status was to highlight to a national audience the local social rented housing stock shortfall. The feeling in some quarters was that North Lanarkshire might lose out on potential future investment in affordable housing because research that was undertaken by Professor Glen Bramley had concluded that there was no requirement to provide more affordable housing in the area. It is worth reinforcing the point that the North Lanarkshire Council area faces competing demands for funding from its towns and other settlements. I believe that, by granting the approval, the Scottish Government will greatly strengthen the case to provide increased levels of investment in affordable housing in the designated areas and beyond.</p><p>Any elected member who has had dealings with constituents&#8212;whether at council level or at Scottish Parliament level&#8212;will have dealt with his or her fair share of housing issues. With the economic maelstrom that is currently enveloping us all, it is clear that such problems will increase significantly over the coming months and years. I remember dealing with such issues as a member of Falkirk Council as far back as 1980. When the right-to-buy legislation was introduced, it had severe implications for local authorities even then. As a result of the legislation, what is often considered to be the best council housing stock is sold. In my experience, houses are even bought by family members in partnership with the existing council tenants.<place-holder colnum=\"15838\"/></p><p>Since its introduction, the right-to-buy legislation has meant increased waiting lists for council housing. That clearly impacts on the homelessness targets that have been set for local authorities under more recent housing legislation. The burden of responsibility lies with the local authorities to house the homeless, which has serious implications for people who are on local authority housing waiting lists. One elected member in the area has told me of a constituent who has been on the housing waiting list for over 18 years, but who has not as yet been made a good housing offer. That person's aspiration for better housing has been stymied. In terms of basic economic analysis, an opportunity cost is associated with the right to buy and the resources that are allocated thereafter.</p><p>As I stated at the outset of my speech, we all have to be aware of the demands that are placed on the social housing sector to provide affordable rented property. I look forward to the opportunities that are being created that will allow local authorities to build housing for rent, thereby alleviating the existing problems in areas such as Cumbernauld and Moodiesburn.

There is a requirement for on-going training in planning departments in local authorities and other bodies. Local government will no doubt make representations on the cost implications of the framework.</p><p>As the committee's report states, there is a requirement for an assessment matrix of candidate national developments and for less use of jargon.

My role in the proposed legislation has been to examine the proposals as a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee, particularly through the evidence-gathering sessions. I have taken an active interest in the bill.</p><p>I will touch on the committee's findings in its report on the proposed legislation. It is important that we examine carefully the context and background of the bill and the reasons for its introduction. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of the issue knows about the on-going problems with the blue badge scheme and the abuse of disabled parking bays by non-blue badge holders. In essence, the scheme is about assisting disabled people to travel and live their lives independently. It is worth reinforcing the point that I made in the stage 1 debate that it is more than a pity that no in-depth research on the issue has <place-holder colnum=\"15241\"/> been commissioned by any governmental agency. For far too long, not enough has been done to tackle what amounts to no less than a flagrant abuse of disabled people's rights.</p><p>Members have referred to the baywatch campaign, which found that at least one in five disabled parking spaces is abused by non-blue badge drivers. Supermarkets and private car park operators have not been opposed to the bill at any stage of its progress through the Parliament. In fact, as members have said, Asda has led the way by introducing a fine system for those who abuse disabled persons bays. Mr Guy Mason from Asda highlighted the fact that four out of five customers support the system of fines. However, as the Local Government and Communities Committee detailed clearly in its report, there is an on-going debate about advisory versus enforceable disabled persons parking bays, which in turn has followed through into a debate on the costs associated with the proposed legislation. The committee recognises the difficulty that local authorities throughout Scotland face in conducting an audit of existing advisory disabled persons parking bays, but it agrees that a period of a year after the act comes into force is a reasonable timeframe for completion of the exercise.</p><p>The evidence-gathering sessions were a more-than-useful exercise in fleshing out important points about the proposed legislation that need to be addressed. Today and in the stage 1 debate, we have had much discussion of the associated costs, particularly in relation to the figures that the Parliament's Finance Committee identified. I reinforce the assertion that I made in the stage 1 debate that we need more clarification of the matter from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and local authorities. As I have argued previously, local authority budgets should be prioritised better to take account of established best practice in relation to existing disability discrimination legislation. Bearing in mind that there are 32 local authorities in Scotland, it was not an especially helpful response rate for only 21 of them to respond to the member's consultation.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14740407", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have said, in this stage 3 debate, it is important to acknowledge Jackie Baillie's contribution in championing the key principles of her member's bill.

The effects of such actions can inflict untold damage on the families and friends of those who are injured or killed.</p><p>As a timely coincidence, last night's edition of \"Police Camera Action\" on ITV1 at 9 pm followed the experience of the programme's presenter while driving with different levels of alcohol in his bloodstream. Tests were monitored by several specialists and new technology was used to monitor his line of vision and his attention to the road. The results shocked the reporter. As he consumed more alcohol, he felt more in control, but he was less in control in reality, as the tests proved. The programme also focused on several people who admitted to drinking to excess and driving regularly.</p><p>As members have said, it is especially relevant to individuals who have enjoyed themselves the previous evening at the office Christmas party, for example, to remember the effects of their alcohol consumption, which might mean that the alcohol level in their bloodstream is still above the legal limit. That applies particularly to people who intend to drive with children in their car the following morning.</p><p>I accept that we cannot have a zero level of alcohol in the bloodstream because of some medical conditions, which other members have explained. However, as a first step, we can urge the UK Government to lower the blood alcohol limit to be in line with that in other European countries, rather than rely on greater enforcement of existing limits.</p><p>It is important to highlight the drink-driving campaign at this time of year, but we must acknowledge that we should be aware of the effects of alcohol and of drink driving throughout the year. That is true particularly in the summer months, as Rob Gibson said, when people drive home from barbecue parties after consuming four or five pints of beer or four or five alcoholic drinks.</p><p>I urge members to support the motion in Kenny MacAskill's name at decision time and to send a clear message to all drivers at this time of year <place-holder colnum=\"13556\"/> and throughout the year that they should think before they drink and drive.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14306679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink Driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept that.

Other members have already stated, but it is worth reiterating, that the Scottish Government deserves credit for creating a degree of sustainability for local government budgets. The concordat between COSLA and the Administration has enhanced their relationship, with a commitment that the Scottish Government will not undertake structural reform of local government between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Council tax rates were frozen in all councils in 2008-09 and funding of &#163;70 million has been included in the budget allocation for 2009-10. At a recent local area partnership meeting, a key finance officer at North Lanarkshire Council stated that the moneys are there for council tax to be maintained at current levels.</p><p>Anyone with even a scant knowledge of the matter knows that there has been a continuing problem in respect of local authorities' levering in capital receipts. The shortfall in capital receipts is a problem for local government that is not unusual, especially given the current recessionary pressures in the marketplace.</p><p>Key questions from the local authority perspective are whether there will be a continued council tax freeze, whether increasing cost pressures are reflected in the financial settlement, and whether funding is available for growth. The council tax freeze ensured that councils throughout Scotland maintained prudent financial management, using the additional resources made available by this Government.</p><p>My local authority's base budget showed that the authority achieved efficiency savings of &#163;10 million in 2008-09. Thanks to the Scottish Government, local authorities are retaining such savings&#8212;unlike under previous budget settlements, when efficiency savings were clawed back. That enables authorities to make further investment in key strategic priorities and increased service provision, as they deem necessary.</p><p>As was stated at a recent evidence session with the Local Government and Communities Committee, there is an on-going debate about whether there is enough money. The arguments are recycled throughout the year, especially when local authority budgets are being set, before the new financial year.<place-holder colnum=\"13398\"/></p><p>I have been advised that the Labour Party's national executive committee in Scotland has instructed its leadership in COSLA to force a vote tomorrow and call for a substantial renegotiation of the concordat. Evidence was presented to the Local Government and Communities Committee that either party to the concordat could go to the other at any time for detailed discussion of issues that might arise under the concordat's terms.</p><p>As other members have said, there has been much discussion of the resource allocations. It is worth restating that local government expenditure will rise in cash terms by 5.1 per cent in 2009-10.</p><p>On ensuring that proper risk management procedures are in place, COSLA and local authorities need to provide much more clarity. Indeed, I could argue that budgets that are already in place should be prioritised; authorities should take account of best practice that has already been established. Some local authorities need to start learning lessons from previous financial decisions. Their exposure to the Icelandic banks is the latest example, but the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal in 1989 also shows that the public pound needs to be protected. I am heartened by the cabinet secretary's comments about statutory guidance on that. There were repeated warnings by ratings agencies; as far back as February 2008, Fitch Ratings warned against investment in financial institutions such as the Icelandic banks.</p><p>The argument made by many local authorities seems to be more about potential sources of more funding than about better harnessing existing resources.</p><p>Hugh Henry raised the issue of senior staff pay levels&#8212;I am sorry that he is not in the chamber at present. David McLetchie raised the spectre of equal pay. The equal pay issue has been hanging over local authorities since 1999. Many local authorities have reached settlements on single status agreements, but such agreements bring additional financial burdens. Pressures around pay are not new financial pressures for local authorities. However, as David McLetchie said, once an equal pay settlement is reached, it may be a burden the local authority that has to be revisited.</p><p>I want to provide some context to the debate. The planned spend for the affordable housing investment programme for 2009-10 is &#163;500.8 million. That means that the Government is taking account of the reality outside the chamber; the figure represents real money for the real economy.</p><p>I welcome the fact that COSLA and the Government continue to work together to ensure that the delivery of services is maintained and enhanced in line with the Government's policy <place-holder colnum=\"13399\"/> objectives, which were agreed with COSLA.

It is worth reinforcing the point, as other members have, that Jackie Baillie deserves credit for her substantial work in introducing the Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>My role, as a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee&#8212;which I joined in September 2008&#8212;has been to examine the proposals, especially with respect to the evidence-gathering sessions. I will talk in depth later about the committee report's detailed findings. It is important that we look carefully at the reasons for introducing the bill. Anyone who has even scant knowledge of the issue knows that there has been an on-going problem with the blue badge scheme because non-badge holders abuse disabled parking places. However, as the committee report states, there are no official figures on abuse of on-street disabled persons' parking places. The blue badge scheme is all about assisting disabled people to travel independently, but the baywatch campaign found that one in five disabled parking spaces is abused by non-disabled drivers.</p><p>In evidence, supermarkets and private car park operators said that they are not opposed to the bill. As other members have mentioned, Asda has led the way by introducing a fines system for people who abuse disabled persons' bays. Far from the system being unpopular, Mr Mason of Asda highlighted in his evidence, as other members have mentioned, that 93 per cent of Asda's customers support the system of fines being extended.</p><p>The committee report details clearly that there is an on-going debate about advisory versus enforceable disabled parking bays. There is also a <place-holder colnum=\"12754\"/> debate about issues around the costs of the proposed legislation. The committee notes in paragraph 87 of the report the difficulty that local authorities throughout Scotland face</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in conducting an audit of their existing advisory disabled persons' parking bays,\"</p><p>but the committee</p><p class=\"indent\">\"agrees that a year after the Act comes into force should ... be a reasonable\"</p><p>timeframe for \"completion of this exercise.\" In our evidence-gathering sessions, we spent a considerable amount of time hearing from witnesses, which was a useful exercise in fleshing out some important points that needed to be addressed. As others have highlighted, there was much discussion on the &#163;1.7 million cost that was identified to the Finance Committee. I assert that much more clarification of the costs is required from local authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. It can be argued that budgets for measures that are already in place should be prioritised by having recourse to the best practice that has been established under disability discrimination legislation that is already on the statute book.</p><p>As the committee's report notes, only 21 local authorities responded to the member's consultation. Bearing in mind that there are 32 local authorities in Scotland, I do not think that that is an especially helpful response rate. Furthermore, the responses showed a significant variation in respect of the financial costs that are associated with the bill, as other members have highlighted. In paragraph 166, the committee's report states clearly that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the overall estimate of &#163;1.7 million ... is subject to a significant degree of doubt.\"</p><p>Indeed, to my mind, the argument that was made by one local authority seemed more like a potential money-grab for funding for the anticipated one-off cost rather than an attempt to embrace service delivery for disabled people in its community.</p><p>As several witnesses stated in evidence, the bill will impact on the wider debate inside and outside Parliament. The committee's report, and research that has been conducted by other organisations, suggest that the bill will have a significant crossover with the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 and the disability equality duty, which has applied to all local authorities since it came into effect on 4 December 2006. Leonard Cheshire Disability's written submission notes that, in undertaking their functions, public bodies in Scotland are required to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"have a 'due regard' to promote disability equality\".<place-holder colnum=\"12755\"/></p><p>Public bodies are, under existing legislation, under a duty to encourage participation by disabled persons in public life. Given that context, the bill will help to underpin the concept of independent living in a practical sense rather than in the abstract. The bill is not some glib and well-meaning statement of intent. The Equality and Human Rights Commission's written submission gets to the heart of the matter. It states that the bill will help by</p><p class=\"indent\">\"removing a persistent barrier to disabled people's participation in society.\"</p><p>I welcome the general principles of the bill and the Local Government and Communities Committee's stage 1 report. I thank the committee members, clerks, those who provided written and oral evidence and all those who have tried to ensure that the bill makes a meaningful contribution to tackling this area of social exclusion.</p><p>In concluding, I welcome the fact that the Government is in favour of the general principles of the bill.

These new figures show that is in fact likely to be an under-estimate.\"</p><p>In February 2008, the Kier Group announced that it had made a 500 per cent return on its investment in the Hairmyres hospital PFI project. It sold a 50 per cent share to Innisfree M &amp; G PPP for &#163;13.8 million in cash, which was on top of &#163;2.2 million of deferred profit from an August 2004 refinancing deal.</p><p>Many PPP projects have led to other issues, particularly for workers in schools and hospitals.

Through freedom of information requests, they received direct access to contract details that enabled them to highlight some of the worst examples of excessive profiteering. Such profits, it must be added, have been made at the expense of the public purse.</p><p>During the inquiry into the proposed closure of Monklands hospital's accident and emergency unit, a number of those who gave evidence highlighted that one possible reason for the proposed closure was Lanarkshire NHS Board's financial commitment to servicing the PPP debts of the hospitals at Wishaw and Hairmyres. Vital services in the Monklands area were therefore being sacrificed to feed the profits of construction contractors.</p><p>I am also aware of the implications of local authorities failing to get the design right under PPP contracts. On one primary school project, an extra &#163;1.5 million had to be spent on additional classroom space just prior to completion, due to the failure to get the right school roll number. On a community school/centre project, the council failed <place-holder colnum=\"12433\"/> to ensure that the design provided adequate disabled access for wheelchair users. That flaw was pointed out only upon completion of the project. The operator's proposed solution was to put a doorbell on the entrance that the janitor could respond to and open the door for wheelchair users. However, the janitor pointed out that, due to cutbacks in staffing levels that had been imposed by his new employer, as well as being expected to open the door he could also be cleaning up after a school child had been sick or dealing with other essential duties. He was expected to drop what he was doing and run to open the door. The problem was eventually resolved at additional expense to the local authority. In the same building, community groups that wanted to store equipment such as chess boards were advised that the storage cost would be &#163;1,000, because the building was designed with inadequate cupboard space.</p><p>Such examples are repeated throughout the country. The main difference is that when the building is owned and controlled by the local authority, the authority can send in its own workers to carry out the work. Under PPP contracts, the work is carried out by the contractor's staff and charged at its rates.</p><p>In the past, I have commented on the role of some civil servants in promoting the procurement of public buildings through PPP. A recent <em>Private Eye</em> article highlighted proper scrutiny of the PPP agenda by the National Audit Office. That body, which was created to hold the Government to account, was accused of being actively involved in promoting the PPP mantra, along with the PFI industry, at conferences to plug the initiative.</p><p>I urge Parliament to support the motion in the name of the cabinet secretary.

For that reason, paragraph 172 in the report's summary of conclusions and recommendations states that any contractor that gains the contract for future provision of electronic counting should be willing to co-operate fully</p><p class=\"indent\">\"with scrutiny by Scottish parliamentary committees.\"</p><p>The high number of rejected ballots gave rise to much concern about the integrity of the process. There are a number of studies of the issue by the Electoral Reform Society, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Scotland Office. The Scottish Government also published a response to the Gould report.</p><p>In future, local government elections will not be held on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections. The decoupling of elections is the will of the Parliament, as expressed in a vote on 10 January 2008.</p><p>To place the debate in context, one need only examine \"Scottish Council Elections 2007: Results and Analysis\" by Bochel and Denver, published by the University of Lincoln in 2007. The research states that there was an increase in the number of rejected ballot papers in the local government election compared with previous elections, although the increase was not as great as that in the Scottish Parliament election. Bochel and Denver note that, given that most people were unfamiliar with the single transferable vote system, a rate of 1.83 per cent for rejected ballot papers did not seem unreasonable. However, it would be remiss of us not to compare the figure of 38,351 rejected council ballot papers in 2007 with figures for the previous two elections.</p><p>The recommendation to devolve legislative powers for the administration of elections should be welcomed. We should bring the process home <place-holder colnum=\"11651\"/> to Scotland. In paragraph 44 of its report, the committee said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee, having regard to the oral and written evidence which it received, endorses the resolution of the Scottish Parliament in relation to the Gould report.\"</p><p>The Gould report indicated the need for the establishment of the post of chief returning officer for Scotland. The committee endorsed that view in paragraph 53 and the Parliament also endorsed that view.</p><p>The committee gathered evidence on the design of the ballot papers that people who voted in person and by post used throughout Scotland on 3 May 2007. I welcome the committee's support for the Scottish Government's intention to examine options for ballot paper design.</p><p>In paragraph 58 of its report, the committee said that it should have a beefed-up role, to enable the Parliament effectively to scrutinise the conduct of elections. The role of the chief returning officer, if such a person is appointed, will be critical in that regard.</p><p>The proposal to randomise rather than alphabetise names in local government elections merits consideration. I realise that I might be accused of having a vested interest in that regard, given that my surname is Wilson rather than Allan. In the aftermath of the election, people&#8212;frequently defeated candidates&#8212;complained that the STV system favours candidates whose names are near the top of the ballot paper. More research into randomisation would be worth while, to ensure equality for all candidates.</p><p>I welcome the report and the general principles that are set out in it. I thank the committee members, clerks and people who provided evidence on the matter, so that we can try to ensure that there is no repeat of the problems of the 2007 elections.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Every member who stood for election last year has their own experiences of the May 2007 Scottish Parliament and local government elections; David Whitton described some of his this morning.

One need only research the list of written parliamentary questions on red squirrels to see the considerable contribution that he has made and his consistent interest in the subject.</p><p>Securing of the red squirrel's future is important because the species has a particular influence and impact in the Scottish context. As the motion states, Scotland</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is home to ... 75% of the UK red squirrel population\".</p><p>The motion and what has been said so far indicate the seriousness of the situation. The red squirrel is under serious attack, especially as a result of the arrival of pox-carrying grey squirrels from England. Despite the best efforts of Scottish Natural Heritage, which has funded grey squirrel control officer posts throughout Scotland, the squirrel pox virus has arrived in Lockerbie, as Murdo Fraser said, and is causing much anxiety. However, I am concerned that it appears that there are no control officers along the central belt. It is clear that most squirrel groups in Scotland are covered, but there seems to be a gap almost right across the central belt in the barrier to stop the spread of the grey squirrel pox.</p><p>Protection of Scotland's species and habitats is nothing new. As far back as February 2004, various agencies and conservationists realised that there was a substantial threat to red squirrels, and that co-ordinated action to protect them was required. The plan that was developed back then by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission, with the support of voluntary bodies, led to the creation of 25 refuges in large coniferous planted areas. That was a welcome step to protect the species, especially as grey squirrels dislike such plantations.</p><p>Today, I spoke to Andy Gallacher, who is a Forestry Commission beat ranger. He said that there is a large population of red squirrels in the Carron valley, but he fears that encroachment by grey squirrels from surrounding areas may deplete that population, particularly if the squirrel pox virus is introduced there.</p><p>Investment in and support of projects such as the red squirrels in south Scotland project are necessary, as conservationists are attempting to halt the decline of the red squirrel population <place-holder colnum=\"11294\"/> throughout Scotland. It has been said that the red squirrel population has been in steady decline for the past 50 years. Murdo Fraser's motion rightly focuses on the situation in Mid-Scotland and Fife, but the decline of the red squirrel population from Argyll and Bute to Aberdeenshire means that any discussion of the red squirrel involves serious time factors. Species that are native to Scotland, such as the red squirrel, have been under sustained attack and constant threat. One has only to observe the regular cull in North Lanarkshire of ruddy ducks that have been imported from America to realise that there are long-term implications for Scotland's sustainability agenda when man meddles with the ecosystem.</p><p>There is much more that I could say. As Murdo Fraser did, I thank the many groups throughout Scotland that are watching the impact of the grey squirrel's encroachment. In particular, I thank those who are involved in the online Scottish squirrel survey. Individuals can report daily or hourly where they have seen grey squirrel and red squirrel habitats. That way, where the grey squirrels are and whether they are encroaching on red squirrel habitats to the danger of red squirrels can be found out. I also thank the other organisations that have taken the time and effort to continue to raise the issue of red squirrels: the Scottish Countryside Alliance, for example, raised the issue in its latest publication. It is clear that a problem exists. I await with interest what the minister will say about what he intends to do to ensure the continued existence of the red squirrel in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14036309", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Red Squirrels"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Murdo Fraser on initiating this members' business debate.

The most notable critic in recent times was Professor Bonnington, who stated in the <em>Journal of the Law Society of Scotland</em> in May 2005 that some lawyers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"of less than average legal ability\"</p><p>had been appointed to the bench. That might or might not be overstating the point, but it would be wrong to dismiss such opinions out of hand.</p><p>The Judicial Appointments Board is important, and its role in delivery will increase over the years. Judicial independence is highlighted in annex A to the stage 1 report. The Scottish Government's response stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"One of the avenues for securing the independence of individual judges relates to the method by which judges are selected.\"</p><p>Another key aspect of the Justice Committee's deliberations was the governance of the Scottish Court Service. The backdrop is that, currently, the chief executive of the Scottish Court Service is responsible solely to ministers and the Parliament. The Osler review that the previous Administration established in June 2005 set in train a process of reviewing the governance of the courts and the future relationships among the Scottish Court Service, the judiciary and the Government. The step change that the Osler review proposed brings us up to date with the bill, which envisages that the SCS will have thirteen members and will be chaired by the Lord President. The bill also provides that the SCS will have responsibility for policy implementation and will be independent of the Scottish ministers. That said, the bill proposes that the SCS will operate according to a corporate plan that is agreed by ministers.</p><p>The Justice Committee had a vital discussion on wider accountability, particularly in respect of section 66(2). That point is also stated in paragraph 209 on page 35 of the stage 1 report. In questioning witnesses and reviewing the written evidence, my overriding aim was to ensure that, together with the enhanced independence of the judiciary and quasi-judicial bodies, the bill provides accountability. Some people might say that, in real terms, accountability will be diminished, because the bill will establish the Scottish Court Service as a body corporate headed by the Lord President. It <place-holder colnum=\"8570\"/> is worth noting that the Lord President is not compelled to give evidence to the Parliament, given his legal standing under the Scotland Act 1998. Equally, the present arrangements for the Scottish Court Service are not satisfactory. As stated in paragraph 209, some members remain to be convinced on the issue.</p><p>The Justice Committee's report has highlighted the need to consider other issues relating to the judiciary, including my point about accountability. The committee has been up front and centre about the need for a mandatory requirement for the judiciary to undertake training, as other members have pointed out. Another issue is the need to ensure that the bill stands the test of time. The resulting act must ensure that the role that the current Lord President&#8212;Lord Hamilton&#8212;sees for himself can be applied to future Lord Presidents.</p><p>I commend the Justice Committee's stage 1 report and I look forward to examining the bill further as it proceeds through Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13658477", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak to the stage 1 report on the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill and the cabinet secretary's opening remarks.

As Elaine Smith said, those two industries suffered people dying and being maimed by losing limbs at work. The event brought back a memory of when I first moved to Coatbridge 25 years ago. An old comrade of mine had Coatbridge described to him as \"hell with the lid off\" because of the number of steelworks in the area. Lives were lost in the steel industry and in the mining industry that serviced it, many of which we will commemorate next year on the anniversary of the Auchengeich pit disaster.</p><p>As Elaine Smith highlighted, we have to remember that we have to build up resources for our workers today. We must ensure that procedures are put in place, such as occupational health services. One of the best examples of good practice in Scotland, if not in the United Kingdom and Europe, is provided by Salus Occupational Health &amp; Safety, a company based in Coatbridge. It provides occupational health support to a number of organisations, including Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board, and draws in income for Lanarkshire NHS Board through its consultancy work. That is a good example of how we can raise the issues of workers' health and wellbeing.</p><p>We must also ensure that the HSE is strengthened in its role of protecting workers. Too often, we hear of accidents happening and deaths occurring that could easily have been avoided if the HSE had been able to do its job of protecting workers in the workplace. In light of Cathy Jamieson's comments about migrant workers, the HSE's role is even more relevant today. Especially in rural industries, seasonal workers risk being maimed because unscrupulous employers disregard health and safety issues in the workplace.</p><p>As I said, I welcome the fact that Elaine Smith's motion finally gives us an opportunity to commemorate and pay tribute to the many workers who lost their lives building the Scotland that we have today. Many died needlessly and many workers were maimed. We must also remember those who suffered industrial illness due to the work that they were engaged in: the miners who suffered pneumoconiosis and the steel workers and those who worked in shipbuilding who suffered asbestosis. We need to mark such occasions so that we remember what work can do to individuals and ensure that such things do not happen in future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403780", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Workers Memorial Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with great pleasure, tinged with sadness, that I speak in tonight's debate as part of the Scotland-wide campaign to mark international workers memorial day.

I acknowledge that it was timely to debate policing and police resources.</p><p>A significant number of witnesses gave evidence to the committee's inquiry. I welcome the opportunity to place on record my appreciation for those who presented evidence to the committee and for the information that was furnished to it. Like other committee members, I place on record my thanks to, and appreciation for, the committee clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre, as well as to the convener for the way that he handled those of us who were new not only to the committee but to the Parliament.<place-holder colnum=\"7581\"/></p><p>As I have stated previously, discussions of policing and the effective use of police resources sometimes come down to the simplistic question of whether we have enough police officers on the streets fighting crime. In many ways, that is a sterile point, as effective policing has moved on apace and resourcing of the police involves greater and more efficient use of civilian support structures.</p><p>The benefit of being a member of the Justice Committee is that an inquiry into the effective use of police resources overlaps with the evidence that is presented to us for the budget process. That crossover is important, especially in the evidence that the Scottish Police Federation presented, to take one practical example. Joe Grant, who is general secretary of the federation, gave committee members a useful insight, especially into the key aspects of the use of community wardens and the reporting of crime in areas where they are deployed. As Mr Lamont stated, the Scottish Police Federation also referred to research that was conducted by Professor Arthur Midwinter, who acted as its financial consultant. Its submission referred to evidence that Scottish police expenditure is the lowest in the United Kingdom. In the evidence that he gave on 6 November 2007, Joe Grant referred to Professor Midwinter's research describing how there had been seven years' underfunding of the police service in Scotland. It is interesting that Arthur Midwinter is known to many members as the policy adviser to the Labour leader in the Parliament.</p><p>Personal experience of crime is sometimes as important in forming our mindset as all the evidence that is presented. On a Saturday night a few months ago, my property was damaged by what can only be described as joy-riders, who felt that the road in front of my house was a race track. I had left the house to collect my daughter and came back to find a car smashed into my driveway. Neighbours reported the crime to the police, who took the necessary statements, but the difficulty was that, after they had done their duty, the police officers had to wait for more than an hour and a half for a police recovery vehicle to turn up and take away the joy-riders' car. Is that a good use of police resources, particularly on a Saturday night?</p><p>In describing how effective the present use of police resources is, the report highlights the role of the Scottish Police Services Authority, which is a relatively new body but an important one that will have a key task in delivering central services. I envisage that its activities will increase over the years to come. It is vital that duplication in police structures is eliminated. Avoiding the duplication of resources involves operational issues, and the <place-holder colnum=\"7582\"/> need for efficiency savings is high on the political agenda.</p><p>The committee supports the retention of the current eight forces, which the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has reinforced. That said, I could not fail to notice in today's mail a letter from the convener of Strathclyde joint police board extending an invitation to elected members in the area to discuss directly with him their views on policing. Although all invitations are welcome, that raises in my mind the issue of democratic accountability&#8212;the conveners and vice-conveners of joint police boards are well remunerated compared with the average councillor who sits on those boards. I would welcome further scrutiny of the role of police boards, especially as some of the councillors serving on joint boards to whom I have spoken feel that it is the serving officers who are driving the agenda, which is not always a welcome feature. The issue of independent support and advice for police boards is highlighted in the committee report, at paragraph 353.</p><p>The report highlights the need to examine other areas of policing, one of which was identified earlier in the debate: community policing. Witnesses gave various accounts of what was considered to constitute community policing in their areas. The Justice Committee has now decided to investigate that issue in an attempt to ensure that we can all be satisfied that community policing is addressing the needs of all our communities and is able to reflect the wishes and desires of all residents.</p><p>In answer to the point that Alex Johnstone made about the working time directive, I say that the committee questioned the Scottish Police Federation on the issue. It was clear from the evidence that Joe Grant gave that no breaches were taking place and that there was no excuse for police services being cut back on the basis of the working time directive. The figures that he gave us showed that, on average, with overtime, the working week was 45 hours, with no one exceeding an average of 48 hours, which would be breaching the working time directive.</p><p>I commend the Justice Committee's report on the effective use of police resources to the Parliament, and I look forward to future discussion on the subject in the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402003", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Resources"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the Justice Committee's report on the effective use of police resources and the conclusions that are contained within it.

Benefit fraud has fallen from &#163;2 billion a year to &#163;800 million a year since 2000, but the recent National Audit Office report of 23 January 2008 stated that &#163;154 million was spent in the previous financial year to identify &#163;106 million of overpayments due to fraud. In answer to points that were raised by Mary Scanlon, Helen Eadie and Jamie Stone, I say that that money could be used to ensure that benefits go to the people who are most in need. At the moment, we still have a Government at Westminster that demands that people ask for benefits, when it could use the 25 million names and addresses on its database to ensure that benefits go directly to the people who deserve them the most. I hope that that will be taken up in the debate on poverty.<place-holder colnum=\"5775\"/></p><p>A recent strength of the policy on poverty has been the acknowledgement that poverty is multifaceted. The emphasis on social exclusion was to be welcomed, but that agenda was nothing new to some of us who have been working on social exclusion issues for many years&#8212;I could give various examples. The French Government took up social exclusion as an issue and in 1996 President Chirac visited Easterhouse to see the programmes that were running there.</p><p>Given the diverse nature of poverty, it is not surprising that the policy mix needs to be flexible in tackling it. Some academics have identified the need to tackle poverty through work for those who can. Issues have also arisen to do with the group of people who are in deepest poverty&#8212;namely, adults without children. They have been identified time and again in discussions on the widening gaps in society. Those people suffer the most poverty, even compared to some of the groups that other members identified.</p><p>In July 2007, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that the gap between rich and poor was as wide as it had been for 40 years. That is true despite 10 years of the Labour Government at Westminster. Society has become more polarised since the 1980s, and a consequence has been that wealthier people have moved to the suburbs while the poorest have tended to remain in the inner cities, although I accept that we cannot ignore rural poverty, which other members have mentioned.</p><p>Opposition members, especially Labour members, will refer to the introduction of the national minimum wage. However, I will ask Labour members two questions: what is the current national minimum wage, and what is the median income? Labour members should answer those questions and then do the calculations and ask themselves whether the minimum wage is actually lifting people out of poverty. The trade union Unison represents many part-time workers. In its submission to the Low Pay Commission in September 2007, it stressed that the national minimum wage needed to be strengthened. It stated that the full national minimum wage should begin at age 16 for all workers. The old trade union adage about paying the rate for the job springs to mind.</p><p>The motion should receive the full support of all members.

That will help them to promote those rights and to ensure that they are not undermined by employers who may believe that young people do not know what those rights are. Such work is crucial in preparing young people for the workplace.</p><p>As members should be aware, one of the main problems in enforcing employment rights in the workplace is the low level of union membership throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom. I hope that the work that the STUC is doing in schools will encourage more people to become active in unions when they enter the workplace. We must continue to fight to establish such representation because, despite all the employment legislation and regulations that have been put in place in the United Kingdom by the UK Government and the European Parliament, many employers still try to take away the rights of the workforce or to not apply them as they should be applied. As Cathy Peattie said, we must address that by getting more people to join the unions and to appreciate their relevance, after many decades in which people have felt that the unions have not played a vital role.</p><p>I want to focus on apprenticeships and traineeships. For the five years before I entered Parliament, I worked hard on pay scales for trainees and apprentices. The end of this year will mark the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the UK Government's introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, but the UK Government has not taken the opportunity to include apprentices and trainees in the national minimum wage framework. Although, after a great deal of lobbying by the unions and low-pay organisations, it decided to take on board the issue of 16 to 18-year-olds, we still have a major gap as regards the pay of apprentices and <place-holder colnum=\"5116\"/> trainees. Indeed, the Government recently extended the exemption from the national minimum wage to cover people up to the age of 26 who enter apprenticeships and traineeships. We must address that issue.</p><p>Cathy said that young people who move into employment, particularly apprenticeships and traineeships, need to be protected.

Over the years, there have been written parliamentary questions and debates on the issue, especially with regard to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Two years on from the 2005 act, the issue was part of the new Scottish Government's key principles and priorities in accordance with its objective of creating safer and stronger communities. I welcome today's motion. The eight Scottish police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Scottish Crime and Drug <place-holder colnum=\"4828\"/> Enforcement Agency have made great strides in their attempts to reduce the activities of organised crime.</p><p>I will talk more about the methods that are employed by the crime overlords, while acknowledging that Scotland is just a pawn in worldwide organised crime. I hope that a lasting benefit of the debate is that a light is shone on the activities of crime families and how deeply the problem is embedded in our society. Many of the resources of the various crime enforcement agencies are targeted at the fight against illegal drugs in our communities&#8212;to which Bill Butler referred&#8212;and the associated human costs, namely family break-up. As we have heard in recent debates, grandparents are forced to intervene to provide support to counter the problems that are associated with second and third-generation drug addiction.</p><p>Clearly, economics is a factor. Illegal drugs such as cocaine are cheaper and more affordable because, in recent times, the market has been flooded by an oversupply of class A drugs in our urban and rural communities. The drugs are not produced in Scotland, which adds an international dimension to the criminal activities. The returns for getting involved are deemed to be worth while financially, which reduces the risks in the eyes of those who commit organised crime on a daily basis&#8212;it is their perverse economic contribution to society. A number of years ago, at a seminar, a senior police officer indicated that the black economy, through the drugs industry, was the third or fourth highest earner in Scotland. That shows the value of that market. The availability of class A drugs, and people's demand for them, drives the returns from crime. We should take any opportunity we can to smash that economic force.</p><p>Since its establishment, the SCDEA has acknowledged the important principle of following the money. One of the agency's key operating functions, the Scottish money laundering unit, recognises that crime is not confined to some small-scale outfit operating in the schemes of Scotland's bigger urban cities. The activities of some of Scotland's professions need serious scrutiny, as they can unwittingly and sometimes tacitly offer a support structure to protect organised crime's ill-gotten gains.</p><p>As my colleague Stuart McMillan said in connection with the private hire car companies that are being established throughout Scotland, local authority planning and licensing departments are not always best equipped to tackle the level of activity that is associated with organised crime in their areas. As we have heard, many MSPs have been approached with allegations that builders or private hire taxi companies are nothing more than front organisations for serious organised crime. I <place-holder colnum=\"4829\"/> am not saying that every individual or company in those industries is involved in organised crime, but the situation has become so bad that legitimate businesses are under threat from criminal elements. The laundering of ill-gotten gains through such routes means that legitimate companies often struggle to maintain their businesses.</p><p>The need to tackle serious organised crime has never been greater in today's society, and it is right that the Scottish Government should give such a high priority to its desire to create safer communities. It is a fair comment that crime families not only operate in the sectors of business to which I have referred, but move into others when they see opportunities. I am surely not the only one who has been surprised by the proliferation of so-called business enterprises&#8212;tanning parlours and nail salons seem to be the latest such enterprises&#8212;over the past few years.</p><p>Like many other members who are present, I had the dubious pleasure of being in the chamber for the members' business debate on the Glasgow Milton and Chirnsyde community initiative. The debate was not bad&#8212;quite the opposite: the practical examples that were raised during the debate highlighted the courage of a community and its activists under real attack from organised crime in a shameful state of affairs&#8212;but the lack of support that the community activists received from officialdom showed signs of institutional inertia.</p><p>That inertia should not be repeated in a modern Scotland. Indeed, I am hopeful that the serious organised crime task force will make a significant and sustained contribution to tackling organised crime head on and ensuring that the proceeds of crime are redirected to assist communities in our fight against organised crime.</p><p>I conclude by supporting Margaret Smith's plea that the cabinet secretary should make every effort to speed up the creation of the Scottish Police Services Authority campus at Gartcosh so that we can bring under one roof the combined forces that can tackle crime head on, not only in Scotland or Britain but throughout Europe and the rest of the world. As I mentioned, crime is not confined to Scotland. The international dimension shows not only that we have to tackle crime at root cause in Scotland, but that we must work with other agencies throughout the world to ensure that we tackle it at that level. We must not become insular and consider only Scotland's problems, but should work with agencies throughout the world to ensure that we root out the real causes of crime that blight our society today.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395119", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have great pleasure in speaking in the debate because, unlike the subjects of other debates, serious organised crime in Scotland is an issue that resonates with people and is not viewed in the abstract.

Indeed, when she attended a recent meeting of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust to represent the interests of Chryston, Auchinloch and Gartcosh in North Lanarkshire, she discovered that, even though her father had been dead for 25 years, some of the retired miners still had fond memories of his work as an NUM activist and in the pit. It is important <place-holder colnum=\"4040\"/> that, despite the decline of some of those communities, we pay tribute to the people who came out of them, particularly national heroes such as Jock Stein, who worked in the mines and showed that people like him could make a contribution not only to their communities but to wider society.</p><p>Although the Coalfields Regeneration Trust was established in 1999 in recognition of the suffering that had been experienced by mining communities, it has in recent years retargeted its focus to work with community planning partnerships in various local authorities. I assert that, in North Lanarkshire, other funders have felt that the work has been a bit hit-and-miss. The case for retaining the Scottish allocation to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust is worth making; indeed, in that respect, one need only refer back to a question on investment in former mining communities that my colleague Fiona Hyslop asked way back in February 2000.</p><p>The 2007 report \"Coalfields and neighbouring cities: Economic regeneration, labour markets and governance\", which was produced by Sheffield Hallam University's Tony Gore on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, highlighted that regeneration and employment opportunities are linked to neighbouring cities. The Scottish element of the report focused on the relationship between the Lothian coalfield communities and Edinburgh, and concluded that the coalfield communities' proximity to Edinburgh had led to more commuting into the city and an increased population in the communities.</p><p>In comparison, many parts of Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Fife and other areas suffer from deep-seated levels of poverty and, as a consequence, depopulation. It would be remiss of me not to highlight the issue of hidden unemployment and the fact that a significant number of people are claiming incapacity benefit. For example, in North Lanarkshire, 12.7 per cent of people of working age are in receipt of disability benefits. Indeed, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust has acknowledged the issue of deprivation by focusing its resources on Clackmannanshire, East Ayrshire, Fife and North Lanarkshire.</p><p>My plea to the minister is that the Coalfields Regeneration Trust receives funding to allow it to continue its vital work in many communities, not only by investing in capital but in other ways.

The Scottish Government is clearly attempting to develop a realistic approach to the Scottish legal services market. I certainly welcome this debate, as some people might be under the impression that this issue has raised its head only in the past couple of months, especially if the letters pages of some of our older newspaper titles are to be believed. That is not the case. The issue, in fact, goes back to the first session of Parliament, when the Justice 1 Committee held an inquiry into regulation of the legal profession.</p><p>Sir David Clementi's report on business structures and legal services in England and Wales advances the prospect of legal organisations raising external capital in order to expand. Although Sir David has in certain quarters been demonised for stating that it is perfectly acceptable for Tesco, for example, to gain entry <place-holder colnum=\"3423\"/> into the legal services market, the fact is that his report, which was published in December 2004, argued that the fit to own test should be applied to any company that seeks to move into the legal profession.</p><p>Although I do not hail from a professional legal background, I have some knowledge of legal issues with regard to the modern workplace&#8212;in particular, employment law&#8212;and to housing law.</p><p>There is an issue about the provision of legal services, and I would argue that, in certain cases, people who are not professionals can deliver legal advice.</p><p>On the main issues identified with regard to competition in and regulation of Scottish legal services, some hold the view that any change in the current structures will lead to a dumbing down and dilution of services, which will strike at the heart of the unique Scottish legal system. Others might say that there are vested interests and restrictive practices at work in modern Scotland.</p><p>Part of the reason for today's debate is the fact that the OFT received a super-complaint from the Consumers Association&#8212;more commonly known as Which?&#8212;on 8 May 2007. The super-complaint arose from the commencement of the Enterprise Act 2002, section 11 of which allows a designated consumer body to raise a matter that it thinks harms significantly the interests of the consumer. In its role as super-complainer, Which? asked the OFT to consider whether certain restrictions were preventing consumers from getting the legal services that they needed.</p><p>\"Consumer\" is not an abstract term; it means all of us in the chamber and people in wider society in Scotland who are provided with legal services by the two professional bodies, the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates, which regulate the legal profession. I confess that one of my oldest friends is an advocate, although I did not seek counsel from him on this debate&#8212;nor did he offer any. At least my bank balance is higher than it would have been if I had asked for his opinion.</p><p>As other members have said, the Law Society does not allow non-lawyers to own or be a partner in a legal firm. It prevents solicitors from forming a legal partnership with non-lawyers, such as accountants or engineers, with a view to offering professional services.</p><p>The Faculty of Advocates compels its members to practice as sole traders; it prevents them from working in partnership with other advocates, solicitors or others to provide legal services. Rules of the faculty mean that individuals cannot instruct an advocate without first instructing a solicitor. Some might argue&#8212;perhaps validly&#8212;that consumer rights are therefore limited. As a <place-holder colnum=\"3424\"/> consumer, I cannot instruct an advocate directly and have to go through a solicitor acting as a middleman.</p><p>Which? stated clearly that it felt that the interests of the consumer were being harmed. It thought that the present arrangements prevent lawyers from introducing innovations to meet the needs and aspirations of their customers. More to the point, service providers are unable to use new business structures to become more efficient, which could lead to lower prices in the legal services market.</p><p>Restrictions can be removed without the need for new legislation, although Which? acknowledges that allowing non-lawyers to get involved in Scottish legal services would require new legal frameworks to be introduced.</p><p>Which?, in its role as the consumer champion, has said that a new Scottish legal services board, which is independent of the legal profession and Government and which has responsibility for regulating the legal services market, should be established.</p><p>The OFT, in its response of 31 July 2007 to the super-complaint, made recommendations to the present Government broadly supporting the complaint that restrictions are a feature of the legal marketplace in Scotland and that action is needed to remove them. Furthermore, the response indicated that efficiency gains and more innovation are required in the provision of legal services in Scotland. Kyla Brand, the OFT representative in Scotland, said that individuals and businesses are hugely important to growth prospects because \"they underpin economic success\".</p><p>There are practical examples of how the present system is failing the consumer. For instance, people are sometimes loth to get legal representation if they are working because the benefits taper kicks in and they are unable to get legal aid, so they have to pay for services. Some say that they are not getting value for money.</p><p>Alistair Morris, chief executive of Pagan Osborne has criticised the Scottish Government's approach as \"protectionism\" in the desire to buck the market over Tesco law. Others have said that we should set our face against choice and change, such as allowing third-party entries into the market place, as that would lead to cherry picking of the best customers.</p><p>There is a growing demand for change from within the legal profession, as Richard Henderson, president of the Law Society of Scotland, acknowledges.</p><p>Change is inevitable. The alternative is that in future the market will be introspective, with the usual suspects dictating to the consumer.<place-holder colnum=\"3425\"/></p><p>As Bill Aitken said, in 2004 the bill for Scottish legal services was almost &#163;1 billion and it has now increased to &#163;1.2 billion. Modernisation should be welcomed. The commodification of legal services is already a factor in the marketplace structure. If anyone goes for a mortgage or a remortgage these days, the banks and building societies usually include a legal panel for conveyancing purposes.</p><p>I welcome the motion and the amendment. I look forward to the additional opportunities for the legal profession to raise finance to ensure that our existing legal firms have the capacity to grow.</p><p>The global environment is tough and business structures within the legal marketplace are changing, whether by design or stealth. That is typified by the recent example of Australian law firm Slater &amp; Gordon, a class action specialist, which was floated on the Australian stock exchange in May 2007 and which is now valued at 150 million Australian dollars, which is &#163;62 million.</p><p>The motion is about the delivery of Scottish solutions for Scottish problems.</p><p>In no debate on the legal services market in Scotland could we fail to mention legal aid. Under the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007, the Scottish Legal Aid Board's work will include registering advisers and agencies other than lawyers and ensuring that they meet the code of practice.</p><p>There were 119,293 grants of civil legal assistance in 2006-07&#8212;a reduction of 7 per cent&#8212;although within that total, the number of civil aid grants rose by 3 per cent, reversing the trend in the past three years.</p><p>We should introduce innovation and access to new finance to assist existing legal structures to expand, but that must not be at the expense of the provision of legal advice at the point of need for the majority of the population. All concerned must see this is an opportunity, not a threat.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391953", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Legal Services Market"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the Cabinet Secretary for Justice on the motion and Pauline McNeill on her amendment.

Gavin Brown quoted only part of the minister's written answer in January 2000. The minister also stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Research is currently being undertaken on the effectiveness of the mediation services provided as part of the In-Court Adviser service\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-01-11.S1W-3494.h\">[<em>Official Report, Written Answers</em>, 11 January 2000; S1W-3494.]</citation></p><p>Almost eight years later, the new Scottish Government has key principles and priorities in connection with its declared objective of creating safer and stronger communities. As a way of significantly reducing the need to go through the court process, the Administration has placed an emphasis on the introduction of dispute resolution processes and the development of a modern system of arbitration in Scotland, which is highlighted in the document \"Principles and Priorities: The Government's Programme for Scotland\".<place-holder colnum=\"2947\"/></p><p>The lasting benefit of alternative dispute resolution is that it greatly reduces both sides' expenses in a dispute. Pursuing grievances through the courts is burdensome; neither side is the winner because going to court is an expensive and costly mechanism for all parties.</p><p>The need to save the public pound is also an important point that any Government must address. Preventing unnecessary expense is a saving for us all as taxpayers. The requirement for public bodies to save money, particularly when they may be involved in litigation, should be of paramount importance. The opportunity cost of unnecessary litigation is that money is denied to vital public services such as hospitals, schools and community facilities.</p><p>Alternative dispute resolution is not an unfamiliar process to members who have a background in pursuing economic and social justice. We are all well aware of the need to develop practical solutions for everyday problems. The concept of ADR is well founded in good practice in the modern workplace, as Pauline McNeill said in relation to ACAS. There is good practice in arbitration in industrial relations, but there should be more arbitration in commercial disputes.</p><p>A number of years ago, ACAS found that, in certain disputes for which arbitration was required, employers were not applying employment legislation correctly. ACAS believed that the employers needed training and so referred individual employers to lawyers who specialised in employment law. The advice was that the employers should get that training because they needed it.</p><p>Over a number of years, ACAS has developed its own training services. It must be commended for the level and range of training that it has provided to employers, which has helped to prevent the types of dispute that previously took place because employers were unaware of their responsibilities under employment legislation. ACAS provides an example of good practice in taking things forward through not only arbitration, but the delivery of training.</p><p>We should focus particularly on how ACAS has acted as a champion in helping to sustain a motivated workforce. It has shown the kind of leadership that is particularly relevant in ADR. ACAS has achieved significant advances in marketing its model workplace as a vital tool, which gives employers and employees practical, effective assistance. Such diagnostic models and examples of best practice can be used to inform the Scottish Government's direction of travel on mediation services.</p><p>There is a requirement to resolve disputes. Less than 50 per cent of the people whose disputes <place-holder colnum=\"2948\"/> were resolved through the courts or tribunals as a last resort said that they had been well served by the process, whereas 70 per cent of people who had resolved their problem by agreement said that they had achieved or partially achieved their objective.</p><p>Research into ADR continues, but take-up and use of ADR vary and the old adage about having one's day in court seems to persist. We should focus on work on the key principles behind the establishment of an ombudsman. In essence, appropriately qualified third parties should assist people to resolve their problems without recourse to the courts. Research that the previous Scottish Executive and the Scottish Consumer Council undertook highlighted the need for the civil courts review that is going on under the chairmanship of the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Gill, in the context of the promotion of dispute resolution at an early stage without recourse to the courts.</p><p>The booklet, \"Resolving Disputes Without Going to Court\", which was published in November 2006, noted that people need to agree that ADR can produce the result that they want. As the booklet says, if the priority of a person who has been injured during medical treatment is compensation rather than redress, they are unlikely to get the outcome that they seek through the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. That might explain the situation that Andy Kerr described in his response to a written question in 2006, in which he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The number of cases alleging medical negligence against NHSScotland put forward by the Central Legal Office for alternative dispute resolution, including mediation, in each year since 1999-2000 is seven.\"</p><p>The response continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Of these cases, none achieved a satisfactory conclusion through the use of alternative dispute resolution.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-09-19.S2W-28243.h\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers,</em> 19 September 2006; S2W-28243.]</citation></p><p>It would be remiss of me not to note that there is resistance to ADR throughout the legal fraternity and society at large.

The tour included a visit to the prison block cells and an opportunity to talk to staff who operate the link service in the prison. The link service introduces newly admitted prisoners to the prison regime and offers those prisoners counselling and other support services. The link centre also works towards preparing prisoners for their release by linking with Jobcentre Plus and other agencies&#8212;including organisations in the voluntary sector&#8212;and by bringing together a number of support services in preparation for prisoners' release.</p><p>We also visited the workshop where prisoners are introduced to construction skills and can achieve a nationally recognised certification level. That increases the opportunities for released prisoners to find employment in the building trade, although in many respects, the construction industry has failed to engage with the project. We have to address that failing.<place-holder colnum=\"2024\"/></p><p>Two of the main issues that staff identified in relation to prisoners' release were housing and employment. In Glasgow, prisoners are put in direct contact with housing providers, and they mainly find accommodation in city centre hostels; but prisoners returning to other local authority areas are issued only with a telephone contact number for a housing provider. That is a disgrace in this day and age. We are releasing prisoners straight into the community without any roof over their head.</p><p>Over lunch during the visit, we were able to discuss frankly with staff some of the issues that they identified, such as the high number of prisoners who come from deprived areas. That issue has been raised time and time again in this chamber. The staff highlighted the fact that poverty plays a part in some people finding themselves involved in activities that lead them to become involved in the criminal justice system.</p><p>We also discussed with staff some of the alternatives to custody, such as home detention curfews. Such schemes could be extended, in particular for those who have been put on remand. It was felt that, for some individuals, that would be a better option than prison and would allow them to carry on with work and to remain with their family. Many people on remand lose a lot more than their liberty. They can lose their job, income, home and family. However, I accept that, in the interests of community safety and where relevant, certain individuals should be remanded.</p><p>Although concern about crime is nothing new, the concept that prison works is also nothing new, which is why I welcome the proposal to establish an independent commission to consider the use and purpose of prison. I am hopeful that such an independent commission will be as successful as the Kilbrandon committee, which was established in 1961 to examine issues of juvenile justice and children's welfare. The Kilbrandon recommendations gave a radical edge to policy development in the area of justice and built the foundations for the children's hearings and panel system. By putting lay members at the heart of the process, the Kilbrandon report still has lessons for today's justice agenda. To date, 10,000 lay members of children's panels have been appointed. Putting the public at the centre of such penal policy initiatives means that people take ownership of their communities.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13388206", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Penal Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the timing of this debate.

I had the privilege of working with tenants and residents groups in Castlemilk after its designation in 1988 by the then Conservative Government at Westminster as one of the new life for urban Scotland partnership areas.</p><p>The United Kingdom Government policies of right to buy and large-scale voluntary transfer have produced many changes in the housing market in the past 25 years. Moreover, there was a push in recent times by the two previous Scottish Executive Administrations towards large-scale voluntary stock transfers of public sector housing, which was marketed as community ownership. Some people might say that that was pushing the concept a touch too far.</p><p>That was typified by Glasgow City Council's stock transfer in 2001, which led to the creation of the Glasgow Housing Association. It is clearly a great misnomer to call the GHA a \"housing association\"&#8212;that term was used to build on the perception of local housing associations as successful agents for local change. That policy thrust took place not only in an urban context, but in rural areas&#8212;for example, the housing stock transfer from Argyll and Bute Council.</p><p>The <em>Social Housing Journal</em> of May 2007 highlighted the fact that Argyll Community Housing Association received gap funding from the public purse to the extent that the UK Exchequer and Communities Scotland wrote off its housing debt of &#163;48 million. In addition, Communities Scotland provided early action funding of &#163;15 million.</p><p>The gap funding in the GHA's finances has been well documented, but it is significant that the stock condition survey&#8212;commissioned by the GHA, funded by the public purse and undertaken by Savills&#8212;has not, to my knowledge, been made public. The survey is cloaked in secrecy and I urge <place-holder colnum=\"1065\"/> the minister and the Scottish Government to make public the survey document, which I believe goes to the heart of the issue of the GHA's financial viability.</p><p>That brings me to the issue of corporate governance and the role of Communities Scotland. I note what the minister said about that agency, but I seek assurances about the timetable for implementing the SNP manifesto commitments on Communities Scotland. All too often, there has been a revolving-door situation in that Government agency. A culture exists in which an officer leaves his or her post, joins a consultancy or becomes a consultant to advise housing bodies on, for example, regulation and inspection, then further down the line is re-employed by Communities Scotland. It could be argued that there are conflicts of interests in the roles and remits of that organisation's staff.</p><p>On the corporate governance issues that relate particularly to registered social landlords and housing associations, some larger associations have a small shareholding membership. Peter Malpass and Alan Murie, who are well-respected housing professors, used the phrase \"self-perpetuating oligarchies\" to describe housing association committees.</p><p>Homelessness and social inclusion are key issues that the Government must tackle, and a holistic approach to health and housing is crucial. However, only with independence can that agenda be taken forward to make a sustained contribution towards creating a healthier Scotland.</p><p>The term \"affordability\" has entered the language of housing in Scotland in the past few years. However, the issue of what people can afford to pay to meet their housing needs has always been paramount in the context of household budgets.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the minister on his appointment to a new&#8212;and, in the coming years, no doubt challenging&#8212;role.
