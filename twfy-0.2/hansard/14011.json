We want Scotland to be one of the fairest and most equal places in the world. That is why we support the bill enabling gay, transgender and lesbian couples to marry. When MSPs met to debate the bill back in November, I was pleased to have the opportunity to vote in favour of the bill and I of course remain supportive of the bill.</p><p>The bill demonstrates that our society values every person equally, irrespective of their sexuality, and that we regard every relationship as worthy of equal recognition. If two people in a loving relationship want to formalise that relationship through a religious or civil marriage ceremony, that should be the case. They should not be prevented from doing so. In other words, there should be no differentiation between what is available to same-sex or to mixed-sex couples.</p><p>I strongly believe that that sense of fairness and equality also runs deep in the psyche of every Scot. Indeed, that view has been reflected in the emails and letters that I have received over the past few months. Key to the whole debate has been the issue of respect for everyone&#8217;s opinions and getting the balance right.</p><p>The bill as it stood earlier struck a good balance. It was recognised that, in voting to uphold the intention of the bill to allow for equal marriage, it was also important to respect the rights of individuals and faith organisations not to carry out same-sex marriages if they do not wish to. I believe that the stage 2 amendments acknowledged that balance.</p><p>As a Lib Dem and someone who was brought up in a household of good churchgoers&#8212;with a mother who broke another mould by becoming the first woman elder in the parish&#8212;I believe that it is important to do the right thing. Inequality is a form of oppression and can manifest itself in many forms, some more subtle than others, and to varying degrees. It is true that society has come a long way on gay rights and equality issues, but I do not buy the argument that gay people should be happy with what they have, as though they have already been given some special concession.</p><p>The idea that a gay couple should have no legal right to a religious or civil marriage ceremony makes the massive assumption that marriage does not apply to those in a same-sex relationship and that they cannot express their religious view or commitment to marriage. To take that a step further, preventing same-sex couples from marrying is preventing a section of the population from expressing their marriage beliefs, which in my view represents a subtle and creeping oppression.</p><p>Back in the 19th century, the businesswoman Anne Lister, whose diaries, which were discovered after her death, revealed much about her private life, said it best when she wrote of her sexuality:</p><p>&#8220;This is my nature. To act in opposition to my nature would be more wrong for me than to be a married woman. I am living my life with the nature that God gave me. It is perfectly ok&#8221;.</p><p>As an aside, it is interesting to note that Anne Lister should primarily be remembered for being the so-called &#8220;first modern lesbian&#8221;. In fact, she is arguably a role model for women and men to this day. She was an independent businesswoman in her own right and became one of the first women to climb the Pyrenees. She lived her life her way, with the nature that God gave her.</p><p>We are not giving preferential treatment to any one group; we are simply saying that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have the same rights. Anything less is inhumane. I am proud to stand up for equality of marriage in Scotland. There can be no excuse for isolating a section of the population for any reason, whether that is on the basis of religious affiliation, skin colour or gender. For that reason, I will be proud to support the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill through its final stage today, as will, I believe, my fellow Lib Dems.</p><p>I should recognise the many constituents who have contacted me and others in support of the bill. We should also recognise the positive campaign, in particular by Stonewall and the Equality Network, throughout the debate. We should of course have respect for other people&#8217;s views, in the chamber and outside it.</p><p>We should also give recognition to Alex Neil for his determination to bring the bill to the Parliament and for the meetings that he held with me and others to ensure that Scotland can be seen as a leading light for equality. I look forward to voting yes for this historic bill at decision time today.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Fairness and equality run through the veins of every true Liberal Democrat I know.

Scottish food and drink is, generally, a success story and an area that we all want to encourage to grow. However, last month, The Scottish Farmer reported that Scottish beef prices are becoming the most expensive in the world, at around 430p per dead-weight kilo, due to the severe shortage of the product and the high demand for it. That might sound like good news for some, but that shortage is worrying for the long-term sustainability of the industry. We have seen the closure of abattoirs due to lack of throughput. The Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers reckons that the number of Scottish suckler cows has reduced by 60,000, down to 450,000, in only nine years&#8212;that is a 12 per cent reduction and represents a decline that I think that we would all want to tackle. We want an increase in the number of cattle, not a decrease. Of course, the UK is now reliant on imports to meet the demand for beef.</p><p>Land that is classified as rough grazing is the breeding ground for beef and lamb, and is where we find our most fragile communities. My amendment, which unfortunately was not selected for debate, suggested that the uniform approach that is being taken to the issue of rough grazing is flawed. That is not my word but the word that was used by the NFU. In fact, the NFU went further, stating that the approach is</p><p>&#8220;fundamentally flawed and risks production, communities and infrastructure in our largest and most fragile region.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to state that the most intensively stocked hills will be subject to heavy cuts that will trigger accelerated de-stocking.</p><p>I have seen evidence from my region to back that view. It comes not from me or from my sons, who farm the home farm, but from a tenant farmer who has given me figures. He would be happy to share them with the cabinet secretary&#8212;or the minister, who also represents the area. They show that his farm would lose 50 per cent of support. That is a farm that rises to more than 2,000 feet, and on which there is no option of growing different crops. It is a farm like many across Scotland that are the breeding places for Scottish beef and lamb, of which we can all be proud. It is an active farm that has as many sheep and cattle as it did at the point 14 years ago to which the historic payments relate.</p><p>Would the cabinet secretary or the minister agree to meet me and that farmer, or other farmers I could bring along, to discuss the consequences of a uniform payment regime for rough grazing land? That uniform scheme would, bizarrely, hit the active farms worst, while at the same time benefiting the extensive hill lands on which there is little activity and which are run by people whom some of us would recognise as slipper farmers.</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary examine the possibility of applying different payment rates for rough grazing land, on objective criteria, as the NFU strongly suggests?</p><p>In my unselected amendment, I also mentioned the importance of the UK home market of 60 million people. I recently visited a successful farming and food business that employs 230 people and turns over around &#163;52 million a year. It is, of course, not a typical farm business, but it is an important driver of a rural economy. It sells 25 per cent of its product&#8212;with the saltire stamped on it&#8212;to our home market and 75 per of it, which also has the union jack stamped on it, south of the border. The English are as conscious of buying local as we are. Unprovoked, that business said that it would have to move production south of the border to retain the ability to sell its product as local, which would take jobs and money away from Scotland. I think that, currently, we have the best of three worlds: we can sell products as produce of the UK, produce of Scotland and produce of the EU. The EU market is one of some 500 million potential customers, which is about 7 per cent of the world&#8217;s population.

As Willie Coffey has already said, I dare say that most of us in the chamber will know of someone who has either committed or attempted suicide. I know of more than one, unfortunately, and Kenny Gibson mentioned a few of his family members. It is hard to articulate just how much the friends and relatives of those concerned can suffer in the aftermath. It is important that we drive down the number of suicides in Scotland and that any framework that is put in place to achieve that aim is fit for purpose.</p><p>The latest strategy follows on from &#8220;Choose Life: A National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland&#8221;, which was published in 2002, and it certainly builds on some of the successes of its predecessor. The 18 per cent reduction in suicides in Scotland and the fact that all probationer police officers and 50 per cent of front-line NHS staff are now trained in suicide prevention techniques provide a good platform on which to build.</p><p>I have highlighted in previous debates on mental health that it is vital that we end the spectre of patients being condemned to long-term repeat prescriptions for antidepressants without regular reviews of their response to the treatment. The strategy highlights how important it is that we make a concerted effort to change that, as it notes that,</p><p>&#8220;at the time of death, many people are receiving some form of medication used in the treatment of mental illness.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps something as simple as a review of their medication with a change to the dosage or the drug may have made a difference to their mood.</p><p>The minister will be well aware of the successful pilot that was held in Glasgow in which participating practices reviewed those who were on antidepressants for more than two years. It led to 28 per cent of patients having a change in their therapy and an 8 per cent reduction in prescribing costs. Reviews can make a difference, but I appreciate that the use of antidepressants is essential in many cases.</p><p>I was delighted to come across commitment 7 in the strategy, which reads:</p><p>&#8220;We will work with the Royal College of General Practitioners and other relevant stakeholders to develop approaches to ensure more regular review of those on long-term drug treatment for mental illness, to ensure that patients receive the safest and most appropriate treatment.&#8221;</p><p>I welcome the inclusion of that important commitment in the strategy and I would be grateful if the minister provided in his summing-up a timeframe for engaging with stakeholders on working towards those much-needed reviews.</p><p>In 2008, the Scottish Government published &#8220;Equally Well: Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Inequalities&#8221;, which makes recommendations on tackling health inequalities. It said that one of the challenges that faced the ministerial task force was that</p><p>&#8220;Those living in the most deprived&#8221;</p><p>10 per cent of</p><p>&#8220;areas of Scotland have a suicide risk double that of the Scottish average.&#8221;</p><p>I appreciate the mention of farmers and vets by Nanette Milne and Kenny Gibson. It is without doubt that the incidence of suicide among such people is high because they have access to the means of committing suicide.</p><p>I was disappointed that health inequalities merited only one fleeting mention in the suicide prevention strategy. The link between inequalities and greater rates of suicide is acknowledged in &#8220;Equally Well&#8221;, and it merits greater inclusion in the overall discussion on preventing suicide.</p><p>Timely access to psychological therapies has a role to play in treating those with mental illness more effectively, and I hope that it would have the knock-on effect of reducing the number of suicides further. I therefore welcomed the target of access to psychological therapies within 18 weeks of referral as a positive step. However, I caution that, for someone who is suffering from mental anguish, 18 weeks is a long time to wait. Many such patients have of course suffered for some time before their referral. The minister should not limit his ambitions to 18 weeks.</p><p>The target is due for delivery by December, so this is not the time to move backwards. In September, there was a 3 per cent drop in the number who are being treated on time. One fifth have to wait more than 18 weeks for treatment, so the Scottish Government cannot rest on its laurels yet.</p><p>The head of psychological services in one health board told me that, alongside its counterparts in other areas, that board is constantly making the case for greater investment in mental health services. Yesterday, I visited Midpark hospital in Dumfries, which I know that the minister visited in 2012&#8212;I saw his signature in the visitors book. NHS boards are experiencing increasing demand for such services because of the economic downturn and&#8212;perhaps more positively&#8212;because the public are becoming much more aware of the services&#8217; availability.</p><p>I hope that we might be beginning to see some erosion of the stigma that has plagued mental health. The Scottish Government needs to continue to address that. It will also have to address the clear disparity that exists across Scotland in access to clinical and other applied psychologists. It cannot be right that, per head of population, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Fife have twice the number of psychologists that NHS Forth Valley has. If the health improvement, efficiency and governance, access and treatment&#8212;HEAT&#8212;target is to be met later this year, access must be addressed urgently.</p><p>Suicide is difficult for those who are left to comprehend.

I also associate myself with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s Christmas message in which he spoke of the extraordinary work that is undertaken daily by NHS staff across Scotland to improve the lives of others.</p><p>NHS staff are the lifeblood of the health service. Just as we look on them to ensure our welfare in times of need, they rely on us to ensure that their welfare is taken care of. However, the reality is that many front-line staff are under extreme pressure. Just last month the BMA chairman, Dr Brian Keighley, warned us that reports of stress and burn-out among all grades of clinical staff are emerging across the service. That followed the &#8220;RCN Employment survey 2013&#8221;, which was published in early December and which also made for alarming reading. It revealed that 54 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s nurses are working more than their contracted weekly hours, with much of the overtime going unpaid; that 58 per cent reported being under too much pressure; and that&#8212;this should really keep the cabinet secretary up at night&#8212;55 per cent believe that they are unable, because of pressure, to provide the standard of care that they would like to provide.</p><p>When pressure continues to be piled on any employee, corners will inevitably be cut. That might be tolerable in many professions, but when decisions and actions can mean life or death, corner-cutting simply cannot be tolerated. As has been said, we have only to look at NHS Lanarkshire to see why the cabinet secretary should be&#8212;I am sure that he is&#8212;straining every sinew to support the majority of nurses who believe that they cannot provide the standard of care that they want to provide. Healthcare Improvement Scotland was moved to make 21 recommendations following its discovery of poor working conditions, inadequate staffing, delays in admitting emergency patients and patients not being listened to. Although no definitive conclusions could be drawn, it is telling that quality of care could not be ruled out as a factor behind the unusually high mortality rates.</p><p>At this point, I must take issue with a specific part of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s amendment that praises the Scottish patient safety programme and the role that it plays in Scotland&#8217;s hospitals. I do not contest that point, but I refer the cabinet secretary to Healthcare Improvement Scotland&#8217;s report into NHS Lanarkshire, which stated:</p><p>&#8220;The review team found that awareness of the Scottish Patient Safety Programme was low in the majority of areas it visited, with little evidence that staff were consistently applying improvement techniques, although there were exceptions. Some elements of the programme, specifically Executive Safety Walkrounds are not in place and other key patient safety interventions need to be reliably implemented.&#8221;</p><p>I presume that it will be of some concern to the cabinet secretary that not only are some elements of his world-leading patient safety programme not being implemented, but some staff are not even aware of its existence. The cabinet secretary must ensure that that particular finding is exclusive to NHS Lanarkshire and not widespread throughout the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>The pressures that staff face are born out of many things including, of course, the expectations that are placed on staff by Government, but staffing bottlenecks in some wards, hospitals and specialties across Scotland also contribute. The latest NHS workforce statistics up to September 2013 reveal a significant increase in consultant, nursing and midwifery vacancies. In just 12 months, an additional 70 consultant posts were lying empty, which is double the number in September 2012; and there was a 26 per cent increase in the number of posts that had been lying empty for over six months. In that same period, there was a 28 per cent increase in the number of nursing and midwifery vacancies, with nearly 1,400 posts lying empty, and a 27 per cent increase in those lying empty for over six months.</p><p>The recruitment issue that the BMA and the RCN continue to warn us about should be one of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s main priorities.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

On head and neck cancer treatment, in addition to the excessive waiting times in Grampian, 12.5 per cent of patients in NHS Highland and more than 41 per cent in NHS Ayrshire and Arran are waiting for longer than 62 days.</p><p>Jim Eadie intervened during my opening speech to ask whether I welcome the increase in students.

Many constituents from South Scotland, which includes east Lothian, use ERI, so I will be happy to work constructively with Jim Eadie on the matter.</p><p>The amendment in the name of the cabinet secretary&#8212;oh, I see that he is off out of the chamber&#8212;says that patients are being treated &#8220;faster than ever&#8221;. There is no doubt that good work has been done. However, there are particular problems for cancer sufferers in certain areas, such as NHS Grampian, which I know have had an impact on patients in Orkney and Shetland. The cabinet secretary&#8212;or perhaps the Minister for Public Health&#8212;must explain why problems have arisen with urological and head and neck cancer patients. The figures in some areas are appalling. The detect cancer early initiative, record-breaking treatment times and the patient safety programme mean nothing to patients who are waiting for a phone call or letter to tell them that their radiotherapy or chemotherapy is finally about to start.</p><p>Many of our emergency departments were plunged into crisis last year, and concerns remain. We hope that staff will have an easier time this year, but compliance with targets has fallen again nationally, with nine of our 14 health boards failing to meet the four-hour target in the three months to September&#8212;and that was before winter, with all the pressure that that brings. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s assertion that patients are being treated &#8220;faster than ever&#8221; does not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>Between the July and September of the SNP Government&#8217;s first full year in office, just 7,385 patients were not treated in and discharged from emergency departments within four hours. The figure for the corresponding period last year has almost trebled to just over 20,000. The stats do not tell us how many of those people waited on a trolley for six, eight or even 12 hours. Time will tell whether the cabinet secretary&#8217;s unscheduled care action plan will be a success. I hope that it will be a success. However, are 18 consultants enough to drive back a threefold increase in the number of people who are not treated within four hours?</p><p>I regret that I cannot support the cabinet secretary&#8217;s amendment. I nearly supported it, but it glosses over the legitimate concerns that I have raised and the stats on cancer treatment and A and E waiting times, which are all available on the Information Services Division Scotland website. However, I am happy to take up the cabinet secretary&#8217;s offer&#8212;he is still absent&#8212;to work together on the 2020 vision for our NHS, and I appreciate his constructive comments in that regard.</p><p>These are challenging times for the NHS, particularly as there appears to be a consensus, and rightly so, on creating a 24/7 service that is fit for the 21st century and takes a person-centred approach. That will require resources and adequate staffing, which simply are not there in many areas.</p><p>Our NHS is our nation&#8217;s most loved and valued service. We face the challenges that I mentioned in my opening speech, as well as challenges in relation to staffing and recruitment.

Although at the time there were differences on how quickly Scotland should have to act, we came up with a world-leading piece of legislation. Under the act, there is a responsibility to ensure that we are as prepared as we can be for climate change effects. Basically, that involves a risk assessment.</p><p>Not many people do not think that there is a change in the world&#8217;s climate. Recently in Scotland, we have again seen amazing wind speeds, coupled in some parts with flooding. All of that is seemingly related to the extremes in temperature across the pond in America, where Arctic air has plunged parts of the USA into a deep freeze, with even the iconic Niagara Falls freezing.</p><p>The consultation on Scotland&#8217;s adaptation programme highlighted that the Parliament and the Government are aware of the work that is being done to make us better prepared in future. That is also the case for many public bodies, as is borne out in the list of respondents, more than half of which were public bodies that have defined duties under the act. Of the 67 responses, only three were from individuals rather than organisations and only four were from private sector organisations. It is disappointing that there were only 67 responses from the 600 or so individuals and organisations that were invited to respond.</p><p>To me, that highlights the duty that falls on us all to make climate change more relevant. We cannot deliver climate change targets and adapt to the changes that are happening without buy-in from everyone. My view is echoed by the respondents to the consultation who thought that the Government needs to make arrangements for better public engagement. In answer to question 5b, which asked whether arrangements for public engagement are sufficient, 58 per cent of respondents ticked no.</p><p>Having been a land user, I focused on who engaged with the consultation. Bearing in mind that land users are vital to help to deliver climate change mitigation and adaptation, I was alarmed that the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Scottish Land &amp; Estates, the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association, Confor and the like did not submit a response, although some gave evidence to our committee. That is not a criticism of those organisations, which all have limited resources; it is a criticism of us all and of our ability to make climate change relevant to those who can help the most. I am therefore interested in hearing the minister&#8217;s view on how the issue can best be addressed.</p><p>Respondents also emphasised the importance of capacity building, which further highlights the need for much better engagement with the public and private sectors.</p><p>I further note that respondents noted that there was a heavy emphasis on flooding, which, of course, is a highly visual and damaging effect of climate change. However, an adapted Scotland will need community partnerships&#8212;such as the Eyemouth example that the minister mentioned&#8212;for emergency responses, care for the vulnerable and the use of existing equipment, perhaps private equipment, when there are snowstorms or there is damage from winds. Organisation will have to be in place prior to any event.</p><p>A good example of that is the memorandum of understanding between Scottish Borders Council and RAYNET&#8212;volunteers from the amateur radio enthusiast world. They and their like helped in the Lockerbie disaster, the Indian Ocean tsunami and hurricane Katrina.</p><p>I welcome the progress of the draft Scottish climate change adaptation programme and the consultation. I thank all who found the time to respond. There is much in the consultation responses that I and the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will examine further.</p><p>I look forward to the minister addressing my points.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many other members, I was proud to put through the Parliament the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill back in 2009.

The bill contains some useful measures such as the overdue regulation of letting agents, the ending of the right to buy and more local flexibility in social housing allocations for landlords. However, none of that will, in any meaningful way, drive down the appalling length of Scotland&#8217;s housing waiting lists. The housing minister&#8217;s own press release highlighted that there are 400,000 people on waiting lists for housing association and council homes, which is an astonishing figure.</p><p>What the quarterly housing statistics never tell us is just how long those people have been on those lists. Information that I obtained last year revealed that two thirds of the 180,000 people on the council house application lists had been there for more than 12 months&#8212;a 6 per cent increase on the year before.</p><p>More than 60,000 of those applicants had been waiting for over three years. Let us imagine someone who has arrived at the decision that their living circumstances are no longer adequate and that an application for a new home is necessary, and then let us consider that, three years later, they are no further forward in extricating themselves from those circumstances. We can then begin to imagine the damage that is being done to the welfare of families across the country.</p><p>Why have we arrived at this point? As others have said, we can probably begin with the 29 per cent real-terms cut in the housing budget, which led to the destructive policy decision in 2010 to cut the subsidies to councils and housing associations. The cut from &#163;70,000 per home to just &#163;40,000 has had serious consequences: a 29 per cent reduction in the number of completions of homes for social rent; a 42 per cent reduction in housing association completions alone over the past three years; and a decline in the public sector housing stock in each year under the SNP Government. Although the minister announced in the summer an increase to subsidy levels, they are still some way short of 2010 levels.</p><p>The situation is bad now, but we need to be mindful of what lies further down the track. With people living longer and Scotland&#8217;s population continuing to grow, it is estimated that an additional half a million homes will be needed by 2035. Research by the previous Scottish Government, which was undertaken before the recession and the subsequent need for more social housing, revealed that 8,000 new homes for social rent were required each year to satisfy demand. The Government&#8217;s target is to build half of that.</p><p>On another note, the minister must check her facts and bring more balance to the debate. She says in her amendment that only six council houses were built in the last four years of the Labour-Lib Dem Administration. That in itself is wrong, but the minister, like all SNP members, continually fails to acknowledge the 19,704 approvals of new housing association homes under the Administration in that time. That was nearly 20,000 homes for social rent. I gently remind the minister that that is her target for the five years of the current session of Parliament and that it remains to be seen whether it will be achieved, given the recent decline in new housing association homes. In the eight years under the Lib Dem-Labour coalition, the figure for housing association new-build approvals and local authority new-build starts was 33,118. The Government has some way to go to match that record. Let us not concentrate only on council houses, because housing association houses were also built.</p><p>Prior to last week&#8217;s publication of the white paper, we were promised that it would answer all our questions and would detail what an independent Scotland would look like. Last week, more than 400,000 people were asking how they would find a new home in an independent Scotland, and they are still asking this week.</p><p>Despite the white paper being heralded as an historic document&#8212;the most important in Scottish history since the declaration of Arbroath&#8212;its 670 pages yielded three on housing. In those three pages, the Scottish Government is at great paints to highlight the constraints that are imposed on it that hamper its ability to provide affordable housing. I do not recall Westminster compelling the SNP to renege on its manifesto commitment to build 6,000 homes for social rent every year or to cut the subsidy that is provided for each home.</p><p>Would it not be fair to surmise that, with just three pages of the white paper devoted to housing, and given the Scottish Government&#8217;s failure to bring a debate to the chamber, it simply does not have the answers, the commitment or the passion to solve this crisis?</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22784886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am in my first minute.

The integration of health and social care is overdue and it is an idea whose time has certainly come. It was a key component of the Scottish Liberal Democrat manifesto for the last election, and we have long called for the delivery of common sense by having health boards, local authorities and the third sector work more closely together to provide more joined-up care and better outcomes for patients.</p><p>The pressures and challenges that the NHS faces have undoubtedly made the proposals necessary. For example, the incidence of emergency admissions has increased significantly in the past few years alone, with the largest increase among the over-75 age group.</p><p>Although I am supportive of the integration of health and social care and support the bill in principle, I share some of the reservations of many people in the public and third sectors&#8212;I will touch on those shortly&#8212;and expect further engagement from the Government to enhance the bill as it progresses.</p><p>One of my concerns, which was well articulated by Glasgow City Council and others in their evidence to the committee, is about disconnects in care provision. The failure in patient outcomes occurs not only because health and social care are not integrated, but because of the disconnect between acute and primary care. Although that is noted in the bill&#8217;s policy memorandum, some people believe that the proposals will address only one of the disconnects and will leave the other unchecked. The submission from Glasgow City Council highlighted the point that</p><p>&#8220;integration works best when GPs and other stakeholders are engaged effectively.&#8221;</p><p>The cabinet secretary was right to say in his response to the committee&#8217;s report that structural change will not in itself lead to greater partnership working, but that a cultural change is also required. I welcome his commitment that GP engagement will form part of the contract discussions, but he will have to provide more detail on the Government&#8217;s plans, irrespective of continuing negotiations.</p><p>The Scottish Government must be realistic. Demands on GPs may be about to increase significantly at a time when the proportion of the NHS budget that is given to general practice has fallen. The cabinet secretary must still explain how he plans to put a square peg in a round hole, regardless of integration joint boards agreeing integrated budgets, because the capacity and resources might simply not be available, although the desire exists.</p><p>I note COSLA&#8217;s understandable concerns regarding the degree of latitude that the bill appears to offer the cabinet secretary to widen its scope beyond adult social care and to bring any local government function within its parameters. I give him the benefit of the doubt and characterise that as an unintended erosion of local democracy and creep towards centralisation. To his credit, he appears to have realised that there is a real issue with the bill. I welcomed his commitment to the Health and Sport Committee that he would work with COSLA on amendments at stage 2 to rectify that.</p><p>That said, the air of centralised power cannot be overlooked. The electorate look to their health boards to provide their health services, and they elect their local councillors to manage their social care services. They are the people whom the electorate will, rightly, hold accountable. However, the integration plan that is designed by the two bodies cannot simply be agreed between them; it must also be signed off by Scottish ministers. The cabinet secretary will be well aware that many people have described the plans as being too prescriptive and too detailed. I suppose that they have a point.</p><p>In addition to integration plans having to be signed off, the joint integration boards have been instructed by the Scottish Government to whom their joint accountable officer will report. The Government will also tell them what their responsibilities will be. Can we not at least trust the joint integration boards to determine what is most appropriate for them locally, because they are best placed to do that? It would be interesting to find out whether the cabinet secretary agrees that it is perhaps not entirely necessary that ministers personally determine the job criteria and the line managers of newly created positions. Perhaps Michael Matheson could reflect on that in his summing-up speech.</p><p>It is not a perfect bill&#8212;far from it.

The past years have seen a massive change in the perception of same-sex couples. It has been legal for some years now to be openly gay, whereas in previous generations people were at risk of persecution and conviction. Gay people can now serve openly in the armed forces and, of course, we are proud of all who are brave enough to do so to keep us safe at home. Same-sex couples can now adopt and have the joy and the responsibilities that that brings.</p><p>This is not just another bill. It is a reform that demonstrates that our Scottish society values everyone, whatever their sexuality and their relationships.</p><p>I will not argue that all Scotland or even all members of this Parliament think that we should allow same-sex marriage, but I think that Scotland is changing. In 2002, 41 per cent of the Scottish people agreed that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, and just eight years later the proportion had risen to 61 per cent. The Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s call for evidence attracted 1,300 responses, and 75 per cent of respondents were positive about equal marriage&#8212;a clear majority. There is clearly growing support for equal marriage. If my bulging in-box is anything to go by, by far the majority are in favour of equal marriage. There is no unanimity of course, but there is a clear majority in favour.</p><p>It will not surprise members that Liberal Democrats will support the bill as it goes through the Parliament. Our constitution says:</p><p>&#8220;The Liberal Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity.&#8221;</p><p>We made equal marriage our party policy in 2010. I think that we were the first major party to do so. We submitted a positive response to the consultation, in which we said that Scotland can prove to the world that it is one of the fairest and most equal places in which to live.</p><p>The progress that we have made, for example by allowing gay people to serve in the forces, makes it more difficult to accept that there should be any barrier to a religious body that is willing to do so marrying two people who have religious beliefs and who feel strongly enough to want to accord their relationship the sanctity of marriage.</p><p>I emphasise that the religious body must be willing. I know that there are concerns that religious bodies, whatever their denomination, might be forced on human rights grounds to marry people whom they do not want to marry, but I simply do not buy that. I am aware of churches that would not marry opposite-sex couples, for example because the couple were not regular attenders. I know of no case in which such a couple would take a church to court; they would simply go to a church that was happy enough to sanctify their relationship. I cannot envisage a same-sex couple having any joy in taking a religious body to court on human rights grounds. It is worth noting that the Scottish Human Rights Commission and the Equality and Human Rights Commission support the bill.</p><p>The bill makes clear that no religious body will be required to solemnise a same-sex marriage and that even if a religious body opts in, individual celebrants will be under no obligation to marry a same-sex couple. We believe in freedom of expression, which extends to religious bodies, whether they want to opt in or out of equal marriage.</p><p>I mentioned the Liberal Democrats&#8217; support for liberty, fairness and equality and said that we will support the bill. It is worth noting work that is going on elsewhere in the UK. Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, a previous conviction for a homosexual act can be deleted. There has been a change to allow gay men to give blood and there has been an end to deporting gay asylum seekers to countries that would torture them for being gay. The UK Government encourages sports organisations to sign up to its sports charter, which calls for an end to homophobia and transphobia. There is also the UK Government&#8217;s Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. I am sure that members&#8212;at least some of them, anyway&#8212;will applaud the positive difference that Liberal Democrats in coalition have made on equal rights for all.</p><p>I am proud to be a member of the Scottish Parliament while the bill is going through, albeit that we are not the first country in Europe to legislate for equal marriage. Westminster is ahead of us, and Belgium, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Iceland have legislated, as have 16 of the 50 states of the United States of America. The bill&#8217;s progress today will prove that Scotland is a fairer and more equal country, in which we can all be proud to live.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is one of those historic days not just for the Parliament but for Scotland as a whole.

The number of vacancies has more than doubled in 18 months and it increased by about 650 in just a year.</p><p>While I am on the subject of consultant vacancies, I add that we cannot forget last winter, when the crisis in Scotland&#8217;s accident and emergency departments left hundreds waiting more than 12 hours for treatment. I presume that delivering person-centred healthcare was not at the forefront of the minds of the hard-working staff who had to catch up and deal with that situation last December and January.</p><p>Members will recall that, in response to that experience, various action plans were produced and additional front-line staff were promised in February. That crystallised into the promise in June of the immediate recruitment of 18 consultants. However, when I questioned the cabinet secretary last month on whether those consultants were in post, he was able to inform me of only three at that stage, who had been recruited by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p><p>Following press inquiries, the Government pressed the cabinet secretary to declare hastily that there were actually 13 consultants now in post. I am not sure why he had been unable to give me an accurate answer a few hours earlier, given that he had had eight days&#8217; advance warning. That is a little unclear, but I am glad that the possibility of negative headlines managed to concentrate the minds of those in Government. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will be able to clarify later whether we now have the promised 18 consultants.</p><p>Staffing is not the only critical component in delivering the infrastructure&#8212;resources are needed too. Throughout the country, however, there are regional discrepancies in treatment times for various conditions. One board may perform well in providing timely access to clinical psychologists but may be found wanting in scheduling appointments for cardiologists.</p><p>Nothing demonstrates that better than the variance in the boards&#8217; ability to meet the 62-day treatment time guarantees across all 10 cancer types. The 95 per cent national standard is achieved for only four out of 10 cancer types, but the differences in timely treatment between boards are alarming.</p><p>The most recent data highlights the fact that only 66 per cent of colorectal cancer patients are treated on time in Grampian, whereas the figure is 72.7 per cent in the Borders. In Tayside, only 71.4 per cent of melanoma patients are treated on time, with the figure reaching 75 per cent in Fife and Grampian. For cervical cancer, the figure is 75 per cent in Lanarkshire, 80 per cent in Fife and 83.3 per cent in Lothian. Only 60 per cent of patients with ovarian cancer in NHS Highland were treated on time.</p><p>The reality is that, as well-intentioned and desirable a model as person-centred healthcare is, the raw materials must be in place for an individual&#8217;s treatment pathways to be tailored to their requirements and values. What use is a person-centred model of healthcare if the resources are not in place to cater for it and the staff&#8212;either because of workforce issues or because they have too many demands on their time&#8212;are not in a position to deliver it?</p><p>I will go into deeper detail with regard to the mental health aspect of my amendment in my later speech today, and I hope that other members will pick up on its importance. Suffice it to say that mental health is the basis of good health in Scotland.

Neil Findlay was right to say that the motion has to do what it says on the tin.</p><p>We have heard stats from various sides about satisfaction levels, missed targets and postcode differences&#8212;different areas having different access, particularly to cancer services. Neil Findlay mentioned a gentleman who had to stay 12 hours, I think, on a trolley. Nanette Milne mentioned the cases of a 90-year-old man and of an elderly lady who was moved from ward to ward and was discharged when her home was not ready and she was unable to use a Zimmer. Although there are high levels of satisfaction, there is work to do. If one or two people are still not getting complete satisfaction, we must try to address that.</p><p>I was interested in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s remarks about examining access to GP appointments.

As Duncan McNeil said, it is important that we keep people involved in that process.</p><p>I would be interested to hear the minister&#8217;s views on some of the anomalies that we get with appointments. For instance, when someone who is ill rings up on a Thursday afternoon, it is possible that, because it is not an emergency, the practice will say, &#8220;We have no appointments we can give you tomorrow but, if you ring back at 8.30 in the morning, we will try and fit you in then.&#8221; To users, that is really quite bizarre.

The resulting socioeconomic and personal cost that is associated with mental health problems is estimated to be in the region of &#163;10.7 billion a year.

The earlier that we can detect any form of illness or health problem, the better the chances of a good outcome.</p><p>I stated earlier that person-centred healthcare is defined as being responsive to individual preferences and needs. More often than not, what those suffering from mental ill health desire and need is someone to talk to. That is why there are such incredible demands on the time of clinical and other applied psychologists throughout the country. With just 13 months until the HEAT target for accessing psychological therapies is to be met, just 81 per cent of patients are being seen by a psychologist within 18 weeks&#8212;that was more or less Bob Doris&#8217;s point. In itself, 18 weeks is quite a long time to wait for someone who is suffering the trauma of mental ill health and will likely have done so for some time before visiting a GP to seek a referral. Early access is therefore important.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are regional variations. Only around 60 per cent of patients in NHS Forth Valley and NHS Lothian are seen within 18 weeks. The figures in Shetland and the Highlands are also significantly under the national average. However, we have 13 months to go, so I hope that we will get there.</p><p>When we analyse the distribution of psychologists throughout health boards, the same picture emerges. There are 15.7 psychologists per 100,000 population in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, but just 8.6 in neighbouring NHS Highland. There are 15.2 per 100,000 in NHS Fife, but less than half that next door in NHS Forth Valley. I have mentioned that previously in the chamber.</p><p>I have heard anecdotal evidence of some GPs refusing to refer patients because of the length of waiting lists in certain areas. That is not acceptable. To be fair to the Scottish Government, there has been an increase in the number of psychologists in recent years&#8212;we almost certainly have the impending HEAT target to thank for that. However, it is clear that many people still struggle to access psychological therapies.</p><p>I return to my earlier point. Patients can enjoy the patient-centred healthcare experience only if the resources and staff are in place to deliver it. Good work has been done to improve Scots&#8217; mental wellbeing but there is still much to do, not least in widening access to talking therapies. If we are truly to offer person-centred healthcare, I would have to agree with the cabinet secretary that the NHS must genuinely become a seven-day service.</p><p>I welcomed the cabinet secretary&#8217;s recent announcement that more had to be done to move away from variations in care at the weekend, and I will take a keen interest in the efforts of the task force that he has established to oversee those changes. However, the implementation of such a cultural change will regularly require substantially more than the &#163;4 million investment that the cabinet secretary announced last month. His press release spoke of ensuring that pharmacists, physiotherapists and porters are on hand every day of the week. However, I gently remind him that consultants and registrars will also be vital cogs in a truly seven-day service. I am sure that he is pretty well aware of that.</p><p>The minister&#8212;the cabinet secretary I should say; I do not want to demote him&#8212;mentioned in his intervention during my earlier speech that there are more consultant positions now than there were previously. However, there is a large increase in the number of vacancies, so will the minister, in his summing up, inform me whether we are struggling to fill those vacancies?</p><p>The Lib Dems will support the Government&#8217;s motion and we see value in supporting the Labour amendment, too. I hope that the rest of the chamber supports my amendment&#8212;it is a constructive amendment that is aimed at emphasising the importance of person-centred care, a motivated and appreciated workforce and the work that still needs to be done on mental health and its stigma.

First, it is always a privilege for members to be able to lead their own debate in the chamber. Secondly, for some time I have been minded to utilise the next opportunity that arose to celebrate the outstanding contribution that the citizens advice service has made to British society and, more specifically, to highlight an innovative and successful project that is being run in my region.</p><p>It would be fair to say that, as parliamentarians, we all have a healthy regard for the work that citizens advice bureaux do around Scotland; I have often referred constituents to them due to the excellent expert advice that they can provide, free of charge, on issues ranging from legal matters to immigration.</p><p>Citizens advice bureaux have become woven into the fabric of British life, and their network of more than 3,500 advice-offering locations across the United Kingdom&#8212;250 of which are in Scotland&#8212;are pillars of the local communities that they serve.</p><p>Like many institutions that have gone on to have a profound impact on the UK, the CAB service was born out of wartime necessity. The day after war with Germany was declared, the first 200 bureaux were opened&#8212;run from private houses, public buildings and, in one instance, even a horse box. As is the case today, the service was dependent on the good will and assistance of volunteers. The casework of advisers back then was certainly different from today&#8217;s caseload, but it was no less important, of course. It ranged from issues with ration books and evacuation to locating missing relatives and prisoners of war.</p><p>It was during the war that the CAB service first gained its reputation for providing valuable support in advising people about their benefits entitlement and helping families to complete applications for all the wartime allowances that were available to them. Crucially, the CAB service&#8217;s experience of witnessing the distress that was caused by a delay in the processing of those applications led it to raise the issue with the relevant Government board of the day. It managed not only to speed up the process but to convince the board to open up more offices to process applications. Thus began the CAB service&#8217;s long and successful tradition of advocacy and of lobbying the Government&#8212;of whatever colour&#8212;and agencies to influence and change policy to the benefit of the people it serves.</p><p>Citizens advice bureaux have shown an ability to evolve throughout their 74-year history. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than at a project in my region that provides valuable advice on a range of issues to an often underrepresented section of society&#8212;young people. In May, I had the pleasure of visiting Duns to see at first hand the outstanding work that is being done by the Roxburgh and Berwickshire Citizens Advice Bureau. In 2009, the young citizens project was created, thanks to funding from the Scottish Borders Council fairer Scotland fund. The objectives of the project, which began in Berwickshire, were to provide regular confidential advice sessions for people aged 16 to 25; to attract, recruit and train young people to become volunteer advisers; and to liaise with local community groups.</p><p>I am pleased to say that the project has gone from strength to strength over the past four years. As a result of its success, it has expanded into Roxburgh, and it has undergone dramatic changes. Following consultation with a group of young people, the project has been rebranded as youthinfo@CAB. It delivers a youth-led service, with a steering group of young people from throughout Roxburgh and Berwickshire who direct the project&#8217;s aims and objectives.</p><p>The CAB now employs Sophie Charlotte Wild, who I believe is up in the public gallery. She is one of its former youth volunteers&#8212;she volunteered as a young persons adviser&#8212;and, along with Annette McGraith, the project leader, she works closely with local schools and colleges to raise awareness of what citizens advice bureaux deliver. Workshops have taken place at six high schools in the area. To date, more than 3,800 pupils have received advice, and 95 per cent of them said that they enjoyed the workshops.</p><p>That work has only been possible because of continuing funding from the Scottish Borders Council fairer Scotland fund and generous grants from the Bank of Scotland Foundation. More important, it is the tireless efforts of the CAB staff and the 31 young volunteers that continue to drive the project forward. I cannot mention them all, but volunteers such as Aaron Bolton and Aaron Millar, who run the bi-monthly Newsflash, which is distributed to high schools and colleges, have helped to secure nearly &#163;700 in funding from a project called youth chex, and others such as Oscar McAndrew, Kyle Wilson and Jess McLean, who, alongside Aaron Bolton, comprise the project&#8217;s steering group, have helped to secure &#163;4,500 in funding to produce a CAB awareness-raising video.</p><p>The success of the youthinfo@CAB project has understandably come to the attention of others. I understand that the Dalkeith CAB sought guidance from the project, following a successful application to the Big Lottery Fund to develop a similar service in its area. I also understand that the two other bureaux in the Borders&#8212;the Central Borders Citizens Advice Bureau and the Peebles and District Citizens Advice Bureau&#8212;are now interested in entering discussions to roll out the project Borders-wide, which would be a fantastic testament to the hard work of all those associated with Roxburgh and Berwickshire CAB.</p><p>I was delighted to welcome representatives of Roxburgh and Berwickshire CAB on a visit to the Parliament back in July, and I am pleased once again to welcome them to the Parliament this afternoon. I wish them well in continuing their good work, and I encourage people in other areas to consider rolling out similar essential youth projects.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698972", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Citizens Advice Youth Outreach"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have secured this members&#8217; business slot for two reasons.

Indeed, the perception is that cancer is reserved for those in later life. There is also an element of unintentional ignorance. A Teenage Cancer Trust survey revealed that more than half of 13 to 24-year-olds believe that we are all born with the cancer gene and that just over a fifth believe that the colour of one&#8217;s skin determines whether one gets cancer or not. The natural naivety of youth is to be expected, and teenagers can be forgiven for not immediately associating fatigue, swelling and pain with cancer. That is why the trust&#8217;s free education programme is so vital and must be commended.</p><p>That the trust&#8217;s advocates and educators reached more than 11,000 students in Scotland during the 2011-12 academic year is an achievement to be proud of but, given the personal testimonies of teenage cancer sufferers and the trust&#8217;s statistics, it seems that educating teenagers on cancer&#8217;s warning signs is only part of the battle.</p><p>Too many of our young people are having to make multiple presentations to healthcare professionals before a diagnosis is finally made. It should worry all of us that two thirds of the young cancer sufferers who were surveyed believe that their diagnoses could have been made quicker, and that 40 per cent of young Scots with cancer said that they had to visit their GP at least four times before they were referred to a specialist. That statistic is very troubling&#8212;particularly when one considers that the subsequent target for treating those youths would be to do so within 62 days. That is a considerable length of time for people who have had symptoms for a while.</p><p>Early diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients of all ages are vital, and although improvements have been made there are still areas of Scotland where not enough patients are being treated within 62 days of a referral for suspected cancer. For instance, the target is 95 per cent, but for NHS Grampian the figure is 88.9 per cent and for NHS Borders 91.8 per cent. The situation is worse for specific cancers, with the national average for cervical and urological cancer standing at 88.6 and 88.2 per cent. If those are the averages, some boards will&#8212;naturally&#8212;be performing worse than that, and perhaps significantly so.</p><p>Education programmes are important, but so is ensuring that the infrastructure and personnel are in place to deal with patients when they receive the dreadful news. I commend the people at the Teenage Cancer Trust, who do important work, and those in the NHS who continue to treat and look after cancer sufferers.

We have had some good speeches this afternoon, and I think there has been a constructive debate.</p><p>The way in which people were treated in the past and the way they are treated now are leagues apart. It would be churlish of any of us to suggest that there has been no improvement in the quality of life of those in our society with learning disabilities. There has been significant progress since &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; was published in 2000, and there have undoubtedly been a number of successes.</p><p>That document represented the first attempt in decades to take a strategic and overarching look at service provision for those with learning disabilities. In the past decade, many people with learning disabilities have been able to set up their own homes and live independently in the community. They have also been empowered and afforded a level of visibility that was hitherto unavailable to them. The closure of the remaining long-stay hospitals for people with mental disabilities in Scotland was another welcome step.</p><p>One of the big success stories that came out of the recommendations in &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; was the creation of the SCLD, which brought together partner organisations to co-ordinate the improved delivery of services for those with learning disabilities. A few weeks ago, the chief executive of SCLD, Chris Creegan, said:</p><p>&#8220;you can't change decades of institutionalisation and prejudice and relative invisibility in just a few years. There is still a lot of work to do.&#8221;</p><p>I am pleased to see that the minister acknowledges that in the motion.</p><p>As is often the case when we consider issues relating to the wellbeing of individuals, inequalities stand out as the biggest barrier to greater outcomes for those with learning disabilities. Along with Enable Scotland and the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, I welcome the Government&#8217;s focus on tackling inequalities. It is staggering to be reminded that those with learning disabilities will, on average, live 20 years less than the general population. Many will even live shorter lives than some smokers in the more deprived areas of the country. Only when we begin to tackle the root causes of that appalling anomaly can we be truly satisfied that the quality of life of those with learning disabilities is on a par with the rest of us. I am pleased that the new strategy aims to identify the reasons behind the gulf in respective life expectancies and to ensure that the relevant agencies and authorities know where their responsibilities lie. Perhaps the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill will keep that in focus.</p><p>Another component of inequalities that the Scottish Government must seek to address concerns the employment of people with learning disabilities. The eSAY statistics for 2012 highlight that three quarters of those known to have a learning difficulty are not currently in employment or training, with only one fifth of those who are employed working more than 16 hours a week.</p><p>With meaningful paid employment comes a sense of value and inclusion. More importantly, it strengthens the individual&#8217;s ability to live independently. That is why supported employment opportunities are so crucial to the wellbeing of those with learning disabilities. That is why the inclusion of recommendation 41, which seeks to develop</p><p>&#8220;a range of supported employment opportunities&#8221;</p><p>in the third sector, local authorities and national health service boards will be beneficial, as is suggesting that such bodies lead the way by employing more people with learning disabilities.</p><p>The Conservative amendment&#8212;which, along with the motion, we will support&#8212;makes the pertinent point about ensuring a smooth transition from child to adult services. The 39th recommendation in the strategy&#8212;do not worry; I am not going to go through them all&#8212;is incredibly important in that respect. However, it is also vital that the Scottish Government monitors the performance of councils, Skills Development Scotland and other agencies to evaluate their success in providing clearer and smoother post-16 transition pathways. When the minister sums up, I would be keen to hear how that will be monitored to ensure adherence by the relevant parties.</p><p>Just over 26,000 people are known&#8212;I stress known&#8212;to local authorities as having learning difficulties. That is a not insignificant number of people. The strategy is not perfect but has, in part, been shaped by stakeholders and it provides a blueprint from which further progress can be made.

There had clearly been issues in identifying those whose medical condition made them appropriate recipients of palliative care and in ensuring that those people did, indeed, receive it. The report acknowledges that by stating:</p><p>&#8220;To date, however, the provision of specialist services for palliative and end of life care in Scotland ... is known to be directed mainly to people with cancer, with a greater range of services available to cancer patients and their families.&#8221;</p><p>That was true in 2008 but, unfortunately, it is still true.</p><p>NHS Lothian, the University of Edinburgh and Marie Curie Cancer Care deserve great credit for the work that they did on the publication that we are debating tonight. Its findings are stark and in some cases shocking, and provide a clarion call for action. The fact that only one in five patients dying from non-cancer diseases receives palliative care shames us all, particularly when that was identified as a problem in the national strategy five years ago.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made progress. Palliative care guidelines have been developed and we are now the first country in Europe to have implemented a national electronic system for communicating anticipatory care planning for palliative care patients; in addition, the do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation policy has been developed. However, there is still much to do.</p><p>One of the more enlightening areas of the research was the views of the health professionals. It is clear that GPs across Scotland are having real difficulty in identifying which non-cancer patients are appropriate for palliative care. They are also having difficulty in discussing death and dying with non-cancer patients with life-threatening conditions.</p><p>This is an incredibly delicate and sensitive topic and no one envies the task that our GPs face, but it seems to me that this is something that could be tackled, perhaps with some targeted training in palliative care for GPs. A critical feature of the GP&#8217;s role is to speak to patients about their end-of-life care. If they are having difficulty in doing that, the Scottish Government has to investigate. Perhaps a working group of general practitioners could engage with those behind the good life, good death, good grief initiative to establish how we can better enable GPs to have these extremely difficult but necessary conversations and tackle the taboo, as it were.</p><p>Some 60 per cent of patients die in hospital, but the vast majority understandably wish to die at home or in a hospice, as Nanette Milne said. I therefore believe that we still have a long way to go.

Like others, I am proud to live in a diverse nation. As Scots, we should be proud of our unique Gypsy Traveller heritage.</p><p>I recently had a conversation about the issue with someone who told me:</p><p>&#8220;there&#8217;s a thriving gypsy population in my own local area which has been there for as long as I can remember and long before that. The gypsies here are an accepted part of the local community; they work and live here, and are a part of the fabric of the area.&#8221;</p><p>The Gypsy Traveller population has a long history in the south region and is even celebrated&#8212;the Yetholm common riding&#8217;s principals are not standard bearers, braw lads or lasses, gala queens or cornets but the bara gadgie and the bara manashee. Anybody who knows a little Romany will know that that means the good man and the good woman.</p><p>If people travel to Yetholm, they will also find the Gypsy palace. It is a wee single-storey house that dates back to the 1600s and in which King Charles II was crowned in 1898. He was not the King Charles whom we might usually think of but the last crowned king of the Gypsies&#8212;Charles Faa Blythe, the son of Queen Esther. More than 10,000 people descended on Yetholm for that coronation, just over a century ago. Gypsies, Romanies and Travellers are not a new phenomenon&#8212;they have been a part of our culture for many generations.</p><p>I echo much of what has been said about the day-to-day challenges that Gypsy Travellers encounter. It is particularly concerning that, as a group, they continue to face discrimination&#8212;whether that is from individuals or institutions&#8212;although they have been part of our culture for so long.</p><p>We in Scotland can be proud of being a tolerant nation that always leads the way in stamping out discrimination and protecting our minority communities, which is why the findings of the committee&#8217;s report make it a genuinely distressing read. The Scottish Human Rights Commission&#8217;s observation that discrimination against Gypsy Travellers is</p><p>&#8220;the last bastion of respectable racism&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee, 6 December 2012; c 777.]</p><p>is a shameful pill to swallow in a democratic society that should have no room for such prejudice to fester.</p><p>The report says:</p><p>&#8220;We were appalled at some of the standards we saw on sites, and disgusted that rent-paying tenants were faced with such bleak living conditions.&#8221;</p><p>We would not accept such living conditions for tenants in fixed housing, so why is it okay to ignore Gypsy Travellers&#8217; plight? That is unacceptable in a fair and tolerant society. If we are to improve the lives of our Gypsy Traveller population, it is clear that we must tackle two key aspects: we must change the attitudes that feed the discrimination; and we need a firm national approach to fixed and temporary homes, with proper access to other services.</p><p>The current arrangements clearly do not work, and we know from the evidence that that creates and feeds into the social discontent of settled communities, which often results in conflict and the sensationalist media attention that the report highlights. As the report says, it is entirely reasonable that Gypsy Travellers should enjoy the same housing rights and responsibilities and the same access to services as tenants in the fixed housing sector have. I look forward to hearing from the minister on that point.</p><p>There has perhaps been a political reluctance to deal with the issue head on in the past. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has underlined the need for political leadership and I share its view, as I think others do. Partnership working must take place across all agencies, including COSLA, from which I hope that the minister will encourage active engagement. We must not shy away from tackling the issue on the basis that being seen to stand up for Gypsy Travellers might be unpopular.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we know, the term &#8220;Gypsy Traveller&#8221; covers a broad range of groups that are descended from Scottish, Roma, Irish and other roots.

That group can take huge credit for this debate. The way in which we deal with chronic pain in Scotland is being given the much-needed spotlight that it deserves because of its campaigning.</p><p>We know that Healthcare Improvement Scotland defines chronic pain as</p><p>&#8220;continuous, long-term pain lasting more than 12 weeks&#8221;</p><p>and we know from evidence from SIGN that as much as 18 per cent of our population&#8212;and 8 per cent of children&#8212;suffer from chronic pain. I want to focus briefly on what chronic pain means to its sufferers and their families. Some members have managed to articulate that. I hope that Susan Archibald will not mind if I refer to her particular circumstances to illustrate the point.</p><p>Like many at the worst end of suffering, Susan Archibald was driven to attempt suicide as a result of having to deal with constant, non-stop pain. She started to swallow pills while her husband and children were asleep, and she was saved by her baby&#8217;s crying. That act of desperation at a very low point was possibly a sad reflection of the deficiencies of pain management services in the current provision. Although some improvements have been made, the pace of change has been slow, and gaps still remain. Thankfully, Susan has put her experiences of dealing with chronic pain to good use in her campaigning efforts, and I congratulate her and her colleagues on bringing their petition to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>We know, sadly, that there are tragically high rates of suicide and attempted suicide among those with chronic pain. That can be linked to depression. People with chronic pain might not be able to hold down a job and that, of course, has all sorts of consequences for home and family life.</p><p>Not many may know that today is world MS day. Bob Doris mentioned multiple sclerosis. A couple of weeks ago, I visited the MS Therapy Centre Lothian in Edinburgh, which also covers Fife and the Borders, and I spoke at length to the manager there, Nancy Campbell, her team and some of the centre users. We discussed issues such as the practical challenges that MS sufferers face. It was clear from those discussions that the physical effects of the condition are wide ranging and that they cannot really be pinned down to one, two or three main symptoms. Each sufferer is different so, in creating a model for chronic pain, we need a system that can work for individual patients.</p><p>The problem of treating chronic pain is not new, and evidence tells us that it is not treated in the same way throughout our country. Throughout the country, patients and health groups tell us there is too much regional variation, and we cannot be assured that the best treatment is being provided to patients equally. We often talk about postcode lotteries in the health sector; in this case, the failure to address chronic pain management effectively across the board seems to represent a health inequality with a huge human cost.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats welcome the plans for a Scottish service model for chronic pain that would mean NHS boards implementing a service delivery plan from next year. It is important to say that the forthcoming legislation to integrate social work and NHS services will be an opportunity to ensure that chronic pain management does not fall between the bailiwicks of those two services.</p><p>We support the aspiration for more management of chronic pain to be undertaken within the community. It is common sense that people should be treated and supported as close to home as possible, rather than have to travel to hospital or, in some cases, as far away as Bath in Somerset. That will of course require improved understanding among general practitioners, so we look forward to the publication of the SIGN guidelines next year.</p><p>It has been a day for welcoming, so we also welcome the commitment to consider options for a specialist residential facility in Scotland that we hope would ensure that patients who need that level of care would no longer have to travel to Bath for it. However, I believe that we need the consultation to run before we recommend what would be the best approach.</p><p>Alongside effective treatment, self-management techniques and support can be critical in helping people to take greater control over their condition and enjoy better lives. Better partnership working between the NHS, social care and the third sector is crucial in improving support for self-management. However, people should know where to get help, so we also welcome the community pharmacy campaign, which highlights where people can find reliable information on pain management.</p><p>Nobody doubts that there is still a long way to go in Scotland, particularly in children&#8217;s pain services, which will have to be a major part of the health service&#8217;s implementation of a Scottish model. Children are particularly vulnerable, with 8 per cent, as I said, estimated to be suffering from chronic pain, which can undoubtedly interfere with their quality of life and of course their education. We need to build on children&#8217;s pain services as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to hearing from the minister and cabinet secretary in due course on that specific point.</p><p>We welcome the plans for a Scottish service model for chronic pain, which is long overdue. Chronic pain is perhaps a misunderstood part of our health service and it has not been afforded the focus that it deserves. I hope that today&#8217;s debate is a marker for change.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the Lib Dem spokesman on health, I, too, pay tribute to Susan Archibald, Dorothy-Grace Elder, Jacquie Forde and, of course, their colleagues on the cross-party group on chronic pain.

I will not bore members too much with my Livingstone bloodline&#8212;of course, I am happy for others to do so. However, it is worth using this debate to consider what maketh the man. What drove Livingstone to go where no European had been, find the source of the Nile, spread Christianity and be a shining light in the fight to end slavery?</p><p>We often ask whether we are products of genetics or our environment. I think that Livingstone was heavily influenced by his family roots, by his environs and by external circumstances. In his autobiography, he talks of his fascination with his grandfather&#8217;s stories&#8212;that is my five-greats grandfather, I think. His grandfather was originally from the island of Ulva, where he tended a small farm, but he had a large family and needed to seek employment elsewhere&#8212;hence the move to Blantyre.</p><p>Livingstone&#8217;s grandfather was keen that David should not forget his islander values and would delight the boy with stories of old. David&#8217;s great-grandfather had fallen at Culloden, supporting the old line of kings, as he called it. His grandfather could tell stories that went back six generations, passing on the wisdom of his ancestors. Later, David recalled that stories that he heard in African communities were &#8220;wonderfully like&#8221; his grandfather&#8217;s stories, which shows that our world is small and our values similar.</p><p>According to David, one of his ancestors had said to his family:</p><p>&#8220;I have searched most carefully through all the traditions I could find of our family, and I never could discover that there was a dishonest man among our forefathers. If, therefore, any of you or any of your children should take to dishonest ways, it will not be because it runs in our blood ... Be honest.&#8221;</p><p>I think that that family value ran true in David&#8217;s blood and was the life force that gave him the strength to tackle what we know was wrong but was the norm at the time: slavery. The honesty gene also helped David&#8217;s father Neil when he worked in the mills. He was so highly esteemed and trusted that he was put in charge of conveying large sums of money from Glasgow to Blantyre. Honesty was recognised and led to trust, and at an old age Neil was pensioned by the mill, spending his last years in ease and comfort.</p><p>David was steeped in the Livingstone family values and, as well as being honest, he had a work ethic that would put us all to shame. He attributed his ability to completely abstract himself from surrounding noises and therefore study in any circumstances to his time working as a piecer in a noisy mill. No one would have criticised the young Livingstone for putting his feet up after a hard day at the mill, but he needed a challenge and a purpose. That led him to study Greek, medicine and divinity. He joined the London Missionary Society, which he described as &#8220;unsectarian&#8221;.</p><p>David did not originally intend to take his missionary work to dark Africa. His focus had been on China, but the opium wars put an end to anyone from Britain travelling there, as the empire closed. I wonder whether Livingstone would be celebrated today if he had gone to China. We do not know. It is doubtful, as Christianity has not taken off too well there so far.

It is estimated that Scotland&#8217;s 657,300 carers provide annual savings of &#163;10.3 billion. Of course, not all those carers provide support for dementia sufferers.</p><p>Dementia is a dreadful illness whose grip extends far beyond the sufferer who is afflicted by the disease. The illness tragically robs a family of the person whom they know and love long before death occurs. That makes the illness uniquely cruel; the loved one is still physically there but, mentally, they can no longer engage with people as they once could. I, too, know that&#8212;my father suffered from the illness and it was not until my mother passed away after a short battle with cancer that I realised that she had hidden his early dementia. That reflects what I think is meant by the stigma of dementia.</p><p>Dementia must always be viewed beyond the mental illness that attacks the sufferer&#8217;s memory, because it also affects the sufferer&#8217;s loved ones. In that environment, people&#8217;s hearts break while they watch their loved ones deteriorate. A person&#8217;s life is suspended while they act as their loved one&#8217;s carer. That is the life for tens of thousands of people in Scotland who find themselves in that position on a daily basis.</p><p>Until the tragic death of his mother last year, Tommy Whitelaw was one of those carers. I want to pay my own tribute to him tonight. Tommy is an inspiration. Frankly, I do not know where he found his energy and drive to do his campaigning while caring for his mother, but I am glad that he did. I had been aware of Tommy&#8217;s exploits from media coverage, but it was not until January this year that I had the pleasure of meeting him, thanks to my old colleague and friend Irene Oldfather. He told me of his work with Alzheimer Scotland touring the country and collecting letters from other carers, of the short film that he had made to raise awareness about dementia and of his role as a carer for Joan. I was so moved by Tommy&#8217;s experiences that I asked him to speak at my regional conference for Lib Dems last month. He is doing an incredible job raising the public&#8217;s awareness about dementia, and I was honoured that he could join me at that conference. I am also pleased that he has joined us in the public gallery this evening.</p><p>The dedicated strategy for carers that the Scottish Government published in 2010 was a good start, particularly as local authorities and the third sector had the opportunity to inform the strategy. The meetings of the carers Parliament have been outstanding forums for discussing and raising awareness of the great job that is being done by carers. However, we must not be complacent. We should strive to build on that good work to strengthen further the support network that is afforded to all carers</p><p>I am glad that the Presiding Officer accepted the motion to extend the debate. That is quite a rare occasion, but it emphasises the issue&#8217;s importance. Let me end not with my words but with Tommy&#8217;s, from an interview that he did with the Daily Record as he embarked on his tour two years ago. When asked to describe the life of a full-time carer, he said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard emotionally, mentally and financially and it can leave me feeling lonely.&#8221;</p><p>He speaks there not just for himself but for all who have cared for parents and loved ones.

I should note that James Kelly also lodged a motion on Dr Livingstone, which I supported before it was lodged.</p><p>Bob Doris and James Kelly have declared my interest for me. My granny was a very proud lady. One of her proudest facts was that her great-grandfather, which I think makes him my great-great-great-grandfather, was a cousin of David Livingstone. Therefore, although I am not quite a straight descendant of Dr Livingstone, I am descended from his grandfather, if I have my maths right.</p><p>My granny&#8217;s great-grandfather&#8217;s name was Alexander Livingstone. A contemporary of David&#8217;s, he, too, was from Blantyre and worked in the Blantyre mills, but as a weaver. Although members might think that David Livingstone&#8217;s life was cut short early because of foreign travels and his contracting malaria&#8212;he died at the age of 60&#8212;my ancestor, David&#8217;s cousin, died some time before he was 31. We do not know exactly when he died. His name appeared in the 1841 census but not in the 1851 census, so he might even have been as young as 22 when he died.</p><p>In those days, mills did not have the highest health and safety standards. It is interesting to think that although David took what appeared to be the more adventurous and dangerous route in life, he managed to live for twice as long as his cousin who stayed at home to continue the family weaving tradition. Members can draw from that what they like.</p><p>David Livingstone is rightly heralded as one of the greatest Scots who ever lived. It must surely be true to say that, despite being a man who is known for his various explorations, the greatest journey that he took in life was the one that took him from his tenement in Blantyre and the mills that all his family worked in to his interment in Westminster abbey alongside this island&#8217;s great and good.</p><p>His life is a true rags-to-riches tale and an inspiration not only to Scots but to people everywhere, including Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It takes a remarkable individual to slip free from the humble confines of early 19th century industrial Lanarkshire and achieve what he achieved.</p><p>In his honour, a mountain range in Canada has been adorned with his name, as has a city in Zambia, a town in Malawi, a college in the United States&#8212;the list goes on.</p><p>How did a man from such humble beginnings, who from the age of 10&#8212;as Alex Fergusson said&#8212;did 12-hour shifts as a piecer in a cotton mill go on to achieve the legacy that he did? One of his most memorable quotes perhaps gives us a measure of the man:</p><p>&#8220;I will go anywhere, provided it is forward&#8221;.</p><p>Forward he did go.</p><p>Livingstone may have been introduced to the African continent to spread the word of God, but he would eventually abandon his mission of faith and go forward on a mission of exploration. As a result, he created a legacy that has endured for two centuries. His expeditions were responsible for important geological discoveries, such as Victoria falls&#8212;I will not embarrass myself by trying to pronounce that waterfall&#8217;s indigenous name&#8212;and led to the mapping of previously uncharted areas of the continent.</p><p>It would be wrong to paint his life as a fairytale, though. He would later come to regret not spending more time with his children, his expeditions were not always fully successful and his wife, Mary Moffat, passed away with malaria on one such expedition.</p><p>It is right and proper that we commemorate his life on the eve of the bicentenary of his birth. That the President of Malawi is making a state visit to this Parliament next week is a wonderful honour and testament to the contribution that David Livingstone made to 19th century Europe&#8217;s understanding of central Africa&#8212;and the impact that he had on not only my granny and family, but all the countries that he visited.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Bob Doris on securing the debate.

I welcome the consultation results, and note that the Government intends to introduce a bill this year. I remind everyone that that was also in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. Indeed, we could argue that the bill should have been introduced long ago, when beds were reduced for more care at home, because it could have been argued that systems for caring at home were not fully in place for that step change.</p><p>Without doubt, the existing system contains overlaps in the responsibilities of health boards, local authorities and, of course, care services. It is also worth noting that the organisations have different ways of working, different cultures and, almost, different languages, so there may be barriers to integrating. However, we want outcomes, and I am sure that the forthcoming bill will have the potential to iron out any differences in organisations&#8217; different methods. I hope that it will address those differences, bridge the gaps and lead to even better provision for patients and service users who require the services, and to more individuals staying in their homes for treatment&#8212;when that is appropriate, of course.</p><p>Once the bill is introduced, if it does what it says on the tin it will get our support. That support will be conditional of course, and I shall keep a close eye on whether local decision making is protected. We would oppose any centralisation in the form of a national care service. To make integration work, we need local accountability. In fact, I would go further: it is essential that throughout the bill&#8217;s progress and in the changes that it will make for our constituents, patients are treated as equal and active partners in decision making and planning.</p><p>Integration of health and social care will not be easy; the representations that we have received echo that point. It is important to note that housing associations have an important role to play, given that 85 per cent of very sheltered and extra-care homes are run by housing associations, and that it is estimated that the demand for that service will increase. As I have said, keeping people in their homes when that is appropriate has great benefits, and the use of adaptations is essential for that to happen. Research shows that adaptations are good value for public money, too, with an estimated &#163;4 saved for every &#163;1 spent. They are an excellent example of preventative spend, on which we need to focus more.</p><p>The consultation reported on the role of a jointly accountable officer. Some people believe that that responsibility should lie jointly with local authority chief executives, health boards and health partnerships. The cabinet secretary referred to the matter, but it is worth noting again that there are often several local authorities within one health board area. I am glad that the cabinet secretary acknowledged that point; it will be interesting to see how he addresses it in the future. Governance in that regard can be cumbersome, so we will keep an eye on it.</p><p>The consultation highlighted general agreement that the jointly accountable officer must have gravitas and a wide skills base. The person who will have overall responsibility for delivery of integrating health and social care must have a good skills base, so we should look to deliver the changes with the help of people who have experience of joint working. I am thinking particularly of allied health professionals, who have a track record on medical versus social views on different ways of delivering joint services, are experts on rehabilitation and reablement, with knowledge from around 12 professions, and are already in post. As part of his deliberations, I would like the cabinet secretary&#8217;s view on representation from allied health professions as part of the development of national policy and regulation in the integration of health and social care services.</p><p>There is no doubt that there will be increased demand on our health and social care services, given that we have an ageing population and limited public resources. We shall all call on those services in the not-too-distant future unfortunately, and we all know of family and friends who have already done so. We must ensure that the services can meet needs in the 21st century.</p><p>There are good examples of partnership working across Scotland, mainly at organisation level. We now need to concentrate more on delivery of first-class services for our patients and users. We need a system in which people do not fall between different organisations&#8217; responsibilities&#8212;for example, clearing a bed in hospital only places the burden of responsibility for a person on a local authority or extra-care home. Addressing such issues must be part of the joined-up thinking of the future.</p><p>I welcome the results of the consultation. The Liberal Democrats will follow the bill&#8217;s progress and hope for better integration of services, with local accountability protected.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The need to integrate health and social care in Scotland has been on the agenda for some time.

One of them involves administrative malpractice on the part of some boards, while the other is about woefully inadequate winter contingency planning. However, the common denominator is that both have transpired under this Government&#8217;s stewardship of the national health service.</p><p>The BMA in Scotland produced a briefing ahead of this debate, with a line in it that reads:</p><p>&#8220;It is important to recognise however, that waiting times are not the only or the most important indicator of performance.&#8221;</p><p>I would have hoped that that truism was obvious to the Scottish Government, but recent revelations suggest that, somewhere along the way, it forgot that.</p><p>In its obsession for achieving targets, the Scottish Government lost sight of the most important thing, which is the patient.

We know that in Lothian and Tayside there was a culture of pressure and that there were instances of bullying, such was the fervour with which management sought to achieve the Government&#8217;s targets. We know that the use of social unavailability codes plummeted remarkably after Lothian was caught red-handed, and we know that, in those health board areas, the specialties that had the most critical capacity issues deployed such codes more frequently. None of that can be attributed to IT systems, and to suggest that it can be is to insult the intelligence of patients and staff.</p><p>One of the more frustrating and disappointing elements of the Government&#8217;s handling of the health service has been the spin&#8212;the smoke and mirrors that the Government deploys to deflect any negative attention.

For us on the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, it has been apparent how important the two sectors are for Scotland. Wild fishing in the likes of the Tweed, Dee and Tay bring in a huge amount of income and generate a huge amount of employment, not to mention that wild fishing is the most popular participant sport in the UK and thus a large attraction for the tourist industry. Throughout Scotland one will find many hotels full due to anglers, who are so important that when a family member of mine looked to have a wedding reception in Kelso, one particular hotel was unavailable as at that time of year the anglers came to fish on the famous junction pool on the Tweed.</p><p>Angling is an iconic sporting pastime in Scotland, which Stewart Stevenson mentioned, but aquaculture, too, has an important place in our economy. Although it is located more in the north and west, it nevertheless provides important employment opportunities in communities where there may be less on offer. The Government has recognised the further economic opportunity that aquaculture could provide for Scotland. The Scottish aquaculture industry has an admirable ambition to grow by 32 per cent by 2020, which is supported by the Scottish Government.</p><p>That ambition has to be achieved sustainably&#8212;I hate to use that word, which is often overused. All stakeholders agreed that we need a clean environment for not just the wild fish and invertebrates but the fish farms that are located in our wild places.</p><p>Many people raised the concern of sea lice and the potential of outbreaks from fish farms to wild fish, and, of course, from wild fish to fish farms, although it has to be argued that wild fish are by definition wild and therefore there could be little human intervention in them that would increase lice population.</p><p>There are concerns that if fish farms are mismanaged they could be a breeding ground for pests such as sea lice, although representation to the committee stated that the aquaculture industry has a good, clean image, and of course it is in its interest to treat and control any pests that may be present. I believe that that clean image is already being used as a powerful marketing tool by the industry. The recent horsemeat scandal has highlighted the importance of good local food, which farmed Scottish fish has the advantage of being, and the importance of keeping the clean, green image of our wild and farmed fish, not just for the public in Scotland, but for our export market and tourist industry.</p><p>Concerns were expressed on both sides, not just about pests such as sea lice but about escapes of farmed fish into the wild. During the committee&#8217;s debates on the bill, I highlighted the example of rainbow trout, a non-native species that is farmed in my region. The trout are treated at egg stage to become what are known as triploids; basically, they are made infertile to ensure that if any of them escape they have no chance of creating their own community, which would obviously displace our native fauna.</p><p>Triploids do not seem to be widely used in salmon fishing in Scotland, although good research has been carried out on that issue at Stirling. The industry has expressed concern that triploids do not grow as fast as normal fish, but they are still a non-chemical, non-genetic way of ensuring that any farmed fish that escape have no chance of breeding with our native stock. I would appreciate it if the minister, along with the industry and stakeholders, could examine that issue to find out whether there is still scope for using triploid salmon fish to negate results of unintentional escapes and I ask the minister to mention the issue when he sums up.</p><p>The bill addresses not only what needs to be done to best protect our environment while we grow the aquaculture industry, but the transparency of district salmon fishery boards. To be honest, I think that the Government has provided scant detail of what it wants to achieve with the boards and when and why it wants to take such measures. I questioned the minister on that very matter at committee; after all, this has been talked about since at least the 1960s with little real change being made. We should note that the good work of many advisory boards in the catchment areas of the Tweed, Nith and Dee has significantly improved riparian habitat and non-native species control and we are now reaping the benefits with increases not just in salmonid species but other aqua fauna. According to the Tweed Foundation&#8217;s figures, more than 13,000 salmon alone were rod-caught last year and in the first half of last year returns were 13 per cent above the five-year average.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats support the bill at stage 1. We recognise the importance of a sustainable wild and farmed fish industry for economic and environmental reasons and look forward to the bill&#8217;s further stages and any amendments that may improve it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "To say that the progress of the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill to date has been without controversy would be pushing the truth to some degree.

I, too, congratulate Joan McAlpine on bringing the subject to the chamber for debate.</p><p>As is the case with most members who represent the south, I suspect, my contact with constituents often leads to conversations about the relevance of the region&#8217;s news output on channel 3. It was such conversations that led me to make representations to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and to have meetings with both Ofcom and&#8212;with other members&#8212;ITV to press the case for greater Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway content for people in southern Scotland. As others have said, the secretary of state made clear in her letter to Ofcom that she also has concerns about the output that is received by those in southern Scotland, and I welcome her desire for Ofcom to address the matter.</p><p>I make clear my admiration for the staff at ITV Border, particularly those who are based at Holyrood and in the region&#8212;Kathryn Samson and Jenny Longden are just two of them&#8212;as they are hard working and they produce good-quality output. My issue is not the standard of ITV Border&#8217;s news output, but its relevance. From what others have said, I am not alone in that.</p><p>The research that Ofcom published last year revealed that those who had no issue with the content of news service output were those who had low interest in regional news or were infrequent viewers&#8212;essentially, it was those who had little need or desire to use the service in any case. Everyone else in the Stranraer, Galashiels and Dumfries focus groups had concerns about the urban bias towards the north-east of England that has become prevalent since the merger.</p><p>There is an appetite for change among most of my constituents and indeed most members who are in the chamber this evening. The question is what shape the change should take. Joan McAlpine appears to support STV assuming responsibility for the output that is currently provided by ITV Border. However, people in Stranraer and Eyemouth would argue, as would I, that Glasgow is as remote from them as Newcastle. The consensus is that, if people want national news, they will watch &#8220;Reporting Scotland&#8221; on the BBC, as Elaine Murray said. They see channel 3&#8217;s regional news as the place for more localised content.</p><p>The upcoming independence referendum necessitates relevant news output from broadcasters with public service obligations. At present, there is a problem with people being adequately informed about the goings-on here at Holyrood&#8212;a problem that is compounded for viewers in the region by the absence of &#8220;Scotland Tonight&#8221;. Although STV news would remedy that problem, I suspect that the north-east of England bias would simply be replaced by a central belt bias. The research project made it clear that, although that option might be slightly preferable to the status quo, the preferred option, as John Lamont mentioned, remains going back to the pre-2009 service, under which it was more commonplace to see news crews on the streets of Dumfries, Selkirk and Galashiels.</p><p>I welcome ITV&#8217;s confirmation that it is discussing the matter with Ofcom and looking at ways in which to retain a local news programme with more local content.

No matter whose statistics we use, the issue is of concern. The debate is timely, although it should be noted&#8212;as the minister did&#8212;that the strategy, while welcome, was published a number of months ago and it could be argued that we should have discussed the issue at an earlier stage.</p><p>I note the recent slight increase in the year up to September 2012 in the number of clinical psychologists employed by our health boards. I commend the Government for that. The Scottish Government rightly recognises that faster access to psychological therapies is a key component in our efforts to tackle mental health issues. It is also key in assisting the reduction in Scotland&#8217;s suicide rate. No matter whose figures are used, suicide is still a leading cause of death among those under the age of 35. I therefore welcome the decision to include access to psychological therapies as an 18-week referral-to-treatment HEAT target from December 2014.</p><p>Although the deadline for achieving that target is still nearly two years away, I was curious to see what the picture looks like. Indeed, so was SAMH, which has asked the Scottish Government to commit to an audit of the provision of, and waiting lists for, psychological therapies. I understand from the Scottish Parliament information centre that no stats exist on waiting times for access to psychological therapies, due to delays and changes in personnel at ISD Scotland. I therefore look forward to the minister confirming in his summing up whether he will consider having that audit and when ISD Scotland will be in a position to begin publishing the statistics.</p><p>The minister will be aware that, two years ago, the coalition Government announced its own strategy, backed by &#163;400 million of additional funding, to massively widen access to psychological therapies south of the border. The aim&#8212;which I trust is one that would be supported across the chamber&#8212;is to put mental health on a par with physical health with regard to perception and treatment, and to end the stigma that attaches to sufferers. Not only is that the right thing to do, but it will result in more than &#163;700 million of savings to the public purse. It is an example of preventative spending at its best, and I hope that the minister is keeping a keen eye on it.</p><p>When it comes to access to much-needed psychological therapy, I am afraid that there can be no doubt that something of a postcode lottery exists throughout Scotland. We are not talking about people waiting for a minor operation or a routine scan. People are often in desperate situations, experiencing real mental anguish, and they need to be treated as soon as possible.</p><p>Currently, the national average full-time equivalent figure for clinical and other applied psychologists is 11.3 per 100,000 people, with the rate increasing to 14.8 in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and 15.5 in NHS Fife, but it is 10.0 in NHS Grampian, 8.9 in NHS Highland and as low as 7.6 in NHS Forth Valley. People in the NHS Forth Valley area therefore have less than half the number of clinical and applied psychologists of their close neighbours in the NHS Fife area. That seems to signpost a postcode lottery situation, which I hope can be addressed.</p><p>I highlight in my amendment the rise in antidepressant prescribing in the NHS. There is no doubt that antidepressants are a worthwhile treatment method for some and should continue to be used, but I am concerned that we have gone from dispensing 1.26 million antidepressant prescriptions in 1994 to dispensing 5 million last year.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682576", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.

Of course, there are still challenges. Dennis Robertson rightly highlighted that one in four adults in Scotland will experience mental ill health at some point in their life, with the resulting social, economic and personal cost of mental health problems estimated to be in the region of &#163;10.7 billion annually. Mental ill health is now the dominant health problem of people of working age, and the cost to employers is now in excess of &#163;2 billion a year. Of course, the emotional cost to families is even greater. Perhaps all of us have been touched in some way by mental health issues in our families. That is why I welcome the publication of the strategy and its important commitments.</p><p>When Kevin Stewart referred to the many mental health champions in Scotland, he should perhaps also have mentioned Tommy Whitelaw. For many years he cared for his mother, who had dementia, and witnessed her writing her name and date of birth on her arm to hide the fact that she was suffering from the condition. He is now taking his tommyontour campaign around Scotland to spread his good word.</p><p>In my opening speech, I highlighted the issue of equal access to psychologists. Proportionally, the number of clinical and other applied psychologists available to treat a patient in Kincardine is twice that available to treat someone three miles away in Clackmannan. That kind of inequity is worrying and I would like the minister in his summing-up to make a commitment not only to meeting the HEAT target by December next year but to addressing that disparity.</p><p>As has been stated, there are no statistics on waiting times for access to psychology therapies because of delays and changes in personnel at Information Services Division Scotland. I accept that the infrastructure for collecting the relevant data needs to be in place, but also note that as waiting times for psychological therapies were approved as a HEAT target more than two years ago, we should by now have some idea of where we are. Again, I would appreciate it if the minister addressed that point either when he sums up or later.</p><p>In my opening speech, I highlighted the increase in the use of antidepressants. Although I acknowledge the minister&#8217;s comments and Dennis Robertson&#8217;s remarks and experience, I think that Mary Scanlon made clear the point that I was trying to make that GPs have no formal process to support any review of patients with common mental health problems. I firmly believe that the Scottish Government should work with health boards to roll out nationwide successful pilots such as that undertaken by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, in which patients on antidepressants for more than two years in 78 participating practice areas had their cases reviewed. As a result of the review, changes were made in the therapy of 28 per cent of patients, ranging from changes in dosage, the use of alternative drugs or treatment being stopped altogether. All of that led to a 9.5 per cent reduction in prescribed daily doses and, more important, better patient treatment.</p><p>One of my overriding concerns, which I know is shared by others, is that the use of antidepressants has increased because GPs lack alternatives. For example, exercise referral schemes are too inflexible or are not available during working hours and the perception is that waiting lists are too long and inaccessible. There also needs to be access to the kinds of alternative therapies that Linda Fabiani so eloquently described. I completely understand that antidepressants need to be used to treat conditions other than depression, but it is a sobering thought that one in 10 Scots are being medicated with them.</p><p>Many members have mentioned SAMH and its good work in highlighting physical activity to address stigma and improve mental health. Its see me campaign, which just about everyone has mentioned, has through its agreement with the Professional Footballers Association Scotland done great work in challenging the stigma associated with mental health in the likes of the football community. In 2011, the campaign produced five excellent short films to coincide with Scottish mental health week and I recommend that well produced video to members.</p><p>As I said, Linda Fabiani referred to creative alternative therapies. The minister knows that I have an interest in this issue through PND Borders and I appreciate and am grateful that he agreed to meet the group just a couple of months ago.</p><p>I am disappointed by the real-terms cut in the budget for physical activity. I believe that such activity is a good example of preventative spend that the Government could take up and I ask the minister to address that issue in his closing speech.</p><p>Many have mentioned suicide rates. Given the facts and figures that Roderick Campbell cited, I do not think that we should be complacent or get too excited by the claim in the strategy that the figures are going down.

Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity is what sells the country, and not only for the obvious industries, such as tourism and golf. It is the most important marketing tool for promoting our successful whisky industry and fine textiles, which rightly sell at a premium throughout the world.</p><p>It is therefore of concern that Scotland failed to meet the 2010 biodiversity targets. It is more concerning that Scotland is not alone in failing to meet those targets, but the Parliament is about holding the Scottish Government to account, so we are concerned about how seriously the Government takes the situation, especially as there have been year-on-year reductions in projects such as agri-environment schemes, which are a useful tool to aid biodiversity.</p><p>Although we have missed the 2010 target, new targets for 2020 are on the horizon. There is little doubt that a step change is needed for those to be achieved.</p><p>One of my concerns is that we have a minister who is responsible for the environment but&#8212;I mean no criticism of him&#8212;biodiversity and climate change should be the responsibility not of a single minister but of all Government departments and, for that matter, broader society.</p><p>Scottish Environment LINK noted in its briefing paper that we should reverse decline in the quality of heathland. I am sure that we all agree with that. However, there are threats on the horizon. Heathland and its wide biodiversity exist due to careful grazing of the land. We are a farmed nation and have been for centuries&#8212;I remind members of my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests&#8212;but there are recent cases in which a cessation of farming has led to a loss of biodiversity.</p><p>In a rush to aid biodiversity, and with the impending changes to, and greening of, the common agricultural policy, we must be careful to remember that heathland needs grazing to prevent vigorous plant life from overtaking some of our precious indigenous plants. Without grazing, Darwinism would come into play: the strong would survive and outgrow our precious smaller plants such as butterwort, grass of Parnassus and sundew.</p><p>In the committee, we discussed the fact that ash dieback, which Alex Fergusson has briefly mentioned today, is now a reality in Scotland. I mentioned that the full extent of the disease&#8217;s spread may be unknown until next June or July due to the lateness of ash coming into leaf. The lateness of leaf and the light shade provide an ideal situation for many of our woodland ground plants to flourish underneath the ash canopy, and it would be difficult to replicate that with another arboreal plant.</p><p>Ash is one of our most common trees. It is a vigorous grower in wet or dry soils. Because of its extensive and fast-growing roots, it is often used for flood prevention&#8212;it is used to naturally bind riverbanks, preventing erosion. That is important, given the ever-increasing flooding that we are experiencing, and the fact that we have just had the wettest year on record.</p><p>Ash is also a tree of historic and spiritual significance, as many in the chamber will know. It was held in respect by the Norse religion, which held it to be the tree of life, or Yggdrasil. The Norse believed that the first humans sprang from that tree. Now, of course, that tree of life faces death, as 90 per cent of ash trees in Denmark have died from dieback. It is a real threat.</p><p>Ash is not only of historic and spiritual significance, it is also one of the few hardwoods that are of any commercial use. It is used in the production of the classic British car, the Morgan; bows, hurleys and traditional shinty sticks; and even some Fender Stratocaster guitars, believe it or not. Further, as anyone who uses firewood knows, ash is the best wood for burning, whether freshly cut or stored for some time&#8212;in fact, there is an old saying that goes, &#8220;Green or old, ash should be bought and never sold.&#8221;</p><p>There is a looming threat to our biodiversity. Recently, there have been a plethora of outbreaks of tree diseases, such as sudden oak death and Dutch elm disease. Of course, the danger comes not only from tree diseases but from developments such as the arrival of the New Zealand flatworm. We therefore have to ask whether policy has in any way been responsible.

With the threat of closure that hangs over Shambellie house, party differences have been cast aside in favour of a united front by parliamentarians throughout South Scotland. Cross-party meetings with National Museums Scotland officials, including Mr Rintoul, and the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, and co-authored letters represent the depth of feeling that exists on the proposal to close Shambellie house.</p><p>The justification that I have routinely heard in favour of the proposal is that there are low visitor numbers to the museum, and that there is high operational spend per visitor and reduced public funding, but there is little mention of how important the siting of a national museum is to the small surrounding communities of Lochfoot, Glencaple and, of course, New Abbey, which has a population of fewer than 100 people. If the national museum of costume is removed from the area, a crucial element will be removed from those communities.</p><p>The sparsity of population spread in Dumfries and Galloway means that leisure and tourist pursuits in the region are largely interconnected. For example, a tourist&#8217;s visit to Shambellie house may coincide with a visit to the artist town of Kirkcudbright and the book town of Wigtown. I fear that the closure of Shambellie house may impact on other cultural pursuits in Dumfries and Galloway and on local businesses in New Abbey that rely on visitors to the village.</p><p>As the proposal comes just over a year after National Museums Scotland completed the &#163;47 million refurbishment of its flagship museum in Edinburgh, there is understandable concern among many of my constituents about a centralist agenda among officials at NMS. That is reinforced by figures that suggest that spending on Shambellie house represents just 0.68 per cent of National Museums Scotland&#8217;s annual budget, and that only an additional 44p per visitor is spent on Shambellie house visitors compared with the average for visitors to other facilities. That does little to dissuade people from thinking that Dumfries and Galloway is being neglected.</p><p>I have met NMS officials twice, and fully appreciate that, in an age of reduced public funding, various difficult decisions will need to be made, but the decision in question should not be one of them. Dangling the carrot of roving exhibitions throughout the region will not prove to be a sufficient replacement for a museum that has been anchored in the area for 30 years. That is an intriguing prospect, but that should not come at the expense of Shambellie house, and there is little detail to consider.</p><p>During my discussions, I have asked Dr Rintoul whether NMS has fully explored all the avenues. If visitor numbers are too low, how can we boost them? Is Shambellie house being marketed in the correct fashion? If costs per visitor are indeed too high, are there not ways to tackle that matter without the drastic choice of a full closure? All those questions need to be answered, and they are worthy of further exploration. That is all the more reason why I support Dumfries and Galloway Council&#8217;s calls for a 12-month stay of execution at least.</p><p>Dumfries and Galloway Chamber of Commerce and Gordon Mann in particular deserve great credit for sustaining the save our Shambellie campaign and keeping us parliamentarians regularly updated.</p><p>The debate has been excellent and passionate, and there have been notable contributions from all members who have spoken. I am sure that there will be more to come. The cabinet secretary can surely be left in no doubt about the value of the national museum of costume to Dumfries and Galloway and she must now, of course, work with NMS officials and everybody else to ensure that it is retained.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Museum of Costume"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Claudia Beamish on securing the debate.

I welcome the fact that the Government has, once again, brought forward a debate on the matter before winter truly begins to bite so that we might question the minister on the Government&#8217;s level of preparedness. During the severe winter of 2010-11 we were denied this opportunity until after our infrastructure and transport networks had ground to a halt. It is not good enough to simply be reactive in such matters and it is right that we have the chance to debate the matter today.</p><p>I support the principles and content of the minister&#8217;s motion, but I thought it necessary that the plight of rural Scotland should be addressed. During wintry weather conditions, the disruption of the transport network in the central belt will inevitably command most attention, but the problems that extreme weather causes in rural and isolated communities are no less severe, and they are more common, of course. The isolation of those communities can make the problems that are caused by wintry weather much more difficult to contend with. A closed road in the central belt can often be passed off as a minor inconvenience, but if the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83 is closed, that can add up to 50 miles to some journeys. If a bus service is disrupted in Edinburgh or Glasgow, another route or rail may be an option, but in a Highland or island community, it is likely that a single bus service will be the only means of passage into and out of the town for many people. That applies to those who are lucky enough to have public transport, of course. More often in the countryside, cars are the only mode of transport. People can therefore be isolated in their own rural homes when the weather gets tough.</p><p>A one-size-fits-all approach simply would not work, which is why innovative measures must be attempted to confront the challenges that rural Scotland faces in times of severe weather. Scottish Borders Council, which has already been mentioned, deserves praise for its initiative in producing its resilient communities plan, which seeks to ensure that volunteers in the Borders have the chance to work more closely with the council and emergency responders during periods of severe weather. In rural areas, there may be rare occasions when public services are temporarily unavailable, so developing a framework for the co-ordination of voluntary support on a community council basis is an intelligent response to the difficulties that many suffer in winter. The support in mind ranges from clearing pathways for the elderly and disabled to placing sandbags in areas that are at threat of flooding. I understand that, in the Borders alone, four community councils have signed up to the plan, and I hope that more will follow. Indeed, it sounds as if the idea is one whose time has come and that it should be explored by other local authorities.</p><p>In last year&#8217;s debate, I welcomed Perth and Kinross Council&#8217;s initiative of adopting a farmer assistance scheme and called on the minister to engage with NFU Scotland to roll out such a scheme nationally. Such a partnership between Transport Scotland and NFU Scotland&#8217;s membership would be an asset at times of extreme wintry weather for our more isolated communities. I congratulate the minister on taking my advice and reaching a tripartite agreement involving Transport Scotland, NFU Scotland and the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland. The code of practice that has been established to allow local authorities to draw on the support of farmers and rural businesses&#8212;not just farmers, of course&#8212;is to be welcomed, and I am optimistic that it will prove to be a success if it is called on this winter.</p><p>In the spirit of consensus that has been commonplace in Holyrood this week, the Scottish Liberal Democrats will support the motion and all the amendments.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-04518.2, to insert after &#8220;possibly be&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;; recognises that rural communities and businesses are most vulnerable to bouts of extreme weather and can experience disproportionate levels of disruption in comparison to other areas of Scotland in the winter months; welcomes the tripartite agreement between Transport Scotland, NFU Scotland and the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland in establishing a code of practice for local authorities to call on the support of the farming community in remote areas of the country&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The last days of October are fast becoming characterised not by gaining an extra hour, or by Hallowe&#8217;en, but by the annual winter resilience debate in the chamber.

In last year&#8217;s debate, I completed my speech by expressing my hope that those in the public, private and voluntary sectors who had worked so hard the previous winter would have an easier time of it. Thankfully, that turned out to be the case, as we experienced a far milder winter.</p><p>That does not mean that the Scottish Government&#8217;s preparations were a wasted exercise. Nor does it mean that the Government has a licence to be complacent this year. We are an island nation and therefore the weather is difficult to forecast. That was mentioned by Elaine Murray, Gil Paterson and James Dornan&#8212;who is unfortunately not here. Also, I was glad that Margaret McCulloch acknowledged the extra funds that the UK Government has put in for the essential Met Office forecasting.</p><p>I am encouraged by some of the Government&#8217;s measures for this winter, which suggest that it has learned some harsh lessons from the 2010-11 winter. The acquisition of icebreakers in Transport Scotland&#8217;s fleet is welcome, although perhaps that was not timely for one of the minister&#8217;s predecessors. It is clear that the review that provided a considered comparison of winter resilience strategies in other countries was a worthwhile exercise that probably should have been done some time ago. The news of a strengthening of the network of weather stations, which has been mentioned, the publication of daily gritting plans, and the commitment to stock more salt than ever before&#8212;or Eco-Thaw, which Mark McDonald mentioned&#8212;are similarly encouraging. Our hauliers and couriers were among those who were badly affected two years ago, so the proposals relating to heavy goods vehicles, which are often vulnerable in extreme weather and cause disruptions, are to be welcomed. After all, it is our HGVs and others that keep supplies going all year round and provide food and fuel to the vulnerable people whom Graeme Dey and Hanzala Malik mentioned.</p><p>Last summer, the Government, in conjunction with the Red Cross, published the emergency preparedness report, which revealed that 40 per cent of Scots felt prepared to deal with emergencies arising out of severe weather. I am pleased that the Government has again teamed up with the Red Cross this winter. Dick Lyle and Margaret McDougall acknowledged the Red Cross&#8217;s valuable work. The Government can do only so much and the public need to take some responsibility for being prepared, but I imagine that it must be a source of disappointment for the minister that, as he mentioned, after last year&#8217;s campaign the level of preparedness among Scots remains at just 40 per cent. Sixty per cent therefore feel unprepared. In his summing up, I would like the minister to tell us how he will seek to improve that preparedness with further measures.</p><p>Preparedness comes at a cost, of course&#8212;I think that Margo MacDonald and Brian Adam mentioned the budgets&#8212;as does, crucially, the aftermath of a severe winter. Members who have analysed the Government&#8217;s spending plans for the 2013-14 financial year may have noted the marginal but welcome real-terms increase in the routine and winter maintenance budget, which could be well utilised should the worst be thrown at us again. The minister may point to the significant increase in the motorways and trunk roads budget as a whole, but that would represent an unclear picture, as most of that money is, in fact, intended for specific road projects. Many of those projects have been promised for years, but there has been some slow progress&#8212;I refer to the Dunragit bypass in the south-west, for example. However, we are getting there now.</p><p>Closer scrutiny of the spending plans reveals that the road improvements budget will be subject to a 27.8 per cent real-terms cut. When spring arrives, especially if it is on the back of a tough winter, there may be cause to undertake necessary remedial work on roads across the country. That will be made more difficult with such a drastic reduction in funds. I hope that the minister agrees that we cannot expect local authorities&#8217; transport budgets to foot the bill following a harsh winter such as we have had before, when they are continuing to feel the squeeze. We must avoid the spectre of two years ago, when local authorities were forced to raid their limited reserves. I look forward to the minister addressing that particular point in summing up.</p><p>It is true that even the best-laid plans can prove to be insufficient against the full force of extreme weather, but it is the job of Government to ensure that those plans are as robust as possible, and our job as parliamentarians is to ensure that the Government is doing everything in its power.</p><p>I wish the minister well for the forthcoming winter and look forward to monitoring his and Transport Scotland&#8217;s progress.</p><p>I agree with Margaret McCulloch&#8217;s acknowledgement of the council workers, emergency services and deliverers of supplies who deliver our resilience plans.

I am sure that Graeme Dey agrees with that. The modelling is not only for rural communities to use to help them to plan for the future but for the Government to use in lobbying in all other places. I know that Brian Pack did some explorative work, but that was some three years ago, and the CAP debate has moved on quite a bit since then. I would appreciate the cabinet secretary giving his views on that in summing up. At committee, both Claudia Beamish and I suggested that to the cabinet secretary, and he stated that he would be happy to take the suggestion away, look at what is being done in Wales, and commission work if he thought that that was necessary. It would be useful for us to hear from the cabinet secretary what the timetable is for that.</p><p>In the previous CAP round in Scotland, which involved Ross Finnie, who is the most experienced agriculture minister ever in the UK, with his eight years at the helm, Scotland took a different line from London on transitional arrangements. DEFRA went for a long transition whereas Scotland went for a short one. That was when we moved from an acreage payment-based scheme to an area-based scheme. Scotland based its area-based scheme on historical production payments, whereas England did not. That is what the industry in Scotland wanted then, and the industry is looking for transition at the moment. I would appreciate it if the minister remarked on that later.</p><p>We face a potentially major shift for Scotland, and the industry is calling for a longer transition to allow businesses to adapt to area-based payments that have no link to history. I realise that that may take a certain time, but I urge the cabinet secretary to consider that industry request seriously. We know that it is allowed as there is a record of it happening in the past and we know that Commissioner Ciolos is open to it. As it is a devolved matter, I hope that the cabinet secretary can deliver on that. I hope that he will comment on that in summing up.</p><p>The cabinet secretary told the committee that the transition period would</p><p>&#8220;very much relate to how we can help new entrants.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 19 September 2012; c 1101.]</p><p>However, that need not be the case. The problem for new entrants to date has been the use of mandatory dates, but if we go for a national reserve, it will run for the full term of the next CAP, which will mean that we can help new entrants at any time and not be concerned about dates or lines in the sand. Again, there are precedents in the EU in that regard and I urge the cabinet secretary to look more deeply at the matter.</p><p>The debate has been constructive, but it must not stop here. We now need full engagement by the Government with all stakeholders. Commissioner Ciolos was receptive to our views when he visited Scotland last week. He is open to variations on CAP at the regional level. We have a new, receptive farming minister at Westminster, the Lib Dem David Heath, who is already on record as stating that it is important that UK farmers are not disadvantaged as CAP decisions are finalised.</p><p>I have several final questions for the cabinet secretary. When is his next meeting with DEFRA ministers? When is his next scheduled meeting with the EU? What criteria will he call on for Scotland&#8217;s share of CAP at those meetings? Will he call for an immediate change, as Brian Pack has suggested, or will he call for the transitional period that the industry wants? Will he call for a national reserve that runs for the term of the new CAP? Will he call for contingency plans for pillar 2 payments in light of a gap between the current CAP and the next one? Will he use his resources to implement a CAP model for Scotland?</p><p>The Liberal Democrats will support the motion and all the amendments.

Members will be well aware of Scotland&#8217;s ambitious climate change targets, which have committed the Government&#8212;indeed, all of us&#8212;to reducing carbon emissions by 42 per cent by 2020. Attempts to meet that commitment must be tackled on many fronts, and the green bus fund is yet another modest but necessary step towards doing so.</p><p>However, the debate takes place in the aftermath of the Government failing the first test that was laid down by the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, as there were more emissions in 2010 than there were in 2009. With around a fifth of our emissions coming from transport, the decarbonisation of our vehicles is clearly a step in the right direction.</p><p>We should, of course, welcome the launch of the third round of bus fund awards by the transport minister, which, I understand, will result in the number of hybrid buses servicing our communities standing at just over 100 when the process is complete. It is important that the minister does not get complacent and that he maintains the momentum, like his counterparts at the Department for Transport have done. Total investment at the Department for Transport now stands at more than &#163;75 million&#8212;largely thanks to the presence of the Liberal Democrat transport minister, Norman Baker.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Scottish Government has a less-than-stellar record when it comes to decarbonising vehicles. Members may recall the SNP&#8217;s 2007 pledge to decarbonise the entire public sector fleet by 2020. As we know as a result of a freedom of information request that I lodged, after three and a half years, the figures stood at just 3.25 per cent, which led to the SNP dropping that pledge.</p><p>I welcome the &#163;2.5 million that John Swinney has committed in order to maintain the programme into the next financial year, but I note that the funding is less than it was in the first and second award rounds. Despite that unfortunate downward trend, I hope that the minister will confirm that the Government is serious about financing the programme over the long term.</p><p>There are obvious long-term economic benefits from the proliferation of hybrid buses in terms of reduced emissions, but ADL in Falkirk has shown that we need not wait to see such benefits. It deserves praise for the expertise that it has built up and for the jobs that that expertise sustains.</p><p>The reduced emissions and greater fuel efficiency that are being displayed by the buses that have already been procured through the fund clearly show the benefits of investment in hybrid vehicles. I have to admit that, in June, I bought one myself&#8212;not a bus, of course; just a car&#8212;and am now benefiting financially as well as helping the environment. I started to sound a bit like Stewart Stevenson there. I apologise for that.</p><p>We can all agree that we want many more such buses on our roads, but that will be possible only if bus operators are in a financial position to invest. With funding covering only the price differential, an operator still needs tens of thousands of pounds to purchase just one bus. The signs are that the bus industry is struggling. Many businesses are, of course, but the 4.8 per cent real-terms cut to the BSOG budget that was announced last week does not help. That change will result in support for bus services falling to around &#163;51 million, at this year&#8217;s prices, in 2014-15. Members should note that the spending level that was agreed between the Government and industry for this year was initially supposed to be &#163;66.5 million.</p><p>Such actions have led to Transform Scotland labelling the Government's transport priorities as &#8220;perverse&#8221;. It stated:</p><p>&#8220;Public transport fares are also rising ahead of the price of using a car, and the government&#8217;s cuts to bus investment are likely to drive people away from public transport.&#8221;</p><p>Against such a backdrop, it is perhaps understandable that, for many operators, updating their fleet may not be a priority. Indeed, one operator told me that its annual grant had been cut by &#163;100,000, and two others told me that they feared for the future of their businesses due to reduced funding, with one of them even considering selling some of its existing fleet and using older vehicles from its garage to plug the gap.</p><p>Of course, that all has a knock-on effect. As Transform Scotland warns, the Government&#8217;s decision to cut support for the bus industry will only drive people away from public transport and into private vehicles. Naturally, that will not assist us to reduce emissions, and I am afraid that 100 hybrid buses will not offset that completely.</p><p>I hope that we can continue to see more hybrid buses rolling out of garages across Scotland, with many of them being procured independently of the green bus fund in the future. The Government cannot keep cutting support for valuable bus services in other ways and expect no consequences.</p><p>I welcome any investment in green technology.

As the convener of the Finance Committee pointed out, the financial memorandum even uses the word &#8220;hope&#8221;. How can a Government propose legislation that is based on the hope that it will help? That is not only unfair on businesses, but a waste of time if it is unsuccessful.</p><p>The Government says that its changes to empty commercial property relief will discourage property owners from leaving their businesses empty. Why on earth would owners leave properties empty when it is in their financial interests to let them out so that another business can pay the rates and necessary costs of maintenance, heating, lighting and often security, and so that those owners can make money from the rental income? The proposal is purely an attempt to raise money from the business sector, which can ill afford it at this time.

The proposal affects only Shetland, but there is an historical reason for that. Shetland&#8217;s housing debt arose from the need to build houses following the construction of the Sullom Voe oil terminal in the 1970s. At that time, the population of the islands increased by 40 per cent, which meant that, over about 20 years, that small council had to build 200 to 300 houses. That resulted in debts of about &#163;50&#160;million.</p><p>There is no way that such a small council could balance its housing revenue account without the serious and real, albeit perhaps unintended, knock-on effects of increased rents and cuts in maintenance. Shetland Islands Council is adamant that if the housing support grant has to go, transitional arrangements need to be in place, and the Parliament&#8217;s Local Government and Regeneration Committee has agreed.

The debate is timely as it takes place in advance of the adoption by the European council of a common position on fisheries reform, which it will look to do on Tuesday. Although that will be a general approach and not legally binding, it will still act as a message to the European Parliament and will give us a good idea of where we are headed prior to the conclusion of this complex co-decision process.</p><p>There is near-unanimous agreement in the industry and across Government that the common fisheries policy in its current guise is unfit for purpose. Indeed, even the European Commission&#8217;s 2009 green paper on reform proposals acknowledged the problems and called for a &#8220;whole-scale ... reform&#8221; of the policy. It is evident to us all that the Commission&#8217;s previous approach of top-down, centralised management of our continent&#8217;s fisheries has not been in the best interests of our industry or our communities.</p><p>In an ideal world, we would be viewing the reforms as an opportunity to mend the common fisheries policy. Time will tell whether that proves to be the case.</p><p>Time constraints prevent me from adequately covering all six points of the reforms, so I will focus on the more contentious ones, which involve transferable fishing concessions and regionalisation.</p><p>I share many members&#8217; reservations about the introduction of TFCs to the common fisheries policy framework. In one of the so-called non-papers, the Commission states that the reason for introducing TFCs is that the CFP has failed to resolve the problem of overcapacity. However, as Jamie McGrigor said, we in Scotland have taken great strides in reducing the size of our fleet over the past few years, which has cemented our reputation as an exemplar of responsible and sustainable fishing. Since 2001, the number of our active fishing vessels has reduced by 15 per cent, or some 398 vessels.</p><p>Although the intention is that transfers of TFCs will be between vessels of the same flag, we know that many in Europe would dearly love to see transfers between member states. What particularly concerns me&#8212;I know that the cabinet secretary shares my concern&#8212;is that that could trigger an excessive concentration of the ownership of fishing rights. To some extent, we are already seeing that. Ian Gatt of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen&#8217;s Association told the RACCE committee:</p><p>&#8220;The biggest demersal quota holder in England is probably a Dutch and Icelandic company, which bought up several companies&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 2 November 2011; c 308.]</p><p>None of us wants a situation in which the skippers of Scottish vessels are enticed by the perhaps deep pockets of their continental colleagues, because that would put relative stability under threat. Furthermore, we must consider the damaging impact that it would have on our processing sector. The spectre of Spanish vessels using Scottish quotas and landing in Europe is a troubling one for our processors and fishing communities and is something that they would struggle to fight.</p><p>Much of the debate surrounding the reforms has centred on the prospect of long-overdue regionalised decision making. It makes perfect sense for the nations that surround a particular sea basin to manage that area&#8217;s fisheries, instead of Europe having an ineffective one-size-fits-all approach. What works in the North Sea will not necessarily work in the Mediterranean. The Commission appears to agree with that in principle.</p><p>A system whereby the EU devises the overarching objectives, with the measures to achieve them set by member states&#8212;almost certainly with an enhanced role for fishermen, stakeholders and regional advisory councils&#8212;is an attractive one, and the Scottish Fishermen&#8217;s Federation is right to say that the argument for that approach must continue to be pressed in Brussels. I therefore welcome the comments of the UK fisheries minister, when he said to the committee last year:</p><p>&#8220;Regionalisation is an absolutely determined goal that we have set ourselves.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 9 November 2011; c 346.]</p><p>I know that the cabinet secretary will welcome that, too.</p><p>In such situations, it is important to gather allies, and I hope that April&#8217;s joint declaration, which featured seven countries, including the UK, France and Ireland, will help to impress on the Commission how important it is that the details of fisheries management are decided at an appropriate level.</p><p>We are at a critical juncture. The decisions that are taken in the next few weeks will shape our fishing industry in Scotland for the next decade and beyond. It is vital that sustainability is at the heart of those decisions in order to ensure the continued survival of our vessels and communities across Scotland&#8212;communities such as those in Argyll, the northern isles, Aberdeenshire, Eyemouth and the Western Isles, where the labour force that is employed in fishing is significantly above the national average and where fishing has been woven into the fabric of life for hundreds of years.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats will support the Government&#8217;s motion and both amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate.

As is often said, they are just not making land anymore. New entrants to farming would find it very difficult to find the capital to buy land, so the only real gateway into agriculture is via land that is let.</p><p>The bill goes a small but significant way towards addressing some anomalies, and I hope that, through the work of the tenant farming forum, we will go a long way towards addressing the question of the trust that needs to be injected back into the letting market. Indeed, as Rob Gibson said, from 2005 to 2011 there was a 10 per cent drop in the number of holdings. That was due perhaps to holdings getting bigger or perhaps to more landlords taking more land in hand to manage, and therein lies one problem&#8212;as we found out in committee, we are data deficient. It would be good if the minister addressed that point.</p><p>The trust that I am talking about is addressed in section 1. It extends the rights of succession, which will now cover surviving spouse, civil partner, child or grandchild. An issue that was much debated was who else rights of succession could be extended to&#8212;for example, could they be extended to the father or a cousin of a deceased tenant? The relevant provision had been agreed on by the tenant farming forum, with the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association, the NFUS and Scottish Land &amp; Estates agreeing that it was the way forward. Therefore, I think that it was wise, for the sake of maintaining trust and because of the willingness that existed to address other issues in Scottish land tenancies, to move ahead on the basis of the TFF&#8217;s agreed recommendation.</p><p>The committee agreed that the Government should look at further extending succession rights in the future. I agree that that should be done, but it is essential that we bring the whole industry&#8212;which includes landlords, tenants and potential future tenants&#8212;with us on the issue.</p><p>As an aside, I believe that some remarks that have been made on an absolute right to buy have not been helpful, and I would welcome an assurance from the cabinet secretary on the matter when he sums up.</p><p>The position of the committee on section 3, on VAT, was fully consensual.</p><p>In committee, I found it surprising that upward-only rent reviews and landlord-only rent reviews existed, but I was assured that they were not common. Nevertheless, I welcome the bill&#8217;s tidying up of the existing legislation.</p><p>Transitional provisions have been a matter of concern. Unfortunately, there will be winners and losers, as always happens when a change in the law is made, depending on which side of the set dates someone falls. There was a willingness to look at retrospective legislation, but it was clear from legal advice that that could create legal difficulties. The Government&#8217;s amendment to section 4 has gone a little way towards addressing that within the existing legal framework.</p><p>Although the bill is small, it is extremely important. It has been designed to tidy up existing legislation, and I hope that it goes a long way towards developing trust in the letting market in Scotland, which, as I mentioned, is much needed. There is still work to be done&#8212;I am committed to helping with that process&#8212;if we are to see a vibrant letting market that will benefit tenants and those who wish to enter the farming industry, which is the backbone of rural Scotland.</p><p>We support the bill and we support further work on tenancies.

In the case of feus, such disadvantages were considered sufficient grounds for conversion to ownership, and on that basis the long leases bill seeks to do the same with leases and sub-leases.</p><p>The bill closely follows the scheme for conversion of feus that is set out in the 2000 act. The scheme would be automatic, so tenants would not need to do anything, although they would have the right to opt out. On conversion, the tenant would become owner and the conditions contained in the lease would be extinguished, but with some exceptions. For example, conditions concerning maintenance and use of common facilities, or the provision of services, would survive, and there would be an option to the landlord to preserve certain conditions for the benefit of neighbouring land. Special provision is made for servitudes and sporting rights. The landlord would be entitled to compensation, calculated as a multiplier of the rent. In some cases, additional compensation may also be due. In most and possibly all cases, the amount of compensation would be small, but a tenant who was not willing to pay could opt out.</p><p>The committee considered all those issues and, generally speaking, there has been little discontent. The committee noted some unresolved issues that relate to common good land. I have some reservations about that aspect when considering long leases. We are talking about the philosophy and principles behind the protection of publicly owned land.</p><p>It has been well noted by many that the accurate recording of common good land is not a straightforward or inexpensive process for local authorities to undertake. Nor can it be done overnight. The number of long leases on common good land is said to be small, but nonetheless that number could be more than we think, given that records are not accurately kept. I do not believe that we can simply ignore what could potentially be damaging to the public interest in Scotland.</p><p>The issue of the Waverley market site in Edinburgh has featured heavily in this debate and throughout committee discussions. Under the bill, the tenants could become full owners of land worth perhaps &#163;50 million, which currently may be owned by Edinburgh&#8217;s common good fund, although there is dubiety over that. If that is correct&#8212;and it seems to be so&#8212;that would be a strange outcome.</p><p>One peculiarity of common good land is that it cannot be alienated and sold off. That may be the very reason why Waverley market and similar plots were let out on long leases in the first place&#8212;to enable the land to be used productively. However, it was never the intention that the ground should be sold off entirely, so it seems odd that tenants in that position, who have paid very little rent&#8212;perhaps to encourage development&#8212;could earn vast amounts of money from what is in fact public land.</p><p>It is crucial that the common good land issue is addressed and resolved and I look to the minister for assurances that it will be addressed as the bill progresses.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665573", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Long Leases (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we know, long leases are similar to feus; there is little difference in how they work.

That is a laudable objective, but plenty of rural operators stand to be just as inconvenienced as their urban counterparts. I recently spoke with the owner of a rural bus operator that is based in Lanarkshire, who told me that their company would lose out significantly and that the changes were disastrous. The changes were compounded by the lack of consultation and the incredibly short lead-up time, which gave operators little wriggle room to adapt to the new environment.</p><p>It is widely understood that operators in urban areas are the big losers.

What it does not mention is that the remaining 25 per cent of operators carry in excess of 80 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s bus passengers, all of whom will be affected.</p><p>The reality for passengers is that some of the operators that run their services have just experienced a cut of 40 per cent in their grant.

Therefore, the technical issues behind providing radio within a community are well known to me. I know well not only the technical issues but the benefits of community radio. Amateur radio is referred to as the global village, as friendships are made all over the short waves. I have been to a wedding in Italy and hosted friends from Japan, Colorado and Sweden, all of whom I have met through the radio waves.</p><p>Like amateur radio, community radio must be licensed&#8212;and for good reasons. With amateur radio, there are restrictions on power outputs, the frequencies that one can use and the purposes for which one can use the radio: no playing of music, no political purposes and, like community radio, no commercial purposes. Hence the name amateur radio. The last restriction causes an issue for community radio stations. They cannot advertise to gain financial support for expensive equipment and nor can the disc jockeys and presenters take a wage to cover their time. They have to fundraise to cover all the costs that are associated with setting up a radio station: computers, mixers, radios, recording equipment and licence fees, to name but a few.</p><p>Generate Radio in Duns went to great lengths to raise &#163;1,500 when Kyle Wilson and Oscar McAndrew of the station both jumped out of an aeroplane at 10,000ft earlier this month. I would not recommend that too many members do that&#8212;well, maybe some members. At Ieast Kyle and Oscar were both kitted out with parachutes and landed safely.</p><p>TD1 Radio in Galashiels, which Christine Grahame mentioned, is one of the many fledgling community radio stations that have faced such problems well. It has gained lottery funding and funding from local donors. I have worked with the station for many years. At the moment, it is available only online, but it has lodged a request for an aerial site and a frequency that it can use with an Ofcom licence. I hope that Ofcom makes a speedy positive response to allow Galashiels to have its much-awaited community radio on the airwaves. The station also hopes to share a mast on Meigle Hill, and I hope that it is successful in that pursuit.</p><p>It may surprise some members to learn that the first community radio licence was launched only in November 2005. There has been some confusion about that. That was when Ofcom gave the first licence, but community radio has been on the go for many years, but not always licensed. I will leave it at that. There are now about 200 licensed stations throughout the UK, which highlights just how successful the format has become, and the numbers are on the increase.</p><p>East Coast FM is seen all over East Lothian at community events, as is East Lothian FM. Alive Radio from Dumfries, which Elaine Murray mentioned, covers all the local issues, including difficult ones. If members are in that area tomorrow, they can tune in to 107.3MHz at 9 am to hear from the Doonhamers&#8217; director.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665517", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Radio"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christine Grahame on securing the debate and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this discussion on the undoubted benefits of the significant expansion of community radio in Scotland.

The CTA in Scotland, which is represented in the public gallery, has about 160 members. Many of the groups in our communities are such small operations that they do not become members. In all, there are some 250 such organisations across Scotland.</p><p>Yesterday, the CTA in Scotland was at Parliament to launch &#8220;The CTA State of the Sector Report for Scotland 2012&#8221;. It is the first such survey of Scotland&#8217;s community transport network and it was compiled by surveying Scotland&#8217;s 80 largest community transport organisations. The report shows that there is a vibrant and expanding network in this country, which is sustained by at least 2,500 volunteers who contribute more than 278,500 hours of their time, which at the current rate of the minimum wage, would amount to a value of approximately &#163;1.7&#160;million annually. Of course, that is a significant underestimate because of the inability of the CTA in Scotland to reach many of the smaller operations.</p><p>What, exactly, are those groups doing in our communities? They are providing 3.5&#160;million passenger journeys every year, 80 per cent of which are for elderly or disabled people, with a fleet of more than 900 vehicles. Those journeys are provided for people who for financial, physical or logistical reasons do not have access to cars, taxis or buses. They include the child who cannot access a bus service to get to school, the elderly person who has difficulty completing their shopping, the sick person who needs to attend a healthcare appointment and so on. Often, the most disadvantaged members of our society are not best served by our transport network.</p><p>There are a number of outstanding providers in South Scotland, such as the Teviot wheels project, which operates out of Hawick; the Annandale Transport Initiative, of which Elaine Murray will be aware; the Gala wheels initiative; and the award-winning Berwickshire wheels project, which has 28 volunteer drivers who cover some 47,000 miles per year.</p><p>I recently spent some time with Tweed wheels in Peebles, which has been transporting people around Tweeddale since 1997. In the past 12 months it has transported more than 3,000 passengers around the Borders, thanks to its dedicated and hard-working team of volunteers. In recognition of that service, it deservedly received the Queen&#8217;s award for voluntary service last year. Teviot wheels is operated in conjunction with Tweed wheels by the organisation The Bridge. Both services are shortly due to celebrate their first anniversary after a highly successful first year. Here&#8217;s to many more for them.</p><p>What more can be done to sustain Scotland&#8217;s network of community transport organisations? Members will note that my motion quoted a Government statement on one of the objectives of the concessionary bus travel scheme&#8212;namely, that the scheme will</p><p>&#8220;allow older and disabled people ... improved access to services, facilities and social networks by &#8216;free&#8217; scheduled bus services&#8221;.</p><p>We should be proud of the way in which the concessionary fares scheme has allowed our elderly and disabled citizens to live more independent lives. However, for a variety of reasons, many people who have a pass are currently underserved by commercial bus operators. It is those people who are most reliant on the types of services that are offered by groups such as Tweed wheels. That is why community transport providers are calling for the extension of the concessionary fares scheme to cover their operations, which are entirely in keeping with the objectives of the scheme.</p><p>Currently, around 90 per cent of the sector operates under section 19 permits, which allow groups to carry socially excluded people but not the general public, thereby making them ineligible for that particular source of funding. An elderly person in a rural area may need to pay a subsidised rate of 50p per mile to travel in a community transport vehicle to do their shopping, whereas their elderly sibling in an urban area can simply hop on a local bus and use their pass.</p><p>The sector claims &#163;660,000 annually from the bus service operators grant. Such funding is always welcome, but there is to be a significant squeeze on the budget in the next financial year. Community transport providers are understandably nervous at a time when demand for their services is increasing year on year.</p><p>Our population is ageing, and it is the older demographic group that makes the most use of such services. Organisations such as Age Scotland&#8212;which is also represented in the gallery this evening&#8212;and the CTA in Scotland are calling for the concessionary fares scheme to be extended to include section 19 permits. One official from Tweed wheels told me that the extension of the concessionary fares scheme would enable the group to offset its dwindling funds from other sources and continue to provide a subsidised service to the most vulnerable members of its community.</p><p>The challenges for the concessionary fares scheme and bus operators were highlighted in the media just yesterday, and we know that budgets are tight. The Government&#8217;s 2009 review of free bus travel did not consider community transport in any great depth, but it produced an estimate of the cost of extending the schemes, which amounted to roughly 3 per cent only of the next financial year&#8217;s concessionary fares budget. That is a bargain when one considers the improvement to wellbeing that service users derive through such effective preventative spend.</p><p>The challenges that are being placed on the concessionary fares budget and bus operators have been highlighted recently in the media. Although the Government is intent only on reviewing operator reimbursement, it is clear that a more thorough review of the entire scheme must take place. I hope that, when that review is eventually undertaken, consideration will be given to the extension of the scheme to cover section 19 permits. I look forward to hearing the minister&#8217;s views on the matter when he sums up the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The purpose of the debate is to highlight the outstanding and vital contributions that are made by often unnoticed community organisations and unsung volunteers across Scotland.

It is important that trust between tenants and landlords be restored in order to ensure that more land is let to farmers. It is worrying that the Government publication that the minister mentioned revealed that there are 10 per cent fewer holdings in Scotland now than there were six years ago. Indeed, the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report on the bill stated that the Government still has much work to do to attract new entrants.</p><p>The policy memorandum for the bill states that it is intended</p><p>&#8220;to create a better environment for the letting of farmland&#8221;.</p><p>I will speak briefly about the first two of the three provisions, because the third provision, which concerns VAT, is mainly consensual.</p><p>The first provision concerns extension of the definition of &#8220;near relative&#8221; from a spouse, civil partner or child to include grandchildren. Although the tenant farming forum has endorsed that provision, it is clear from the evidence that the committee received that there are diverging opinions. The Scottish Tenant Farmers Association and NFU Scotland would like the definition to be extended to include, perhaps, nieces and nephews, whereas Scottish Land &amp; Estates draws a line in the sand after the inclusion of grandchildren. I acknowledge the committee&#8217;s recommendation that the Government re-examine extending the definition, but I recognise the compromise provision that is outlined in the bill and the importance of injecting trust back into land letting. As the committee has said, any movement on that could risk destabilising the consensus.</p><p>There is also a divergence of opinion on when the changes to the definition of &#8220;near relative&#8221; should come into force. As it stands, the new succession provisions will not come into force until two months after royal assent, but most TFF members believe that the changes should apply if a tenant has died before the act comes into force but the acquirer of the lease is still to give notice. I do not believe that to permit that would be an example of retrospective legislation, and I support the committee&#8217;s call for the Government to reconsider the issue at stage 2. I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary could shed some more light on that today.</p><p>The second provision concerns the prevention of upward-only and landlord-only initiated rent reviews. I was surprised to learn that a number of upward-only rental agreements are in place, but that fact is not sufficient to prevent Parliament from legislating against such agreements being used in the future. Holdings agreements need to be market led, and there should be scope for tenants to request a rent review and to negotiate the price down if there are legitimate business reasons for doing so.</p><p>The available data on the amount of land that is rented was highlighted during the committee&#8217;s scrutiny of the bill. In committee, I highlighted the agricultural censuses that come out in June and December, which could be used to gather that information. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s admission that there is a problem with the data, and I look forward to the Government addressing it in the future.</p><p>Like the Government and the TFF, I am keen for the measures in the bill to become law as soon as possible. I was disappointed when they were not introduced in last year&#8217;s order, but the bill has been shaped by the sector and I acknowledge the good work of the TFF that has brought us to this point.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats will vote for the bill to progress to stage 2. As for the Salvesen v Riddell case, which the cabinet secretary mentioned, obviously it is sub judice, but a judgment is about to be made on it.

There are too many such issues for me to mention them all in my four minutes, but two major items on which we have focused are reform of the common agricultural policy and reform of the common fisheries policy. We have taken evidence on both matters from UK and Scottish ministers, MEPs and the industries.</p><p>On the CFP, it is clear that the industry has concerns about management of the policy and its effect on the fishing industry. The European and External Relations Committee agreed, and has emphasised in its report, that reform of the CFP will have failed if regionalisation of decision making does not replace top-down management. To put it simply, local areas know how best to manage their fish stocks sustainably, which is important for the future of the fishing industry and the environment. As part of that, we recommended the reform of regional advisory councils that could feed into a new legal body, which would ensure sustainable management of the seas. Councils should comprise a sensible balance of stakeholders and should include the fish-processing industry.</p><p>On transferable fishing concessions, the committee heard sufficient evidence that trading of fish quotas could result in the bigger operators becoming even bigger and more centralised, which could present a threat to our fishing communities. I think the Government shares that view. The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has concluded its work on the CFP, but we will keep CFP reform on our radar.</p><p>As has been mentioned, another major EU reform is reform of the common agricultural policy, which is a major part of the EU budget and has a major input into rural Scotland. Agriculture is important to the Scottish economy. Last year, income from it rose by 13 per cent across Scotland but&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;costs rose, too. It is obvious that CAP reform will affect rural Scotland, and not just agriculture, to a great extent.</p><p>Just last week, the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee took evidence on CAP reform from the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment. In early March, it took evidence from the UK minister, Jim Paice. We have not completed our report, but we hope to agree it by 18 April.</p><p>Concerns that are relevant to the Scottish situation have been highlighted to us. Process is key&#8212;how the various Governments work together to form a consensus is obviously difficult, but it was interesting that Jim Paice highlighted the work that goes on officially and unofficially in devolved Administrations to</p><p>&#8220;find common ground to ensure that everyone is happy.&#8221;</p><p>It is worth noting that Mr Paice said, too, that</p><p>&#8220;I believe that we will start the new CAP on 1 January 2015.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 7 March 2012; c 705-6.]</p><p>As members might know, that would be a year late and, although rolling over pillar 1 payments should not be a problem, pillar 2 payments would be jeopardised. It is therefore essential that our Government has contingency plans.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has a close eye on many EU matters that are arising.

It is evident that that desire exists across the political spectrum. The motion refers to the &#8220;hard-working volunteers&#8221; who have campaigned on the issue for decades. Members have paid tribute to them, and I pay tribute to them, too&#8212;particularly those who are associated with RAGES. I congratulate them on their good work; it is good to see them all here this evening.</p><p>The study said:</p><p>&#8220;There is therefore no doubt that there is a local desire for improved services and this has been fully expressed throughout the study.&#8221;</p><p>Figures from the Office of Rail Regulation show a 49 per cent increase in rail travel in East Lothian between 2005 and 2010. I would like to provide members with similar stats for the Borders railway, but we are still not quite there. We look forward to the Borders railway being delivered soon.</p><p>I note that, although part of Berwickshire is in the Borders, it could take about an hour and a half to drive from Reston to Galashiels&#8212;of course, that depends on how someone drives.</p><p>I have been present at meetings that RAGES has arranged, when much has been made of the compelling socioeconomic benefits of constructing the new stations. However, we should not overlook the potential environmental benefits. The General Register Office for Scotland has projected that, as Iain Gray said, the populations of East Lothian and the Borders will grow by 33 and 16 per cent respectively. It is clear that the people there will need to travel&#8212;often up to Edinburgh&#8212;for jobs.</p><p>We should ensure that people who settle in the Reston and East Linton areas have a choice other than their car for their journey to work, to reduce carbon emissions. The 2001 census revealed that, of the significant number of adults from East Linton who were employed in Edinburgh, 87 per cent drove the 24 miles to Edinburgh. We need to encourage such people on to the rail network.</p><p>Much of the study is good work, but I and many campaigners dispute some of the points that it makes. For example, it estimated that just 8,700 people would form the drive-in catchment for a new Reston station, whereas the south east of Scotland transport partnership and others around the RAGES table estimate that the figure would be at least 14,000.</p><p>Such estimates in the study do not take into account the untapped potential for tourism from opening up this corner of Scotland to the rail network. Who would not want to follow the many visitors&#8212;some 70,000 annually&#8212;to St Abbs cliffs, or those who enjoy the James Hutton trail or diving off the coast at Eyemouth, which is a popular activity? We should not forget the efforts of the Eyemouth Harbour Trust to diversify activities&#8212;it even has proposals to receive cruise liners. I imagine that a nearby station would make such an initiative much more attractive.</p><p>There are few barriers to proceeding with the projects, which have overwhelming support from local stakeholders, elected officials and&#8212;crucially&#8212;the public, East Lothian Council and Scottish Borders Council. Both stations are supported in the local plans for both authority areas, and appropriate provisions have been made.

The debate has been quite consensual. There can be little doubt that we are dealing with a highly important subject. Tackling reoffending is about offering second chances and it is clear that members on all sides think that we are not offering enough of those second chances to the people who need them.</p><p>A quick glance at the statistics on reoffending that Alison McInnes highlighted is enough to make the eyes water. The simple fact is that most people who are convicted in a Scottish court have offended before and 62 per cent of Scottish prisoners will reoffend within two years of their release from prison. That is a deeply unhelpful statistic when we consider that Scotland&#8217;s prison population has increased by more than 25 per cent in the past decade.</p><p>Even more concerning is the fact that more than two thirds of the 9,372 people who received a prison sentence in 2009-10 already had five or more previous convictions. There is clearly a problem there and the Government is simply not getting a grip on it. &#8220;An overview of Scotland&#8217;s criminal justice system&#8221;, a report published last year by Audit Scotland, stated:</p><p>&#8220;Reoffending is a continuing problem in Scotland. There has been little progress towards the Scottish Government&#8217;s national indicator to reduce reconviction rates, which have fallen by less than one per cent in the last three years.&#8221;</p><p>The cabinet secretary and Mary Fee concentrated on talking about families. Each statistic represents not just a reoffender, but a personal tragedy for friends, family and other concerned individuals. The reoffender might have been brought up in a turbulent environment, might not have been able to enjoy the same educational opportunities as the rest of us, or might have had problematic drug addictions, which Lewis Macdonald addressed.</p><p>There are societal consequences from failing to tackle reoffending effectively. Just ask the 825,000 victims of criminal activity in Scotland in 2009-10, many of whom were victims at the hands of reoffenders. Many members, including Christine Grahame, mentioned the cost to society. Although there are no estimates of the cost to the Scottish criminal justice system, the Audit Scotland report highlights UK Government research, which estimates that every prisoner who reoffends costs the taxpayer around &#163;80,000. Interestingly, research commissioned by the Wise Group, a social enterprise that helps unemployed people to move into employment, established that, by factoring in the costs of welfare payments, unemployment benefits and the cost to the criminal justice system, moving one unemployed reoffender into employment could deliver savings to Scotland of &#163;940,000 over a five-year period.</p><p>Graeme Pearson mentioned how a reduction in reoffending would deliver significant savings to the criminal justice system. It would result in fewer cases heading into the in-trays of fiscals throughout the country, fewer court cases and fewer recipients of legal aid. A reduction in the case load for fiscals should be a pressing concern for the cabinet secretary in light of the Procurators Fiscal Society&#8217;s written submission to the Justice Committee. It revealed that fiscals had 14,000 unmarked cases in October, which was an increase of 7,000 cases in just six months. There would also be a reduction in the costs to the courts and the police of supporting the courts system.</p><p>The Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Act 2005 established Scotland&#8217;s eight community justice authorities while we were in government. The intention behind the CJAs was to enable a more co-ordinated approach to the delivery of offender services and to target those services towards the reduction of reoffending.</p><p>We established both a framework to tackle reoffending and some outstanding projects, such as the Women in Focus service in the south-west of Scotland, which I will touch on later. Sadly, however, no progress has been made and the Government failed to achieve its own national indicator on reducing reconviction rates.</p><p>I have spoken of the reasons why we require a new approach to prison rehabilitation in order to reduce reoffending rates in Scotland, and Audit Scotland has stated that there needs to be significant improvement in how services for offenders are delivered throughout the country. As with everything in life, there is no silver bullet, as David McLetchie, Dennis Robertson and others have mentioned, but social impact bonds present an attractive option for policy makers, and the evidence from the pilot in Peterborough seems encouraging, as Roderick Campbell mentioned.</p><p>Despite not operating on the basis of a social impact bond, the Women in Focus service, which is being delivered across the south-west of Scotland by Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, is a useful illustration of how such a model could work here. The service works with women offenders who are serving community-based orders in Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway to reduce their levels of reoffending and reconviction, reduce the number of community-based orders and help the women to make positive contributions to their local communities.</p><p>The service was commissioned following a highly successful pilot in Ayrshire, the outcomes from which showed that the number of successfully completed community orders among women engaging with the service more than doubled, with significantly lower reoffending levels. Early indicators show that the service is achieving similar results to those the pilot achieved.</p><p>Driving down levels of reoffending in Scotland is in all our best interests. As a party, we wish to engage with the Government on the issue, which is why we suggested this debate. To be successful at reducing reoffending, we need to know what does and does not work and what is and is not cost-effective. Audit Scotland states:</p><p>&#8220;Performance information on both the level of reoffending and the effectiveness of services to reduce offending is limited and inconsistent.&#8221;</p><p>We need to remedy that and I would be keen to discuss with the cabinet secretary how the Government will assess the effectiveness of the preventative spend measures that he plans to explore, as detailed in his amendment.</p><p>As my colleague Alison McInnes mentioned, it is a matter of regret that the Government does not fully support our motion. We appreciate that this has been a consensual debate and will take the cabinet secretary&#8217;s words in good faith. However, we are disappointed: the amendment welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government will &#8220;explore the potential&#8221; of social impact bonds, but we would rather see a pilot set up.</p><p>Thank you for this opportunity, Presiding Officer, and I look forward to the rest of the chamber supporting our motion at the end of the day.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663220", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offenders (Rehabilitation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to sum up what has been an important debate that was led very ably by Alison McInnes on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.

The reality is that countries in the developing world are being disproportionately affected by climate change, largely because they are ill-equipped to deal with its consequences. The sad irony is that the worst affected have done the least to cause the problem.</p><p>Article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights states:</p><p>&#8220;Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care ... and the right of security in the event of ... circumstances beyond his control.&#8221;</p><p>Sadly, there are far too many people in the developing world to whom article 25 is merely a fictional piece of writing&#8212;people such as the millions in east Africa who are experiencing starvation due to drought, and the millions in south Asia displaced by devastating floods. It is those people who ensure that climate change and human rights will for ever be inextricably linked. Indeed, Oxfam has spoken of the fights against poverty and climate change as &#8220;interrelated efforts&#8221;. I welcome the fact that our Parliament and Parliaments throughout the world are beginning to view climate change as akin to an issue of justice.</p><p>Rarely do I find myself agreeing with the First Minister, but I agreed with him when he spoke in China of developed countries having an &#8220;ethical obligation&#8221; to share the benefits of on-going economic development&#8212;economic development that led to such carbon-dependent wealth creation. He was also correct to speak of the importance of delivering climate justice and of linking economic development to human rights.</p><p>Some time ago, we proposed the development of an overseas climate change team to assist developing countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change, deal with climate-related disasters and adopt low-carbon technologies. The focus should be on climate adaptation to assist those in developing countries who are in desperate need of the intervention that their own Governments&#8212;for whatever reason&#8212;are unable to provide.</p><p>We should all therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s announcement in December of the establishment of a Scottish international climate adaptation fund, or climate justice fund, as it is now known.

We shall also support Claudia Beamish&#8217;s amendment, which addresses the involvement of the wider Scottish community.</p><p>Scotland need not be independent to be the &#8220;good world citizen&#8221; that the First Minister recently talked about. It is important that we do our bit to tackle climate justice. We must be an exemplar of good practice in our domestic attempts to tackle climate change to act as a model for the rest of the world.</p><p>The environmental lobby has lined up to praise our ambitious Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The Scottish Liberal Democrats were proud to engage constructively with the Government on that legislation. However, environmentalists are all united in agreement that the act will mean little unless we deliver on the targets to which we committed ourselves.</p><p>As we all know, the 2009 act has committed us to reducing carbon emissions by 42 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. However, our built environment is something of a barrier to our attempts to drive down emissions. Currently, homes contribute around 27 per cent of our total carbon emissions. WWF Scotland estimates that 85 per cent of today&#8217;s homes will still be in use by 2050, and it is clear that our emissions levels will not be significantly altered without targeted intervention in the condition of many of Scotland&#8217;s existing homes.</p><p>The Government has various schemes to tackle that issue: the energy assistance package, the universal home insulation scheme and the new &#163;50 million warm homes fund. Such measures are welcome, but the Government estimates that the cost of achieving the carbon reduction targets will be &#163;16 billion between now and 2020, so there is a lot to do.</p><p>That is why the Government should reconsider the independent budget review&#8217;s recommendation to restructure Scottish Water, which would unlock substantial funds by generating a one-off capital receipt. We would use that capital by investing &#163;250 million of it into massively accelerating the insulation of homes in Scotland, including homes in the private rented sector and hard-to-treat properties.</p><p>I am happy to have spoken in the debate and support the amendments and the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to speak on climate justice for the first time for the Liberal Democrats in this or any Parliament.

Co-operatives also give workers the chance to share in the success of their business. What a great incentive and what better way to address fairness in the workplace?</p><p>The motion mentions that 473 groups of businesses in Scotland have a turnover of &#163;3.4 billion&#8212;nearly a staggering &#163;7.2 million for each group of businesses. Imagine the buying power of a company with a turnover of more than &#163;7 million compared with the buying power of each of the many small businesses within the group, which may have a turnover of only &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000. It is all about economies of scale and, of course, working for mutual benefit.</p><p>Traditionally, people who were in business saw neighbouring businesses as competition. I do not believe that that is the case. We live in a global marketplace in which barriers to trade are disappearing. For example, purchasers of holidays who do not want to build all the blocks of a good holiday themselves&#8212;such as where to eat, where to rent a car, what to see and where to stay&#8212;now benefit from going online and clicking one button to get the whole experience. VisitScotland has done good work with its online system for members. That involves microbusinesses working under one umbrella.</p><p>The motion mentions agriculture, and I declare an interest in that. The agriculture industry has a plethora of microbusinesses that are often at the mercy of big companies that dictate the price of supplies. In recent years, advances have been made, often supported by organisations such as the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which Jamie McGrigor mentioned. Those have advanced the buying power of businesses or expanded the opportunities to reach out to markets, which is difficult for a one or two-person business to do.</p><p>There are many good examples of that but, to be parochial, in the South Scotland region, there is the Borders Machinery Ring, which enables its members to improve their buying power through the economies of scale of co-operative buying. That is along the same lines as the approach of the Fenwick Weavers Society just over 250 years ago. I was glad to have been at the celebration of that anniversary last year and to sign the new Fenwick charter, which I think was thanks to Willie Coffey.</p><p>We also have the Scottish Borders Food Network, which markets food from producers and outlets across the Scottish Borders to make it easier for the buyer to buy the whole package. Hotels are co-operating with farmers and farmers markets to deliver quality produce in a single marketplace. One of the network&#8217;s great successes is the Borders banquet, which provides two weeks of culinary delights throughout the Borders, giving people a chance to taste food such as Peelham&#8217;s salami, which is one of the few salamis that have been exported successfully to Italy&#8212;talk about selling sand to the Arabs&#8212;Giles Henry&#8217;s free-range eggs; Standhill and Stichill cheeses; and, of course, Traquair ales. Those are all microbusinesses that benefit from co-operation in the true meaning of the co-operative movement.</p><p>The UN General Assembly has announced that 2012 is the year of co-operatives. I am proud that Scotland has always led the movement. We have come a long way from the Fenwick weavers and New Lanark to where we are today, but we still have a long way to go. In that, our focus should be on banking. In the past, many mutual building societies have gone private, and we now have loan companies that offer pay day loans for a staggering annual percentage rate of 4,214 per cent. I believe that, as Helen Eadie said, credit unions need to play a larger part in our society in future. Therefore, let us celebrate 2012 as the year of co-operatives and use it as a starting point to promote more co-operation in our society.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661322", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Helen Eadie on bringing the subject to the Parliament, not just because I am one of the co-conveners of the cross-party group on co-operatives&#8212;it is good to see all the others here this evening, including the Presiding Officer&#8212;but because I have long thought that more can be done to build on the work of good organisations such as Co-operative Development Scotland in...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Hume", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80531", "house": "4", "member_id": "80531", "person_id": "14011", "party": "Liberal Democrat", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22661322", "hpos": "429", "gid": "2012-02-09.41.19", "epobject_id": "22661341", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2012-02-09.41.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14011+section%3Asp#g41.19", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80531"}, {"body": "<p>Mr Mason mentions the Scotland Bill and increasing borrowing powers.

The availability of broadband is important in helping to anchor businesses in rural areas&#8212;businesses which would, without access to this basic tool of commerce, be forced to leave such areas and take their jobs with them.</p><p>The benefits are also tangible. In evidence to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, Fiona Ballantyne of the Communications Consumer Panel spoke of estimates from 2008 that suggest that people who are online can save &#163;560 a year. With high-speed broadband, people can work from home to create a better work-life balance, undertake education or receive more convenient and personalised care using telehealth measures.</p><p>It is in rural areas where the plan should have the greatest impact. Alex Neil has already mentioned Kirkliston in the constituency of Mike Crockart MP, who is fighting for better coverage in that area. I also know of the good work that has been done by the south of Scotland alliance. Its hard work has led to the development of an ambitious plan to ensure that the south of Scotland&#8212;Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders, in this case&#8212;is not left behind. I welcome the Government's awarding of &#163;5 million to the plan, which will get it started. Of course, the plan will require significantly more finance to achieve its aims, and I look forward to the Government's continued support. We will be happy to work with the Government in that regard. A plan of that scope must include significant involvement by the private sector. The Government recognises that and goes to great pains to say so throughout the infrastructure action plan, stating:</p><p>&#8220;We expect the industry to work in partnership with us to deliver the plan and we will put in place mechanisms to secure greater investment from the private sector&#8221;</p><p>which will ensure that</p><p>&#8220;all of Scotland is able to benefit.&#8221;</p><p>It is obvious that, if broadband&#8217;s reach can extend further across Scotland, it will open up attractive commercial opportunities for internet service providers in the UK. Therefore, it is only proper that some of the capital for the plan be found in the private sector. However, as other members have mentioned, there is much talk of expectations in the document, but little about commitments. The question is this: Do we have a plan whose success will be reliant on a private sector that is not yet on board? I would be interested to hear from Alex Neil about discussions that he has had with the private sector about the support that it is committed to offering in order to make the plan a success.</p><p>The report is also light on information regarding just how many jobs the plan will sustain and create. In our manifesto, we detailed our digital economy action plan and made a commitment to use &#163;250 million from our investing in Scotland's future fund to accelerate the roll-out of superfast broadband across Scotland. We believe that our plan could have created as many as 20,000 jobs through installation of infrastructure and use of improved connectivity to build businesses. I can find no estimates of jobs that would be created in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s plan, so I would be interested if he would refer to that in summing up.</p><p>I welcome the recognition that improving mobile phone coverage is important, and the commitment to work together with the UK Government and Ofcom to that end. However, that should not happen at the expense of measures that the Scottish Government can take. I would like the cabinet secretary to explore the possibility of widening the scope of operator partnerships in order to spread the cost of building and maintaining new masts in rural locations, where building masts might not be commercially viable. That would go a long way towards improving 2G and 3G coverage in those often-neglected areas, such as the Ettrick valley down in Selkirkshire. I have heard anecdotally from Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue Team that mobile phone reception is better in the hills of Iceland than it is in some parts of the south of Scotland.</p><p>The situation contributes to the youth drain from our rural areas and damages small businesses.

After all, saying that there are no plans to close stations is not the same as saying that there will be no closures.</p><p>Glasgow is a thriving, busy city.

Remote communities from Lerwick down to Whithorn are reliant on the CAP funds that come into communities and which indirectly support local businesses, shops and schools, as other members have said. Our environment is managed by farming communities&#8212;there would not be heather-clad hills or rolling green pastures without a vibrant agriculture industry. The CAP is also the first step in food and drink production, which is a vital industry. The base product in whisky&#8212;our largest export&#8212;is farm-grown Scottish malt barley.</p><p>Of course, agriculture also produces more basic products for vital foods such as bread and milk. We simply cannot survive without it. Worldwide demand increases as the population rises&#8212;it is now more than 7&#160;billion. The combination of that with climate change&#8212;which is changing parts of the world from fertile areas to arid regions that are unfit for production&#8212;heightens the importance of getting the reform of the CAP correct.</p><p>All alterations to the CAP ultimately result in redistribution. The EU must bear that in mind in its deliberations and it must ensure that there is a transition period to give businesses time to change. As part of that, if we do not have an agreed CAP for the end of the current arrangement in 2014&#8212;which is possible&#8212;a bridging mechanism must be in place to ensure a smooth transition to cover any gap in the CAP. Transition measures could be used until 2019, which is five years after the proposed introduction of the new CAP in 2014, but if, as is possible, the introduction of the new CAP is late by a year or two, enough flexibility should be installed so that the 2019 date can be set back to allow at least five years of transition.</p><p>Scotland could benefit from redistribution within the EU of pillar 2 environmental payments; we are at the bottom of the payment per hectare league on those. There is, I hope, potential for good news. However, the proposals have various anomalies that must be addressed. New claimants in 2014 will need to have made a claim in 2011. How can we encourage new entrants in or after 2014? This morning, the committee heard that the situation is holding up the letting of land until we find out what is what. New entrants could be kept out of CAP for good if that issue is not addressed. There is a need for a national reserve not just at the beginning of the new CAP, but throughout it.</p><p>Others have mentioned permanent pasture, which it is proposed will be classified as grass under five years old. When I was a student, any grass under five years of age was classified as temporary grass. Permanent grass&#8212;or ley, in Scotland&#8212;was traditionally grass that was 28 years old. It was often direct-drilled grass, which saves digging up stones and the land is therefore permanently in grass. Moreover, the longer grass is undisturbed, the more biodiverse the pasture becomes. Given the proposed greening of CAP and the knowledge that increasing ploughing intervals will only increase our carbon emissions, it must be recognised that a five-year permanent pasture proposal is unsuitable, at least for the Scottish situation. I hope that subsidiarity will be the key to be used in that regard.</p><p>As I mentioned, the proposal is for a greening of the CAP so that 30 per cent of direct payments will be to benefit the environment, and that payments should not go to so-called slipper farmers. It is absolutely correct that someone who is not farming should not benefit. However, the EU must recognise more of Scotland&#8217;s anomalies. For example, there is a call for three-crop rotation, but in most of Scotland it is impossible to grow three different crops on the same land, and the crop rotations that do occur are rightly influenced by what it is possible to grow on the land and what there is a market or a need for.</p><p>Another greening issue is the 7 per cent of farmed land that is to be put aside for environmental benefit. I question the benefit of that proposal, given that people in certain parts of the world are starving. However, if it goes ahead, it must not be 7 per cent of every parcel of land, as some suggest, but be either on a whole-farm or community basis, and it should also take into account whether the farmer has been in a scheme like the rural stewardship scheme in the past.</p><p>There has also been mention of areas of national constraint and the ability to fund such areas. Orkney could benefit, but at the moment there is concern that such areas would be unfundable through the less favoured area schemes. I would like clarification on that matter from the minister, if possible.</p><p>My final point is about the fact that the Scottish Government holds back payments of the single farm payment if there is a live cross-compliance check on a farm. We see at the moment many farms waiting for their SFP that have perhaps altered their maps as per instruction from the Scottish Government and are honestly complying but who are suffering because of that. The Government states that it is an EU rule. If that is the case, the new CAP should allow provision for payment of, say, 90 per cent of CAP payments while waiting for conclusion of the cross-compliance check. I hope that the minister can concur with my view on that at some stage.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy (Reform)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre for their hard work on the subject and on the many other subjects that the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee tackles.

No woman should ever endure the physical and psychological trauma that comes from violence in the home or anywhere else. It is vital that we keep this issue in the national consciousness, so I welcome the regularity with which we debate the issue.</p><p>We should be proud of the progress that has been made in Scotland. The Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 and the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011 are welcome steps towards the goal of improved protection of women. In the case of the latter act, Rhoda Grant and others should be praised for their work in bringing the original bill to Parliament.</p><p>There is still much work to be done, however. Last year, there were 51,926 cases of domestic abuse recorded by the police in Scotland. Although the number is down on the previous year&#8217;s figure, it is still far too high. Figures that have been revealed by Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid provide sobering reading. In one 24-hour period this year, 54 women, with their 51 children, requested refuge accommodation. Unfortunately, only 17 of those women and 24 of the children could be accommodated. Although the long-term aim is to eradicate the scourge of violence against women, I would like the Government to strive, in the short term, for a target of ensuring that no woman or child who seeks refuge is turned away. That will be a challenge, particularly with a real-terms cut of 7.5 per cent to the equalities budget over the spending review period. However, I understand that there is, as yet, no level 4 information available for the equalities budget, so I would be grateful if the minister could, in his summing up, assure us that the Government will continue to support initiatives that are doing a great deal of important work across the country.</p><p>It has been widely acknowledged that our relationship with alcohol needs to change, and alcohol is clearly a factor in many abuse cases. In September, Strathclyde Police highlighted that the number of reported domestic abuse incidents in their area doubled in the aftermath of an old firm match. With such matches taking place in the early afternoon, alcohol consumption begins much earlier than usual, which explains that troubling statistic. Minimum pricing will have a role to play, which is why the Liberal Democrats are now committed to supporting the measure, but so will education, culture and many other matters, which is the point that Jackie Baillie made.</p><p>A large part of our making progress involves changing of attitudes. Of course, that refers chiefly to men, who should be in no doubt that striking a woman can never be justified and will never be tolerated, but it also refers to women. Too often, a woman who has suffered abuse will feel obliged to pass off any such incident as being out of character or a result of the drink.</p><p>However, women should never feel the need to explain away the actions of their abusers. Unfortunately, I have witnessed exactly that kind of behaviour first hand. When travelling home with my family one evening, I witnessed a well-dressed young woman being literally kicked into the gutter by her suitor. We turned the car around to help her. When we were driving her home, she immediately stated, &#8220;He&#8217;s not normally like that. It&#8217;s only when he has a drink.&#8221; Obviously, she said that because she was embarrassed. There can never be an excuse. We should ensure that everyone is in no doubt about that.</p><p>I commend members who have taken part in the debate, which has featured some excellent contributions, and welcome the spirit in which it has taken place. I also welcome Marco Biagi&#8217;s remarks on why men should take part in the debate. At one stage, I noticed that there were 26 MSPs in the chamber, 13 of whom were male and 13 of whom were female.

Both developments were rejected by the public and the local planning authority, only for the Government to run roughshod over local democracy and approve them. As John Lamont knows, that has not been forgotten in Berwickshire.</p><p>I have heard from one couple who run a holiday cottage in the Creetown area that, should the two wind farms that are in development near their home be built, their customers will no longer use their cottage. I understand that more than 800 turbines are at various stages in Dumfries and Galloway Council&#8217;s planning system, which provides an effective illustration of the overconcentration referred to in the motion&#8212;Mr Gibson should not wait too long for the issue to recede, because it is already here.</p><p>The status quo must change. Developments are too often led by private companies that act in the interests of stakeholders and pay scant regard to the appropriate siting of proposed wind farms.</p><p>There are ambitious targets to be met and it is right that wind farms should, along with other forms of energy generation, play some part in meeting them. However, it is time that the Government gave serious consideration to the cumulative effect on communities of nearby wind farm developments. Issues such as shadow flicker, ice throw, noise and landscape impairment are problems for many Scots.</p><p>During my time as a member of the Scottish Parliament in both this session and the previous one, I have on several occasions called on the relevant minister of the day to formulate a national strategy to oversee such developments to help restore public confidence in the planning system. I do so yet again.</p><p>There is no statutory minimum distance between turbines and properties; there is merely guidance in Scottish planning policy. There is also no statutory requirement for a pre-application consultation or a pre-determination hearing for developments under an installed capacity of 20MW. The guidelines for noise are 15 years out of date and do not take into account the more powerful turbines that we see today. We also need provisions to protect people whose business or property may be devalued by development, such as in the case of my constituents in Creetown.</p><p>It is clear that current planning regulation is not robust enough to safeguard communities that are in the shadow of inappropriate developments.

Those who were stranded on a 20-mile stretch of the M8 on 6 and 8 December last year would have begged to differ, but I am glad that the minister&#8217;s comments today have been more measured.</p><p>I welcome this afternoon&#8217;s debate and the chance to hear the minister&#8217;s report on the Government&#8217;s progress. The Government has certainly been busy with its six-point plan, emergency preparedness reports, get ready for winter week and polar storm exercise. However, the proof of the pudding will be what happens if Scotland is tested again, and we all hope that it will be enough.</p><p>Predicting the weather and compiling long-range forecasts are an inexact science. The only predictable thing about Scotland&#8217;s climate, as Gil Paterson has mentioned, is its unpredictability. There is nothing new about bad weather in Scotland&#8212;even Burns, in &#8220;A Winter Night&#8221;, wrote:</p><p>&#8220;Blow, blow, ye Winds, with heavier gust!</p><p>And freeze, thou bitter-biting Frost!</p><p>Descend, ye chilly, smothering Snows!&#8221;</p><p>Of course, the difference now is that we have quite a lot more traffic on our roads.</p><p>We have perhaps experienced a bit of a golden period since then, even recently. In 2006, 2007 and 2008 there were, according to the Met Office, only 20 days on which snow was lying in Scotland. However, in the last year alone, there were 45 such days.</p><p>Just four weeks before the onset of the extreme weather last November, the Met Office bravely suggested that we could be in for an unusually mild and dry winter. At the same time, independent forecasters were predicting a winter on a par with that of 2009-10. That illustrates how difficult a task local authorities and trunk-road operating companies face at that time of year.</p><p>I noted the findings of the emergency preparedness report that was produced in conjunction with the Red Cross. Although it is only right that we expect the Government, local authorities and emergency services to have robust preparedness plans in place, they can cover only so much ground. It is incumbent on us all to be prepared individually for emergencies that arise from severe weather but, unfortunately, only 40 per cent of Scots feel prepared to deal with such emergencies. Of course the Government cannot do everything for us, but it can raise awareness of what actions we can and should take this winter. The number who feel prepared should be significantly higher this time next year, and the Government&#8217;s ready for winter campaign seems to be a step in the right direction.</p><p>The experience of the past two severe winters has undoubtedly reshaped and improved the winter resilience plans of all local authorities and&#8212;to be fair&#8212;of the Government. However, with greater preparedness comes greater financial pressure. It is important to note that, while roads and transport budgets across local authorities are subject to cuts, the financial demands on them are increasing significantly. The non-domestic rates budget that is available to local authorities will increase modestly, but the general revenue grant is to be cut by 12.4 per cent in real terms over the spending review period, which will obviously have an impact.</p><p>Last week, media reports said that Fife Council intends to enter winter with an opening stock of salt supplies that totals 40,000 tonnes. Just three winters ago, that council entered winter with 8,000 tonnes, so it now has five times more stock. Demand for salt from the three supplying mines has increased dramatically. It has proved to be the case that, in severe weather, the UK salt mining industry cannot cope with the spike in demand. That necessitates the procuring of salt from Peru and Egypt, which can be almost 50 per cent more expensive per tonne.</p><p>Local authorities have gone from paying perhaps just &#163;23 per tonne and entering winter with modest stocks in a just-in-time scenario to increasing their opening stock significantly, at much greater expense. That is before we consider the costs of additional equipment and additional labour hours. The increase in the routine and winter maintenance budget is welcome, but it pertains only to our motorways and trunk roads and will not go towards gritting footpaths or clearing snow from inaccessible residential areas. Councils have also had to raid their reserves. Perth and Kinross Council has gone from expecting a surplus to having a &#163;477,000 overspend because of the wintry weather.</p><p>The Scottish Government cannot simply pass the buck to councils and expect them to cope.

The Government&#8217;s eagerness to emphasise repeatedly that it intends to build 30,000 new social rented homes over the course of the parliamentary session has not gone unnoticed. There is, of course, an important distinction between affordable and social rented housing. I hope that the minister or cabinet secretary will clarify that they know the difference.</p><p>To change tack, one unfortunate aspect of the housing crisis in Scotland is the impact that it has on children. Research that was published this year revealed that one in 10 children lives in overcrowded accommodation and that 186,000 children live in homes with condensation or damp. The implications of growing up in such environments will be obvious to members.

I have no doubt that Galashiels would have made a fine location, as would Dumfries&#8212;which Elaine Murray mentioned&#8212;in serving the interests of the good people of Dumfries and Galloway. However, I understand that technical reasons may be behind the omission of a station in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway rather than a deliberate oversight, as members may believe. Locations such as Falkirk, Greenock and Dundee do not have to contend with the same topographical issues as many communities in the south. Members can take my word for it, as an amateur radio operator who lives in a deep valley, that it is an unfortunate fact that part of the spectrum to be utilised to make the stations possible suffers from inherent gaps and can be undone in hilly regions.</p><p>However, despite the unfortunate omission of large parts of the south, I welcomed the inclusion of Ayr on the list. I trust that the people of Ayrshire will embrace such a local TV station, and I was pleased to hear of the reports from the BBC last month that one company was &#8220;certain&#8221; to bid for the Ayrshire licence.

The figure is 62 per cent, compared with 52 per cent in the UK as a whole. That would suggest something of an appetite for local TV stations, and I do not doubt that such an appetite exists throughout the south of Scotland. I agree with the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Local TV services have the potential to bring benefits to viewers across Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>An obvious example is the ability for small, local businesses to target advertising to their customer base. In an age when there are so many media platforms and we can receive news at the most local level in print and on radio, the television proposal would seem to be just an extension along those lines.</p><p>I understand that the local TV initiative will be rolled out in two stages, the second of which involves the eventual introduction of internet TV. That will benefit the 40 per cent of the UK that cannot receive the spectrum, so it is obviously relevant to the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Clearly, that development is a few years down the line and it will necessitate the roll-out of superfast broadband. I look forward to that coinciding with the south of Scotland broadband project, which has been approved by Dumfries and Galloway and Borders Councils.

Such new and innovative solutions will be required if local authorities are to fulfil the target of recycling or composting 70 per cent of municipal waste by 2025. Although the Government&#8217;s modest investment in that area last year is a welcome start, now is the time to explore the expansion of the use of anaerobic digesters and to be mindful of the benefits of such technology over and above the obvious landfill benefits, which include its ability to assist us to meet our renewable energy and emissions reduction targets.</p><p>I am aware that two waste incinerator disputes are on-going and sub judice, so I assure the Presiding Officer that I will take care with my words.

Of course, we will also support Alex Johnstone&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>In the 21st century, digital connectivity will prove to be as vital to businesses and communities as transport connectivity was in the previous century. Like many, I live in a rural area, so I understand as well as anyone how vital it is that we improve connectivity throughout Scotland.</p><p>One of the Government&#8217;s biggest challenges throughout the parliamentary session will be to improve rural Scotland&#8217;s digital infrastructure by expanding opportunities for people in rural communities to enjoy the benefits of superfast broadband and by working with Ofcom and mobile network operators to improve mobile phone coverage dramatically and tackle what are called not-spots. I welcome the consideration that the Government appears to be giving the issue.</p><p>According to the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, one in 10 of its members still does not use the internet for work purposes&#8212;the equivalent figure in London is just one in 20. Broadband uptake by Scottish households stood at just 61 per cent last year, which&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;led Ofcom to describe Scotland as the least-connected nation in the UK. That is why the coalition Government in Westminster must be congratulated on including the Highlands and Islands as one of the four pilot areas that will experience superfast broadband. I hope that the Scottish Government will follow suit.</p><p>Businesses in Scotland are at a clear disadvantage internationally to our competitors in Germany, Sweden and the United States of America, and our rural businesses are also at a disadvantage to their urban competitors nationally. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said earlier this year that</p><p>&#8220;For rural areas, the immediate priority is to extend the reach of broadband.&#8221;</p><p>The reasons for doing so are obvious. More and more business is conducted online, and rural businesses are increasingly unable to tap into what could be a lucrative revenue stream for them. We recognised that in our manifesto, in which we made a commitment to &#163;250 million of investment to deliver superfast broadband to all parts of Scotland.</p><p>The availability of high-speed broadband is key to developing telehealth services, which Fiona McLeod mentioned. Expanding broadband coverage into rural areas will be instrumental to widening the scope of telemedicine and e-health services. For people who live in remote and rural communities&#8212;particularly those who are chronically ill&#8212;a trip to a health practice can be a considerable undertaking. The advent of telehealth solutions has allowed patients to be cared for locally. Telehealth services can empower those with long-term conditions and provide confidence to patients who are enabled to self-manage their condition. We want Scotland to be the first country to establish a national-scale telehealth service. The Government should look to mainstream the use of telehealth in delivering patient care.</p><p>It is worth highlighting how improved mobile phone coverage in rural areas can benefit public safety. I know from discussions with the Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue Team that, because of poor mobile coverage, pagers have to be used to call out members of that team to an emergency. Through the team&#8217;s experience, it believes that network coverage in Iceland&#8217;s hills is superior to what can be expected in elevated positions in Scotland. Mobile phones can prove instrumental in a rescue because of the ability to locate someone who is stranded by using so-called cell triangulation. That reduces the risk to searchers and saves countless precious hours.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s manifesto speaks of identifying</p><p>&#8220;barriers to increased mobile coverage&#8221;,</p><p>but the reason for the barriers is fairly clear&#8212;it is cost. I have argued that we should encourage widening the scope of operator partnerships, to spread the cost of building and maintaining new masts in remote and rural locations that have inadequate coverage. It is a sad fact that building a mast in the Highlands or in some parts of the south of Scotland costs substantially more than building one in Edinburgh does. Given that, why not encourage all operators to share the burden of building and maintaining rural masts?</p><p>The economic case for improving broadband and mobile coverage is clear. The social reasons for improving rural Scotland&#8217;s digital infrastructure are no less compelling. To the average 16 to 24-year-old, the internet has become an essential part of daily life. To those with broadband and favourable 3G mobile coverage, accessing websites presents no problems, but those in rural communities often encounter major difficulty with that.</p><p>Scottish Government social research that was published last year revealed that, although rural areas have experienced net migration in every age demographic in the past three years, accessible and remote rural areas have&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;experienced a net loss in 16 to 24-year-olds. From 2005-06 right up to 2008, the loss in the percentage of the 16 to 24-year-old population in remote rural areas was slightly greater than 5 per cent. The research also revealed that one of the push factors often highlighted by young migrants was social detachment. Young people are hampered in their attempts to access the internet, such as Facebook&#8212;as George Adam knows&#8212;and to utilise their mobile phones like their friends and relatives in more urban areas do. The Scottish Government&#8217;s research suggested that policy interventions were required to minimise the associated risks of rural migration and improve the digital infrastructure. That is one way to tackle that feeling of detachment and end that drain of young people from our rural communities.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Liberal Democrats will support the Government&#8217;s motion, but we also approve of Elaine Murray&#8217;s amendment, which strengthens the motion.

I am sure that one objective will be the delivery on budget and on time of the Forth replacement crossing. However, as a south of Scotland member, I share the concern expressed by many of my constituents about the future of the Waverley line project. As Lewis Macdonald pointed out, earlier this month&#8212;and just seven months after the new Borders railway consortium removed itself from consideration&#8212;the IMCD consortium withdrew from the bidding process, leaving only one group in the running for the contract to deliver a project of huge significance to the people of the Scottish Borders, Midlothian and Edinburgh. Every time a consortium has egressed, there have been claims about governance issues with Transport Scotland, and I hope that the alleged burden of regulation and contractual wrangling over this project is not a surreptitious attempt by the Government to kick the project into the long grass. As a result, I request that the cabinet secretary this afternoon tells us that we will see trains in Tweedbank in 2014 and seek Government assurances that it is actively encouraging other groups to throw their hat in the ring for the contract.</p><p>Under his wide remit, the cabinet secretary is also responsible for ferry services and I imagine that hauliers throughout Scotland will be watching with interest his actions with regard to the Rosyth to Zeebrugge service. After all, the freight service between those two ports is vital for many businesses in Scotland in expanding and maintaining their European operations. That said, questions remain over the commitment of DFDS Seaways to the service, following the removal of the passenger element and the reduction from four to three sailings per week. In his answers to my parliamentary questions about the service, the minister Keith Brown referred to that as</p><p>&#8220;a commercial matter for DFDS&#8221; &#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 24 June 2011 ; S4W-00897]</p><p>This morning, the cabinet secretary stated to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee that the Government&#8217;s approach would be &#8220;ambitious&#8221; but that cannot be achieved simply by washing one&#8217;s hands of an issue and watching from the sidelines as DFDS keeps downgrading Scotland&#8217;s only ferry link to mainland Europe.

His continued interest in the matter is to be applauded. Indeed, the cross-party group on co-operatives was born following the previous debate. I am pleased to have been a co-convener of that group since its creation.</p><p>I reserve a special mention for the two historians, John McFadzean and John Smith&#8212;the twa Johns&#8212;who unearthed the documents that revealed that Fenwick is the birthplace of the co-operative movement. Their research ultimately ensured that next week&#8217;s anniversary will be properly honoured, but it would be wise if they avoided Rochdale for the foreseeable future. The co-operative there thought that it had the honour of being the oldest.</p><p>It is incredible that a movement that has spawned almost a billion global members was a product of 16 weavers in a small Ayrshire village who sold oatmeal at a discounted price. Those 16 weavers were not only pioneers; they were incredibly courageous. Rob Gibson mentioned landowners. Landowners back then did not much like the thought of self-sufficient workers acting in an organised fashion.</p><p>In 1761, life was, of course, very different from and much more difficult than it is now. That is not to say that life is not difficult now, but at least we do not have to contend with the threat of engaging in a duel in a town square or perhaps another Jacobite uprising. That is why it is all the more remarkable that, against such a backdrop, men were willing to look beyond their own families and help their neighbours. For the period, the words that have been committed in ink on their document are inspirational. They bound the signatories to be</p><p>&#8220;honest and faithful to one another ... and to make good and sufficient work and exact neither higher nor lower prices than are accustomed&#8221;.</p><p>The soon-to-be-established Fenwick weavers trail will act as a fitting legacy of next week&#8217;s 250th anniversary celebrations. The Heritage Lottery Fund is to be commended for its generous contribution, which has made the trail possible. I understand that the old parliament wall is to be restored, which will be a fitting tribute to the weavers who met there. They often had to post a look-out during meetings to ensure their safety. It would, of course, be remiss of me not to highlight the roles played by East Ayrshire Council, Co-operative Development Scotland and the Scottish co-operative group for helping to fund a feasibility study, which ultimately made the trail possible.</p><p>As I said, I am a co-convener of the cross-party group on co-operatives, and I am a member of the Borders Machinery Ring co-operative. From a past life, when I was chairman of the Borders Foundation for Rural Sustainability, I have experience of trying to bring farmers together. The foundation conducted research among local farmers, which revealed that many of them wished to diversify and were willing to share resources. We engaged them with numerous land managers and other farmers, and we audited some of their ideas, interests and skills. That led to the establishment of the Borders farm venture groups. We had initiatives such as the James Hutton trail in east Berwickshire&#8212;Hutton being the father of geology&#8212;and the cliff-top discovery tours at St Abb&#8217;s Head. That is just a wee example of the success that can be achieved and of the progress that is still being made in the co-operative movement. The Borders Machinery Ring has now started the Borders Sports Ring, to give better buying power to sports clubs.</p><p>The village of Fenwick, the Fenwick Weavers Society and, importantly, the 16 weavers, will all be deserving recipients of what, I am sure, will be a fine celebration next week, when I look forward to signing the charter in Fenwick church.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646651", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fenwick Weavers Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate ahead of the events that are planned for next week.

In short, financial resolutions are important. They are important because it is vital that any bill that is brought before Parliament, that may significantly influence the Scottish consolidated fund, be fully costed to ensure that members are aware of its full implications. The financial implications of a bill are always just as important as its policy implications, particularly now, in times of tight finances.</p><p>We are fast approaching the end of the third session of the Parliament, and there is no harm in doing a little spring cleaning with the standing orders. Indeed, the difficulties in costing the financial implications of proposed amendments to the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill, as highlighted by the Finance Committee&#8217;s letter, demonstrated that it was perhaps time that we looked again at the rules governing financial resolutions. The Finance Committee&#8217;s desire to develop an approach to considering cost-bearing amendments when no financial resolution existed was clearly worthy of consideration.</p><p>As the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee report highlighted, voting on cumulative cost-bearing amendments in the standard marshalled-list order gives rise to the possibility of members failing to be afforded the opportunity to debate their own cumulative cost-bearing amendments. That could happen if amendments up to the financial threshold have already been agreed to in earlier sections of the bill.</p><p>I agree entirely with the committee that that is both &#8220;unfair and arbitrary&#8221;. The failure of any amendment should depend entirely on its merits and not on where it happens to fall in the bill. That is why I support the committee&#8217;s recommendation that, although cumulative cost-bearing amendments should be debated by subject matter, as they are currently, the putting of the question on those cumulative cost-bearing amendments that fall within the financial threshold should be deferred until the end of stage 2.</p><p>Some thought was clearly given as to whether stage 2 or stage 3 would be the appropriate time to consider cumulative cost-bearing amendments. In my eyes, stage 2 appears to be the natural choice, due to the obvious flexibility that it offers in comparison with stage 3 proceedings, which involve a strict timescale and many more members than a committee. I agree with the committee entirely.</p><p>I thank the clerks, all the associated staff, the convener and the other members of the committee for their hard work during the consultation and the preparation of the report.

It is not a competency for a lay person, and police forces alone, whether or not we are talking about special constables, should continue to have those powers.

For a start, we need to remember the importance of rural sports to rural economies. Many country hotels, bed and breakfasts and so on would not have enough trade, especially at winter time, if they did not have their regular fishers and shooters. Of course, it all helps the broader tourism industry. Moreover, 80 per cent of woodland in the Borders is at some stage used for country sports and many woods and copses are managed solely for such purposes, which, along with the feeding of released birds in the open, obviously benefits the wider wildlife community.</p><p>The provisions on vicarious liability have concerned many&#8212;indeed, they still concern the Conservatives&#8212;but have gained further support. As Roseanna Cunningham suggested, they should be implemented methodically, giving organisations time to implement the changes in their work practices.</p><p>The bill is not just about wildlife crime. It deals with protection for brown hares as well as white hares, which are of course blue in the summer. They do not breed in the same way as rabbits, which hide away in burrows, and I welcome the fact that they will be protected during their breeding season.</p><p>The bill also introduces improvements to deer management in Scotland. Issues surrounding deer are complex; we have our indigenous reds and roes and I believe that Jamie McGrigor mentioned the monarch of the glen&#8212;or perhaps it was the mongrel of the glen. There are also non-native sikas and the like that can damage the environment, including mature trees.</p><p>This important bill shows that the Parliament is concerned about the Scottish environment and listens to the many interests that understand not only the broader Scottish economy but the fact that we have to strike a balance between the two aspects.

We fought successfully for that to be included in the UK Government&#8217;s coalition agreement, and it is worth noting that it took just five months for the Westminster Government to announce its intention to introduce a pilot scheme that will deliver fuel duty discounts to many of our island communities.</p><p>Of course, dramatic increases in fuel are not exclusive to the past few months; they were endemic throughout Labour&#8217;s 13 years in power, so people will rightly ask Labour what was keeping it from introducing a similar scheme. That is further evidence that Labour does not really get the rural issues.</p><p>The price of unleaded and diesel fuels in areas such as Lerwick and Kirkwall is certainly eye-watering and I imagine that few members will argue with such communities receiving support in the form that was announced in October. However, not all Scotland&#8217;s remote communities are located to the north.

That gives a population density of just 24 people per square kilometre, which is in stark contrast to a city such as Glasgow, which has a population density of 3,338 people per square kilometre. As we would expect, two such vast areas as the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway are also experiencing high fuel prices. In Selkirk today, diesel costs 137p per litre. In Eyemouth, it is 140p, and in Annan, it is 142p. All those prices are above the UK average. Many people who reside there are forced to commute to their work and are only too well aware that trips to filling stations are becoming more frequent.</p><p>We have also had two hard winters, which have hit rural businesses&#8217; fuel costs high and hard.

Indeed, last month it was revealed that Dumfries and Galloway&#8217;s bill for running its vehicle fleet increased by 60 per cent in just 12 months. Clearly, it would be desirable for our efforts to decarbonise the economy and for economic reasons if the public sector were to move away from using petrol and diesel in its vehicles.</p><p>The SNP appeared to recognise that by stating in its 2007 manifesto that it was committed to ensuring that the entire public sector fleet would be running on alternative fuels by 2020. Unfortunately, I regret to inform members that the Government&#8217;s record on that target is appalling. Responses to freedom of information requests that I received a few weeks ago reveal that, in the 30 local authorities that responded, just 4.5 per cent of their vehicles are using alternative fuels. Thirteen health boards responded, and 1.1 per cent of their vehicles are using alternative fuels, while 0.7 per cent of the fleets of the police boards that responded are using alternative fuels. That is nowhere near 100 per cent. In all the public bodies that I surveyed&#8212;a combined fleet of 21,203 vehicles&#8212;only 3.25 per cent of vehicles use any type of alternative fuel. There is therefore little cause for optimism that we will see an improvement in that situation under the SNP Government.</p><p>Many of the public bodies that I surveyed had never purchased a vehicle that uses alternative fuel, and in the few that had, 45 per cent fewer such vehicles will be purchased during the current financial year than were purchased in 2007. Of course, the First Minister announced a low-carbon vehicle procurement scheme but, at best, that will give money towards only 104 vehicles, which is 0.005 per cent of the fleet that I have just mentioned.</p><p>The failure to take adequate steps towards decarbonising the public sector&#8217;s fleet of vehicles simply ensures that public bodies will continue to experience a tightening of their budgets as their fuel costs rise. That is because of a lack of competitive fuel alternatives and investment.</p><p>People throughout my region and the rest of Scotland are concerned about the rising cost of fuel, and we should be concerned, too.

The Scottish Constitutional Convention&#8217;s report said that locating a Parliament in Scotland would mean that it was more accessible than Westminster. Robin Harper talked about the idea of access being important to the committee. Under the standing orders, the committee was designed to be one of the vehicles that would ensure the involvement of people in Scotland in democracy, and giving people the opportunity to submit a petition before a committee of MSPs is an excellent way of enabling that.</p><p>Bruce Crawford mentioned that the committee is internationally renowned. That is correct, but there is concern about whether it is being marketed effectively in Scotland. When I read the committee&#8217;s report on its processes, I was surprised to learn that, although 194 petitions were lodged in the Parliament&#8217;s first year, fewer than 120 a year have been lodged since the start of session 2. After almost 12 years, we might have expected there to be greater awareness of the petitions process. Obviously, there is still work to be done.</p><p>John Wilson mentioned Dr Carman&#8217;s research study with Ipsos MORI, which revealed that most of those who participate in the process are among the older and better educated groups and are more likely to be middle class and to live in an affluent area than the average Scot. It also revealed that there is a disappointing lack of diversity in terms of minority participation. Perhaps we could all do more to promote the use of petitions when we are contacted by constituents.</p><p>Rhona Brankin, Bruce Crawford, Paul Martin and others mentioned that the committee had taken steps to address those issues, through the production of a blog and podcasts and the publication of a streamlined leaflet, as well as through the outreach programme, which many other members mentioned. I agree with the committee&#8217;s point that a balance must be struck. There is just one committee to deal with petitions, and it contains only nine MSPs and operates with a handful of support staff&#8212;the clerks, SPICe and others, whom Nigel Don thanked for all their hard work. The committee&#8212;and by extension the Parliament&#8212;will be successful with regard to accessibility only if it is able properly to scrutinise each petition that is brought before it.</p><p>There are many examples of petitions that have been submitted by groups or members of the public that have gone on to achieve some degree of success. The Laurencekirk crossing petition, which Mike Rumbles mentioned, is one such petition, although there is still a long way to go until the petitioners are satisfied. Of course, all success is relative.</p><p>I highlight a petition that originated in my community in the South of Scotland, which is also nationally significant. Last autumn, Daphne Jackson submitted a petition on behalf of Ettrick and Yarrow community council regarding the standard of mobile phone coverage in rural areas. The petition, which gained 780 signatures, called on the Parliament to urge the Government to make direct representations, which is what happened. The petition gained local media coverage and was considered by the committee in November. The committee agreed to write to a number of organisations, including the Scottish Government, fire brigades, the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Office of Communications, and I trust that it has now received responses. I, too, made representations on that difficult issue.</p><p>Everyone has highlighted their own pet petitions today. That is one example&#8212;although everybody has given their own examples&#8212;of how a petition can lead to greater awareness of an issue among the public and elected officials, and to action thereafter.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions Committee"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had an interesting debate this afternoon that has highlighted the importance of the Public Petitions Committee.

I should probably begin by declaring an interest as I live just a few miles downstream from the Megget reservoir, which has a capacity of 61,400,000m3 and, being nearly 1,100ft deep, is deeper than any Scottish loch or British lake. I take more than a passing interest in reservoir safety as any breach of the Megget would most likely result in my home ending up at Berwick-upon-Tweed.</p><p>Joking aside, I note that the regulation of our numerous reservoirs is an important matter due to our reliance on many of them and the close proximity of settlements to some of them. Indeed, the example that the cabinet secretary gave of the Maich fishery in Renfrewshire is cited in the policy memorandum and serves as a reminder that complacency on reservoir safety is not an option. In that regard, I welcome the Government&#8217;s attempt to look more closely at the matter.</p><p>The bill has particular relevance to my region, the South of Scotland. I believe that all of Edinburgh&#8217;s water comes from the region, and there are numerous reservoirs dotted around the area, with 38 in Dumfries and Galloway and 26 in the Borders. Of course, not all reservoirs are used for drinking water and many of them are utilised for recreation. As members will know, Penwhirn near Stranraer and Alemoor near Hawick are both excellent fishing locations that are enjoyed by many.</p><p>I plan to touch on a few aspects of the bill that I feel are worth highlighting, the first of which is the relatively contentious issue of the proposed threshold volume. Members will be aware that the Reservoirs Act 1975 is largely responsible for setting the current safety requirements surrounding large raised reservoirs. It was that legislation that introduced the 25,000m3 threshold but, interestingly, the act still did not cover the Skelmorlie reservoir in Ayrshire, the failure of which in 1925 resulted in the sad loss of five people.</p><p>The bill puts an extra burden on to SEPA and, as Elaine Murray said, there will be a cost to that organisation. The cost is estimated at more than &#163;4 million in the next five years, so I would be interested in hearing how the cabinet secretary foresees funding that cost, especially in the light of SEPA&#8217;s diminishing budget. Will we see an increase in fees from SEPA across the board, or will an extra burden be passed on to consumers through water rates?</p><p>Clearly, a reservoir need not be greater than 25,000m3 to have the ability to cause great harm to life and property. The Government has realised that and sought to address the issue in the bill, for which I am grateful. I am aware that RSPB Scotland and the Association of British Insurers have opposed the lowering of the threshold, but I think that we need to be guided by those who have direct experience in the field. That is why I am comfortable supporting a threshold that was set largely thanks to professional advice from the Institution of Civil Engineers and which has been supported by SEPA, local authorities and even the Scotch Whisky Association.</p><p>I note that the committee supports the lowering of the threshold, but I share its concerns that the Government failed during stage 1 to articulate adequately the rationale behind the use of the 10,000m3 figure. The fact is that each reservoir is unique, and increased capacity of a reservoir does not equate to greater risk. Indeed, some reservoirs in excess of 25,000m3 will pose no risk to life or infrastructure because of their remoteness, but a 10,000m3 reservoir that is being held back by an embankment dam near a village certainly does pose a risk.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats support the bill at stage 1, but I look forward to some clarifications in the minister&#8217;s summing up.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to contribute to the debate.

Peter Peacock, Rob Gibson and Jamie McGrigor all mentioned that reservoir safety is very important in the Highlands and Islands. I noted its relevance to my own region of the South of Scotland, which has many reservoirs that feed Edinburgh, and thereby affect Sarah Boyack&#8217;s constituency.</p><p>Sarah Boyack and Elaine Murray mentioned climate change and its effect on reservoir safety. To go back to my example of the Megget reservoir, the earth dam there was recently reinforced with more stone, because the winds and waves have been higher and stronger than originally calculated when the dam was built.</p><p>Several members have noted that when the bill receives royal assent, SEPA will acquire many additional powers as the recognised enforcement authority for reservoirs. Those powers will include serving enforcement notices on reservoir managers, appointing relevant engineers and imposing monetary penalties when an offence has been committed.</p><p>It is clear that SEPA will be burdened with many new responsibilities on top of its already extensive remit, and that will be costly, as Elaine Murray, Sarah Boyack and I pointed out. The Government&#8217;s own figures reveal that the full implementation of the bill will cost SEPA &#163;4.2 million in the period up to 2016. It is expected that &#163;0.34 million of that will be spent in the next financial year alone on recruiting just five new staff members&#8212;I hope that that is not an example of high pay coming into Government again. I am interested to hear from the cabinet secretary the Government&#8217;s plans for how SEPA will meet those additional costs. That is important, particularly when one considers that the spring budget revision for 2010-11 showed that SEPA&#8217;s spending was &#163;48.2 million, and its budget for 2011-12 is &#163;10.4 million less than that.</p><p>I am aware that an enabling power could allow Scottish ministers to let SEPA recover some revenue by transferring some of the costs to reservoir managers. However, that would only slightly reduce SEPA&#8217;s resource figure, and it would risk higher water rates. I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary addressed that point.</p><p>There is a wider issue in terms of burdening managers of reservoirs that are not regulated by the 1975 act with costs that they will find difficult to meet. Now that the threshold will rightly be lowered, many smaller and perhaps privately owned reservoirs that are used for angling will be included. Peter Peacock gave examples of such reservoirs, and I mentioned some that exist in my own region.</p><p>A glance at the committee&#8217;s recommendations in its report reveals that it is awaiting clarification on a number of points relating to costs. It would be unfair to expect some reservoir managers to absorb all the costs without assistance, and I am glad that the cabinet secretary has stated that the Government is considering assistance in certain cases. I would like to know where we are with that. Many of those reservoir managers operate without the luxury of extensive resources or deep pockets, and we must be mindful of overburdening them. Like the committee, I await further clarification.</p><p>However, there is certainly much to be lauded in the bill, and it has clearly benefited from a consultation exercise with high-quality responses. The bill is important for safety. Peter Peacock mentioned that many dams are more than 50 years old. In fact, many are more than 100 years old. Lowering the threshold and creating a central register of reservoirs are sensible ideas.</p><p>Ultimately, I support the general principles of the bill. However, we require further clarification from the Government on a few issues, with a particular focus on whether assistance will be provided to reservoir managers and how SEPA will operate as an enforcement authority despite the cuts to its budget. I look forward to scrutinising the bill as it progresses through the Parliament, and I will support it at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a productive and fairly consensual debate, with some worthy contributions from members on all sides of the chamber.

I will cover just a few points. One privilege of an MSP&#8217;s job is giving school pupils or students who take a keen interest in politics the chance to experience work in a parliamentary office. As the consultation document noted, the definition of gifts in the 2006 act does not exempt the value of the time of volunteers who work in parliamentary and constituency offices. As the report states, some members might not register volunteer support under gifts, because of the exemption under the sponsorship category. It is desirable to clarify that situation, so I am glad that a revision to the schedule is proposed.</p><p>As Nanette Milne said, letters often come our way from the likes of Ipsos MORI and ComRes asking us to participate in quite large surveys, for which the pay-off is that we can direct the polling organisations to make donations to local charitable causes. Like most members, I have done such surveys and asked for donations to be made to the likes of the Royal Air Forces Association and common good funds. As arrangements stand, a fee that is paid to a charity in return for completing a survey is still classed as remuneration, although members have no personal benefit.</p><p>I agree with the committee&#8217;s view that the registration of interests, particularly in relation to remuneration, is intended to focus on significant interests that might be perceived to influence a member&#8217;s behaviour. That is without question in the public interest. I also agree with the committee that it is difficult to state that a member could be unduly influenced by directing a small donation to a charity for completing a survey. I question whether constituents really care whether I have participated in a survey and asked that a donation be paid to a local charity. That is why I welcome the proposed changes to focus the remuneration category on relevant and non-trivial interests.</p><p>As I mentioned, many of the proposals are just general housekeeping of the schedule. We see that in the restructuring of the number of categories in the schedule from eight to five.

It has been a very constructive debate, and that must be welcomed.</p><p>It is just a few months since we debated Scotland's move towards a low-carbon economy. At that time, I said that climate change must be tackled head on to avoid our leading industries being severely impacted by prolonged periods of extreme weather. Never has that been truer, when we consider the hit that our businesses took in December and the carnage that our commuters faced in the transport network.</p><p>The path to achieving a low-carbon economy need not be a painful one. It should be seen to present opportunities that are ripe for exploitation. Although electricity market reform is a vital component in our efforts to tackle climate change, it also serves as one such vehicle of opportunity. Indeed, I know that the Scottish Government shares that view and agrees with the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change that the reform offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restructure the vital electricity market.</p><p>The consultation document that the Department of Energy and Climate Change published recently is important both because of the scope of its ambitions and because, frankly, time is of the essence. That has been clear today. We are in a period where numerous coal and nuclear power stations are nearing the end of their lives and will leave gaps in energy generation that need to be plugged. One such power station&#8212;Cockenzie, in the south of Scotland, just east of here&#8212;is scheduled to close by the end of 2015. It is important that power companies are mindful of local sensitivities when they plan their next generation of power stations, as well as considering the potential impact on communities such as Cockenzie when existing stations close.</p><p>In the past, some members on the Government benches have got a bit hot under the collar over nuclear power and its inclusion as one of the means of low-carbon generation. However, for all Governments, there will be circumstances that dictate that things cannot always be done as planned. Those are not my words, but those of the Deputy First Minister&#8212;on Twitter, of all places. I welcome her admission that Governments cannot always fully legislate according to their manifestos, as they would wish. However, for the avoidance of <place-holder colnum=\"32243\"/> doubt, I state what the Scottish Liberal Democrats have been saying for some time&#8212;we are still opposed to new nuclear capacity in Scotland and we firmly believe in maximising the benefits of Scotland's enviable renewables potential, which the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism mentioned when he commented on the EU remarks.</p><p>The publication of the consultation and the reforms that are contained within it only serve to further strengthen the Lib Dem and Conservative coalition Government's green credentials after just eight months in power, as Iain Smith remarked. The Government committed &#163;1 billion to carbon capture and storage pilot plants in the comprehensive spending review. I welcome the energy secretary's visit to Longannet in Fife yesterday, as did Liam McArthur in his opening speech. Members should also be aware that our party is lobbying strongly for the green investment bank to be situated in Scotland, and I welcome the energy secretary's positive comments in that regard yesterday, when he appeared before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, which is chaired by Iain Smith. Due to our renewables potential and Edinburgh's position as a financial powerhouse, Scotland is the obvious fit.</p><p>David Stewart noted that E.ON has announced a 9 per cent increase in electricity prices, which makes it the fifth of the big six to announce substantial price increases this winter. Perhaps the most attractive aspect of the reforms in the consultation is the certainty that they would create in the market. For example, carbon price support and feed-in tariffs will provide certainty over the cost of running polluting plant and the revenues for low-carbon generation, and certainty breeds investment. Given the number of new generation power stations that will be required to keep the lights on, the measures will remove the existing bias in favour of fossil fuels and incentivise investment in low-carbon generation. By implementing such reforms, we will be able to achieve the key aim of securing our energy supplies and insulating ourselves from the volatile fossil fuel prices that are so often blamed for increases in electricity and gas prices. It is vital that any reforms protect customers while encouraging investment in low-carbon technologies. The consultation strikes the right balance.</p><p>Significant investment will be required from the power sector. It is important that the sector plays ball to drive through the reforms to the market for the benefit of consumers who are penalised annually for trying to heat their homes. That happens not only in the Highlands and Islands, as David Stewart said, but across the whole of Scotland, including of course my area, the South of Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"32244\"/></p><p>As we begin to make significant inroads into decarbonisation, the demand for electricity will rise dramatically, given that it will be required to meet more of our heating and transport needs. The reforms are crucial. I hope that the Scottish Government will work closely with the Liberal Democrat Government to shape the final proposals&#8212;[<em>Interruption</em>.]&#8212;I should have said not Liberal Democrat Government but coalition Government.</p><p>I am glad that the minister has welcomed the UK Government's work, which is, of course, led by the Lib Dem Chris Huhne.

Those are all umbrella terms pertaining to a number of conditions that lead to the sudden deaths of young people every day. However, despite those daily tragedies, many people are still relatively unaware of the terms.</p><p>Leading charities, such as Cardiac Risk in the Young, estimate that at least 200,000 people under the age of 35 in the United Kingdom have a cardiac condition that is capable of causing sudden cardiac death, which could mean that as many as 16,500 people are in that situation in Scotland alone. Although many of those people will live normal lives, never knowing that they are at risk, it is important to note that they will still be genetic carriers of an abnormality that could, with more serious consequences, be passed on to their children. Unfortunately, the Gunn family in Selkirk is all too well aware of the dangers of one heart condition that can be responsible for sudden <place-holder colnum=\"31513\"/> cardiac deaths. Wilma Gunn decided to dedicate her life to raising awareness of sudden cardiac deaths following the death of her son Cameron. She established Scottish Heart at Risk Testing 14 years ago and has a record of achievements of which she should be proud. Money raised by Scottish HART has gone towards supplying a number of defibrillators to schools, fitness centres and swimming pools across Scotland, and they have already saved lives. In her attempts to raise awareness, Wilma has met Government ministers and presented evidence to parliamentary committees. Thanks to Scottish HART, an important annual sporting fixture in the Borders is the Cameron Gunn memorial soccer sevens tournament. The event has grown so large that it is now run in conjunction with Scottish Borders Council and the Scottish Football Association. It involves more than 1,000 youths every year and it is an important means of fundraising for the charity.</p><p>Cardiac Risk in the Young, or CRY as it is sometimes called, deserves enormous credit for the work that it has done in the past 15 years. During that time, it has been at the forefront of campaigns to raise awareness of sudden cardiac deaths in young people. Its activities include supporting bereaved families throughout the United Kingdom, conducting heart screenings, research, and lobbying politicians and the medical profession to raise awareness of SADS issues. CRY should be commended particularly for offering significant grants to trained cardiologists who will continue to work in the national health service as experts in SADS-related conditions.</p><p>Before this evening&#8217;s debate, I made inquiries of the University of Edinburgh regarding the structure and content of its physical education teacher training programme. With some of the conditions there are warning signs, and if they are detected early enough, that can lead to a diagnosis and the ability to effect life-saving lifestyle changes. PE teachers are ideally situated to spot the warning signs, so I was intrigued to learn whether they have the necessary skills to do so. I understand that, following the introduction of curriculum for excellence, there is now a focus on the wellbeing of pupils, and that this year&#8217;s intake of PE teaching students at Edinburgh will be the first to leave university equipped with such skills when they graduate in 2014. I certainly welcome those amendments to the course structure. However, before this year, only students who undertook more scientific modules would have gained the necessary knowledge, and those modules were not compulsory. I wonder whether the minister will be willing to look into that and investigate the possibility of giving existing PE teachers some retrospective training in the symptoms of heart conditions. I imagine that most <place-holder colnum=\"31514\"/> 13 or 14-year olds would not readily associate dizziness or shortness of breath from exertion with a heart condition, but if their teacher did so, it could make all the difference. I am not suggesting a full course for PE teachers; perhaps a brief lecture from a physician or some educational literature would suffice.</p><p>Although that approach would be helpful, we must be mindful that the first time many people who fall victim to sudden cardiac death become symptomatic is when they die. The only way to combat that is to screen young people for heart conditions. That is why the Government deserves credit for supporting Professor Stewart Hillis&#8217;s cardiac assessment of young athletes programme, or CAYA. In the answer to a parliamentary question last month, I learned that 176 of the 885 individuals who had been screened up to that point had been referred for further treatment. Many of those cases involved elevated blood pressure. My concern is that the commendable CAYA programme is largely geared towards those who compete in organised amateur sport. Those sporting individuals who keep active, but do so outside organised competition, are in danger of slipping through the net. For every weekend amateur footballer or cricketer, there are many people who jog or cycle after work or play five-a-side football with colleagues, as Cameron Gunn was doing when he passed away.</p><p>I am fully aware that blanket screening is not feasible because of budgetary constraints and the lack of medical professionals in the NHS who have experience of electrocardiogram and echocardiogram manifestations. I understand that most of the CAYA programme&#8217;s subjects thus far have been male and involved in team sports, but that there is a capability to offer satellite clinics. I would be interested to know whether the additional funding that was announced in October will allow the CAYA programme to move into leisure centres and gyms to screen those who would otherwise miss out on the opportunity.</p><p>SADS is a phenomenon that strikes without discrimination. It is thanks only to the actions of charities such as Cardiac Risk in the Young and Scottish HART that we are beginning to understand that previously unexplained deaths were, in fact, the result of heart conditions.</p><p>The CAYA programme is a good start, but it would be desirable to have many more of our country&#8217;s young people screened for heart defects. It costs the NHS just &#163;38 to operate an electrocardiogram machine on a patient, which has the potential to save a person&#8217;s life.</p><p>Perhaps in the future we will have a programme to rival that in Italy, which has virtually eradicated sudden cardiac deaths in sport and has led to a greater recognition of such deaths in that country.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137778", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members who have remained behind to participate in the debate.

I took a particular interest in the section on muirburn.</p><p>There can be no doubt that we are fortunate to live in a country of such beauty. The scenery in every corner of Scotland is complemented by diverse wildlife. Indeed, I argue that our most profitable natural resource is our environment and <place-holder colnum=\"31242\"/> wildlife. It is not just profitable; it provides great enjoyment for everyone who goes into the country.</p><p>A report that was commissioned by SNH and published this year estimated that nature-based tourism was worth nearly &#163;1.5 billion annually to the Scottish economy, and that it supported 39,000 full-time jobs. Wildlife tourism alone is estimated to generate &#163;127 million each year, and it is the driving force behind more than 1 million visits annually.</p><p>The intentions behind the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill are good. It was appropriate to hold an extensive consultation to ensure that a wide range of stakeholders could help to shape the bill prior to its introduction. It seems rather ridiculous that there are still sections of game law that are derived from a piece of legislation that was passed before the US declaration of independence. I welcome the bill's attempts to provide a more modern legal framework for tackling wildlife and environmental issues.</p><p>There are a number of concerns in my region. Country sports play an important part in the economy there, with many hotels surviving only because of the winter visitors for game shooting and because of the environment. An independent survey from eight years ago estimated that 80 per cent of woods in the Borders were used at some stage for country sports. Many of them were planted solely for that reason. In one year there were up to 196,000 participation days in rural sports, and in the Borders alone an estimated &#163;29.5 million was spent by providers and participants. We must be careful not to shoot ourselves in the foot with a well-intentioned bill. I also recognise the importance of pheasant rearing and release in that regard, and I would be interested to hear the minister's views on that when she sums up the debate.</p><p>Vicarious liability has been discussed, and no one here will wish to condone any land user giving orders to kill wildlife illegally, so the bill must tighten up that area. It must also ensure that land users cannot be prosecuted for a crime just because it happened on their land. I am glad to hear that the minister will lodge an amendment regarding due diligence to address that point.</p><p>The sections of the bill that seek to legislate on non-native species are of particular interest to me, because non-native species are of some relevance to me and others in the South of Scotland. American signal crayfish have become a significant problem in various areas of the country, with Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway being especially badly affected. It is estimated that the income that is generated by people who use the loch for boating and angling exceeds &#163;740,000 per annum. That has come under threat from the <place-holder colnum=\"31243\"/> crayfish, which eat young fish and destroy their habitat. I understand that, in a five-month period last year, more than a million of the creatures were captured on the loch in a Government-funded pilot scheme, which highlights how serious the problem is. Such is their impact that the species was described by Colin Bean of SNH as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Steve McQueen of the invertebrate world\",</p><p>because the crayfish can escape from anything, probably due to their being amphibious.</p><p>That is only one example of the kind of economic and environmental impacts that an invasive non-native species can have when introduced into an alien ecosystem. It is therefore only right that we take a dim view of those whose actions, or inaction, endanger native animals and plant life, so I welcome the Government's efforts to tackle invasive non-native species.

As the cabinet secretary said, Scottish seafood exports are worth around &#163;500 million a year. It is clearly an important industry, and there is a clear need for a fair settlement for Scotland's fishermen in the upcoming negotiations.</p><p>The European Commission's proposal for fishing opportunities in 2011 is concerning, particularly with regard to Scotland's key commercial species. Our fishing industry understands the need to have a sustainable relationship with the environment, which is why the Scottish fleet is one of the most responsible in Europe. I am glad that we have unanimity in the Parliament regarding discards. There are concerns over proposed cuts for prawn quotas in the west coast of Scotland and the North Sea, and we face cuts in quotas for west coast haddock and cod of 25 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. Those are extremely serious proposals that would have a significant impact. Our fishing industry must be protected and made sustainable to ensure that it continues to thrive.</p><p>About a quarter of the labour force operates from the fishing port areas of Peterhead and Fraserburgh. When the port districts of Aberdeen and Buckie are included, the north-east contains about 32 per cent of the total labour force and lands about half of the fish. Only three other port districts have more than 500 fishermen, one of which is in Ayr. In my region, Ayrshire is an important fishing area, as is Berwickshire. Only the port at Fraserburgh employs more fishermen than that in Ayr. Unfortunately, both Ayr and Eyemouth in Berwickshire have witnessed a drop in the number of fishermen operating out of their harbours. To emphasise that, I point out that, in Ayr alone, 118 fewer fishermen were employed in 2009 than in 2007.</p><p>The past 10 years have been characterised by alarming drops in the value of landings, with only some modest year-on-year increases. It is little wonder that the 2007 labour force was approximately half that employed back in the 1970s; that the number of people employed in the catching sector in 2009 dropped to an historic low of 5,409; and that the current figure of 2,174 fishing vessels is the smallest fleet size ever recorded. We must ensure that fishermen can plan for their future. Trawler skippers run small businesses, and what business owner would envy them the task of continuing to operate when they are unable to make long-term projections on turnover? That is why I welcome the comments of the UK fisheries minister, who said in June that any reform of the common fisheries policy should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Enable and encourage fishermen to better plan for their businesses for the long-term\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>House of Commons</em>, 23 June 2010; Vol 512, c 264W.]<place-holder colnum=\"31027\"/></p><p>It was appropriate that the cabinet secretary had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the UK delegation regarding the quotas for the Faroe Islands and Iceland at September's agriculture and fisheries council.</p><p>The UK Government has been proactive in engaging with the relevant stakeholders in the fishing industry in the past few months. Only last week, the fisheries minister met Alistair Carmichael MP and representatives of the Shetland fisheries group SHOAL&#8212;the Shetland oceans alliance&#8212;and has committed to visiting Shetland in the new year. The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, also recently met the Scottish Fishermen's Federation to discuss the challenges that the industry faces. I understand that the fisheries minister is in regular contact with the Scottish Government. Obviously, Maureen Watt is not aware of that.</p><p>The negotiations are vital not just for our fishing communities, but for Scotland as a whole.

He is also right to suggest that the IUCN's decision to base the programme in Scotland is recognition of how significant peatlands are to our landscape and environment, as eloquently described by Bill Wilson. They are also important for our annual carbon emissions, and the restoration of our peatlands should be considered a key means of helping to achieve our climate change targets.</p><p>I note that the commission of inquiry took evidence yesterday from members of the public and expert witnesses to investigate the steps that are necessary to tackle the damaged peatlands that are dotted around Scotland. The IUCN should certainly be congratulated on managing to bring land managers, scientists and industry officials together to discuss, and inform it on, peatland restoration. I would be interested to hear from the <place-holder colnum=\"30126\"/> minister whether the Scottish Government has any plans to contribute to that process, or at least to meet the IUCN afterwards to discuss the commission's findings in detail after it has reported.</p><p>Only in August, a <em>Guardian</em> journalist described peat's impact on the climate as \"the global environment's Cinderella\". I do not usually bog down members with statistics, but they are useful to highlight the scale of peat's contribution to global carbon emissions. Only relatively recently has science caught up, to the point that we can reveal the problem's extent. The fact that Scotland possesses 80 per cent of the UK's blanket bog peat, which holds 3 billion tonnes of carbon, shows how important peat conservation is. The amount of carbon that lies underneath our soil represents approximately 190 years' worth of Scotland's total emissions. It is believed that 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide are being released from peatland each year&#8212;the equivalent of the emissions from 1 million households.</p><p>It is only right to acknowledge that measures are in place for peatland restoration under the Scottish rural development programme, but more could be done. The longer we delay restoration work to some peatlands, the more costly that work will be and the more damage will be caused. A range of environmental organisations advocate more ministerial direction to SEPA, SNH and the Forestry Commission Scotland to work together to deliver peatland restoration, with the help of other land users. I am interested to hear the minister's views on such proposals.</p><p>A Scottish Wildlife Trust press release from earlier this year quoted the cabinet secretary as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I hope to see further opportunities being pursued in future to bring Scottish peatlands back to peak condition, bringing with them a multitude of benefits for our natural environment.\"</p><p>I, too, would like opportunities to be developed.

However, the Public Audit Committee's report on the potential final cost of staging the games is a concern. We must all concentrate on ensuring that the games are a success. As Nanette Milne and others said, we must not forget that the Ryder cup is to be held on these shores just a few weeks after the conclusion of the Commonwealth games here in 2014. We have only to note how gripping this week's tense finale of the Ryder cup was to highlight how great and admired an event it is. Indeed, I suspect that some members&#8212;not I, of course&#8212;achieved little on Monday afternoon as the events at Celtic Manor reached a thrilling conclusion.</p><p>Scotland alone may never stage the world cup or the Olympics, so to have two major internationally recognised sporting events in our country in the same year is probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we should seize it. Given the handling of the homecoming 2009, I am wary of the suitability of another homecoming as a means to capitalise on our year of opportunity. Last year's event was a good idea, but in an era of limited public funds it is vital that we ensure that events are properly administered so that we maximise the gains from public investment.</p><p>As important as the economic benefits are the societal benefits, such as the promotion of mass participation in sports and the health benefits that an active lifestyle delivers. The former chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, once stated in regard to participation in sport that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The potential benefits of physical activity are huge. If a medication existed which had a similar effect it would be regarded as a ... 'miracle cure'.\"</p><p>Tennis courts are full in July and snooker halls are full in April. When sporting events that are staged in the UK are broadcast, people feel compelled to participate, and that is particularly true of young people. We have to take advantage <place-holder colnum=\"29532\"/> of the large number of people who might want to take part in boxing, cycling, swimming or gymnastics for the first time. It is estimated that 2,500 people a year die due to physical inactivity, and people who take little exercise are three times more likely to develop some cancers. We have to nip that in the bud.</p><p>I would like the Parliament to engage with the national governing bodies of each sport that is featured in the Commonwealth games to ascertain whether they have strategies in place to increase participation in sport in communities throughout the country after July 2014. By having such meetings, we could establish whether we can offer any support or expertise to help them to create strategies for the future. We must remember that many of the governing bodies are small organisations, so we cannot rely on them alone to increase participation in their sports.</p><p>Sport can serve as a vehicle for community cohesion and togetherness. To realise that, we have only to look at the way in which junior football clubs such as Auchinleck Talbot and rugby clubs such as Melrose have become such staples of their local communities.

Members will recall that it removed all Government funding from the national volunteering charity ProjectScotland. In 2007, ProjectScotland's funding was &#163;5 million; in 2009, it was zero. ProjectScotland's work existed to provide volunteering opportunities in a range of sectors for young people aged 16 to 25. The volunteers were provided with experience, skills and confidence to help to make them more employable. It is worth reminding ourselves of what the refreshed skills strategy says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Collectively, these commitments are aimed at improving the skills and employability of individuals\".</p><p>ProjectScotland already delivered those aims. When the decision was made to remove the funding from ProjectScotland, I thought that it was foolhardy; it now seems that it was downright reckless. In February this year, there were 42,450 Scots between the age of 18 and 24 claiming jobseekers allowance. Instead of collecting their dole money, many could be doing rewarding volunteering work with the support of an allowance, as young Paul Hamilton from Stranraer did. He volunteered with the Forestry Commission and overcame literacy problems and low confidence to gain employment following his placement. That is only one success story among many.</p><p>ProjectScotland recently had to make staff redundant. It is having to turn people away and it is limiting its operations to only 400 volunteers a year. The Scottish Government's school leavers task force initiative provides volunteer placements to those who have recently left school.

I imagine that most members in the chamber this evening will know someone who has been touched by the cruel illness of MS and will be well aware of the impact that it has on the lives of those who are personally affected, and their loved ones of course. There are about 10,500 people with MS in Scotland, which is the highest prevalence of the illness anywhere in the world. Now we face the potential loss of the only respite centre of its kind in Scotland&#8212;and in fact in the northern United Kingdom.</p><p> I have been privileged to visit Leuchie house on two occasions as an elected representative in East Lothian, and I was able to speak to staff and service users. On one of those occasions I was with my colleague and Lib Dem health spokesman Ross Finnie. Having seen the dedication of the staff as well as the immense benefit that service users derive from their stay in Leuchie house, I know how concerned visitors to the centre are about the MS Society's plans and how cherished Leuchie has become. However, the loss of the centre is currently an ominous prospect.</p><p> I have a great deal of respect for the work that the MS Society Scotland has done over the years, but I am afraid that in this instance the society can do more to ease the severity of the situation. Although the three England-based respite centres have until November 2011 to be transferred to another provider, Leuchie house will close in a little over 10 weeks if another provider cannot be found.</p><p> The disparity in the grace periods is attributed to</p><p class=\"indent\"> \"the different circumstances surrounding Leuchie house in Scotland\",</p><p> which I suspect might refer to the fact that Leuchie is the only centre that is not owned outright by the society, even though there is only a peppercorn rent. Sir Hew himself said that it was a penny, so Jackie Baillie and I will have to agree to disagree on a penny. I imagine that that will be of little comfort to the 85 staff who are employed at Leuchie house. I have been told that it is nothing to do with costs, but of course in the real world funds do matter, and I stagger at the thought of the cost of returning Leuchie house to its previous d&#233;cor if it is forced to close.</p><p> In June, I wrote to appeal to the MS Society to reverse its decision to withdraw support from Leuchie, but it became clear that the society was not for turning on the matter. I have also asked trustees to extend a lifeline to Leuchie by granting an extension that would allow staff and other interested parties to explore the options fully. The society has a duty of care to users of the centre, <place-holder colnum=\"28981\"/>  and in the interests of fairness I would like an extension to be granted to bring Leuchie into line with the English centres.</p><p> I also wrote to the Deputy First Minister in June to ask the Government to investigate ways in which it could support Leuchie to ensure that there is no gap in provision. I accept that the situation is a result of operational decisions by the MS Society, but I wonder how big a burden has been removed from the national health service simply through Leuchie house being available to people who have MS. I therefore ask the minister to exercise some influence over the matter.</p><p> The majority of respondents to the MS Society's surveys and focus groups might have intimated a desire to move to holiday venues where care is provided, but most holiday venues are unable to cater for people with high-dependency MS. I also wonder how many people who have complex physical needs were able to respond to those surveys.</p><p> The staff need time to set up their own mechanism for the management of Leuchie, and I intend to impress that upon the MS Society when I, Ross Finnie, Councillor Jacquie Bell and representatives from the save Leuchie campaign meet the society.</p><p> The care commission's inspection of Leuchie house in August 2009 awarded it the highest grade possible for the commission's four quality themes. Leuchie house was inspected just a few weeks ago, and again it maintained its outstanding record of excellence.</p><p> I offer my congratulations to Mairi O'Keefe and her staff for their achievements during a difficult time. It would be remiss of me if I did not mention Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple and thank him for his generosity, which stretches back to the 1970s. Thanks to his kindness in leasing Leuchie for just a penny a year, thousands of people who suffer from MS have been able to experience the benefits of the centre in North Berwick. Service users, staff, local councillors, local MPs, the local community and members throughout the chamber want Leuchie house to remain open. It is simply too valuable to be lost, a fact on which I am sure that most of us agree.

One has only to look at the severity of our most recent winter to see the impact that extreme weather can have on our businesses and society.</p><p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 was a welcome initial step of which we should rightly feel proud, because it shows our intent to contribute to the international fight against climate change. To that end, I welcome the improved annual emissions targets that the Government published yesterday, following consistent pressure from the Liberal Democrats, although there was some resistance from other parties. It is imperative that we have an established framework for achieving our 2020 targets to ensure that continuous progress is made.</p><p>Although it is only proper to view climate change as the threat that it is, the path to achieving a low-carbon economy need not be painful. We should be mindful of the opportunities and possibilities that it presents for reshaping our economy and the enormous potential for job creation.</p><p>WWF Scotland has stated that a third of emissions in Scotland result from home energy use, which is a significant contribution to our annual emissions total&#8212;a point that Iain Smith made well. An effective way to tackle such emissions on our way to decarbonising is by encouraging householders to modernise their homes to make them more energy efficient.</p><p>Liam McArthur mentioned the Lib Dem coalition Government's green deal, which is to be applauded. It is ambitious in seeking to have millions of householders take up the offer of up-front finance to insulate their homes, the savings made from energy bills being used to pay for the improvements. Not only would that help tackle the problem of home-energy-use emissions; it would establish a sector that the coalition Government expects to provide 246,000 jobs by 2030.</p><p>Of course, if Scotland is to work towards a low-carbon economy, it is essential that we have a population with the skills, training and education required to drive it. Both Cathy Peattie and David Whitton mentioned skills. That is where outstanding organisations such as the Crichton Carbon Centre in Dumfries have a real part to <place-holder colnum=\"28950\"/> play. That organisation exists to provide teaching in carbon management and to conduct academic research. In partnership with the University of Glasgow, it has developed the first masters degree in carbon management in the UK. It states on its website:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our expert team is working to tackle the challenge of climate change by encouraging and supporting behaviour changes at individual, business and community levels.\"</p><p>I am sure that members across the chamber will welcome such forward thinking from an organisation that is still in its infancy. However, we should not rely on charities and other organisations to do the work of the Government.</p><p>The Scottish Government's discussion paper on moving towards a low-carbon economy states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Key to the success of a low carbon economy will be equipping learners with the additional skills that they need in the usage and application of environmental solution and technologies.\"</p><p>I agree. A step in the right direction would be&#8212;my colleague Tavish Scott highlighted this to the First Minister a fortnight ago&#8212;to ensure the future of the wind turbine technician course at Carnegie College in Dunfermline, which David Whitton mentioned. One might suspect that such a qualification would prove competitive over the next few years in our march towards decarbonising our economy. It would be a terrible shame if such a course and the skills that it teaches and develops were lost to Wales or Yorkshire.</p><p>Sarah Boyack and Cathy Peattie mentioned local procurement, which I have also pushed for some time, particularly local food procurement. The benefits of such a move would also help in our efforts to tackle climate change. According to Friends of the Earth, 25 per cent of Scotland's greenhouse gases result from food production. I note the recent Scottish Government consultation document \"Public Bodies Climate Change Duties\" and welcome its draft guidance on how public bodies can play their part by sourcing food locally.</p><p>Many local authorities are making commendable efforts to source their food locally, but others have a long way to go. The successful example of the Fife diet shows that we can source food virtually on our doorsteps and, in so doing, make a significant contribution to cutting emissions. What harm can there be in boosting and sustaining an industry that plays such an important role in our economy?</p><p>By educating and training our population, encouraging better procurement practices in our public bodies and insulating our homes in a massive programme to boost jobs, as Iain Smith mentioned, we not only tackle climate change and move Scotland to a low-carbon economy but <place-holder colnum=\"28951\"/> assist job creation and sustain the industries that are important to our country.</p><p>We have had an interesting debate. Jackson Carlaw mentioned schemes for reducing car usage, albeit that the suggestion conflicts somewhat with his past life. I am glad that Sarah Boyack welcomes the Liberal Democrat announcement on the green investment bank. Stuart McMillan was slightly out of touch in criticising the lack of work between UK and Scottish ministers.

I secured a members' business debate on local food way back in June 2007 and I am now one of the conveners of the cross-party group on food.</p><p>One would be hard-pressed to dine in a top restaurant in some of the world's biggest cities and not find some form of Scottish produce on the menu. A fine example of quality exported Scottish produce can be found at Peelham farm down in Berwickshire, which does not sell sand to the Arabs but does sell salami to the Italians. Last year it won the future farmer award. Congratulations must go to Arnold and John Park of Drinkstone near Hawick for winning that accolade this year. The Borders seem to be leading the way again.</p><p>Unfortunately, some people are unaware of the world-class produce that is available on their own doorstep. That is why schemes such as the Scottish food and drink fortnight are to be applauded for their scope and ambition in attempting to build on Scotland's outstanding reputation for quality food and drink.</p><p>Not only should we be proud of the standard of our food and drink, but we must acknowledge how important the industry is to our economy. Various figures have been quoted, but it is worth around &#163;9.5 billion annually and is responsible for keeping more than 350,000 people in employment, so it is obviously critical to Scotland.</p><p>Scotland Food &amp; Drink's vision, which is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to make Scotland internationally known as 'A Land of Food and Drink'\",</p><p>is a laudable objective, but it is important that we do more to promote ourselves as a land of food and drink closer to home. For some time now, I have campaigned for locally sourced food to be used more widely within the public sector. That is a means not only of promoting our produce and improving our diets, but of helping to boost our economy by creating a sustainable food, drink and agriculture sector in Scotland. That is of great importance in my region, which is the South of Scotland.</p><p>I note that the Scottish Government's national food and drink policy, which was published last year, expresses a desire</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to make our public sector a world-wide exemplar of excellent food and drink procurement practice which supports our sustainable economic growth and contributes to a healthier Scotland.\"</p><p>I welcome the Government's commitment to strive towards something that I and my colleagues have advocated for some time. However, I am afraid that although there is some evidence of a trend towards the public sector sourcing more of its food locally, more needs to be done. I have obtained <place-holder colnum=\"28691\"/> figures through freedom of information requests that highlight the massive disparity that exists among local authorities throughout the country.</p><p>Leading the field is East Ayrshire Council, which sources 30 per cent of its food in Ayrshire&#8212;of course, Robin Gourlay was involved in that. Part of its success could be attributed to the council's innovative local food pilot scheme, which was met with enormous enthusiasm. However, unfortunately, only 3.5 per cent of North Ayrshire Council's food budget this year will be spent on local produce. That is in stark contrast to neighbouring East Ayrshire Council. Stirling Council spends 28 per cent of its food budget on food that is sourced within a 100-mile radius, but nearby Clackmannanshire Council will spend only 9 per cent this year.</p><p>I highlight those statistics not to condemn the councils concerned but to point out the differences that exist between neighbouring councils. Why should such disparities exist when neighbouring authorities could use the same food sources? Perhaps they need to develop shared strategies under which they work co-operatively to source local food produce.</p><p>Another success story of recent years is the rise of farmers markets&#8212;in which I acknowledge John Scott's involvement. From speaking to constituents in Kelso, Haddington, Hawick and Peebles, where successful markets are thriving, I know how valuable the markets are, not only to farmers but to consumers. Many farmers markets have become tourist attractions in their own right, and 15 of them have been accredited by VisitScotland. They serve as an excellent vehicle not only for promoting local produce but for exposing members of the public to high-quality local produce that they may not necessarily be offered in retail stores. Local authorities, town centre managers and the Government should encourage the continued success and expansion of farmers markets into more Scottish towns, alongside initiatives such as the food and drink fortnight.</p><p>We must recognise that we can have such an enviable food and drink sector only as long as we are willing to safeguard our producers. That is why I welcome the comments of my Liberal Democrat colleague Ed Davey&#8212;now the UK Minister for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs&#8212;who has announced the UK Government's intent to create a supermarket ombudsman to prevent retailers from abusing their considerable power. As such behaviour can lead to less innovation, less choice and lower-quality goods, the creation of a groceries code adjudicator is long overdue: I am sure that all members join me in welcoming its creation.<place-holder colnum=\"28692\"/></p><p>Scottish food and drink fortnight has been a great success, and I wish it well in promoting our fine foods for the future.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997464", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I also declare a farming interest.

I also congratulate Duncan Brown on the publication of his book on the 172 Scottish recipients of the Victoria Cross.</p><p>This week, I am hosting the Royal Air Forces Association, which has a display just outside the chamber to mark the 70th anniversary of the battle of Britain, a battle that started just a few miles from here over the Forth and a battle for which many air fighters won the Victoria Cross in defence of our nation. Many Royal Air Force men who won the Victoria Cross made the ultimate sacrifice, such as Ayrshire Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell, who, with 1,000 guns firing at him, ran the gauntlet at 50ft above sea level in Brest harbour and successfully released his torpedoes at an enemy ship, but never got out of the harbour. The Germans gave him full military honours at his burial. I think that we all agree that we owe so much to those few.</p><p>We should also remember recipients of the Victoria Cross who were not from these British Isles. I refer to recipients from what used to be called the British Empire and from the Commonwealth. Many of them were Indian, Caribbean, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, Nepalese or from the African Commonwealth countries.</p><p>The Victoria Cross has been awarded to more than 1,350 people. We owe a great debt to those individuals.</p><p>Nearer to hand, if I may be parochial, my South of Scotland region was the home of individuals who went the extra mile in their duties. One such individual was Thomas Caldwell of Carluke, who is mentioned in Christina McKelvie's motion. In the closing weeks of the first world war, he courageously and under close-range heavy fire ran single-handedly at an enemy position, took control of it and captured 18 prisoners.</p><p>Elsewhere from my region, James Blair of Melrose was injured while serving in India, but with not much more than the hilt of a sword he headed up his men and charged rebels, with total effect. Also in India, Tom Cadell of Cockenzie in East Lothian risked his life to save his fellow men by twice going under heavy fire, once to pick up and rescue a wounded bugler and then, again facing a wall of lead, to rescue a wounded man from the 75th regiment who had been left behind.</p><p>In Moffat, there is the grave of Lieutenant Wallace from Thornhill&#8212;no relation to Jim Wallace&#8212;who, on finding himself completely surrounded and with only five men, maintained firing by running from gun to gun for eight hours <place-holder colnum=\"27298\"/> until, completely exhausted, he retreated successfully, taking all his wounded men and guns with him. That was real courage in an impossible situation.</p><p>An Ayrshire private, Ross Tollerton, is also mentioned in the book. He put others' lives before his own in going under heavy fire. With head and hand injuries, he returned to rescue his wounded lieutenant. That not being enough, he resumed his post, held the position and nursed his lieutenant for three days until they were rescued. Again, his actions went well beyond the call of duty. Like many others, Private Tollerton never recovered from his injuries and died at the young age of 41.</p><p>Tomorrow sees the famous Hawick common riding, which celebrates the daring raid on English troops by Hawick men and their return with the English standard in 1514. Five hundred years later, a certain Hawick man called John Daykins inspired his fellow troops by rushing two machine gun posts in France. By hand-to-hand fighting alone, he returned with 25 prisoners and the enemy's machine gun. Without doubt, that was bravery in the extreme.</p><p>One other special Victoria Cross was awarded. In 1921, in the United States, it was awarded to the unknown soldier to mark those who fell for us all, whose deeds were never witnessed but who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we all could have the liberty that we often, but should not, take for granted.</p><p>The Victoria Cross may be made of fairly cheap bronze, but it is the ultimate recognition of what is often the ultimate that someone can do for others.

Of course, Liberal Democrats support the idea of zero waste and waste prevention and, by extension, any initiative that is aimed at achieving it. This has been a fairly convivial debate, in that that view is shared across the parties. I am glad that my new friend John Scott agrees with it, just as David agrees with Nick.</p><p>My only disappointment&#8212;which is a significant one&#8212;is that we have been here before, as other members have said. Little progress seems to have been made since January 2008 on producing a defined zero waste strategy. That is especially disappointing given the good start that the Liberal Democrats made in 2003, under Ross Finnie's stewardship, with the launch of the national waste strategy, as Liam McArthur and Shirley-Anne Somerville recognised.</p><p>Christopher Harvie highlighted the problem of nappies in German landfill sites. Although Scotland has met some landfill targets a year early, levels of recycling in some areas of Scotland remain unacceptably low. According to SEPA, Scotland recycled or composted only 34.25 per cent of its municipal waste in 2008-09. The target is to recycle or compost 40 per cent of municipal waste by 2010, but the rate in some local authority areas is as low as 18.5 per cent. Although the upward trend in recycling rates is welcome, organisations such as SEPA and the FSB continue to believe that a lack of suitable infrastructure and facilities is having an impact on that trend.</p><p>According to a report in 2007 by Audit Scotland, there is no guarantee that Scotland is on track to meet its 2013 landfill directive targets. Only 26 per cent of all councils are confident that they will meet those objectives. The process will be made harder by the removal of &#163;26 million from the zero waste fund, which is especially worrying from the point of view of fines. Audit Scotland's 2007 report concluded that three councils&#8212;Aberdeenshire, Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway, which Elaine Murray mentioned&#8212;had been penalised for exceeding their landfill allowances. The fines that were imposed were recognised to be relatively small at the time, but the report went on to say that future penalties would be more <place-holder colnum=\"26089\"/> severe and could pose a risk to many councils. Information from SEPA suggests that as the Scottish Government has allocated annual landfill allowances to each Scottish local authority until the 2009-10 financial year, it remains unclear where local authorities stand.</p><p>In October 2008, Richard Lochhead indicated that fines that were associated with the landfill allowance scheme had been temporarily suspended because COSLA and the Scottish Government had entered into discussions to determine how best to ensure that waste management targets would be achieved in the longer term, but in an answer to a parliamentary question in 2007 he stated that if the UK failed to meet landfill directive targets in 2010, 2013 and 2020, the regulations provided for supplementary penalties for those authorities that exceeded their allowances. However, in the zero waste plan consultation, it was revealed that the landfill allowance scheme has been suspended in principle until May 2011, which is quite an interesting date, and I fear that we might be building up problems for the future.</p><p>Also worrying is the issue of targets, to which Robin Harper alluded. The Audit Scotland report identified that many councils might have difficulties in meeting their 2013 landfill directive targets and, according to an Audit Scotland survey, only 26 per cent of local authorities were confident or very confident of meeting their 2013 objectives, while 74 per cent were either unsure or not very confident, and 23 per cent were not confident at all. As the report said, with the combination of tight timescales and the volume of waste that current schemes can treat, Scotland will not be able to treat enough residual waste to meet our 2013 landfill directive targets.</p><p>There is much work to be done. In its fourth year of power, the Government disappoints us by not having made quicker progress on waste. The Liberal Democrat amendment highlights the threat of fines if we do not meet our landfill directive targets, and I fear that the Government will try to pass responsibility for those fines to local authorities.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766193", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Zero Waste Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It goes without saying that I welcome the chance to sum up the debate.

Our report highlighted the need for Scotland as a region to benchmark its performance against the EU 2020 targets and stressed the importance of working with the UK Government in relation to its European economic strategies and policies&#8212;policies that, I am sure, will all be recognised as coming from the Lib Dem manifesto.</p><p>The new work programme rightly highlights the importance of exiting the economic crisis. Finance and banking are at the top of the agenda; legislators have to agree on tackling those areas before the summer. That is, of course, of great importance to Scotland not only as a home for banks but in terms of our businesses, which require much better access to finance. I am sure that we are in good hands with Vince Cable.</p><p>Both the committee report and the work programme rightly highlight the importance of small businesses to Scotland. In his evidence to <place-holder colnum=\"26049\"/> the committee, John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, stated the importance of support for SMEs. However, unlike other devolved Governments in the UK, the Scottish Government still does not have in place JEREMIE&#8212;joint European resources for micro to medium enterprises initiative&#8212;funding. As paragraph 48 of the committee's report clearly points out, the Scottish Government is not considering a transitional rate relief scheme for our small businesses, which need to be looked after better if they are to be competitive in Europe.</p><p>The motion mentions the need for reform of the common fisheries policy and the CAP&#8212;I declare a farming interest in that regard. I remind members of the importance of agriculture, food production and the CAP to Scotland. Fiona Hyslop mentioned that in her speech. Organisations such as RSPB Scotland and the Royal Society of Edinburgh have highlighted the importance of those areas in evidence to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, including at its meeting this morning, and other organisations have also done so in their evidence to the European and External Relations Committee. I remind the chamber that the EU consultation on a future CAP is open. It is perhaps no surprise that the CAP budget is a large percentage of the EU budget, given that the common market was basically set up to address food security issues. The CAP is one of the few fully funded EU policies.</p><p>The work programme rightly states that there will be a focus on climate change. Thanks to the Lib Dems standing up for strong reduction targets, Scotland is leading the way in that respect. Of course, implementation is much more important than any target setting; after all, targets need to be attained. There is no room for complacency.</p><p>I welcome the work programme's focus on cross-border criminal activity. Agreements are in place between forces across some of the EU, but there remain too many loopholes, allowing organised crime to thrive.</p><p>Scotland has opportunities with green energy. I am thinking of the focus on interconnections and so-called smart grids. It is up to us to ensure that we can exploit the strong potential of new energies such as tidal.</p><p>A digital agenda for the EU is sorely needed in many rural areas of Scotland, which suffer from slow internet connections. We are, in effect, a digitally divided country.</p><p>Scotland is in a prime position to benefit from the EU plan for research and innovation, given our first-rate higher and further education institutions. The committee's report recognises the view that many more of our communities&#8212;and people in the <place-holder colnum=\"26050\"/> voluntary and business sectors in particular&#8212;need to be engaged in EU processes. The Government therefore has a duty to be inclusive in its involvement and in its implementation of any strategies.</p><p>I welcome the work programme.

Newton St Boswells mart in the Borders will face an increase of 140 per cent in rates, meaning that more than &#163;44,000 extra must be found this year. Craig Wilson's mart in Ayr faces a 38 per cent increase, equal to an extra &#163;17,000. For a hotel in Irvine, the increase is &#163;31,000; for a hotel in Troon, it is &#163;33,000; for a pub in Longniddry, it is &#163;17,000; for a pub in Dumfries, it is &#163;16,000; and for the New Lanark Mill hotel, it is nearly &#163;10,000. The position applies not just to auction marts and hotels, but to every kind of business. Two high street shops in Ayr face an increase of &#163;6,000 in rates each year, and such rises are unbearable for very small businesses.</p><p>I have the details of well over 50 businesses whose owners are worried. Many of them cannot absorb the cost of increased rates. The owner of a medium-sized hotel in Galloway says that he will have to find &#163;400 of cuts per month to pay for the rise. He says that he will try to appeal, but he has been told that it is unlikely that he will be successful. He has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I will have to look at redundancies ... I will now be less likely to invest in my business\".</p><p>That is not a good prospect if we want a flourishing economy.

Did they know about the rate rise? No&#8212;because there was no consultation.</p><p>The Tories should wake up to what is happening in the Ayr constituency that they hold&#8212;for now. The two high street shops there that I mentioned earlier will have to find an extra &#163;500 a month, and their owners found out about the rise only by word of mouth.

We should be immensely proud that it exists, and it is perhaps an indication of the enthusiasm of cadets, schools, parents and others that we celebrate the movement's 150th anniversary this year. I also send my congratulations to the movement.</p><p>As the motion states, the cadet forces provide young people with leadership and other skills that will doubtless benefit them in years to come. When we speak to young cadets, it is obvious that, apart from any practical skills that they learn, they gain a huge amount of confidence, a great deal of comradeship and a sense of belonging and working together as part of a close-knit cadet team&#8212;apparently, that was demonstrated during the cadets' visit to the Parliament today, which unfortunately I was unable to attend due to parliamentary business. Those soft skills can be translated into later life.</p><p>My eldest son benefited from the air cadets in his early teenage years&#8212;I know that I look far too young to have a kid that old, but there we go&#8212;so I know the value that is attached to such groups for young people. The cadet forces cut across all boundaries: race, gender, age, colour and creed. For that reason alone, they are an ideal vehicle for giving our young people a balanced view of the world. It is true that the life of a cadet is filled with adventure and new experiences&#8212;Stuart McMillan mentioned some of those&#8212;but cadet forces are underpinned by a firm set of principles: equality, fairness, teamwork and public spirit. Those are all qualities that we want to instil in our young people.</p><p>Not only that, the cadet forces keep alive the memory of our armed forces personnel who fought in the past and who are currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example. The cadet forces are a link between the armed forces and our young people. They maintain the memory of the bravery that our servicemen and women have shown over the years. On a dangerously solemn note, I propose that the cadet forces are a tribute to that bravery and a continuation of the memory of every one of those servicemen and women.</p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak, because the cadet forces resonate with many in East Lothian constituency, which is in my South of Scotland region. As Elizabeth Smith mentioned, the uncertainty over the future of Knox academy Combined Cadet Force has been a prominent <place-holder colnum=\"24934\"/> issue for many months. Knox academy has been fortunate to benefit from a cadet force for many years, and indeed has just celebrated its centenary. It is the only state school in Scotland with its own cadet force, which brings me back to my earlier comments about crossing social boundaries. Unfortunately, in recent times, the future of that cadet force has been unclear. Indeed, the MOD now intends to remove funding as of 1 April.</p><p>It is difficult to know the precise cause of the problems in that situation, but I ask the local authority, the school staff and the MOD to work together to come to some sort of reasonable conclusion that will not leave the young people without a cadet force. Everything must be done to reach a solution. Local campaigners&#8212;including my colleague, the Haddington provost Councillor Sheena Richardson&#8212;have been working hard to come up with alternative ideas. There have even been discussions about a community-based cadet force, for example, or even going into collaboration with a private school&#8212;in fact, Loretto, which Elizabeth Smith mentioned. No matter which route is taken, buy-in from all stakeholders will be essential.</p><p>It is incumbent on us to ensure that our young people are given the valuable opportunities that cadet forces afford them.

The past few decades have seen tremendous growth in the industry and I believe that it has the potential for a long and prosperous future. Scotland produces about 90 per cent of the UK's farmed fish and shellfish and receives about &#163;340 million per annum from aquaculture. In fact, aquaculture represents 50 per cent of the value of Scotland's food exports. We know that world consumption is set to increase, so we must ensure that Scotland is in a position to gain from that increased demand. We are in a strong position to do that because we have a good climate for aquaculture. As Maureen Watt said, aquaculture in Scotland is the cleanest and greenest in the world. That helps with the quality and health of the fish, which in turn <place-holder colnum=\"24403\"/> has helped us to become world renowned for high quality.</p><p>Freshwater trout represent a key industry for inland Scotland. I can think of many good examples of trout production in the South of Scotland, not just for normal consumption but for stocking sporting pools: leisure fishing is one of the most popular hobbies in the country. An example is the specialist Yarrow Fishery, which was nearly washed away during the floods in November but which, thankfully, was saved. The risk of flooding is a hazard for many a freshwater fish farm.</p><p>It is not just the Highlands and Islands, which Peter Peacock and Jamie McGrigor mentioned, in which aquaculture is important. As I said, it is also important in the South of Scotland, from the aptly named Musselburgh down to Eyemouth, and on the Ayrshire and Solway coasts in the west. Research has shown that 13,000 tonnes of oysters and 19,000 tonnes of mussels could be farmed on the Solway in the future. Work by local authorities, such as Scottish Borders Council, and the Scottish sustainable marine environment initiative has meant that councils have the expertise and are in a prime position to help the industry with planning and other matters. That was helped by the recent Lib Dem amendment to the Marine (Scotland) Bill, which stopped the Labour and Tory supported proposal to centralise such decisions. I know that John Scott will not agree, given his previous comments, but that proposal had the potential to throw the baby&#8212;or should I say the smolts?&#8212;out with the bath water.</p><p>When the minister sums up, I would be interested to hear what training initiatives the Government is funding in order to encourage growth in aquaculture, because we Liberal Democrats recognise that training is essential if Scotland is to retain its lead in fish farming. I hope that the minister is listening. Shellfish and salmon lead the way and dominate the aquaculture market in Scotland, so we need to focus on the development of skills in those sectors. The Scottish salmon brand is well known throughout the world. We need to develop and retain people for long-term careers in fish farming.</p><p>Both Jamie McGrigor and the minister mentioned containment. That is important. We do not want a repeat of the disasters that occurred when crayfish were released into Loch Ken and the Ettrick Water in the south of Scotland. I would also be interested to hear what the Scottish Government has to say about SEPA's charges in relation to fish farming, which are often cited to me as being high, onerous and a barrier to the growth and perhaps even the survival of fish farms.</p><p>As I said, aquaculture is important to my region and to Scotland as a whole. The Liberal <place-holder colnum=\"24404\"/> Democrats have recognised that for a long time. After all, it was back in 2003 when Ross Finnie launched the first strategic framework for Scottish aquaculture. There are opportunities for growth and some diversification in the industry, but we need to encourage new entrants through training programmes. I hope that the minister will discuss that when she sums up. I look forward to Scotland leading the way with the further growth of a healthy, wealthy fish farming industry.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20679574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is a long tradition of fish farming in Scotland.

That is why the Liberal Democrats are pushing to retain the CAP budget and we hope that the other parties will consider supporting our amendment.</p><p>It is not just the Liberal Democrats who consider continued support to be important; the fact has also been highlighted in the Pack report, in recent reports by the Scottish Agricultural College and the NFUS and, indeed, by the much-accredited and non-biased Royal Society of Edinburgh in its report on its inquiry into Scotland's hill and island areas. Moreover, all those reports noted the importance of less favoured area support schemes to the survival of rural communities throughout most of Scotland.</p><p>We have heard a lot about the New Zealand approach of providing no support, but we should also remember that, in that country, support is available for developing markets and all the farming debt was written off. Those facts are not so widely heard.</p><p>There is little doubt that, due to its historical nature, the existing CAP support system must be changed. I believe that we can work with the Macaulay land classification to a certain extent, but it must be reviewed and tweaked as the present classification itself might be slightly different from the reality on the ground.</p><p>Although Mr Pack's interim report is very welcome and represents a starter for discussion, I must say that I have several concerns. Like other members, I am a bit puzzled about why we are debating the subject before the consultation finishes on 5 March. I certainly recall being criticised by Tories and the Scottish National Party for seeking to debate the forestry sell-off while it was out to consultation, but there we are.<place-holder colnum=\"24091\"/></p><p>I find it questionable that a farmer on good-quality land should get paid more per hectare than a farmer with land on a high hill if both have exactly the same number of stock or are carrying out exactly the same activity on that land. Furthermore, how can we police minimum cultivations? How will such practices be balanced against someone who, for example, puts an expensive crop such as potatoes into the ground? The Liberal Democrats fear that such moves might encourage less activity, which, I am sure, is not the intended consequence of the CAP changes that Peter Peacock referred to. I must sound a note of caution: we do not want to fix the problem of the very few landlords who carry out next to no activity for their single farm payment by positively encouraging all land users to do the same.</p><p>As I say, we welcome the report as a starter for discussion but hope that it is not a starter for implementation. A learned farmer in Dumfries and Galloway has already reckoned that the area could lose &#163;30 million if implementation follows what is set out in the Pack report, so care must be taken on this matter.</p><p>It is argued that rebasing the payments by taking into account current or recent activity would be a good way of encouraging active farming, and would take away the problems of the current historical model. Perhaps a base area plus a top-up for livestock would be workable, and a good use of public money, and arable units would be freer to plant what suits the market and consumer. There must be certainty that actual work occurs on the farmed land, otherwise we might see landlords take back their land in hand to do minimal cultivation with contractors. That would not be good for communities and would be unhelpful in encouraging new entrants.</p><p>We must address as a matter of urgency the encouragement of new entrants to farming, which was not mentioned by many today. That has been left out of the system at the moment because of the high cost of buying single farm payment entitlement on top of all the other entry costs. I am a little concerned about all the money going to one area in particular, to support the lambs in the north west. A quarter of sheep have been lost in the past decade, so I hope that we can have a one-tier support system throughout Scotland and a level playing field for all. I fear that not to do so would divide rural communities, never mind the nation.</p><p>We have had a good debate. The subject is of the utmost importance, especially to Scotland as a whole. There will be change and some redistribution, as the cabinet secretary said. For the points that have been made today, we need to do a lot more work; whatever the results, any changes should be phased in if possible, as was done after the review south of the border a few <place-holder colnum=\"24092\"/> years ago.

In addition, section 27 of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 requires SEPA to identify other measures.</p><p>Nevertheless, the measures are simply tools for achieving plan objectives. We believe that the plan should set out what is going to be done and who is responsible for doing it. The Liberal Democrats' position is, therefore, consistent with the foregoing acts, which provide a clear, simple and flexible outline as to what marine plans should contain as a minimum.</p><p>Members will have received hundreds of e-mails on the bill from their constituents, particularly regarding the protection of seals and the enhancement of our Scottish seas. The key for the future of our seas is to have not only protection and conservation, but measures that will develop that natural resource in a sensible way.</p><p>The bill has given us an opportunity to strengthen the legal position by placing a duty on Scottish ministers and all relevant public authorities to act in the best way to protect and enhance the health of the Scottish marine area.

I pay tribute to the local action groups and campaigners who have eloquently expressed the need to retain their hospitals.</p><p>I welcome the news that the cabinet secretary will meet Kirkcudbright action group members, but I believe that she should visit each of the communities that will be affected to speak to key people at first hand. I have invited her to Langholm and extend an invitation for her to meet action groups in Lochmaben, Moffat and Thornhill.</p><p>I have met patients, relatives and staff over the past few months. It is clear that community hospitals provide a vital link between the patient, the relative and a truly local, high-quality health service of which these communities are rightly very proud. However, I want to make it clear from the outset that this is not about misguided, emotional attachment to an out-of-date arm of the national health service; it is about the real prospect of losing invaluable, well-used, high-quality, face-to-face human care that many fear will simply not be replicated in the home.</p><p>Elderly and palliative care is second to none in these hospitals: it provides comfort not only to patients at the end of their lives but to the relatives. The hospitals also provide other primary services. As a general practitioner-led service <place-holder colnum=\"22930\"/> attached to the local health centre, Kirkcudbright hospital treats patients of all ages. Provision includes physiotherapy, chest and limb X-rays, podiatry, palliative care, surgical pre-assessments, blood transfusions and rehabilitation. It has a minor injuries casualty unit and is very well equipped to deliver all those services. Crucially, the medical centre with GPs, nurses and community care staff is in the same building, which provides a direct link between staff and patients to ensure good co-ordination of all aspects of patient care.</p><p>Kirkcudbright is a good example of how community hospitals can be used for other services to maximise staff skills and to create a one-stop shop with multiple uses. I welcome the health board's wish to invest in the area but I would urge the health board, instead of building new facilities at the expense of other buildings, to rethink its plans and to think hard about reinvesting in the existing community hospitals. With some creative thinking, can these hospitals not become multifunctioning centres of excellence in each community, with integrated services to serve the whole population?</p><p>The health board talks about a dwindling workforce, but having high-quality, multiple-provision hospitals on one's doorstep is exactly one reason to stay and work in one's community as a health professional. Yes, people will retire, but let us give those entering the NHS a chance to work in their own communities. For example, could the health board not work with the local college to ensure a safer supply of staff? Let us not remove local employment opportunities.</p><p>These hospitals are crucial in ensuring that people get access to health care. If they are removed, there will be consequences for visiting relatives who cannot get to their loved ones because of lack of public transport. The logistics mean that visiting will just not be feasible for someone who does not have access to a car. That, together with a proposed cut in south west of Scotland transport partnership funding of &#163;230,000, does not bode well for relatives who want to visit, which could have knock-on consequences for patient recovery.</p><p>Funding for the new builds is unclear. The health board has not secured the finance for the new builds that would replace the five hospitals, and it will have to make a business case to ministers. I cannot see how such a long-term project can be planned on the basis of bidding for money at different stages. If any part-funding bid fails, will we end up with a mix of services that ultimately costs more money because it is neither one thing nor the other? Will there be a loss of service provision in the transition from one state to the next? Those are all questions that constituents <place-holder colnum=\"22931\"/> have asked me but which I cannot answer&#8212;I share their concerns. I wish to be clear that I and others welcome the health board's wish to invest in services but that money could surely be invested in existing buildings to maximise their potential.</p><p>On community care, there is no 100 per cent assurance that the local authority has the resources to cope with elderly care services that are transferred to it as a result of closures. How would the funding work for that part of the proposals, and can we be given a guarantee that elderly patients would receive the same quality of care in their home as in the community hospitals? There is no guarantee that a private sector provider could fulfil the staff requirements to take care of elderly people in the home.</p><p>I am glad that the NHS has reacted to my request to extend the on-going consultation, but I urge NHS officials to overhaul their plans radically and think creatively about investment in existing facilities. I ask the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and the Minister for Public Health and Sport to come to these communities to meet key local people and to consider the bigger picture before reaching any decision&#8212;the social impact on patients and relatives, the employment opportunities that community hospitals provide to local people and the need for and benefits of investment in these facilities, rather than a blanket closure approach.</p><p>The cabinet secretary gave geography as one reason to save the Monklands and Ayr accident and emergency wards. I ask her to consider carefully the expansive geography of Dumfries and Galloway. On Ayr and Monklands, the cabinet secretary stated at the time:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the ... boards did not in my view give sufficient weight to the concerns expressed by local people\".</p><p>People in Dumfries and Galloway are concerned.

In that respect, Lesmahagow's Jubilee hall is no different from any other community hall in the rural parts of Scotland. It provides accommodation for many activities, such as parent-and-child activities, dance, badminton, keep fit and even functions, including, I am glad to hear, wedding functions. Unfortunately, my invitation to Aileen Campbell's wedding seemed to get lost in the post&#8212;I have complained to her about that before. Although I did not make it to her wedding, I am glad that she used a local hall for the reception.<place-holder colnum=\"22858\"/></p><p>In addition, any community hall is the perfect place for drama to develop. Many of our finest actors and actresses have cut their teeth in local halls, and I am sure that we would all agree that many of our fellow MSPs show an amazing wealth of dramatic prowess, which in some cases might be due to participation in amateur dramatics in a local hall at an earlier stage of their lives.</p><p>Like Aileen Campbell, who has been extremely active with the Jubilee hall, in particular, I have a long history of supporting local halls. I was the secretary of Yarrow hall for around seven years. However, since 2007, there has been a question about how hall funding can continue. Back in the autumn of 2007, in answer to my question, Richard Lochhead, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, stated that funding would be available through the Scotland rural development fund and European LEADER funding, which is welcome and useful in many communities. However, as we know, such funds are limited and not easy to access, and there is great competition for them.</p><p>Access to funding is the key. It is well known that, under the single outcome agreement, it is the responsibility of local authorities to decide whether to keep open various facilities.

The debate has been interesting and mostly consensual. At some stages, it has been surprising, with George Foulkes praising the two SNP ministers, although I am not too sure how much his tongue was in his cheek. We also had Christopher Harvie's usual romanticism, which takes us to better places. He mentioned the novel \"Lanark\" and Robin Harper and Karen Gillon mentioned New Lanark, where Robert Owen did great work on the working environment. He did that not only in New Lanark, but across the water in America.</p><p>Forestry is close to my heart, not only because I am a former Borders Forest Trust trustee and director and a Forestry Commission Scotland regional forestry forum member, but because I led the successful campaign against the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"21141\"/> Government's unpopular plan to sell off a quarter of Forestry Commission land, which was, thankfully, defeated. I shall refrain from using this opportunity to remind the Government of that debacle. Now that the future of Scotland's forest is assured, we must investigate the advantages of having a dedicated national land use strategy, which the Liberal Democrats have called for on several occasions. That would allow management practices for all land&#8212;not just forests&#8212;in Scotland to be examined and could lead to substantial improvements across the board.</p><p>Although the Scottish Government is undertaking a study of land use in rural areas, it is arguable that now is the time to focus on a wider-reaching land use policy, with intent to act. Robin Harper was correct that farmers should be involved in a wider strategy. Our proposed strategy would implement a holistic approach to integrated land use and would deliver multiple public benefits. As part of a dedicated land use strategy and a central Scotland green network, it would be important to ensure that Scotland's forests continued to offer a wide range of economic, social and environmental opportunities, thereby promoting access and biodiversity and securing a sustainable supply of wood from our forestry sector. The national forest estate can offer far more in public hands than it can in private ones. Furthermore, by choosing to introduce joint venture proposals rather than the leasing proposals, it is likely that the Government will make more money to tackle climate change.</p><p>The central Scotland green network strategy covers land from Ayrshire to East Lothian, parts of which, bizarrely, are in the South of Scotland region. The strategy is highly commendable and underlines the importance of publicly or trust-owned community woodlands. It is also a reminder that an urban green space network, with the environmental, social and economic benefits that it brings, is possible with inventive thinking.</p><p>There are clear links between the environment, green space, and good health and wellbeing, all of which must be nurtured and encouraged as much as possible. In a Greenspace Scotland survey in 2007, almost 60 per cent of respondents strongly agreed that they can relax and unwind in their local green space, and 56 per cent strongly agreed that it is an attractive space that is safe for physical activity. Greenspace Scotland supports the concept of the central Scotland green network. Its other key findings include the following: that there is a clear positive relationship between green spaces and health, particularly for young and older people; that the value of green spaces for physical exercise is unquestionable; that, on mental health, there is compelling evidence for the restorative effects of green spaces; and that, on <place-holder colnum=\"21142\"/> social health, green spaces are some of the few remaining spaces that are available to all.</p><p>Walking and outdoor activities are growing in popularity in Scotland and have major benefits to individuals and the economy as a result of the development of outdoor business opportunities. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have long recognised the links between environment, activity and good health. We want to continue to improve access to Scotland's environment. There are forests throughout my area of the South of Scotland&#8212;Glentress in the Borders and the Galloway forest park are examples that spring to mind immediately. Those attractions are hugely important for the local economy and fulfil the objective of creating a healthy population. In Carrifran wildwood, the restoration of ancient woodlands inspires the imagination, and the Borders Forest Trust has recently acquired Corehead farm near the Devil's Beef Tub. That imaginative mix of land uses improves people's experience of visiting the area.</p><p>I am particularly interested in economic development through the green network. In the South of Scotland region, it is easy to see how many businesses and jobs are supported by our forests in one way or another. Often whole communities centre on forestry activity&#8212;for example, the village of Ae in Dumfriesshire was created for forestry workers in the Ae forest. The situation is different in urban areas in central Scotland and I do not expect new villages to sprout from the ground overnight, but there is no reason why that type of economic benefit cannot be replicated in the central belt.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20375795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Central Scotland Green Network"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to sum up for the Liberal Democrats.

It has been recognised that our fishermen have worked hard to develop and adhere to sustainable fishing methods. As we know, Scottish waters are some of the richest in Europe; in many parts of Scotland, fishing is the principal economic mainstay.</p><p>There has been a substantial decrease in the level of employment in Scotland's fishing industry due to restrictions on tonnage and on the catch that may be landed. Despite that, my area of the South of Scotland retains a significant interest in fisheries, particularly in Eyemouth and coastal Berwickshire, East Lothian and the south-west. Elaine Murray mentioned Annan, in her constituency. There are fishing interests on the Solway and on the Ayrshire coast. In the coastal waters of Berwickshire, vessels are reliant on nephrops, particularly langoustines. By value, that is the most economically important species that is caught by our fishing industry.</p><p>John Farquhar Munro mentioned the related industries, which include deshelling, processing and packaging. We must not forget them. They provide direct and indirect employment, and they are vital to retaining coastal communities.</p><p>As the Government's own inquiry states,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"current policies are failing to conserve fish stocks and sustain jobs for communities.\"</p><p>I am afraid that the same old problem exists: we need a workable balance between economic activity and profitability. The aim should be a sea fishing industry that is sustainable and profitable on a longer-term basis. The industry must be allowed to use quotas sensibly while meeting conservation commitments. It is a difficult balance, <place-holder colnum=\"20991\"/> but I repeat that our fishermen have made good strides in that regard.</p><p>Scottish fishermen have made a huge contribution regarding cod stocks through the cod recovery plan, as the cabinet secretary mentioned in his speech. It is clear that cod stocks are heading in the right direction, thanks to the significant efforts of our fleet. However, the Europe Commission has announced a significant reduction in total allowable catches, which will surely lead to increased discards and to draconian constraints on the industry, as Sarah Boyack mentioned. Simply applying large cuts is not the answer when it comes to promoting a healthy, mixed fishery. Part of any solution will surely involve sensible total catches, combined with other changes such as changes to fishing methods and net sizes&#8212;as mentioned by Liam McArthur&#8212;which we hope will reduce the volume of discards and prevent the catching of juvenile fish, spawning fish and non-target species.</p><p>Any such measures must be applied fairly. I will use an example that Liam McArthur has raised in relation to complying with rules on mesh sizes. Nets must of course comply, but new electronic measuring devices are failing nets that previously would have passed when the old devices were used. Few fishermen will be able to replace nets to comply with the electronic devices. That is an example of where Governments need to work in tandem with the industry to help, rather than simply to impose strict rules.</p><p>We welcome the interim findings of the Government's \"Inquiry into Future Fisheries Management\", which were released in September. The report recognised the point about greater regional control of fisheries policy&#8212;an approach that Liberal Democrats have long advocated&#8212;and highlighted some widespread concerns surrounding the current embodiment of the common fisheries policy, but it stopped well short of calling for its abolition. Withdrawal from the CFP is not an option and never was; the SNP must build on what was achieved under Ross Finnie's stewardship.</p><p>Liberal Democrats have long argued for more regional management of our fisheries, and our past involvement in setting up influential regional advisory councils under Ross Finnie was an integral part of that process. When he sums up, perhaps the cabinet secretary will state that he agrees that the regional advisory councils are of great importance.</p><p>We have consistently argued for further reform of the common fisheries policy. I note that Alex Salmond's Government has given up on its unachievable stance of exiting the common fisheries policy&#8212;a grandstanding stance if ever there was one. I understand that it was a <place-holder colnum=\"20992\"/> manifesto pledge. It would be interesting to see whether it has indeed been dropped. We want to give local fishermen and other stakeholders a better say in the management of their regional matters, not talk ourselves out of influence. The SNP's 2007 manifesto stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The SNP will continue to work for withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy.\"</p><p>That stance has changed.</p><p>Greater levels of regional control would be beneficial to Scotland's fishing industry. The Liberal Democrats have repeatedly called for an increased local emphasis, which has been echoed by the European fisheries commissioner, Joe Borg.</p><p>Regional advisory councils, the upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy, discards and the Scottish Government's inquiry into future fisheries management are all significant matters for Scotland's skippers, but although those issues are important, fishermen throughout the country will agree that the most pressing concern is the upcoming quota negotiations. Scottish ministers must accept that and work urgently and constructively with all involved to secure the best possible outcome for the Scottish fleet. As the much quoted Bertie Armstrong has said, we are engaged in a fight for this industry that must be won if we are to harvest the benefits in the future.</p><p>Members of the fishing industry will have their eyes on Mr Lochhead in the upcoming talks. Let us hope that he gains constructive results and does not, as he has in the past, indulge in grandstanding on unobtainable issues or, as the National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations stated, use the talks to pursue a separatist agenda&#8212;I was disappointed to hear him refer in his opening speech to the devolution settlement as a problem.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a good debate, mostly.

As Liam McArthur and John Farquhar Munro have stated, the Liberal Democrats broadly welcome <place-holder colnum=\"20654\"/> the bill, which must of course complement the UK legislation, complex though that process may be. However, I regret the time that it has taken for the proposals to reach this stage.</p><p>The debate has highlighted our marine and coastal environment, which contains many special, and some unique, landscapes of national and international renown. Our distinctive habitats, sea lochs and maerl beds are synonymous with Scotland. Scottish waters are among the most diverse in the world, given that they support some 8,000 complex and more than 36,000 single-cell species and animals. The two examples that always come to my mind are the basking shark and the leather-back turtle. The latter species is threatened by our humble plastic bag, which it confuses for its jellyfish prey.</p><p>As a South of Scotland MSP, like the Deputy Presiding Officer, I represent a region that contains a large part of the Scottish coastline. The mild Solway and Ayrshire coasts on the west and the East Lothian and Berwickshire coasts on the east are estimated to include&#8212;depending on how one measures such things&#8212;more than 600km of coastline. The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's stage 1 report highlights the need to consider the Solway Firth as a single marine area, as recommended by the Solway Firth Partnership. Like Elaine Murray and John Scott, I agree with that proposal. I look to the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment to work with the Westminster Administration to draw up an agreed strategy, as hinted at in the Government's response to the committee's report and in the cabinet secretary's opening speech today.</p><p>As well as helping biodiversity within our seas, the coastline provides important economic benefits in supporting communities through activities such as fishing, aquaculture and tourism. Fishing provides 16,000 jobs. Aquaculture generates a landing value of some &#163;300 million from Scottish boats and a farm-gate value of &#163;340 million. Indeed, Scotland produces about 90 per cent of the UK's farmed fish and shellfish. The opportunity for renewable energy from tidal and wave power is also huge and, as yet, untapped. Fishing is not only a vital industry for my region, but lies at the heart of many coastal communities. As such, fishing must be a major consideration in any marine legislative proposal. Liberal Democrats have consistently fought for the rights of Scottish fishermen, as we recognise that a balance must be struck between considering our natural environment and allowing Scotland's world-renowned sustainable fishing industry to flourish.</p><p>In addition, visitors to Historic Scotland's staffed coastal and island properties generate some &#163;2.5 million of income per annum. Recreational diving opportunities attract many thousands each year to <place-holder colnum=\"20655\"/> places such as St Abb's Head in Eyemouth&#8212;with its flora and shipwrecks, including a U-boat&#8212;and have given opportunities to companies such as Marine Quest, which was set up following fishing-boat decommissioning. Offshore British oil and British gas support 164,000 jobs. There is cross-party agreement that Scotland's seas should be managed in a coherent way that addresses social, economic and environmental factors.</p><p>Some key issues need to be addressed through the bill. Scotland will now have responsibility for planning and conservation measures out to a distance of 200 nautical miles&#8212;as was originally suggested by Scottish Lib Dems&#8212;so an integrated system of marine spatial planning is needed. Crucially, those measures will build on current powers over sea fisheries and offshore renewable energy. Therefore, the Scottish Government must continue positive dialogue with UK ministers to achieve those benefits. Without a streamlined framework for coastal zone management, there has been increasing evidence of environmental degradation. A more integrated approach would reduce uncertainty and bring real benefits to all marine and coastal users. It is vital, therefore, that the Westminster and Holyrood bills complement each other.</p><p>It is also vital to note that many of the bill's proposals were recommended by the advisory group on marine and coastal strategy, which is the task force that was established in 2005 under the chair of the Lib Dem minister, Ross Finnie. The AGMACS report of 2007 appears to have formed the cornerstone of the Government's proposals&#8212;as is the case with many of the SNP Government's recent achievements.</p><p>Given that the previous debate&#8212;on the marine bill consultation&#8212;highlighted the issue of licensing arrangements, I hope that the cabinet secretary can assure us that the licensing arrangements will be aligned with the measures to protect the marine environment that will be introduced under the UK's Marine and Coastal Access Bill. There are concerns that British gas and British oil have already been removed from the remit of the marine management organisation that will be established under that bill. There is also no guarantee that the MMO will have responsibility over carbon capture and storage. That suggests that the protection of the marine environment is not being sufficiently considered. Can the cabinet secretary confirm whether Marine Scotland will play a part in that?</p><p>Licensing for offshore storage of natural gas and carbon dioxide needs to take full account of environmental risks and should integrate with future provisions for managing and protecting the marine environment. We should ensure that consultation with stakeholders takes place before <place-holder colnum=\"20656\"/> licences are granted for the importation and storage of combustible gas and carbon dioxide. I ask the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment or the Minister for Environment&#8212;whichever of them winds up the debate&#8212;to provide assurances that that is being considered.</p><p>Around 50 per cent of respondents to the consultation believed that Marine Scotland should be established as a statutory body at arm's length from the Government, whereas the other 50 per cent believed that it should remain a Government body. Can ministers clarify, therefore, why they took the decision that they took? What measures will be taken to ensure the independence of any scientific advice?</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20275168", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the chance to sum up this debate on the important subject of the Marine (Scotland) Bill.

It is therefore wise to remember that investment in insulation and heat loss prevention makes good budgetary sense.</p><p>Efficiency maximisation is correctly highlighted in the report. The need for decentralisation of energy is key. The loss of electricity in power cables the further that they travel, due to Ohm's law, suggests that in future local energy production will be helpful in the context of efficiency, as well as helping local economies.</p><p>Biomass cogeneration plants, or district heating plants, are a particular hobby-horse of mine. Such plants produce heat and electricity for communities and should be promoted. European examples in Austria and Scandinavia are worth exploring and demonstrate that Scotland is playing catch-up. We are not leading in the field. Biomass is a good use for the vast acres of forestry in Scotland, which are still in our ownership&#8212;I am thankful for that.</p><p>Biomass and other methods of renewable energy can go a long way towards addressing Scotland's energy efficiency needs. The committee is still waiting for the Government to <place-holder colnum=\"20090\"/> publish its energy efficiency action plan and to launch its home insulation scheme. Both initiatives were negotiated during last year's budget discussions, but there has been a resounding silence since then. Perhaps when the Government announces those plans it will also announce access to the fossil fuel levy account. The First Minister boasted that that would happen during the first 100 days of Government, but it has still not happened, although the Government is in its third year of office. Perhaps the issue is still in the First Minister's in-tray.</p><p>A controversial issue for some committee members is that the report does not recommend a new wave of nuclear power stations. I support the approach. Conservative and Labour members support new nuclear power stations, as does the First Minister's Council of Economic Advisers, so the Liberal Democrats are the only main party to oppose new nuclear capacity. Apart from the obvious danger and sustainability issues that are associated with nuclear power, we think that there should be further investment in renewable energy production, so that we can meet the Liberal Democrat target of 100 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2050.</p><p>There is a need for clarity in the planning process. A balance must be struck between communities' wishes and needs, so that renewables projects have as their aim public and social goods and are not simply business opportunities for developers.

My youngest child, Julia, was given a blood change as a newborn baby, which undeniably saved her life. Her blood, like mine, is rhesus positive, whereas my wife's blood is rhesus negative. As a result, there was a large build-up of antibodies in my daughter's blood. My wife had to be induced a month early and the antibodies had to be flushed out with donor blood. That was nearly 16 years ago, and the doctor said that it was the first time that the procedure had been carried out in the Borders.</p><p>Since then, I have given blood. I am proud to say that my blood is like my attitude to life&#8212;B positive. That will not come as a surprise to members. I cannot quite match Thomas Bradley's record on blood donation, although like him I have a motorbike, which I will use to get home tonight. I hope that I will never need a blood transfusion myself&#8212;touch wood.</p><p>I know from my own experience, from the experience of friends and family who have received transfusions and from listening to the fantastic appeals of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service that giving blood is vital. I give blood as often as possible. It is always worth taking an hour out of one's day to give blood, <place-holder colnum=\"20062\"/> whether we do it at our local hospital or through the mobile service that travels around Scotland.</p><p>I hope that employers will be proactive in allowing staff time off to donate blood, as the motion calls for, because I am sure that some people do not give blood simply because they cannot find the time to do so. The ability to take an hour off from work would encourage people to give blood, and the mobile service makes it easier than it has ever been to do so, because it tries to fit in with people's busy lives.</p><p>We have all received the e-mails that come through the Parliament's system when the mobile donation service is in Holyrood park. Such e-mails are an excellent way of reminding people to give blood if they can. I hope that other employers can do that. If there is more flexibility for staff to give blood in work hours, blood stores should increase, which is much needed. I always remind my staff that they are free to take time out to donate blood, and they do so. It is sensible that employers everywhere should play a big role in helping the SNBTS. They might need blood or a blood product one day.</p><p>I congratulate the SNBTS on the campaign that it launched last year, which I understand has recruited an extra 10,000 donors. The campaign will continue and I hope that through advertising and other ways of reaching the public the service will go on to recruit another 10,000 people. New donors are needed. As the motion says, there are 30,000 fewer donors than there were a decade ago, which is a problem not just in the Highlands but in the south of Scotland. Indeed, it is a problem throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>We should not exclude certain sectors of our society. Healthy gay men should not be excluded, given that testing of blood has progressed so much. I hope that the UK Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs will reconsider the position. I would be interested to hear the minister's view on that.</p><p>I offer the SNBTS whatever assistance I can give to its campaign in the South of Scotland region. It is not possible for everyone to give blood, but I assure the people who can that the experience is painless and they will even get a free cup of tea and a choccy biscuit.

It is vital to extend that work, and I whole-heartedly welcome the committee's research into who uses the petitions system, general public awareness and what can be done to extend that to all communities throughout Scotland to ensure that all demographic groups are represented. I believe that that work can be undertaken with local groups and organisations, including community councils, which play a huge role in communities.</p><p>People are often put off from coming to the Scottish Parliament to make a representation because it is somehow seen as a huge, inanimate <place-holder colnum=\"19868\"/> organisation. For the past two summers, I have conducted a tour of all the main rural shows in the South of Scotland, including some of the local festivals. When I embarked on this now yearly schedule, I was enthusiastic, but at the same time I had a feeling of the unknown. Would people be interested in learning about the Scottish Parliament, my work for the South of Scotland or, indeed, how they can lobby for policy changes? People are interested. They are out there, and it is our job to make ourselves available to them. That is why the Public Petitions Committee's work is so important.</p><p>Many members mentioned the use of technology to reach people. It is essential that we keep up with that. Tricia Marwick mentioned podcasts and other events, but we also heard about Twitter, Delicious, Digg, Facebook and Bebo. However, use of the technology must be targeted, and as the report states, the benefits should be established at the outset.</p><p>My view is that face-to-face contact is always the best way to engage with individuals, schools, local groups, community councils, voluntary groups and so on. It would be good to see the Public Petitions Committee conducting some kind of summer roadshow each year. I do not know whether time could be found for that, but my experiences as a fresh MSP have given me invaluable information about the people I represent and what they want from their MSPs. Most important, my tours have given my constituents a link to their MSP and broken down a perception of not quite knowing what the Scottish Parliament does.</p><p>We heard good contributions from Nigel Don, who was interested in the system of investigations and proposed speeding up the process by pairing up MSPs to scrutinise petitions, and Bill Butler, who sounded a note of caution and said that we must ensure that all petitions are properly scrutinised. I am sure that we will find a way to do that. I was interested to hear John Wilson say that he volunteered. I hope that there was no inference that the rest of the committee members were press-ganged into being on the committee. I am sure that that is not the case.</p><p>In closing, I reiterate that Scotland has a good, thorough and accessible public petitions system, but as the committee and the likes of Helen Eadie have said, improvements can always be made. We must always strive to ensure that all communities in Scotland are aware of the tool that is available to them and know that they, as individuals or groups, can hold the Parliament to account.</p><p>In turn, we as MSPs should acknowledge that we must never rest on our laurels.

Indeed, I congratulate all those who have participated in the work of the committee over the past 10 years. I welcome the opportunity that the debate gives to showcase how committees such as the Public Petitions Committee can help to make the Parliament more accessible and, in so doing, develop decision making for the benefit of Scotland as a whole.</p><p>I welcome the comprehensive inquiry report into the public petitions process. The report highlights many issues in setting out the committee's progress over the years and outlining ideas for future improvements, for example in accessibility and future methods of working. I refer to the ways in which we can better engage the youth of Scotland in their Parliament. It is, of course, correct that an inquiry should have been instigated, not because there was any doubt about the process but to endeavour to find better ways of working. Such an inquiry is, after all, the way in which to improve, scrutinise and progress the working of committees of the Parliament.</p><p>My Public Petitions Committee experience is limited to being a once-used substitute member in the first year of this session. Like other MSPs, I am well aware of the importance of petitions as a formalised way in which to access the Parliament and its decision-making processes. Accessibility is key&#8212;indeed, it should always be paramount&#8212;to the Parliament: there should be no ivory towers.</p><p>I speak in the debate as a former active lobbyist. Access to decision makers enabled me to inform <place-holder colnum=\"19851\"/> them of the consequences of their actions and those of Parliaments. I was also able to state what I believed could be changed for the better. That work made a huge difference. The ability to undertake it in Scotland is a huge benefit of our devolved Scotland. The difficulties in lobbying Westminster from Scotland when the decision-making process happens only there do not need to be spelled out. Such lobbying becomes the exclusive preserve of those who can afford the time and money to make trips down south.</p><p>The ability for people to gain access, be heard, and have their advice acted on is vital for the working of the democratic listening and acting Parliament to which we all aspire. The work of the Public Petitions Committee is a huge part of that.</p><p>Of course, there are several other ways of accessing the Parliament&#8212;for example, by directly contacting constituency MSPs, or the much busier regional MSPs, or through cross-party groups&#8212;but when there is a large public feeling of discontent about an issue, the Public Petitions Committee is an ideal, transparent and useful vehicle. If members doubt those words, they need only look at the statistics in the report. In its first 10 years of life, the committee has had an enormous number of petitions to consider&#8212;1,263, to be precise. That is more than one every three days, which is a colossal amount. As members have mentioned, in recent years the figure has increased by the use of e-petitions. Bruce Crawford indicated that the Scottish Parliament is world leading in that respect.</p><p>Many petitions have highlighted serious issues in communities and areas of Scotland, such as the danger of cheap alcohol, the need for building regulations to require the installation of thermostatic controls and the right of all members of the community to give blood, which John Farquhar Munro mentioned. There have been petitions on the management difficulties that will result from the proposed electronic identification of sheep and on the need to recognise the loss of life on the Lancastria&#8212;Britain's worst maritime disaster, with the loss of an estimated 4,000, perhaps 6,000, lives&#8212;during the war. I have even considered submitting my petition to keep Tesco local in Haddington, but perhaps I will send that to East Lothian Council. In every case that I have mentioned, the Public Petitions Committee highlighted the causes to which the petitions related. In the past decade, it has considered more than 126 petitions a year.</p><p>The report that the motion highlights shows that there is no sitting on laurels. I am pleased to note that the report recommends increasing the number of languages in which the committee prints its leaflets and proactively putting out literature in many more public places, which can only be <place-holder colnum=\"19852\"/> commendable. I look forward to seeing the soon-to-be-published \"How to submit a public petition\" in every public place possible. I am glad that, not satisfied with having led the way on e-petitions, the committee will consider using modern social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as videoconferencing. Used well, those will only improve the accessibility of Parliament and the petitions process. I confess to using Twitter and Facebook, but I admit that all of my kids are much more familiar with those media&#8212;a clue to why they must be considered as means of engaging with that generation.</p><p>I welcome the committee's report, which goes a long way towards bettering the workings and accessibility of the Parliament and its decision-making process. We can be proud of the committee's achievements, and I am glad that there is a hunger for improvement. I advise all MSPs and committees to read the report and some of the recommendations, so that we can consider better ways of working for the benefit of the Scottish people and the workings of the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20195663", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Petitions Process Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the Public Petitions Committee members and clerks on their hard work.

The debate highlights the importance of the south of Scotland and Whithorn in particular. The Isle of Whithorn and much of the Solway coast provide a real haven. There is much to see on the costa del Solway: we have the Wickerman festival, the book town of Wigtown, the artist town of Kirkcudbright, Logan botanic garden, Threave gardens, Port William&#8212;scene of most of my childhood holidays&#8212;and, of course, the many rural shows that I enjoy attending in summer. At one such show last year, we probably had the most southerly hustings for the Liberal Democrat party, when Tavish Scott, Mr Finnie and the rest of them came to Wigtown.</p><p>I hope that the debate will highlight the excellent work of the Whithorn Trust to keep alive the ancient memory of the fifth-century settlers who are believed to have been Scotland's first Christian community, and the work of St Ninian, the apostle of the southern Picts. As the motion <place-holder colnum=\"19654\"/> makes clear, the site is important in theological history. The most significant of the early Scottish saints was undoubtedly Ninian, a bishop who was born in about AD 350. During the years of the Roman empire's terminal decline, he was sent to Rome for religious instruction, his parents having adopted the faith through the influence of Roman soldiers. He returned to Whithorn to build his candida casa&#8212;the original white house&#8212;in AD 397.</p><p>As John Scott said, the story of Bishop Ninian does not appear in the historical record until 300 years later, in AD 731, in the writings of the Northumbrian monk Bede, which is perhaps why St Ninian is not as well known as St Columba. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Whithorn area was important for trade for a long time, perhaps even as far back as when the ice melted on its northern track. As most scholars know, little was written in the post-Roman period before the Venerable Bede's writings&#8212;the period is therefore called the dark ages&#8212;so the fact that little was written of Ninian is irrelevant to the saint's story, which is backed up by archaeological evidence.</p><p>Some people wonder why there was so much early activity in a remote part of south-west Scotland, but that is an attitude of people who are used to land transport in modern times. The sea was the ancient motorway and places such as Whithorn and Orkney were vital junctions on the network.</p><p>There is evidence of the importance of Whithorn from Ninian's time until the reformation, after which the pilgrimage to Whithorn and the area's importance went into decline. The economy and population declined and names that had been synonymous with the area moved to the new world of America, Canada and Australia. I hope that, in the year of homecoming, the motion and debate go some way to encourage people who have historical links with or an interest in Whithorn and the surrounding area&#8212;and Scotland as a whole&#8212;to make the pilgrimage back to the Isle of Whithorn.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193738", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Whithorn"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The historical and religious significance of Whithorn is immense, and I congratulate Alasdair Morgan on bringing the debate to the chamber on St Ninian's day.

Like him, I declare a farming interest. I have also been the environment director for the National Farmers Union, a trustee for Borders Forest Trust and an RSPB member. I, too, condemn any wildlife crime.</p><p>We are lucky in Scotland to have such a diverse range of bird species, ranging from our seabirds to our almost unique red grouse, dotterels and golden plovers of the higher ground. Such diversity is due to the unspoilt and, I believe, well-<place-holder colnum=\"19427\"/> managed farm land that we have in Scotland. On my own family farm, Sundhope hill farm in the Yarrow valley, we are lucky to have a decent black grouse lek, and we have farmed and entered projects with the likes of the Tweed Foundation, the RSPB, the Borders Forest Trust and the Southern Upland Partnership in order to encourage that lek to survive. As well as that, those projects have helped salmon in their spawning ground in the area. Many other birds have benefited, including a healthy population of curlew, which we call whaups in our area.</p><p>I have witnessed changes in bird behaviour in my lifetime. Oystercatchers and cormorants are now common inland, although they were once never far from the seashore. We must be aware of natural changes, too. Farming with the natural habitat in mind is important and it is being done well, but there are other factors involved.</p><p>The first of those is the impact of predators on bird numbers. I recognise that there is a division among bird enthusiasts as to the quantifiable risk that is associated with predation from birds such as corvids&#8212;magpies included&#8212;and perhaps some raptors. From my own experience, predation does have a significant impact on the population of birds. Jamie McGrigor's motion uses the key phrase of \"balanced biodiversity\", which reflects exactly how it should be. As such, some humane control can take place that can reduce the problem.</p><p>No one is talking about a mass cull of crows&#8212;a crow is too wise for that to be a threat anyway&#8212;but rather an attempt to balance the scales. I realise that this view will be unpopular with many people, but organisations such as Songbird Survival are right to welcome further research into the relationship between predator and prey species.</p><p>It is not just songbirds that are under threat. I have personally seen a change in crow predation, with even healthy lambs being mobbed. There is nothing worse than coming upon a lamb that has had its eyes, bottom and tongue pulled out while it was still alive&#8212;and I will never forget finding a lamb that had been preyed on while it was halfway out of its mother. I sound a note of caution about the release of predators, whether they are winged or four legged. They are at the top of the ecosystem triangle, and we should bear in mind their effect on the environment, including on songbirds.</p><p>There is no doubt that songbird population decline is inextricably linked with development. Perhaps local authorities could put conditions on planning applications to ensure that green spaces are left in which to accommodate wild birds. If the proposed quarry goes ahead at Overburns near Biggar, many tonnes of gravel will be extracted <place-holder colnum=\"19428\"/> from Clydeside. Such development would surely lead to a decline in songbirds. Although there would be reclamation after the quarrying had taken place, the damage would have been done and it would take years to rebuild the wildlife population. We need sympathetic planning that makes the most of the green spaces that we have.</p><p>I commend the RSPB and the Scottish Ornithologists Club, which, respectively, have helped with the volunteer and farmer alliance and the south-east Scotland bird atlas.

My premier thoughts are with them. Like Elaine Murray, I agree that Mr MacAskill should have thought to visit the people of Lockerbie to seek their views.</p><p>The Lockerbie incident is the most horrific to have happened in Scotland, with 270 innocent lives unjustly taken just a few days before Christmas. We have to be clear: the debate is not about Mr al-Megrahi's innocence&#8212;Miss Grahame <place-holder colnum=\"19058\"/> was mistaken in pursuing that argument&#8212;but about the events that led to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice's decision. The affair raises several concerns about that process, including Mr al-Megrahi's decision to choose to meet the Cabinet Secretary for Justice. The cabinet secretary met him&#8212;indeed, he said that he was \"duty bound\" to do so&#8212;but what precedent has he set in making the visit? Can all prisoners now claim their right to be visited in prison by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice? If so, he will be a busy man indeed, not least in replying to the mail that will be involved in such requests. How many such requests have been submitted thus far, cabinet secretary?</p><p>Like others, my concern extends to why the press were so well informed, not only about the visit but about the release date. Mr MacAskill has stated clearly that he was acting in a quasi-judicial manner. Like Robert Brown, I have never heard of a judge or jury&#8212;never mind a justice minister&#8212;meeting a convicted prisoner before they make a judicial decision and, having done so, briefing the press.</p><p>On 24 August, in response to a question from Brian Adam, Mr MacAskill said in this chamber:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Costs are not a factor that we take into account in the implementation of our justice system.\"</p><p>Earlier that day, he said in his statement that the advice from the deputy chief constable of Strathclyde Police was that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a minimum of 48 officers would have been required simply to allow Mr al-Megrahi to live in Scotland. I therefore ruled that out as an option.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-08-24.18991.3\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 24 August 2009; c 19010, 18995.]</citation></p><p>However, the same police force stated subsequently:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If a decision had been made to release Mr al-Megrahi in Scotland, we would have provided whatever security was required.\"</p><p>The cabinet secretary has said that that any suggestion that he did not consider seriously release into Scotland is \"ludicrous\". However, Strathclyde Police's statement raises doubts in that regard. Is it not ludicrous for 1,000 police officers to be deployed for one old firm game? After all, security for Mr al-Megrahi was required for only an estimated three months. A release into a Scottish hospice could have been imposed. Mr al-Megrahi's family could easily have visited him there and his release conditions could have been monitored. That decision would have shown true compassion and justice could have been monitored. How can Mr al-Megrahi's release condition of a monthly videoconference be controlled now that he is far out of the reach of our jurisdiction?</p><p>I turn to the medical advice, on which subject only time will tell. In pictures of Mr al-Megrahi, we <place-holder colnum=\"19059\"/> see him being treated. I wish no ill on anyone. Equally, no one should lose the most precious gift of life. As I said, time will tell; perhaps time will also judge.</p><p>It is regrettable that the appeal process was halted. Many questions could have been answered, including questions on Mr al-Megrahi's innocence and the matter of justice for victims if he was so found. In the Government summing up, I ask for a full assurance that the dropping of the appeal was no bargaining chip for release.</p><p>The decision that we are debating was for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to make. That said, he is responsible to the Parliament. The Liberal Democrat request for a recall of Parliament to debate the issue in advance of this unprecedented decision should have been granted. It was a mistake for that recall not to be made. On 24 August, I pressed Mr MacAskill to say whether he had supported our call for a debate.</p><p>Flurries of papers are now being published in an attempt to dam the flood of criticism. If the cabinet secretary had made the announcement on release to Parliament and answered questions, the Government would have avoided much of the criticism. I regret that the process of release has raised so many questions. As I said, yesterday saw the hurried publication of papers and letters. According to the interview that the First Minister gave to the BBC, all documents have been published, but we have not yet had sight of transcripts of the discussions between the Governments. I remain to be convinced that all the options on Mr al-Megrahi were fully explored. If that had been the case, we would be certain that, as our Parliament mace says, we had seen the use of wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173555", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi (Decision)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In terms of this case, we have heard much about compassion over the past month and, of course, today.

Indeed, in his summing up, the now removed Minister for Environment, Mike Russell, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We must take action\",</p><p>and he added:</p><p>\"Binding packaging reduction targets could be a way forward.\"&#8212;&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 11 June 2008; c 9586-9587.]</p><p>Twelve months on, we have yet to see such reductions.</p><p>However, excess packaging is not the only issue that we still have to address. When he sums up, I hope that the cabinet secretary will confirm that, by 2020, growth in municipal waste will be at, or below, 0 per cent. That was the claim made by the cabinet secretary in a statement in January 2008, which Elaine Murray mentioned. Will the cabinet <place-holder colnum=\"18398\"/> secretary also shed light on what his department is doing to create business and enterprise from recycling? Having tangible evidence of what is being done to create green jobs, particularly in the current recession, would be a good indicator of the Government's focus and its commitment to the issue.</p><p>Des McNulty mentioned a Labour-led council that is the worst local authority in Scotland for its recycling of municipal waste. However, I am sure that the council will be addressing that point as I speak.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat amendment highlights key areas and timings that should concern this Government. I sat on the Audit Committee when Audit Scotland's report on sustainable waste management was published. There is a serious risk, if we do not meet our 2013 targets, that we will suffer EU fines. The Audit Scotland report highlighted clearly that the risk was high and that the 2013 target would be the most difficult to meet. That view was shared by three quarters of our councils. Of course, there is ambiguity over who would pay the fines&#8212;the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Government, or local government&#8212;but I fear that the buck will be passed down the chain. Local authorities will end up paying, and therefore local people will end up paying.</p><p>The Government has been well warned that it must stay focused on the target; it must not keep on taking sums like &#163;26 million out of its own waste budget while advocating a zero waste Scotland.</p><p>Elaine Murray and Lewis Macdonald mentioned the Austrian delegation and yesterday's working lunch, which was organised by Marlyn Glen. Robin Harper and I were there, too. We can, of course, learn from other EU member states that are far in advance of where we are.</p><p>Audit Scotland reckoned that we would need to treble our spending on recycling in the lead-up to 2020. Increased recycling rates lead to increased costs per tonne on waste. John Scott said that the low-hanging fruit was the easiest to fetch, and Audit Scotland put some figures on such ideas. It reckoned that there would be a cost of &#163;120 per tonne to recycle at a rate of 30 per cent, but &#163;217 per tonne for a rate of 40 per cent. The previous Liberal Democrat Administration recognised that the strategic waste fund budget would have to treble between 2007 and 2020. That is a serious matter and I fear that the Government may not be allocating enough resources to it.</p><p>Audit Scotland also thought that it was difficult to see how the Government could meet its own targets and the EU legislation targets if we did not invest more. I hope that the Government is content <place-holder colnum=\"18399\"/> that local authorities will have the resources to meet the impending targets in 2013 for landfill reduction and recycling. If ministers want recycling rates to be increased and waste levels to be reduced, it is vital that local authorities have adequate funding to do that.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats, of course, have very good green credentials. As I said, we quadrupled recycling rates in five years in government. We also introduced bills on carrier bags, and there was my motion on excess packaging, which Liam McArthur mentioned. We remain committed to a Scotland that is economically sustainable; tackling economic growth without ensuring sustainability would lead to that growth declining. The two ideas go hand in hand.</p><p>The debate has highlighted concerns over the incineration of waste. Dunbar in East Lothian, in my own patch, has been mentioned by many members. We must consider the opportunities that anaerobic digestion can offer.</p><p>I was a little disappointed to hear Christopher Harvie criticising Galashiels and pointing out the negative parts of it. We must remember that Borders College leads the world in textiles expertise. I will not mention the hypocrisy of Christopher Harvie criticising bottled water when he had a bottle of water right in front of him.</p><p>I welcome any advance in Scotland's green credentials, but as I said, we cannot be complacent. The Government has real challenges to face if we are to meet our 2013 European targets, which have been set under the landfill directive. I therefore welcome our Liberal Democrat amendment, which highlights the challenges that we face and should send a clear message to the Government to stop cutting budgets to address waste management.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16658844", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Waste Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Liberal Democrats have long been associated with very good green credentials and my colleague Liam McArthur was quite right to highlight that Scotland improved its recycling rate from 7 to 25 per cent between 2001 and 2006, under the stewardship of a Liberal Democrat minister.

I congratulate Liam McArthur on securing this important debate at a time when we need action.</p><p>Sheep farming has a long history in Scotland. We have heard about the Highlands and Islands, <place-holder colnum=\"17897\"/> but the history is nowhere longer than in the south of Scotland, where famous flock names such as the Cheviots came from and where the expertise of husbandry grew. That expertise was taken to the Highlands and into Galloway when they had their clearances and it was exported around the world to New Zealand, where there are many Scots-named farms and farmers. Of course, our premium textile industry also grew up with the sheep industry&#8212;it is no coincidence that tweed is so named.</p><p>We now face new clearances. The Scottish Agricultural College, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the NFUS have all recently published figures showing an alarming decline in the sheep stock of Scotland, which directly correlates to the decline in active farming in the hills. We are losing sheep and working people from the hills. There are 25 per cent fewer sheep than there were 10 years ago and the figure is still falling, even with the recent, long-awaited rise in prices due to the falling value of the pound.</p><p>The last thing that we need is more unnecessary burdens. Unlike the Conservatives, I am not lying down to electronic ID. The recent pilot project that is referred to in Liam McArthur's motion found three things that we practitioners knew before&#8212;the expense of EID, the needless time taking of it and how poor it is for animal welfare. Various electronic readers and tags would need to be bought, and none of those costs would be paid by retail buyers&#8212;and I doubt whether they would be paid by the Government. They will all come out of the industry. That is fine when the money is there but disastrous when it is not.</p><p>It takes time to insert the tags properly&#8212;it is no easy job, especially on a cold, wet morning. Sheep do not normally keep their heads still. Think how impractical it is when a shepherd has 1,500 ewes and a similar amount of lambs to tag by himself or herself. In fact, the job is near impossible. There are neither the spare staff nor the time on farms to implement electronic sheep ID in any form. As Mr McArthur mentioned, our flocks are now larger and more numerous than those of most of our European neighbours. Sheep EID therefore acts as an additional pressure on farmers to decrease their sheep numbers, and the knock-on effect that that has on our rural communities and related industries can only be negative.</p><p>There are concerns about fines if the system fails. As Peter Peacock mentioned, cross-compliance is an undue pressure on hard-pressed communities. I have already mentioned animal welfare&#8212;necrosis in a sheep's ear is not a pretty sight. It is most unpleasant for the animal, which will be pestered by flies and mackit, although that is perhaps not a problem in the islands. There are <place-holder colnum=\"17898\"/> also impracticalities in relation to sheep that are affected with yellowsis, and torn ears in hedges.</p><p>Those issues are all important, but the main problem with sheep EID is that it is totally unnecessary. We have in place a system that works&#8212;if it ain't broke, why fix it? We should consider the madness that will ensue if the system is introduced: a hill sheep will have to be electronically tagged; it will go nowhere from the hills in its working life; and if it still has its microchip and that chip is still working, the chip will not be read until six years after tagging. It is far better that sheep are tagged only when they leave their holding, which is a practice that works and can be audited.</p><p>We desperately need a derogation now&#8212;our own Liberal Democrat minister succeeded in getting one in 2005, in relation to double tagging. It is now Mr Lochhead's responsibility to achieve what has been achieved before. Article 68, as proposed by the Government, would split the agricultural industry. Failure to achieve a derogation in relation to electronic sheep ID would decimate the sheep industry, which is one of Scotland's oldest industries.

However, I could not take part in the debate without talking a little bit about forestry and land use. First, the leasing proposal threatened the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. Those are not my words&#8212;they were the words of RSPB Scotland and the like. The proposal has been dropped after there was overpowering opposition to it, but the powers that will enable ministers to change the functions of forestry commissioners remain in section 47. I will lodge an amendment at a later stage if the Government does not address that issue.</p><p>Secondly, according to the then minister, we are now left with the prospect of a huge funding gap for climate change measures such as tree planting. The lease option was supposed to raise a one-off &#163;200 million. We were told by the minister that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"by dropping the leasing proposal, we face a short-term funding problem for woodland creation for up to five years.\"</p><p>However, Scottish rural development programme figures that were released last week&#8212;and with which Mr Lochhead agreed, just about 20 minutes ago&#8212;directly contradict that statement. We can now see that there is ample headroom for forestry under rural priorities funding. I hope that it was a miscalculation on the minister's part, rather than a misrepresentation. Clarification would be welcome.</p><p>We know that tree planting has a role to play in acting as a carbon sink, although there is still debate about how significant a role it can play. Tree planting has to be done in a balanced way, taking other land uses into consideration and not displacing existing and commercially viable activities. Tree planting can be only a part of the solution. There is no point in planting up hundreds of acres of land if nothing is done to address renewable energies or our energy consumption; and there is no point in planting without considering other land use and without considering soil types. Planting in peat-based soils releases a large amount of carbon, and it can take 30 years of tree growth to negate that release.</p><p>We need an integrated land use strategy that will take into account all types of land use&#8212;from commercial and agricultural, through to leisure and environmental. The recent forestry debates have highlighted the fact that forestry is a lot more than just wood production or a carbon sink.</p><p>My concern with the bill as it stands is the lack of detail on management of Scotland's land. The forestry sector has been acknowledged in the bill, but ministers have so far failed to provide direction for Scotland's major land user, which is agriculture&#8212;of course, I declare an interest in that respect. If the Scottish Government is determined to tackle climate change, it can ill afford to <place-holder colnum=\"17250\"/> mismanage one of our most important resources. We all await the results of the rural land use study towards the end of this year, but what will come of the study, and will the Government be in a position to formulate a proper strategy on its conclusion?</p><p>This bill is welcome. I hope that ministers will heed the committee's recommendations, and I also hope that a sensible land use strategy will be produced sooner rather than later.

Mike Russell even accused others of being theatrical. Such an attitude from a minister is shocking and, considering the potential impacts of leasing on Scotland and the scale of what was proposed, it was sheer arrogance to assume that the proposal could be pushed through Parliament by piggybacking on the simplistic idea that it would solve all our climate change problems.</p><p>Throughout the debate in January, Mr Russell accused the Liberal Democrat contribution and response to the consultation of being \"fact free\".

Those businesses have been in serious limbo since last November and, in January, 19 of the main wood processors sent the minister a letter stating exactly that. That limbo was due to the Government's mad proposal and to the Tories, who did not stand up against it initially and made their U-turn only after their Scottish National Party masters. Mike Russell ignored everyone, decried their expertise and passed them off as scaremongers who did not do their homework&#8212;what arrogance and ignorance.</p><p>Throughout the debate, references were made to the Stern report, but nowhere in that document did Lord Stern conclude that 100,000 hectares of Scotland's most commercially viable forests should be sold to the Rothschild banking group for a notional sum of up to &#163;200 million for 75 years. In that same debate, Mike Russell pronounced in prophetic fashion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Although leasing is not a new idea, I believe that its time has come.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-01-29.14496.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 29 January 2009; c 14497.]</citation></p><p>Its time had come&#8212;its time to be buried with all the SNP's other misguided flights of fancy.</p><p>Who would have thought that, within a month, Mr Russell would be removed from his minister's position, obviously for flogging that dead horse? I welcome the new minister's U-turn, even though Ms Cunningham had thought the leasing proposal a \"cunning plan\" in January. I am sincerely relieved that sense has prevailed: the decision has removed the guillotine of uncertainty that was hanging over rural communities, which can now invest for the future.</p><p>It is now time to move on.

We have distinctive habitats such as sea lochs and maerl beds, which are as synonymous with Scotland as tulips are with Amsterdam. Scottish waters are among the most diverse in the world, as they support 8,000 complex and more than 36,000 single-cell species. Two examples that come to mind are leatherback turtles and basking sharks.</p><p>My South of Scotland region includes a large part of the Scottish coastline&#8212;the mild Solway and Ayrshire coast in the west and the East Lothian and Berwickshire coast in the east. I estimate that it has more than 600 km of coastline. The Bass Rock in the east and Ailsa Craig in the far west, which were mentioned by the cabinet secretary&#8212;unfortunately, he is now absent&#8212;are both in my region and both have gannet populations. The Solway Firth was one of the five contenders for the national park location. I hope that that will come in the future. I seek an assurance from the Government that those plans have not been put on the back burner.</p><p>As John Scott and John Farquhar Munro said, the coastline is important economically as it <place-holder colnum=\"15334\"/> supports communities, whether through fishing, aquaculture or tourism. It has been well noted that 16,000 jobs in fishing and aquaculture generate a landing value of &#163;300 million from Scottish boats and a farm-gate value of &#163;340 million. Alasdair Allan said that Scotland produces about 90 per cent of UK farmed fish and shellfish. People visiting Historic Scotland's staffed coastal and island properties generate &#163;2.5 million of income per annum and recreational diving opportunities attract many thousands of divers every year. St Abbs has flora wrecks that include U-boats, and businesses such as Eyemouth-based Marine Quest have grasped such opportunities following the decommissioning of their fishing boats. John Scott mentioned that the oil and gas industry supports 164,000 jobs.</p><p>There is cross-party agreement that Scotland's seas should be managed coherently and in a manner that addresses social, economic and environmental factors. Of course, the difficulty is working out how to achieve that in practice. I emphasise that a sensible balance must be struck between economic activity and other uses of our seas, given their economic importance to Scotland.</p><p>I welcome the prospect of a Scottish marine bill, which must complement UK legislation&#8212;the reference to the UK is an important part of our amendment&#8212;although the process might be complex. However, I share my colleagues' disappointment that, well over a year since the previous debate on the subject, and despite the cabinet secretary's upbeat words back in June 2007, proposals have still not been produced.</p><p>Key issues should be addressed in producing a Scottish bill. Scotland will have responsibility for planning and conservation measures out to 200 nautical miles, as the Scottish Liberal Democrats originally suggested. An integrated system of marine spatial planning is needed. It is crucial that those two aspects build on current powers over sea fisheries and offshore renewable energy. The Government must therefore continue positive dialogue with UK ministers to achieve the benefits that we all want from the use of the sea.</p><p>Without a streamlined framework for coastal zone management, evidence of environmental degradation has increased. A more integrated approach would reduce uncertainty and bring benefits to all users of the marine and coastal environments. It is therefore vital that the Westminster and Holyrood bills complement each other, to achieve consistency in planning our uses of the sea and in protecting sites for rare wildlife.</p><p>I welcome the consultation document. I am pleased that many of the proposals in it were recommended by AGMACS, which Liam McArthur mentioned. The previous Administration founded <place-holder colnum=\"15335\"/> that group, which Ross Finnie chaired. Those recommendations included the creation of a dedicated marine management organisation; the co-ordination of marine planning; an increased local focus; a three-tiered planning structure; the extension of some responsibilities up to 200 nautical miles; and a three-pillared approach to marine conservation.</p><p>I ask the minister to assure us that licensing arrangements will be aligned with proposals to protect the marine environment under the bill. Concern has been expressed that gas and oil have been removed from the marine management organisation's remit under the UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill and that it is not guaranteed to be given responsibility for carbon capture and storage. That suggests that protection of the marine environment is not being sufficiently considered. Will marine Scotland play a part in such matters?</p><p>Full account of environmental risks needs to be taken in licensing for offshore storage of natural gas and carbon dioxide. I ask the Government to provide assurances that that is being considered.</p><p>Liberal Democrats welcome a better and more streamlined approach to marine conservation and management. We have called repeatedly for the introduction of a marine bill, which should be introduced sooner rather than later. Liam McArthur and I hope that, a year from now, we will not have the same debate. The Scottish Government should not delay the delivery of better marine management. I sincerely hope that the cabinet secretary or the minister will offer a timescale for introducing the bill and I look for support from throughout the chamber for our amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14740648", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Bill Consultation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I warmly welcome Roseanna Cunningham to her new post and I look forward to shadowing her as closely as I shadowed Mr Russell.

It was lucky that the dog swam out.</p><p>Liberal Democrats acknowledge that flooding is a tangible danger in the south of Scotland and many other parts of the country and welcome the renewed focus on flood management. We are committed to the bill, as Liam McArthur made clear, which presents an opportunity to introduce a more sustainable, integrated approach to flood management. As Liam McArthur said, the process was begun by Ross Finnie in the previous session of the Parliament. We are glad that there has been progress.<place-holder colnum=\"14371\"/></p><p>Almost 100,000 Scottish homes and 7,000 Scottish businesses are vulnerable to inland and coastal flooding. It is estimated that the annual average cost of damage from flooding is about &#163;20 million, which could rise by 115 per cent by 2080. The economic cost should be the force behind the change that is needed to achieve a more sustainable approach to flooding.</p><p>Sustainable flood management offers a long-term solution, but there will still be a place for the hard defences that were mentioned by many members, including Roseanna Cunningham, the convener of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee. Hard engineering defences should be considered alongside softer engineering options. Many villages and towns in Scotland, including those in the south, are located on flood plains and are vulnerable to flooding. Soft engineering can reduce the need to build ever higher flood defences to protect such vulnerable communities.</p><p>The adoption of sustainable measures to tackle flooding will require a strategic approach in which consideration is given to the catchment as a whole, including water environment and land use interests. Responsibilities will have to be shared, not only between authorities but between rural communities and other groups.</p><p>Hawick has long suffered from flooding. Murdo Fraser mentioned gravel, which is an issue there: water does not flow under one of the two arches of the main bridge because the river is so full of gravel.</p><p>Towards the end of last year, Tavish Scott and I viewed the devastating effects of flooding in the Bowmont and Kale valleys near Kelso&#8212;as did Mr Russell, I believe. We saw the destruction that was caused to roads, bridges, homes and businessness. Further to the south-west, flooding disrupted the white sands area of Dumfries last week, as it seems to do regularly, and more is expected again tonight. The River Annan also caused problems for people when it burst it banks recently.</p><p>John Scott mentioned wood planting to alleviate floods. That comes at great expense&#8212;my farm has been involved in such an initiative&#8212;and we must not underestimate the power of water to move even trees and fences.</p><p>I am concerned that flood risk management plans will not have to be in place until 2015. Jeremy Purvis mentioned that local authorities are uncertain what their rights and responsibilities will be under the bill. The cabinet secretary and Liam McArthur also mentioned that. SEPA would inherit responsibility for Scotland's national flood management under the bill but its role may not be fully implemented until 2015. In evidence to the committee, Scottish Government officials said that <place-holder colnum=\"14372\"/> they have not finalised any interim arrangements, which has led some local authorities to question their flood management remit in advance of SEPA taking full responsibility. I echo the concerns that Jeremy Purvis, Sarah Boyack and Liam McArthur expressed about local authority funding.</p><p>Richard Lochhead mentioned that the bill will require SEPA and local authorities to assess whether natural features such as flood plains, woodlands or wetlands can be incorporated into flood risk management, but once the assessment has been carried out there will be no obligation on the authorities to incorporate natural defences into their plans and the bill does not presume that such defences should be preferred to other methods. Roseanna Cunningham, the committee's convener, mentioned that we need a cultural shift in favour of considering natural flood management techniques, as did Sarah Boyack.</p><p>Dave Thompson mentioned the Scottish rural development programme. I will not go on about it, but it is an issue&#8212;it is a pot that seems to be being dragged in all directions.</p><p>Alasdair Morgan and Liam McArthur mentioned skills. There may be opportunities, but it looks as though we have a skills gap that will have to be addressed.</p><p>The introduction of a Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill is welcome, but some matters still need clarification. I hope that, once the bill has progressed through stages 2 and 3, the final outcome will be a piece of legislation that builds on the good work that Ross Finnie did, so that truly sustainable flood management strategies that reduce the impact of flooding on Scotland's economy, species and habitats can be implemented with the proper finance behind them.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14622229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest in farming and my past directorships of NFU Scotland.

As a result, food security, the environment, value for money and fuel crops have become key factors.</p><p>Today's debate has been interesting. Again, we have heard Mr Lochhead take all the praise for anything good that has come from the Scottish rural development programme, while Rob Gibson says that anything wrong with the programme is the fault of the previous Administration.</p><p>CAP reform under Ross Finnie gave farmers greater freedom to decide which crops to produce. That was hailed as a great success, unlike the English reform, which embraced area payments. Under our reform, farmers&#8212;instead of having to produce certain products to obtain support&#8212;were able to choose what to produce so that they could match the demands of the market. Furthermore, it was at last acknowledged that farmers who received CAP support had responsibilities towards the protection of the environment and towards public health and welfare. Scotland has a good track record in such issues, as Mr Lochhead acknowledged.</p><p>John Scott mentioned a level playing field for farmers that will ensure sustainable food production. Production will run alongside the stewardship of our land so that our biodiversity is retained and nurtured. We cannot have environmental benefits without economic activity on the ground to deliver them. I believe that Sarah Boyack acknowledged that point.</p><p>When we debated this issue last May, two things became clear from our discussions with the farming sector. First, any increases in compulsory modulation should be tempered by reductions in voluntary modulation, and secondly, progressive modulation&#8212;as mentioned by Jamie McGrigor&#8212;threatened to damage the farming sector, stifle business and unfairly put Scotland at a competitive disadvantage compared with other parts of Europe. Luckily, those issues have been addressed, we hope.</p><p>As many members have acknowledged, we are moving from an era of food surplus to an era of food shortage. The imbalance between the farm-gate price and the retail price has been acutely felt by producers; it does not bode well for a viable <place-holder colnum=\"14211\"/> future. We obviously have some great hills to climb, if members will forgive the pun.</p><p>If any of our aspirations for a food policy are to be met, the Government's top priority must be to secure our future production capacity. The SRDP will be a key part of that, as will support for farming activity and efforts to stem the decline in livestock numbers.</p><p>I am a bit surprised that John Scott will not support the Liberal Democrat amendment, because there are real problems with access to the Scottish rural development programme, as my colleague Liam McArthur has illustrated. The system is too complicated and farmers are being put off from even applying. The criteria are restrictive, and we have heard that 25 per cent of all applications are given the red light. The Government must address that problem.</p><p>Another problem arises, as Liam McArthur pointed out, because the system is computerised. Because of digital exclusion, it is not always possible for people in remote, rural areas to apply. That may not be the case in Ayr, but it certainly is the case in other parts of the south of Scotland if broadband is not available.</p><p>A cost is involved in the use of consultants, which gives rise to the fear that an unsuccessful application will also have an added cost. That can be enough to put people off applying.</p><p>I could not mention consultants without&#8212;like Sarah Boyack&#8212;mentioning FWAG Scotland, which faces an uncertain future.

Elderly and disabled people found the personal service from their post office branch to be a lifeline, especially where there was a poor bus service. The post office was cited as the hub of the community, providing a place to meet and an informal communication network&#8212;that is particularly true of rural and remote communities. The report showed that the postmaster and staff played an important part in the community. Participants in all three studies reported that the advice and support that those individuals provided went beyond counter duties to include wider community roles. They were figures of trust.</p><p>The report also showed that the post office branches complemented other businesses. People who use post office branches often stop at other shops along the high street. In addition, residents use post offices as local communication networks. Through notices, post offices often act as one-stop advice shops for visitors and tourists. Indeed, research that Postwatch commissioned at about the same time concluded that, whether the community was affluent or disadvantaged,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the closure of the rural post office appeared to have had far-reaching effects upon both particular individuals and the community ... It became apparent that the post office played an extremely important role in the rural community, a role that transcended the provision of post office services or even the goods sold at the store which was often attached.\"</p><p>Three years later, those two pieces of research can be translated on the ground, using evidence that was obtained from constituents, local organisations and community groups throughout the consultation period. I believe that the Post Office based its network change programme on clinical factors and in no way took into account the demographics of individual communities.</p><p>During the consultation period, there was a huge public outcry against the proposed closures, from not only individuals, but organisations and local authorities. Some of the Post Office's decisions are hard to swallow, including the closure of busy, well-used branches such as Greenlaw, Hutton and Morebattle post offices and the closure of Sheuchan Street post office in Stranraer, of which I am sure the Deputy Presiding Officer is well aware.</p><p>The closure of Greenlaw post office is particularly difficult to fathom. A significant number of small businesses in the town rely on the post office and its current opening hours to conduct their business. They need a next-day delivery service for orders that are received before specified times during the day. Transporting large numbers of parcels to the nearest alternative post office will not be practical because people will have to spend time away from their business and because it is difficult to park near the post office in <place-holder colnum=\"13987\"/> Duns. Scottish Borders Council is seriously concerned about the adverse effects that the proposed closure will have on all businesses in Greenlaw and the job losses that will occur if it goes ahead. The fact that there is no Parcelforce facility in the area increases small businesses' reliance on the post office, and a reduction in access to post office services might affect both the number of businesses that locate in the area and their viability. Greenlaw post office is also used by tourists who base themselves at the local caravan park.</p><p>Elderly people who rely on carers to accompany them to the post office will be severely disadvantaged if the proposed new hours are not aligned with carers' visits. The bus service to the nearest alternative post office operates every two hours, and the journey to carry out a simple transaction will take a minimum of 2.5 hours using public transport. The proposed stopping area for the mobile van is problematic because it is used as a general car parking space and it might not always be available for the mobile service to use. It is also on a hill, which will present access difficulties for the elderly, the disabled and parents with prams and young kids.</p><p>The only reason that I can think of for reducing services at the likes of Greenlaw post office and Sheuchan Street post office in Stranraer is to justify mobile and hosted services, but they might be unsustainable. Post offices throughout the South of Scotland are now playing the waiting game and many of them are in the dark about when they will close. I make a plea to the Post Office to ensure that the closure of vital community services is not a starter for 10, that replacement mobile and hosted services are kept under constant review, and that provision is increased where necessary.</p><p>I make a plea to the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism to do everything in his power to help to reinstate essential post offices such as those at Greenlaw and Sheuchan Street&#8212;it is hoped that the latter will be made into a Co-operative. My fear remains that, where replacement services are drastically reduced, customers will find it impossible to fit into the restricted service and the Post Office will use further reductions in customer use as a reason to get rid of mobile and hosted services.

The cabinet secretary and Sarah Boyack recognised that our fishermen have worked hard to develop and adhere to sustainable fishing methods. Scottish waters are some of the richest in Europe. Elaine Murray gave a long list of the fish that are in our seas&#8212;who knows, with a change of habit and climate, we may see piranhas in Palnackie one day, although that is doubtful.</p><p>Fishing is an economic mainstay in many parts of Scotland. We have witnessed a large-scale decrease in employment in the industry, due to restrictions on tonnage, but parts of the area that I represent, the South of Scotland, still have an interest in fisheries. They include Eyemouth, which experienced a disaster rather worse than the Lossiemouth disaster that was mentioned; coastal Berwickshire; East Lothian; and, to the south-west, Annan, Solway and the Ayrshire coast. The industry is vital to retaining population and maintaining viable communities&#8212;Jamie McGrigor focused on that issue.</p><p>Liam McArthur stated that we need to ensure that there is a balance between economic activity and profitability. The aim should be to have a sea fishing industry that is sustainable and profitable, to support communities. The industry must be allowed to use quotas sensibly, while meeting commitments to conservation. That is a difficult balance to strike.</p><p>It has been recognised today that the Scottish fishing sector has already made a substantial contribution to achieving the sustainable management of cod stocks&#8212;that has been evident recently, even under the three-year plan. It is clear that cod stocks are heading in the right direction, thanks to the efforts of our fleet. Many members, including John Scott, have noted that increases in total allowable catch for cod must be part of any solution. Combined with other measures such as changes to net size, that approach will reduce the number of discards; prevent the catching of juvenile fish, spawning fish and non-target species; and help to create an economically sustainable sector. Nigel Don was right to suggest that we need to look even further into the future than we are looking at the moment.<place-holder colnum=\"12845\"/></p><p>In the coastal waters of Berwickshire, vessels are reliant on nephrops, which many speakers have mentioned&#8212;especially langoustines. By value, langoustines are probably the single most economically important species that the Scottish fishing industry catches. In 2005, landings were worth &#163;38.5 million, compared with &#163;22.5 million or thereabouts for haddock. Rightly, many members have mentioned the west coast problem, which is serious, but in Berwickshire fishermen are concerned about recent Commission proposals to reduce some North Sea catches by up to 15 per cent&#8212;a reduction of 13 per cent is proposed for the crucial langoustine catch in the area. A cut of that size would have an impact on the livelihoods of fishermen in Berwickshire. I would like to hear from the cabinet secretary how it is proposed to fight the case for the Berwickshire fleet. Like others, that fleet has had to bear increases in fuel costs, as Jamie McGrigor mentioned. The proposed reduction will do nothing to help those fishermen, and I question the science behind it. In his discussions with Joe Borg, will the cabinet secretary be resisting the proposed reduction which, if it is applied, will press even further an already hard-pressed sector?</p><p>My colleague Michael Moore MP and I have been campaigning on the draft European fisheries fund programme and its implications for Eyemouth and the Berwickshire coast. In particular, we have sought fisheries-dependent area status for Berwickshire and the creation of local committees of industry representatives to oversee the allocation of programme funds. I am delighted to say that it looks as though the hard work of many people in the industry, including the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the Anglo-Scottish Fishermen's Association, has paid off, as it seems that the developments that I have mentioned have been achieved.</p><p>Axis 4 funding, together with local control of spending, will be crucial for areas such as Berwickshire, because that will build on the sector that is already there. It will provide support for diversification efforts and will potentially attract inward investment, from tourism initiatives for example. The goal is the long-term sustainable development of coastal communities. I hope that efforts in that regard will provide another opportunity for people in fishing communities.</p><p>The good work of my colleague Liam McArthur, who recently met Joe Borg in Strasbourg, has been well outlined today. The Liberal Democrats' position is clear. The SNP must make a strong case for Scotland, as part of the UK. I am glad to hear that Scotland now has jurisdiction out to 200 miles, which Ross Finnie and the Liberal Democrats have long argued for in order to have more regional management of our fisheries. Our past involvement in setting up the influential <place-holder colnum=\"12846\"/> regional advisory councils, with Ross Finnie, was an integral part of that process. We need to continue to make progress there.</p><p>We have consistently argued for further reform of the common fisheries policy to give local fishermen and other stakeholders a better say in the management of their own regional waters. Dave Thompson must have had his head in the sand when he was speaking earlier. The industry must be quite disgusted by his poor contribution. Liam McArthur noted that, when regional advisory councils were introduced, both the SNP and the Tories described them as glorified but toothless talking shops. That is not the case.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary will make the defence of Scotland's fisheries sector as strongly as the Liberal Democrats did in the past&#8212;and will continue to do. I welcome the extension of jurisdiction to 200 miles and the work that is being done on discards.

As Mike Russell mentioned, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 2006 that aquaculture, which supplied only 9 per cent of the fish consumed by people in <place-holder colnum=\"12656\"/> 1980, now provides 43 per cent of the market&#8212;a share that is growing. Of course, seafood consumption is expected to increase by 50 per cent between now and 2030. To keep pace with demand, global production of shellfish will need to double by 2030.</p><p>Scotland can deliver a chunk of that supply, but we need to ensure that that growth potential is seized upon. Sustainable development of this food sector should be the main focus for policy makers. Atlantic salmon dominates in terms of value, with production at around 130,000 tonnes in 2007, as Mike Russell mentioned. Mussel production dominates shellfish culture in Scotland, but trout is also important in fresh waters. No one would deny that scope exists to increase fin fish and shellfish production. Globally, aquaculture has to make up the gap between the demand for marine protein and what is available from depleting wild fish stocks. It is an industry that has carved a place for itself in the international marketplace and still has a place to go. As Mike Russell mentioned, the industry is worth roughly &#163;400 million each year. To put that in context, the fish-catching sector is worth &#163;370 million, beef &#163;467 million, sheep &#163;151 million and pigs &#163;57 million. Aquaculture already plays a significant economic role in Scotland, although there is obviously room for growth.</p><p>The Solway coast has huge potential for development and is considered a growth area by Scottish Enterprise, particularly for niche markets. Members will all have heard of a fish called Wanda, but how many have heard of a fish called tilapia? In the US, it is now ranked as the fifth most consumed seafood and researchers believe that tilapia is destined to be one of the most important farmed seafood products of the century. It is a good substitute for white fish, with the potential to help the recovery of cod; the University of Stirling and Scottish Enterprise have done interesting work on that already.</p><p>A report on aquaculture in the Solway indicated potential yields for shellfish production to be in the region of 13,000 tonnes of oysters or 19,000 tonnes of mussels. As with aquaculture elsewhere in Scotland, realising potential will depend on the degree to which the industry can exist in harmony with other marine use, regulations and environmental designations. Will the minister confirm what work is on-going on the Solway? I hope that that conversation will continue between us long after today's debate.</p><p>In developing the sector and our potential for increased wealth, we need to ensure that there is a properly-trained, skilled workforce. I know that Liam McArthur will focus on that in more detail later. Elaine Murray mentioned the good work of Barony college where, coincidentally, my sons and <place-holder colnum=\"12657\"/> my father were educated&#8212;albeit in sheep and cattle culture rather than fish culture.</p><p>There are some concerns about the environmental consequences of a growing aquaculture industry. Elaine Murray seemed to be concerned that the Liberal Democrat amendment would just bring full-scale industrialisation, but that must happen with the environment in mind. It is therefore key that the Government offers assurances that the development of the sector will not come at the expense of the environment. We know about the problems with cod recovery in the North Sea and the measures to deal with discards. To mirror those efforts, let us ensure that the aquaculture industry is delivered in a way that does not damage existing wild fish or the sea bed. The same goes for freshwater farms and their escapees, which Mike Russell and John Scott rightly have concerns about. The wild fish and invertebrates that live in our waters are an important part of our economy for both tourism and our environment.</p><p>Access to support will kick-start any business venture, so I was pleased to read in the strategy that applications to the Scottish fisheries fund from small businesses will be prioritised. It is important that small and medium-sized enterprises are given as much support as possible, whether they are existing businesses or those diversifying for the first time.</p><p>Coexistence in the marine environment requires communication between all stakeholders. Planning must be flexible if we in Scotland want to remain competitive and it must be based on what we can do rather than what we cannot. Scotland needs a competitive advantage.</p><p>The minister's motion refers to the excellent health of our industry, although Iceland and Norway have advantages over us because of their cooler waters, so we cannot be complacent. The arc of aquaculture also invests heavily in research and development, and we need to learn from those countries. I am pleased to hear that the minister is working with Norway on that.</p><p>Red tape remains a barrier. I know of a one-man business in my region that, until recently, paid &#163;600 per year to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for water testing. That charge is now &#163;2,000 per year, which is unsustainable.

Its implementation will be crucial in safeguarding Scotland's most vulnerable native plants and animals and will, in the long term, help to protect ecosystems. Scotland is world-renowned for its flora and fauna, and we all have a responsibility to protect those jewels in the crown of our environment. Indeed, the UK has an obligation to deal with invasives as part of the \"Convention on Biological Diversity\".</p><p>Many true alien species may now be regarded as native, such as the rabbit, which was introduced by the Normans, and the sycamore, which was introduced by the Celts, but no one is proposing eliminating those from our countryside. Harmful invasive species, however, can alter the structure of ecosystems through repressing or excluding native species, either by directly out-competing them&#8212;as is the case with grey and red squirrels&#8212;or by indirectly changing the way in which nutrients are cycled through the system. The danger is that entire ecosystems become permanently skewed.</p><p>It is important, therefore, that we deal with the problem timeously rather than wait for it to become <place-holder colnum=\"11957\"/> unmanageable and expensive. That approach is endorsed by the strategy, which views prevention as a key to tackling the problem of invasive species. The strategy acknowledges the good work that has been achieved through the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, but it also identifies the need for a more cohesive and comprehensive policy approach. The strategy's intention is to build on existing legislation, but any legislation must fast-track the existing system. The point of my amendment, which I will come to, is to address that.</p><p>I mention at this point the work of the Tweed Forum, which deals with the particular problems of giant hogweed, Himalayan balsam&#8212;or touch-me-not, as it is commonly known&#8212;and Japanese knotweed in the Tweed catchment. Those plants are all, as Elaine Murray pointed out, garden introductions.</p><p>The Tweed invasives project has been successful but, like other projects, it now needs resources to complete the job and, as the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment mentioned, to save money in the medium and the long term. The project's key to success is, of course, the local knowledge within the forum, but the difficulty is the time it takes to gain licences through agencies so that non-native species can be tackled before they become invasive.</p><p>The same goes for the American signal crayfish, which has now reached endemic proportions in the south of Scotland&#8212;in Loch Ken in particular, and in the Tweed. It is being tackled by the Tweed Foundation and the Galloway Fisheries Trust: fishing in those areas brings in large incomes and the amphibious crayfish is a serious threat to the economy of Scotland. Resources are needed to tackle that alien now because not only is it a faster breeder than our native crayfish, it is a more ferocious eater of salmon par and trout alevins, which, I inform the cabinet secretary, are small fry.</p><p>The point of my amendment is that local groups need to take the lead by having responsibility and authority for an agreed catchment area that potentially takes in more than one local authority area and local groups with an environmental focus. Tweed Forum treated the Tweed as a whole catchment because the seeds and rhizomes of the giant hogweed and knotweed were shown to travel through watercourses. Treating the whole river system as one catchment is rather more effective than simply stopping at any borders. Tweed Forum worked with Northumberland County Council, for example, because co-operation is key.</p><p>The biosecurity planning project that is under way again is welcome. It will build on the existing knowledge base to realise a biosecurity plan <place-holder colnum=\"11958\"/> template and plans, rapid response protocols and databases, together with awareness raising and training. That is good planning, but what is needed now is for the Scottish Government to take a lead in the UK to deal proactively with the problem of invasives. Crucially, it has been repeated to me that the Scottish Government also needs to agree that control and eradication measures can be put in place when invasive species are first detected and not just when they are shown to be damaging, which can be years later, often too late and&#8212;by then&#8212;too expensive to tackle.</p><p>Localised measures do not commit the Scottish Government to limitless expenditure on invasives, but could be taken by empowering local groups with professional staff, such as the Tweed Foundation, Tweed Forum, the Galloway Fisheries Trust and the Rivers and Fisheries Trusts of Scotland, so that they can take local action to meet local problems as they identify them through local plans on the ground and in the water.</p><p>Quick access to funding is an issue. If they have resources, local bodies can control non-native species early on, not just when they are established as an invasives problem. Dealing with any problem early on will keep costs down. Best value is good government.</p><p>I have carped on a wee bit about fish today, but I believe that we have the knowledge and means in Scotland to deal with the problem of non-native invasives in a practical way. I have outlined briefly in my speech the importance of local action plans and quick responses. Many groups and organisations are involved, so communication will be paramount in setting up local initiatives to tackle invasive species now. I hope that the minister and cabinet secretary will consider speeding up the licensing process to tackle non-native species.</p><p>I am glad that the Government and Labour support my amendment. We will support the Labour amendment, although ours goes a little further and focuses on the need for fast local action.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2777.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises that prevention and early intervention are vital in protecting native species, habitats and ecosystems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work with local organisations with a remit for the protection of Scotland's natural environment to find ways to expedite the timeous implementation of measures at a local level and to report back to the Parliament with the findings.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14186607", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Non-native Invasive Species"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Liberal Democrats welcome the publication of the strategy.

The concept of mutual ownership is relevant now, given the extremely difficult economics that we are facing. A recent report that was presented to the European Association of Co-operative Banks stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"co-operative banks in Europe should be seen as a safe haven in these times of turbulence and uncertainty in the financial markets.\"</p><p>Co-operatives come in many forms and provide all manner of products and services. They are involved in agriculture, social housing, retail and many other areas. They are built on the common theme of their funding principles and the idea that their members have a relationship with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products, or as employees.</p><p>The co-operative idea as we know it is not new but dates back as far as the 18<sup>th</sup> century. We are all familiar with the Fenwick Weavers Society, and Robert Owen from New Lanark in the south of Scotland is widely regarded as the founder of the co-operative movement. His work at the New Lanark cotton mills was underpinned by the principle that workers should have fair working conditions and by the idea that welfare and education rights should be extended to workers' <place-holder colnum=\"11843\"/> families. He was many years ahead of his time. Members might have read my motion S3M-2755, on the New Lanark world heritage site. The motion already has some cross-party support, but I hope that more members will support it because the site has some funding issues.</p><p>There are of course other, more modern co-operative movements and projects in the south of Scotland region. Elaine Murray mentioned how important Scottish Enterprise has been in helping such projects. The Borders Machinery Ring was established in the 1980s to rationalise labour, machinery and input costs. It has grown since then and now offers a range of services that help to sustain and improve business viability, including accountancy services, training, waste management and the bulk buying of fuel. It is even running a project on renewable energy.</p><p>Elaine Murray mentioned Stewartry Care, which provides long-term residential care for older and disabled people. It now employs more than 150 people and looks after more than 500 clients throughout Dumfries and Galloway. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The co-operative approach has enabled us to provide a quality personal service that is driven by a happy, positive, motivated and highly skilled workforce\".</p><p>Scottish Enterprise has also helped the Borders Foundation for Rural Sustainability, in which I declare an interest as a past chairman. The foundation has brainstormed interests and opportunities to forge co-operative diversification projects, some of which turned into real businesses or venture groups, including Clifftop Discovery Ltd in Coldingham, which provides wildlife tours, and the James Hutton trail in Berwickshire. Other examples include East Lothian Potatoes, Wigtownshire Quality Lamb Ltd, Irvine North Credit Union and the Scottish Cashmere Club, which represents textiles companies from the Borders to Ayrshire. The list goes on.</p><p>In addition, we have organisations such as the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which plays a key role in developing the work of those businesses and groups. However, we need sustained funding in place to help and support SAOS and its new ventures. Again, SAOS has been helped by Scottish Enterprise in the past.</p><p>Co-operative Development Scotland undoubtedly has a role to play in providing resources to enable and encourage the take-up of the co-operative option and improve the growth of individual co-operatives. However, that work should be done in conjunction&#8212;or should I say co-operation?&#8212;with agencies such as SAOS, Co-operation and Mutuality Scotland, BFRS, BMR, Scottish Enterprise and the business gateway, which already have the required knowledge and experience.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14183884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operative Development Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elaine Murray on securing the debate.

I hope that, as the debate continues long after 5 o'clock today, Mr Lochhead and his officials will seek to protect Scotland from infected animals crossing the border or coming in from further afield once the vaccination programme starts running. I also hope that they will make a plea to farmers and others not to import animals from infected areas at all&#8212;there is no excuse for that.</p><p>We welcome Jim Scudamore's report and I am pleased that the Government is committed to taking forward its recommendations. That will be a long and complicated process, but a necessary one.

I witnessed that at first hand, and I <place-holder colnum=\"11488\"/> never want to live through that outbreak or last year's again.</p><p>The timing of the 2007 outbreak was worse, as livestock were ready to be moved off the islands and the hills for the winter. The distress and economic impact that both events caused directly and indirectly cannot be overestimated, and neither can the animal welfare implications of the outbreaks and the effect of the outbreaks on the number of sheep&#8212;as John Scott mentioned&#8212;and cattle in Scotland.</p><p>We therefore need to create a workable system of protection for Scotland's flocks and herds that safeguards a future for our livestock producers through healthy markets at home and in the EU and, of course, the important international markets. In other words, we need to create a system that reacts quickly and flexibly to the needs of the Scottish situation.</p><p>The key issue is how we can protect Scotland from disease while getting the market back to normal as quickly as possible so that we do not allow significant damage or disruption to the rural economy and the livestock sector. The bottom line in an FMD situation is that there has to be unfailing communication and clear arrangements between the Scottish and UK Governments. As an aside, I say that I have no doubt that the UK Government should tighten up customs to reduce the chance of illegally imported meat entering the country in future.</p><p>Regionalisation is imperative.

As responsibility for policy has been fully devolved to the Scottish Government, it is only logical that the budgets to deliver that policy should also be devolved, <place-holder colnum=\"11489\"/> including the funding that is required to control major outbreaks of disease.</p><p>The current position is an anomaly of the Scotland Act 1998. The money that Scotland gets from the Barnett formula does not include money for animal health, which is kept instead in the overall UK animal health pot. Scotland's share of the money would be better used if it was devolved, but with the proviso that we still had access to the UK Treasury's reserve if and when required.

The vast majority of the south of Scotland is less favoured. Dramatic changes have occurred in the landscape there because stock has been removed from the hills&#8212;that does not affect only the Highlands and Islands, which are talked about often. Five out of seven of my neighbouring hill farmers have taken all their stock off the hills. Aileen Campbell talked about her relevant family experience.</p><p>Corroboration is provided by unbiased and respected sources, which all recognise the importance of the LFASS. The Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Scottish Agricultural College, the crofting inquiry report and the NFUS's \"Manifesto for the Hills\" conclude categorically that sheep and cattle numbers on Scottish hills are in decline, as just about every member has said. Since 1998&#8212;in 10 years&#8212;23 to 25 per cent of the sheep flock has disappeared and 11 to 12 per cent of the beef breeding herd has disappeared. The trend is clear and alarming&#8212;Peter Peacock and the cabinet secretary referred to it. Those stock reductions will mean that fewer people work in rural communities. Rob Gibson talked about that, but the rest of his speech blamed everything on everybody else, which was unhelpful. The \"It wisnae me\" attitude wears rather thin. It was also disappointing to hear Bill Wilson back up Rob Gibson.</p><p>We need grazing on the hills, or no wild mountain thyme will grow in our blooming heather&#8212;the RSPB would back that. People who are working&#8212;who are economically active&#8212;are needed in remote areas to maintain and enhance the biodiversity for which our hills and islands are famous.

If we could blame the weather, we could see a correlation&#8212;the weather turned bad last May and has never improved, except perhaps in Orkney and Shetland, where Liberal Democrats are in power.</p><p>Food, fuel and fertiliser prices are all linked to oil prices, which the cabinet secretary mentioned. Banks have also tightened their practices, so the credit crunch is having an extreme effect on farmers.<place-holder colnum=\"10964\"/></p><p>We have excellent food that is produced in an excellent environment by excellent people, so let us keep it that way.

I have championed local food procurement since becoming an MSP and I still wait for the Government to act on it. It is felt that the rural development programme needs to be streamlined, so I agree with the Labour amendment on that.</p><p>However, I wish that Labour members' colleagues in Westminster were as concerned about rural Scotland and I hope that they will support the CAP after 2013. The Tories are right in their amendment to criticise the Westminster Labour Government. Alistair Darling's statement that he wanted to end the CAP in 2013 was at best unhelpful, whether or not it was a starting point, given that many organisations, such as the RSE, say that such support is important.</p><p>The Tories missed a chance to use their amendment to make the Scottish Government act, which is what the Parliament is about. After all, the Scottish Government has the devolved powers to act.

I have no doubt that the fact that we have too much packaging resonates with all members who are here and with others, including constituents, environmental groups, neighbours, friends and family members. We are all consumers and we come across excess packaging daily. A trip to the supermarket results in the accumulation of seemingly endless amounts of card, foil and plastic, much of which is disposed of as soon as we get home.</p><p>The United Kingdom Waste and Resources Action Programme says that families in the UK spend about &#163;470 on packaging each year, which is one sixth of their food budget. To put the issue into context, the UK dumps 5 million tonnes of packaging each year, of which Scotland's share is 1 million tonnes. A recent survey by my Liberal Democrat member of Parliament colleague Jo Swinson found that Easter eggs take up as little as 9 per cent of the volume of their packaging.<place-holder colnum=\"9576\"/></p><p>The UK Government's regulations on excess packaging are not working to best effect. Much needs to be done to consider how to toughen the law so that retailers take seriously their role in reducing excess packaging. At present, the commitments that companies have made to reduce packaging are voluntary. We must monitor properly the progress that they make to ensure that those commitments are met, but we also need binding packaging reduction targets for producers and retailers, to replace the current voluntary commitments. I hope that the minister will be able to advise us on that.</p><p>We must empower consumers and give them greater choice over the amount of excess packaging that they buy, while ensuring that extra costs for producers are not simply passed on to shoppers. My colleague Mike Pringle is no stranger to the issue, given all his work on the Environmental Levy on Plastic Bags (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I have just completed my own survey on excess packaging, in which an overwhelming 95 per cent of respondents said that too much packaging is attached to the goods that we buy. Crucially, 85 per cent of respondents felt that retailers could help to tackle the problem and 90 per cent felt that we as consumers can also help. Further, 95 per cent felt that any packaging should at the very least be biodegradable, although that does not address the need to reduce packaging and prevent waste in the first place. More work needs to be done with manufacturers to ensure that, when packaging cannot be reduced further, whatever packaging remains can be left to degrade safely.</p><p>Sadly, in the survey, only 4 per cent of respondents said that we are doing enough as a nation to recycle, only 4 per cent said that we use our waste efficiently and only 19 per cent felt that there are enough facilities to allow them to recycle. The good news is that 71 per cent said that they would like to recycle more. We have an opportunity to do something positive to fill the gap between what people want to happen and what is happening and available.</p><p>The UK Government's waste strategy fails to address the need for constructive changes to be made to its current ineffective Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003. Trading standards departments should be provided with adequate resources to tackle producers of excessive packaging effectively. The UK Government has also failed to meet the UK-wide targets for packaging reduction that were set by the European Union. My colleagues in London are working hard to secure improvements. In Scotland, I hope that the Scottish Government realises that it must make tackling excess <place-holder colnum=\"9577\"/> packaging a priority in its new waste strategy, not least to meet the EU's waste management directive targets, which may hit strongly in 2013. After all, there is no doubt that prevention is better than cure.</p><p>We must make recycling easier for consumers. Let large supermarkets provide waste points in stores where customers can deposit unwanted packaging. We have seen people protest by taking off packaging in the middle of supermarkets and leaving it for the stores to deal with. I do not condone that, but I am sure that there is an opportunity for supermarkets to take the lead and show corporate responsibility. There are early signs that some of them are slowly awakening to that. What a worthwhile advert it would be for any business if it offered to take back any waste packaging from its products.</p><p>The supermarket summit is looming. I am sure that many issues need to be discussed at it, including local food and fair trade for producers, but excess packaging must be on the agenda, as it affects everyone. However, supermarkets cannot take all the blame, although they are in a powerful position to demand that their suppliers work into their products a more sustainable approach. Product designers and manufacturers may then realise that they have an opportunity to sell their products to a market that appreciates that less packaging is better and to gain a unique selling point, such as the one that the growing organic sector has found and exploited well.</p><p>Some local authorities are providing recycling facilities, but that is not happening across the board. People need to have recycling facilities available to them. Let us make it easier for people to recycle.</p><p>Work to build the Ecodeco plant, which is mentioned in the motion and is an intelligent transfer station in Dumfries, started at the end of January 2005. I believe that Michael Russell has visited the plant, as have I. It is now fully operational and processes up to 65,000 tonnes of waste a year from the west of the region, although it could do more. It works on a simple idea: it dries out the waste, sucks out glass, stones and metals for recycling and recovers a fuel. The small amount of waste that cannot be dealt with in that process is then sent to landfill, but that constitutes only 9 per cent of the original mass. The beauty of that type of treatment facility is the fact that people do not have to sort out their kerbside waste. Although that does not educate people in the habit of recycling, it is perhaps an answer for households in areas where recycling facilities are poor or non-existent.</p><p>I hope that the Scottish Government will introduce binding packaging reduction targets for producers and retailers in order to reduce <place-holder colnum=\"9578\"/> significantly the amount of waste that is produced. I look to the minister for assurances that that will happen and that all the foregoing points will be addressed in the forthcoming supermarket summit. I hope that the Scottish Government will put excess packaging right up there as a top priority in its waste strategy, and I look forward to hearing from the minister about what positive actions it will take.

The policy has since evolved to meet society's changing needs so that food safety, preservation of the environment, value for money and agriculture as a source of fuel crops have become key factors.</p><p>Reform of the CAP, under the guidance provided by the Liberal Democrat minister, Ross Finnie, gave farmers greater freedom to decide what crops and livestock to produce. Under the reformed CAP, instead of having to produce specific products to obtain support, farmers can choose what to produce and therefore have an obvious ability to match market demands. At last, it was acknowledged that farmers who are in receipt of CAP support have important responsibilities towards the protection of the environment, animal health and welfare and public health; we in Scotland have a proud track record on all those things.</p><p>The health check is broadly welcomed and we know that it is intended to deliver only an adjustment to the CAP if needed, rather than a sweeping reform.</p><p>There must be a level playing field for farmers in Scotland, so that we can ensure sustainable food production and a successful agriculture industry. Of course, those two elements must run alongside the environmental stewardship of our land, so that Scotland's renowned biodiversity is retained and nurtured, as my amendment states. We cannot have environmental benefits without economic activity on the ground to deliver them.</p><p>The health check includes proposals that aim to simplify the single farm payment scheme, phase out milk quotas fully by 2015 and find ways of protecting livestock production in disadvantaged areas. Those are all welcome moves. There are, however, concerns over the proposals for modulation, which brings me to the key aspect of the Liberal Democrat amendment. Any increases in compulsory modulation by the EU must be tempered with reductions in national voluntary modulation rates. Many farms are already disadvantaged by voluntary modulation, which is not widely practised in other member states; as John Scott said, Portugal is the only country apart from the UK that has voluntary modulation.<place-holder colnum=\"9114\"/></p><p>There is deep concern in the industry over proposals for progressive modulation. Quite frankly, if progressive modulation is implemented, it will result in land being split into smaller, less efficient units, job losses and the discouragement of expansion in the industry. We must remember that Scotland has larger farms than anywhere in Europe, and that much European farming is lifestyle based, rather than a serious food-producing business. Why, therefore, should we put our country at a disadvantage?</p><p>There will be no even-handedness in any system that employs progressive modulation or capping. Large farms with higher numbers of staff will find it impossible to absorb the costs of progressive modulation, and that will undoubtedly cause economic damage. There will be no incentive to expand and develop the business, which will be devastating for our rural economy. The wrong message will also be sent out to future entrants to the industry, at a time when we need to encourage as much young blood as possible. We want to make farming and agriculture an exciting and viable prospect for the next generation.</p><p>As I said, we need economic activity on the ground to maintain and secure our environmental benefits. If progressive modulation and capping are imposed, how will that good environmental work be continued if there are no economically viable farms to manage the land?</p><p>I am sure that members have all read the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association briefing. A direct quotation from one of the association's members states quite categorically that, if progressive modulation became a reality, he would have to either downsize, which would mean getting rid of livestock and labour, or split the holding. Both options would result in smaller, inefficient farming&#8212;just think of the run-rig system of farming back in the 18<sup>th</sup> century and how inefficient that was. Perhaps Jamie McGrigor will discuss that.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats believe that the Scottish rural development programme should be reviewed in the light of concerns over food production and, therefore, food security. We live in an era of just-in-time delivery&#8212;unfortunately, gone are the grain mountains and wine lakes, and here are the times of world food shortages. However, as part of Europe, we can help with that. Food production has to be one of our key priorities.</p><p>In its 2007 manifesto, the Scottish Government said that it would give Scotland a stronger voice in Europe. It also said that it would work proactively to safeguard agricultural support for Scotland's farmers. I cannot emphasise enough that the Scottish Government must stand by its manifesto commitments to Scottish agriculture. I look to the cabinet secretary for clear assurances that he will <place-holder colnum=\"9115\"/> fight the cause for Scotland in Europe as strongly as the Liberal Democrats did for eight years; that he will say no to progressive modulation and capping, for the benefit of our environment, economy and agriculture; and that voluntary modulation will reduce if compulsory modulation increases.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2002.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"considers that any increase in compulsory modulation must be offset by a corresponding reduction in voluntary modulation to ensure that Scottish producers are not put at a competitive disadvantage within the European Union; further considers that Scotland, with its high proportion of large farm units, must not be disadvantaged by proposals for progressive modulation or capping; believes that, in light of rapidly escalating food and fuel costs, the Scottish Rural Development Programme should be reviewed, with the production of food and food security considered as a key priority, and recognises the correlation between economic activity on the ground and delivery of environmental benefits for all.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13714393", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to participate in this important debate and, like John Scott, I declare a farming interest.

Constituents in my region of South of Scotland often complain to me about the lack of decent integrated public transport. The complaints are endless: there are not enough buses, routes do not match and we are still waiting for the Borders railway to start. People are forced to use their cars to get to and from work&#8212;their cars are necessary tools. I live in the heart of the region in the south, but I am 12 miles from the nearest town and, of course, bus stop, so like many others I have no option but to use motorised transport.

We have produced a comprehensive set of policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the UK, and we have a clear long-term strategy for tackling climate change and reducing emissions across the whole economy, with outlined measures to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050. Those plans are the first attempt by any British political party to tackle carbon emissions from every part of the economy: transport, energy, housing, offices and factories.</p><p>Let us look at the evidence. Liberal Democrats led the way by setting the first ever Scottish climate change target of exceeding our share of the UK carbon savings by an additional one million tonnes in 2010. I am sure that the minister acknowledges that Liberal Democrats in the previous Administration invested more in renewables and support for energy efficiency than was invested in any other part of the UK. Scotland's first target on renewable energy generation&#8212;18 per cent by 2010&#8212;was met three years ahead of schedule.</p><p>We need clearly defined and detailed plans from the Scottish Government on how it will tackle climate change. We have heard the rhetoric from Mr Stevenson and his colleagues about how climate change is the biggest challenge that the world faces, but we need real answers, plans and annual targets. I am sure that the Presiding Officer agrees that there are enough greenhouse gases going around in the chamber.

As Hugh O'Donnell and Margaret Curran said, epilepsy affects about 40,000 people in Scotland.</p><p>Epilepsy has been well documented through the ages, from as far back as 5000 BC, when epileptic auras, convulsions and all other aspects of the disease&#8212;called the falling disease then&#8212;were recorded with accurate descriptions. I think that it is still called the falling disease in Gaelic&#8212;Alasdair Allan is nodding.</p><p>Ancient people thought that epilepsy was caused by evil spirits invading a person's body. Priests attempted to cure people of epilepsy by trying to drive the demons out of them. Superstition was challenged by ancient physicians such as Hippocrates of Greece, who recognised a seizure as a dysfunction of the brain and not a supernatural event. Thankfully, we have moved on since then and that interpretation of epilepsy no longer exists, although those past attitudes have left a legacy of stigma and some damaging misconceptions. People with epilepsy continue to face fear, prejudice and discrimination in their everyday lives.</p><p>The condition is complex, which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult. As the motion says&#8212;and as we have heard&#8212;it is important to recognise the role played by Epilepsy Scotland in supporting patients, and to give special recognition to the work carried out by the specialist nurses and medical staff on the ground, and to Allana Parker, who drives the cross-party group on epilepsy, to which I and many other members belong. As we have heard, there are fewer specialist nurses than are needed. The inconsistent nature of specialist services throughout Scotland will leave many epilepsy sufferers at an obvious disadvantage. It is, as has been said, like a postcode lottery.</p><p>Specialist nurses are important because they are highly skilled and experienced in epilepsy or neurology. They provide essential support to newly diagnosed adults and children. There are nurse-led clinics that give people access to specialist help and advice without the need to wait <place-holder colnum=\"7612\"/> for a consultant appointment. They assist with transition clinics, which inform and help young people who are moving from paediatric to adult services. They provide specialist support for pregnant women through dedicated pre-pregnancy and pregnancy clinics. They provide advice and support on drug management, pre-surgery, education, employment and&#8212;as Alasdair Allan mentioned&#8212;driving. They provide education to health professionals who work with people with epilepsy.</p><p>As the motion states, there are five health authorities in Scotland that are without any specialist epilepsy nurses. Of those five, two are in my region and that of the Deputy Presiding Officer&#8212;South of Scotland. NHS Dumfries and Galloway, where there may be about 1,200 epilepsy sufferers, has no specialist nurses. NHS Borders, which covers the area where Alasdair Allan was brought up, may have about 1,000 sufferers, but it too has no specialist nurses.</p><p>Also lagging behind in the region is NHS Ayrshire and Arran, which has only one adult specialist nurse and still needs to fill three posts. NHS Lanarkshire, which is also in the South of Scotland&#8212;it is a huge region, of course&#8212;has one paediatric specialist nurse and one learning disability specialist nurse but still needs to fill another four and a half posts. NHS Lothian has specialist nurses but still needs to fill another three and a half posts.</p><p>I echo what has been said about epilepsy specialist nurses being vital to providing comprehensive, high-quality care for patients.

The previous Executive, and Sarah Boyack in particular, led the way on the protection and enhancement of Scotland's landscapes with the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. The previous Executive also established the Scottish landscape forum, initiated the revision of planning guidance and introduced policies on Scotland's historic environment, as well as agri-environment schemes. It also passed the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 that established the two national parks in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, Ross Finnie, the Lib Dem Minister for Environment and Rural Development announced the intention to create a coastal and <place-holder colnum=\"6984\"/> marine national park, which, it is hoped, will be delivered by 2008. Mr Russell mentioned that, and we look forward to that being progressed. I mention those developments to illustrate the point that we need to invest in managing our landscapes to ensure that the people who live in and visit them use them sustainably and enjoy them.</p><p>We have had debates on the value of open spaces to our health and wellbeing, the value of preserving our natural heritage and the role of landscapes and environments such as national parks in helping to prevent the loss of biodiversity. We also debated recently the importance of forestry to Scotland's economic success. There is still huge potential to develop our market share of renewables. Land managers can work with the national parks to make a real difference in progressing renewable energy and sustainable transport projects. The national parks stand to make a significant contribution to the Scottish climate change programme too.</p><p>As common sense would suggest and as we can all see, there are basic environmental and socioeconomic benefits in using and managing our national parks in the right way. They are areas of land that have been specifically set up with not only conservation in mind, but the social and economic aim of supporting the 31,000-strong population living within their bounds. Perhaps even more people will live there in future, according to Mr Russell.</p><p>The two parks must be recognised as distinct, which is the point of our amendment. They need separate, responsive authorities with locally accountable members on their boards. That is what differentiates Scotland's national parks from other similar areas in the United Kingdom. Included in the parks' objectives and aims should always be a focus on social and economic progress and development.</p><p>That brings me to the key point of my amendment. The park authorities' socioeconomic objectives of promoting the sustainable development of the local communities within its perimeters are hugely important. Effective management of the land should mean job creation, job opportunity and enterprise. We are creating a place in which people want to work and live, and we are supporting the communities that live there.</p><p>The future of the two park authorities is unclear. Mr Russell said that he was interested in keeping two authorities, but he does not support our amendment, so there is some confusion, which I am sure that Mr Lochhead will clarify in his summing up. Professor Neil Kay's recent report recommends a root and branch review of their <place-holder colnum=\"6985\"/> functions and suggests that they should be rolled into SNH.

As John Scott mentioned, it is obviously important to streamline any organisation to ensure its efficiency, particularly when public money is involved. However, whatever the outcome, the minister must ensure that the work and aims of the two authorities are not compromised in any way.</p><p>A core Liberal Democrat value is that decisions should be made as close to where the effects occur as possible and by people who are affected. It is therefore vital, whatever changes occur in future, that elected members, practitioners and grass-roots stakeholders are fully integrated into the decision-making process and that the park authorities are given freedom to make appropriate decisions for their areas. In other words, it should be regional rather than centralised decision making. That goes to the heart of the review and, bearing that in mind, full consideration should be given to the existing park boundaries. I am glad that Mr Russell is considering the southern boundary of one park.</p><p>I hope that, whatever happens with the upcoming quinquennial review of the national parks, the Scottish Government will ensure a prosperous future for our national parks. I am concerned that the natural heritage budget will reduce in real terms by 0.9 per cent, so I hope that the Parliament will support my amendment and recognise the socioeconomic benefits of the national parks and their two governing authorities.

Sarah Boyack clearly stated the achievements of the Liberal Democrat minister with responsibility for rural affairs in the previous two Administrations. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, Aileen Campbell, Elaine Murray, Jeremy Purvis and Cathy Jamieson all mentioned the South of Scotland region, and I am concerned that the report states that there is a particular problem with social exclusion in that region. I am sure that the Deputy Presiding Officer and the Minister for Environment&#8212;like me, they represent the South of Scotland&#8212;agree that that is an issue.</p><p>The debate identified several areas of concern in rural Scotland: transport infrastructure; the availability of affordable housing, which Mike Rumbles clearly stated as being an issue; economic diversification; and links between urban and rural settings. If those areas are developed in the right way, they will help to tackle social exclusion. It goes without saying that we should be aiming for sustainable economic diversification, <place-holder colnum=\"6764\"/> whether through tourism, through supporting small businesses to expand, or simply by making the most of our countryside.</p><p>If pursued properly and in a balanced way, those activities would, in turn, create a sustainable environment for the vital communities that make up the fabric of the region. If rural areas were made economically attractive, people would be drawn into them and young people would be encouraged to stay in them. That would ensure a diverse population, which is particularly important. Depopulation and ageing are among the major threats to rural areas that are mentioned in the report and which have been mentioned in the debate&#8212;indeed, the cabinet secretary mentioned them.</p><p>Public transport infrastructure, which Rob Gibson mentioned, and affordable housing are key to sustaining a productive population. Only today, I opened a letter from a constituent who has been unable to obtain affordable housing. After months of trying all the local housing associations, he is now making plans to leave the town in which he and his partner grew up. They will take their skills elsewhere.</p><p>Public transport provision in Scotland is patchy, to say the least, and the situation in the south has again been highlighted. I look forward to hearing how the Government and the minister will address that problem in a rural context.</p><p>Robin Harper mentioned the environment. I was interested in Peter Peacock's views on the rural development programme. I have concerns. The report mentions the large funds that have been put into agri-environmental areas, but we are at the bottom of the European pile for funding. The situation was not helped by a certain Labour ex-Prime Minister bargaining funds away in 2005 from pillar 2 to the European Union general budget, at a cost to Scotland of &#163;60 million, with nothing in return.</p><p>Regionalisation is heavily featured in the report as a more effective approach than centralising services. In light of the cabinet secretary's warm welcome for the report, his approach seems at odds with his Government's policy. I refer to two recent examples in that context: Scottish Enterprise, which many members have mentioned, and VisitScotland.</p><p>I was astounded to hear John Scott supporting Jeremy Purvis's stance on retaining funding for Scottish Enterprise Borders. In, I think, the very seat that John Scott is sitting in, the Tory party's Derek Brownlee welcomed the dismantling of the Scottish Enterprise structure. It is a little concerning to find out the Tories' views on that matter.

That is especially true in the south-west, where the local enterprise company has specialised in forestry innovation. We have the new E.ON plant, which David Stewart mentioned and which produces electricity from locally grown willow. I will return to that issue. The forestry industry, like any other, lives in a dynamic world and therefore needs to change. The key to any industry's advancement is innovation. That can mean simply finding new markets for old products&#8212;which requires the industry to compete on the world market&#8212;or, better still, it can mean finding new products for emerging markets.</p><p>Renewable energy is an emerging market that I studied in a previous life when I was a trustee of <place-holder colnum=\"5949\"/> the Borders Forest Trust. I am glad that the minister has visited the trust. About 10 years ago, I visited East Tyrol on the continent to see its community heating plants, which use local forestry waste products to produce hot water&#8212;simple brash is used to give warm baths. The first plant that I saw was in a rural location and fed hot water to about 300 disparate houses through a mains supply. At worst, the water in the main loses 1&#176; C, in an area where I have seen snow in August. The fuel is simply brashings and bark, chipped to a regular size and naturally dried. Because all carbon residue is filtered out before it escapes into the atmosphere, the emissions are so clean that if somebody goes into the plant with a cigarette, the smoke alarm goes off. That plant is far better than having 300 boilers running with different effectiveness and having oil and gas transported in from who knows where to warm homes, while the profits from the heat go not just out of the community but out of the country.</p><p>Another plant that I saw on that and subsequent visits was the Stadw&#228;rme plant in Lienz. The town lies at the bottom of three valleys and had problems with pollution lying on it, which were addressed with a co-generation plant that feeds warm water to up to 5,000 houses and produces about 22MW of electricity from biomass in its two combined plants. It is hoped to get the figure up to 75MW fairly soon. That is all done using local wood products, with little processing involved. David Stewart mentioned a plant that used pellets, but the Lienz plant uses bulldozed-in waste products from the wood industry.</p><p>At the last count that I did, which was two or three years ago, Austria, with a population of about 8.5 million, had more than 700 community district heating plants. Scotland can and should do that, too&#8212;it is not rocket science. The technology exists already and can be improved. I want Scotland to be at the forefront on biomass energy, not only because it is good for the environment&#8212;as has been mentioned, it tackles our carbon footprint&#8212;but because it is good for the health of our people and, which is important, good for local economies. With such schemes, money that is spent on energy is spent locally and therefore does not go out of the economy. Also, if the whole energy process is local, that helps people to understand where their power comes from.</p><p>I lodged my amendment to strengthen Mr Russell's motion. The minister mentioned the expansion of forestry. I hope that members agree that that should be done in a way that does not exclude others and that includes all. I have mentioned before the importance of integrating existing land users with any expansion of forestry. The Borders Forest Trust has been involved in prime examples of that. I hope that the minister agrees that such integration is essential.

By providing young children with experiences, we give learning potential a helping hand. As the Lib Dem environment spokesman, I want to focus on that subject.</p><p>Through learning through play in places such as nature kindergartens, which Robert Brown mentioned, children figure out not only how the world works but how it can work for them. Nature kindergartens on the continent have even been <place-holder colnum=\"5827\"/> used successfully to help the children of drug addicts. Frau Kutsch's project in Germany, fully supported by Chancellor Merkel, celebrates its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. We have a lot to learn from such projects. In the south, campaigner Sibylle Alexander has fought for many years for nature kindergartens to become part of our national curriculum, and I have full sympathy with that.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be brought up in the country. Being 12 miles from the nearest town I may have missed out on being able just to go down the park to play football with my mates, but I did have the benefit of living with nature all around and, of course, of understanding it fairly well. But this past generation has changed. A distance has appeared between urban and rural lives; no longer do most urban kids have a relation who works on the land and understands it. It is therefore up to us to ensure that the gap is bridged.</p><p>It is not always possible to take kids out to the environment, but it is possible to bring the environment to the kids. Among many other innovative projects, Borders Forest Trust, which works throughout the south of Scotland, runs a successful playground initiative&#8212;I declare that I am a past trustee. The initiative encourages school kids to plan and fund their own playgrounds that include indigenous trees and furniture made with local craftsmen under another initiative called butts to benches, in which local wood is made into highly imaginative pieces of furniture. If anyone is interested, they can see a red squirrel shaped bench, leaf shaped benches and even one in the shape of a dolphin. Those playgrounds, of which there are 35 to date, can also include wildlife gardens, ponds, sensory plantings, special needs gardens and murals. All of them are different and all are fired by the children's imagination, which is in turn fired by the initiative. That project is proven to improve understanding of the environment, increase urban green space and raise awareness of local issues.</p><p>As Liberal Democrat environment spokesman and a South of Scotland MSP, my focus in this debate has rightly been on the benefits that the south has derived from environmental outdoor education, with some local initiatives from which all should benefit&#8212;urban and rural. That is echoed in Elizabeth Smith's motion. Understanding our environment better, learning new skills, seeing a lump of wood turn into a dolphin shaped bench and acorns grow into great oaks can only better prepare kids for a holistic understanding of the planet on which we live.

We have a moral duty to look after our flora and fauna, but we also know about the significant economic benefits that our landscape brings to us, for example from outdoor activities and green tourism. Anyone who visits Scotland will say that they come here for its magnificent scenery and natural heritage.</p><p>There are also marine interests. Game fish such as salmon and trout contribute about &#163;112 million to the Scottish economy, and aquatic invertebrates make an indirect contribution to the game fish industry as a food source. The Scottish offshore fishing industry depends largely on sustainable populations of herring and haddock. Invertebrates such as shrimp, mussels, langoustines and lobsters make a vital contribution to the economy of coastal communities.</p><p>Any ecologist will say that biodiversity does not just happen. As I have said often, we need economic activity on the ground or in the water to benefit our environment. Our grazed upland pasture has been hailed as among the most biodiverse in Europe, and our wild mountain thyme would not be blooming around our purple heather without the benefits of sheep grazing. Our birdlife benefits from cattle. Therefore, existing flora and fauna need to be nurtured and looked after. I agree that we must look after our biodiversity by looking at the wider ecosystem. It is important to build from the bottom up with the help and understanding of practitioners.</p><p>We need more emphasis to be put on planting native species within forestry as part of any work to improve wildlife habitats. I have played a part in such work as a Borders Forest Trust trustee and a member of the South of Scotland regional forestry forum. We must also preserve and improve our peatlands, which are important as carbon sinks and for their unique biodiversity. An increase in funding through the biodiversity action plan grant scheme would be most welcome.</p><p>I come to the point behind my amendment. Obviously, it is important to have agencies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, SNH, the Scottish Executive&#8212;I think that the former Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department had six representatives at the previous core forum meeting of the Scottish Biodiversity Committee&#8212;the Forestry Commission, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the RSPB, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the National Trust for Scotland at the helm of the Scottish Biodiversity Committee, but the biodiversity strategy would be better delivered through broader, vertically integrated stakeholder involvement. As the strategy directly affects not only farmers, but land managers and practitioners, forestry interests, tourism, fishing interests and <place-holder colnum=\"5518\"/> sporting interests, it is important that stakeholders in such areas take a meaningful interest in it. That would, of course, help to meet the target of suffering no further losses in biodiversity by 2010, and would ensure that all stakeholders are engaged and heard so that an objective that we all share can be met in a way that benefits everyone.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396925", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Biodiversity Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the biodiversity report and the improvements that are outlined in it, but I share the minister's concerns.

My Westminster colleague Michael Moore lodged a motion strongly opposing the proposals, and Liberal Democrat councillors throughout the south of Scotland have added their voices to the collective opposition, as have Conservatives and independents. Like others, I met Paddy Merrall of Border TV and Vicky Nash of Ofcom here at Holyrood. We expressed our strong opposition to the plans.</p><p>The success of Border TV lies in good quality, relevant regional and local news coverage and programming that is relevant to the people. Frankly, that will not get a look in if ITV Border is operated from Tyne Tees or STV. We see little coverage of the south of Scotland from the BBC and I doubt whether anyone in Gateshead knows where we are.</p><p>Border TV's region incorporates three distinct cultures&#8212;English, Scottish and Manx&#8212;but we are all united as Borderers. For centuries, we contested the border or debatable lands, not caring whether we were ruled from Edinburgh or London. We have not changed. I will not bore the Parliament again by repeating some of the Border reiver names, but some of them went on to shape <place-holder colnum=\"4618\"/> the world&#8212;Armstrong, Douglas, Graham, Bell, Chamberlain, the Bruce, Burns, Nixon, Scott, Murray, who was Roosevelt's ancestor, and of course Hume.</p><p>Under the changes, Border's flagship news programme \"Lookaround\" would be axed within two years and replaced with 10 minutes of local news that would be slotted into a nightly broadcast by Tyne Tees, which is based in Gateshead. The audience figures for \"Lookaround\" show that it is one of the highest rating programmes of any BBC or ITV region in the country, as John Lamont mentioned.</p><p>The important point is that we are talking about a public broadcasting service that has operated successfully at the local level since 1961, which is before I was born&#8212;just. Border TV has always provided a regional service since its inception. The region enjoys good coverage of the common ridings festivals, for example. Borderers are passionate about the common ridings tradition, which dates back nearly 500 years. The festivals are unique and unequalled in the rest of Scotland.</p><p>Presiding Officer, you and Elaine Murray are well aware of the Dumfries and Galloway side of Border TV's area, which has the immensely popular and successful Wigtown book festival. I hear that any coverage of that 10-day event will be lost if the merge with Tyne Tees or STV goes ahead.</p><p>It is 145 miles from Gateshead to Wigtown and 180 miles from the furthest point in the Border TV area to Gateshead. That is a nine-hour round trip. The logistics are madness. It is same as going from here to Ullapool in the north or to Birmingham in the south. The Border TV region is already vast enough.</p><p>I plead with Ofcom, as a public interest body, to take the public view on board and to reject any formal merger proposals that arrive from ITV. We are talking about a public broadcasting service that has served its viewers very well. It has the viewing records to prove it.

It is difficult to disagree with today's motion, which is neither new nor substantial.</p><p>As a former South of Scotland regional forestry forum member and Borders forest trustee, I am well acquainted with the work that has gone on in previous years to increase the use of woodlands and green space. In 2005, &#163;1 million was given to Greenspace Scotland for community woodlands&#8212;ten times the &#163;100,000 that has been promised to the Forestry Commission today. Back in the early 90s, two community woodlands sprang to life in the Borders, the main one being Wooplaw community woodland between Lauder and Galashiels&#8212;one of the first in the country&#8212;which was founded by the late, great Tim Stead and many locals. Tim is now buried in that woodland, <place-holder colnum=\"4321\"/> and his work as a wood sculptor can be seen in the millennium clock up at the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers street. The woodland focuses on education, training, art, recreation and the sustainable production of forest products. Lochend Wood in East Lothian is also managed successfully and wetland areas there are contributing to the local wildlife.</p><p>There is a well-known link between health, well-being and activity, and the use of our outdoor environment. It has been shown that the percentage of green space in people's environment is positively associated with their perceived general health. That is not to mention the opportunity for using green spaces for nature kindergarten&#8212;I am disappointed that the minister does not support that. The benefits of educating the youngest children to their environment are well known and we are lagging behind in that.</p><p>With that in mind, I had hoped that the recent planning policy on open space and physical activity would keep the new national minimum standards for open space that were detailed in the consultation on the policy. The original version of the policy required all local authorities either to adopt the national minimum standards and thresholds, or set higher ones. By the time that the guidelines for local authorities were issued earlier this month, all reference to minimum standards had been removed.</p><p>People should feel proud of where they live. Using community woodlands and other green space to improve people's health will undoubtedly have positive effects&#8212;on, for example, the National Health Service and the economy&#8212;as a healthier workforce means people taking fewer days off sick. However, 40 per cent of people in urban areas think that the quality of their green space has deteriorated in the past five years and that figure is higher in deprived areas. We need to do more to recognise the links between green spaces, activity and good health.</p><p>There is ample opportunity to use land that was previously developed and is now derelict to help regenerate communities. If they are engaged, people will want to improve the communities in which they live. They will then enjoy their surroundings and will benefit as a direct result. That is not to mention the environmental benefit of transforming a brown space into a green space&#8212;trees, of course, being the lungs of the earth.</p><p>Adequate resources are necessary to create and maintain path networks and outdoor education services. The Scottish Government must ensure that local authorities develop their core path plans in order to improve access. In the rural situation, we have to work in co-operation with the land users. There is an example of that in the Ettrick flood plain habitat plan, in which 12 local farmers <place-holder colnum=\"4322\"/> entered into management agreements that included times for cutting their hay and fertiliser application et cetera. That is now one of the largest flood plain woodland restorations in the United Kingdom. No-one wants to dislodge land users from their land when both can live hand in hand. Such co-operation is important and it works; I could happily provide the minister with a long list of examples from my previous experience.</p><p>The creation of community woodlands, footpath and cycle networks is good for our health and our education, and we know that it is possible&#8212;projects are, and have been, happening all over the country. I have planted into the tens of thousands of trees. I wonder how many the minister&#8212;personally&#8212;has planted. Creating woodlands can be an opportunity for traditional rural businesses and it needs to be managed in the right way, to benefit everyone.</p><p>I hope that the minister sees some light. I am happy to move amendment S3M-1008.4, to leave out from \"and calls\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"believes that the voluntary and public sectors can work proactively to promote the use of existing woodland and other greenspace, particularly by young people, through such activities as nature kindergartens, outdoor education centres and footpath networks; recognises the importance of local authorities developing core path plans in improving public access to greenspace; further recognises the need to work with land managers to increase access to land through management contract incentives; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to commit to long-term funding to sustain better access for everyone to urban and rural woodland and greenspace through management contract incentives; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that local authorities create better public access to their area by developing and implementing core path plans, and calls on the environmental and health sectors to work together to further develop the contribution of woodland and other greenspace to Scotland's health.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394242", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Woodland and Green Spaces"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Liberal Democrats in the debate.

I am sure that, as you are a fellow South of Scotland member, you will be pleased that I speak today on behalf of the other half of Scotland, which everybody seems to forget about.</p><p>Tourism is an important part of the south of Scotland, with its mountainous uplands, rolling farmland and rugged sea coasts. It is a land of ancient buildings and it boasts strong literary connections: Burns, Hogg and Sir Walter Scott all lived there. Scotland's gateway is the border to the south. The scenery changes there, with the peaks of the big Cheviot and the Eildon hills. Those landmarks have been seen by generations of travellers at the Carter Bar on the A68, or Dere Street as it was called&#8212;the ancient Roman road that passes through the old Roman town site of Trimontium near Melrose. Of course, there are the forests and moors of upland Galloway and the greens of Ayrshire's pastures, with the mountainous Arran as a backdrop.</p><p>That brings me to my first point. In real terms, the budget for natural heritage, the water <place-holder colnum=\"3904\"/> environment and coastal protection has been cut. That is worrying for areas such as the south of Scotland, because if we are to continue to draw first-time and repeat visitors, it is crucial that we maintain the environment and the coastline. From a purely practical point of view, it is worth noting that the south of Scotland is close to Ireland, England and the rest of Scotland. It is within an hour of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Carlisle, Newcastle and Belfast. The latter is a huge, as yet untapped, market.</p><p>Tourism needs infrastructure, such as direct flights through Prestwick. Good quality, clean and efficient integrated transport is key to allowing visitors to get around and enjoy all of Scotland. That is critical, especially as the market is dominated by short breaks. A balance has to be struck, of course, between exploiting and protecting our environment. I believe that nature-based tourism is an example of the possibilities in the future.</p><p>The south of Scotland is not lacking in history either. The battle of Flodden in 1513 saw the bloodiest battle between the Scots and the English. Commemorations still take place each year, with Flodden day in the Berwickshire town of Coldstream and the Hawick and Selkirk common ridings, not to forget Gala. In the past, battles were daily occurrences. Events such as the much-lamented MacDonald and Campbell tragedy in the Highlands were commonplace, almost everyday, occurrences.</p><p>In the south, reiver families were the front line of Scotland, and we remember the strong family reiving names that still hold fast there&#8212;Douglas, Scott, Armstrong, Elliot, and those wardens of the eastern marches, the Humes. In the south, there are obvious opportunities for the 2009 year of homecoming. \"Wha daur meddle wi me?\" was an oft-quoted saying from reiving culture, the reivers not caring whether they&#8212;I should say we&#8212;were led from London or Edinburgh.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

The one supports the other. If tourism is buoyant, small rural businesses will flourish, which will encourage more visitors to come and see their products and what they do, whether it be rare books in Wigtown&#8212;home of Scotland's book festival, which is a hugely successful event&#8212;specialities such as are found at the Teviot Game Fare Smokery or the water gardens near Kelso. There is also the recently refurbished home of John Davidson, village souter, who was immortalised as Souter Johnny in Robbie Burns's \"Tam o' Shanter\".</p><p>As well as history and scenery, there are a great number of activities in the south, such as mountain biking. Stow, near Galashiels, boasts not just the first Scottish person to become a world champion mountain biker, but the UK's first world champion, Ruaridh Cunningham. Mountain biking is huge in the south, with the 7stanes project and the Tweed valley adventure sports sites of Traquair and Glentress, which attract around 400,000 visitors a year and will be the site of a proposed chairlift facility as part of the Scottish Enterprise Borders pipeline adventure sports project. Dave Thompson mentioned Whistler. The person who runs the Whistler park came to Glentress and was hugely impressed. More visitors come to Glentress than go to Whistler for mountain biking. Sites such as those need all the launch funding they can be given, for the greater benefit to our economy.</p><p>Angling, diving, walking and bird watching are all catered for in the south. RSPB Scotland has numerous bird attractions. I recently visited two at the Wood of Cree, near Newton Stewart, and at Mersehead, near Kippford. I can tell David Stewart that we have osprey viewing centres at Glentress, too. We also have a film heritage, including \"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes\" and the not-so-well-known \"Flass the Sheepdog\", which was filmed at my farm back in the 1960s.

Myrica gale&#8212;to use its botanical name&#8212;is happy in the damp, acidic soils that are common in Scotland.</p><p>In 2006, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise commissioned a report into the business opportunities for Scottish growers, the wider economic benefits for Scotland and the attached risks. It covered the expected value to Scottish farming; the value to seed and plant providers; the capacity for research and development related to the plant; manufacturing and job opportunities; the promotion of a natural Scottish product by a major multinational; the cultivation process; transport logistics; the distillation process; and timing issues in terms of production profile versus market requirements. The report concluded that there are significant opportunities for Scotland, both in the Highlands and Islands and in the South of Scotland, in the commercial production of bog myrtle.</p><p>This debate is a timely reminder of the importance of the Scottish Enterprise network in identifying new economic ventures and of the role of local enterprise companies in bringing those ventures to their areas. I am thinking of the work of the Borders LEC on farming and the extensive work of Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway on forestry opportunities.</p><p>Key to the success of any initiative are two things. First, there must be an open and co-operative supply chain, with commercial contracts, so that propagators and growers are given a fair price and receive assurance about uptake of their product. In the past, cereal growers have faced problems with their contracts in those respects. Fair trade here would protect the investment of Boots and lessen the risk for the grower.</p><p>Secondly, there should be access to the rural development plan&#8212;which has been mentioned&#8212;and support for growers, as well as for nurseries. The agricultural business development scheme, the farm business development scheme and the agricultural processing and marketing grant <place-holder colnum=\"3784\"/> scheme are now all closed to applicants. I hope that the minister will note that and make money available through the new rural development plan for farm diversification into, for example, alternative, non-food products.</p><p>There is demand for bog myrtle. Earlier in the year, it was estimated that bog myrtle could generate &#163;5 million for rural areas&#8212;maybe more if it was exported to America. Additional income would be welcomed by any landowner or farmer, but with any new product there are risks. Plants do not always survive, and the cost of establishing plants can be up to &#163;7,000 per hectare. There are trial plots in the Highlands, and Alba Trees of East Lothian&#8212;in my region&#8212;and the Buccleuch Group have successfully propagated 250,000 plants, proving that propagation can be successful in Scotland.</p><p>Bog myrtle shows that there are opportunities in rural Scotland, but it is no panacea. We should invest in research into such opportunities, not just from plants but from existing traditional rural industries. I am thinking of the use of wool in the building industry and in brakes in aerosystems; the use of cereals in packaging, lubricants, resins, fuels and textiles; and even the use of nettles in fine cloth, which has already happened. All of that can be done in Scotland, not just in the Highlands but in the South of Scotland.</p><p>Bog myrtle can be marketed as an entirely natural Scottish product. I look forward to the Government supporting this innovative product&#8212;no moaning about myrtle&#8212;and supporting other alternative uses for traditional agricultural products.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392944", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bog Myrtle (Sweet Gale)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is obvious.

Most people would find it impossible to argue against the use of local food, which benefits not only the economy but our health and the planet. To put it simply, the use of local food benefits our health, wealth and mother earth.</p><p>As with last week's debate on Scotland's historic environment, it is extremely difficult to disagree with the terms of the motion. I am glad that the cabinet secretary acknowledged that the motion lacks detail and expressed his party's support for the Liberal Democrat amendment, which covers the points that were made in June, both in my motion and during the debate.</p><p>In that debate, I talked about the use that East Ayrshire Council had made of a modest &#163;30,000 from the hungry for success initiative to augment existing resources to fund its healthy eating schools pilot project. Such initiatives are crucial in developing and thereafter maintaining the use of fresh and locally produced food in the public sector. I look to the cabinet secretary and his education colleagues for clarification of what replacement funding will be put in place when the present funding comes to an end. Given that it is undeniable that the hungry for success project has played a vital role in East Ayrshire and that it has benefited our young people, I hope that the Scottish Government will put funding in place beyond 2008.</p><p>It is perceived that procurement rules can be a hindrance, but that need not be the case. As Shirley-Anne Somerville said, France, Italy and parts of Scandinavia have successful purchasing systems that push the competitive balance in favour of small, local producers and which are similar to those that were used in the East Ayrshire project. The fact that they focus on freshness and seasonality helps local suppliers to bid for contracts that have been broken down into smaller parts.</p><p>In a global marketplace, it is difficult to persuade the larger retailers to regularly use a significant amount of Scottish produce.

However, we all agree that it is nonsensical to buy in food from countries thousands of miles away. Such a practice removes the economic benefit from Scotland and means compromising on the quality and freshness of the food that we eat. In addition, consumers want produce to be available all year round, which results in out-of-season fruit and vegetables being shipped in from far away.</p><p>It is probably impossible to change every consumer's mindset because people always want variety and choice at a reasonable price.

In the past, the company has declared a commitment to the south-west of Scotland that it does not seem to be putting into practice now. The news of the 89 jobs to be lost this time round is disappointing, to say the least. I hope that the company will review its decision and reduce the number as it did in February, when 120 job losses became 100.</p><p>Our sea-fishing and related industries and their communities are mutually dependent. Not only are those industries integral to the heritage and traditions of the communities; they are also essential building blocks for the future of the local economies. From the perspective of the changes that are taking place in much of rural Scotland, those industries are vital to retaining population and, hence, viable communities. A greater proportion of the south of Scotland's economy depends on agri-food industries than is the case for the national economy, which clearly demonstrates the need for that sector to be retained within the region. I hope that the minister takes note of that.</p><p>Of course, there are several financial considerations for any company. It makes sense to locate a business where it is most cost effective for the goods to be processed, according to the business guru Michael E Porter in his \"Competitive Advantage of Nations\". Having the Annan operations temporarily relocated to Grimsby, following the fire in March, will perhaps have given the company's management a chance to see another way of working&#8212;a way that is probably less costly.</p><p>However, the company has a moral obligation to the local community in Annan. That is why I agree with the motion that the consultation period should be extended to 90 days. The company should make the relocation options clear to those who face redundancy and everything should be done to help employees who wish to relocate. With transfers of work to Cromer, Fraserburgh and Grimsby, employees at Annan will have physical reasons why they cannot move so far to follow their jobs&#8212;their families and finances and so on. I hope therefore that the company will offer an appropriate redundancy package and that employees will be given time to take stock. We also need the company to give a meaningful commitment to the area. As Elaine Murray said, we do not want to see it as a big fridge.</p><p>This most recent development is a sad reminder that much of our food and drink processing is being outsourced to cheaper units abroad because of globalisation. The 100 job losses at the Young's plant in February occurred when the prawn de-shelling was relocated to Thailand. That <place-holder colnum=\"2914\"/> is a 17,000-mile round trip with, of course, environmental costs, as John Park said. Most members who are in the chamber this evening will be aware of my interest in the use of local produce, and I will be interested to hear about the Government's progress on that, but using the food that Scotland has on offer is just a small part of that. It is a great pity that, in some circumstances, the use of Scottish produce is blighted when the economic advantage of processing it elsewhere is so great. It is shipped to other countries and then shipped back. It is beyond sensible reasoning and removes economic benefit from Scotland for what will be a relatively small saving to a company of the size of Young's. It is unsustainable, as is lamb flying in from New Zealand and beef from Brazil where, interestingly, farmers are now losing money on their products.</p><p>I hope that the debate can be used to highlight the importance of ensuring the security of sustainable local economies and what they mean to their communities, particularly those in rural areas.

I have had regular meetings with farmers and people in related industries who have spoken passionately and eloquently not only about their businesses but about what they see as their way of life&#8212;a life that has to be profitable to have a future. Agriculture benefits Scotland both economically and environmentally. I have some facts here with which all members will be familiar: Scotland's farmers produce output&#8212;including whisky&#8212;worth &#163;2.4 billion a year to the Scottish economy; and one in 10 of all Scottish jobs is dependent on agriculture, with the agri-food sector now the UK's largest manufacturing sector.</p><p>However, it is not just about economics and money. Yes, there are clear economic benefits to the country, but having a long-term secured and profitable agriculture sector also means that land managers are looking after the land and its habitats. Some have had access to agri-environment schemes, such as the rural stewardship scheme, whose re-implementation we are still waiting for. Because of that, our farmers have been able to ensure the sustainable future of our countryside's flora and fauna. Scotland's diverse wildlife has made it one of the best tourist attractions in the world. Scotland's grazed upland pasture land, with its high nature value, is among the most biodiverse in Europe, only because of the way in which it is farmed with grazing animals. Conservation groups are concerned that if farming stops in those fragile areas, Scotland's nature will be badly affected.</p><p>As we have all sadly witnessed, foot-and-mouth has had a devastating impact on rural Scotland and, in particular, on the export-dependent sheep industry. Unfortunately, that has not been helped by the major buyers, who have been opportunistic in making money. The only competition&#8212;exporting&#8212;has been taken out of the equation, with sheep prices in rapid decline and, according to the recent press, in meltdown. It further shows the absolute need for an independent ombudsman to see that producers get a fair price in relation to the price that is charged in the supermarkets, where the prices have not come down.</p><p>The cabinet secretary heard from the NFUS this week that emergency aid must be delivered to <place-holder colnum=\"2606\"/> Scotland's livestock farmers \"to avoid that meltdown\". That turn of phrase is not an understatement. If there has to be a focus, it should be on a meaningful&#8212;not &#163;6 a head&#8212;payment for sheep. That figure represents about half the estimated losses per ewe. We should also focus on the LFASS supplements, which could easily have been quickly released. I hope that the cabinet secretary sees today's announcement as an interim announcement and, in conjunction with Westminster, continues to pursue a more comprehensive package for all agriculture.</p><p>I have always been positive about agriculture, which was flourishing until this outbreak, but on this occasion I am left feeling very despondent. I am despondent for two reasons: first, because the industry is suffering badly, through no fault of its own; and secondly, because the UK and Scottish Governments appear not to be taking the resultant dire situation seriously enough or acting quickly enough to save an industry that is the third largest employer in rural Scotland. I find that insensitive, to say the least, and I am astonished at the disregard that has been displayed by those in a position of authority who have&#8212;to use that all-important phrase&#8212;decision-making powers.

I have been involved in conservation throughout my working life, so I am glad to sum up on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Fresh in our minds is the recent and tragic poisoning of a golden eagle in Peeblesshire in my region. There is significant evidence that such illegal activity is seriously damaging populations of golden eagles and other birds of prey. Such activity is not just devastating to Scotland's biodiversity but potentially damaging to the economy. The Galloway red kite trail alone is thought to bring around &#163;750,000 to the region each year.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham referred to products that are used to carry out illegal killings. Such products are often banned in this country and are illegally imported&#8212;that appears to have been the case in the Peeblesshire incident. HM Revenue and Customs should be alerted not just to the illegal importation of meat products that can lead to foot and mouth disease but to the seriousness of bringing illegal pesticides into the UK. Let us tackle the issue at source.</p><p>Scotland's wildlife protection laws are among the best in Europe, so why do we have such a problem? Liberal Democrats in the previous Scottish Executive significantly improved our capacity for effective wildlife policing, through the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. Despite that, in 2006 Scotland had the worst figures for illegal poisoning for at least 25 years, so we need people in place to ensure that the law is enforced. Each police force should have at least one full-time wildlife crime officer and back-up from part-time wildlife crime officers, as has been the case in Lothian and Borders Police since 2005&#8212;the force was the first to have such an arrangement. Thereafter, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service must pursue wildlife crimes vigorously.</p><p>Proper co-operation between Scotland's police forces is all-important, and by placing dedicated wildlife crime officers throughout Scotland we will ensure that there is greater synchronicity between regions and with the national wildlife crime unit. That will lead to better investigation, prosecution and record keeping. We would appreciate advice from the minister on the steps that his department is taking to ensure that at least one full-time serving officer is appointed as a wildlife crime officer in each Scottish force.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that, as well as having the people in place to investigate wildlife crimes, we also need a system that delivers uniformity in applying penalties, so that the existing legislation successfully acts as a proper deterrent. The Scottish Government needs to review the use of penalties by the courts and to encourage the Crown Office to press for full use in all cases. Our <place-holder colnum=\"2529\"/> ministers need to review the process of recording wildlife crime, so that its full extent, its trends and the effectiveness of efforts to deal with it are clearer.</p><p>There are evidence-gathering problems, for example in cases in which evidence is considered inadmissible in court because the person who reported the crime did not have the landowner's permission to be on the land. With that in mind, I welcome the SRPBA's willingness to help in stamping out wildlife crime, as well as that of the BASC, the SEBG and the SGA, which have all been mentioned.</p><p>The minister told us in August about the measures to deal with wildlife crime that his department is considering. One suggestion was the possibility of stopping single farm payments. I have heard some clarification on that today, but I still urge serious caution when considering such a measure. If a landowner or farmer is implicated in wildlife crime and as being in breach of cross-compliance, their payments can be reduced by 1 to 5 per cent where they are shown to be negligent. If the action or omission is intentional, the penalty can go up to 100 per cent. That is important, because unlike criminal prosecutions the lower civil standard of proof is used to decide whether or not cross-compliance requirements have been breached. If there is no criminal prosecution, cross-compliance penalties can still be applied. The civil standard of proof relates to the balance of probability, and if an inspector can provide evidence to show the probability, they can say that there has been a breach.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is Jim Hume, Trish.

The Parliament should acknowledge their efforts. Very few campaigns in Scotland have gained support from all the major parties. The campaign grabbed the attention of the south of Scotland as a result of the campaigners' dedication, which was so great that they spent five and a half days walking in dignified fashion from the campus in Dumfries to the University of Glasgow&#8212;Elaine Murray mentioned that.</p><p>I am sure that the campaign will continue, because continue it has to&#8212;the eye cannot be taken off the ball. The Crichton campus is a wonderful example of how dedication and co-operation can overcome obstacles to the provision of liberal arts and other university courses in an area that, until recently, was devoid of such a valuable asset.</p><p>The Crichton has succeeded in attracting young people into university education from families where that has not been the norm. Importantly, it has overwhelmingly surpassed expectations in encouraging age and gender groups back into education, where others have struggled to do that. Praise indeed has to go to the Crichton for being Scotland's first multi-institutional campus.</p><p>With any co-operative project, buy-in from stakeholders is important. On this occasion, the stakeholders are many and varied. As other members have said, they are the University of Paisley, Bell College and, of course and importantly, the University of Glasgow. In addition, the stakeholders include the local enterprise company, the Crichton Development Company and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;the staff and students, not only those from the south-west of Scotland whom the campaign directly affects but those who come from all over to study at the campus.<place-holder colnum=\"1542\"/></p><p>The Crichton offers a great environment in which to work. To those members who have not visited the campus, I say that it is probably one of the most beautiful educational sites in the United Kingdom. It is therefore highly appropriate that new investment is being made in a carbon centre at the campus, given the south-west of Scotland's expertise in the forestry industry, which is aided by Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway. An example of such innovation and past Executive support can be seen nearby at the E.ON UK biomass plant at Lockerbie, which promises to create 300 jobs in the area and to use an estimated 220,000 tonnes of renewable wood products per year to produce electricity. Of course, that was kick-started by the Liberal Democrats in coalition.</p><p>I am sure that most members and the wider public will agree with me about the welcome nature of the cabinet secretary's announcement of the extra &#163;1.5 million. Let us hope that the Administration is not just handing out a token sweetie&#8212;although I could do with a sweetie this afternoon. The announcement may be welcome, but an assurance that no other education projects or institutions will suffer as a result of that movement of funds would also have been welcome. The cabinet secretary has addressed the issue to some extent, but I am sure that we all agree on the usefulness of seeing the exact details and conditions.</p><p>Marketing the campus is essential. I am sure that damage was done in the past as a result of uncertainty about whether the University of Glasgow would stay involved in the project. We heard Hugh Henry and Jeremy Purvis express their concerns about the level of future demand from students. I urge stakeholders, including the cabinet secretary's department, to come up with a detailed marketing plan for the campus and its courses in order to ensure continued long-term demand. Staff also need to receive assurances that no redundancies are in the offing.</p><p>We Liberal Democrats, students&#8212;past and present&#8212;and, of course, staff need to see the Government make a long-term commitment to the campus. We also need to see engagement from all the stakeholders, including the University of Glasgow.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats will not take our eye off the future of the Crichton campus and its long-term sustainability. The focus will not go away from the Crichton&#8212;ask any of the campaigners or the media.

I am sure that we will have a valuable discussion.</p><p>Local food procurement for public agencies can help with three contemporary issues&#8212;health, wealth and our mother earth. On health, Scotland is seen as the sick man of Europe, which is ironic given the quality of the produce on our doorstep, for which we are famous. Surely we have a great opportunity to improve that image and create a new culture of healthy and nutritionally aware youngsters who are excited by food, so starting in our schools is most appropriate.</p><p>Food that is procured locally needs fewer preservatives and retains its nutritional value better, because of shorter supply chains. If food is locally grown, children understand better how their food appears. That is why I want what is happening in East Ayrshire and the project with Tayside schools to be rolled out throughout Scotland. More than that, I want the whole public sector to follow that example.</p><p>As for wealth, using local produce has economic benefits. A new guide to public procurement from the New Economics Foundation shows how local authorities and other public bodies can use their purchasing power to promote local economic development. The report concluded that providing high-quality, competitively priced food in schools, hospitals and local authority facilities is possible. Local suppliers can deliver food that is cheaper and healthier and can help the public sector to find ways to deliver additional food items and possibly <place-holder colnum=\"1105\"/> even to save public money. Of course, that cannot be achieved overnight. Public tenders must address the fact that local food supply chains will have to start from scratch in some areas, but anything is possible, if the will exists.</p><p>As for our mother earth, we all talk about climate change daily. The Parliament held two debates on the subject last week; I participated in both. Sourcing food thousands of miles away cannot be good for our environment, never mind the sometimes questionable traceability and animal welfare issues. The Stern report of 2006 said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"What we do now can have only a limited effect on the climate over the next 40 or 50 years\"</p><p>but</p><p class=\"indent\">\"what we do in the next 10 or 20 years can have a profound effect on the climate in the second half of this century\".</p><p>Encouraging the public sector to use local produce is one measure in the fight against climate change, which we discussed this afternoon.</p><p>Local food is not just an agenda item for rural communities. In our urban green spaces, we still have a strong community of allotment growers. Societies such as the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society are in a prime position to provide niche products in the new food supply chains that will be required, which will save green spaces in our cities.</p><p>Relevant examples are spread randomly all over the United Kingdom already. The headteacher of Whalsay high in Shetland recently spoke passionately about his school's rural skills course and about efforts to provide seasonal and healthy school meals by using fresh local produce. The school enlists the help of a local crofter to teach and give practical work experience while children participate in the rural skills course. They learn about where their food comes from and how it is grown and looked after, and they learn about animal husbandry. An additional benefit of the course is that many of the children say that they want to go into the agriculture industry when they leave school&#8212;an excellent example of sustainability at work.</p><p>In East Ayrshire, the school meals pilot project has worked well. There has been no additional cost to the local authority and &#163;160,000 has been generated for the local economy. Parents have become engaged and the catering staff are now enjoying working with proper, fresh and seasonal produce. The East Ayrshire pilot project has proved sustainable and is seen as a model for best practice.</p><p>The what's on your plate? campaign of the National Farmers Union Scotland, which was launched last week, highlights the importance of understanding food sourcing. I am sure that Mr <place-holder colnum=\"1106\"/> Lochhead heard all about the campaign today, during his visit to the Royal Highland show. In addition, Northumberland County Council's project resulted in roughly &#163;1.5 million being invested back into the local economy. I could go on citing such examples.</p><p>Often, the barrier is seen as procurement rules&#8212;free-market philosophy versus sustainability; however, that need not be the case. In fact, article 26 of the public sector directive states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Contracting authorities may lay down special conditions relating to the performance of a contract ... The conditions governing the performance of a contract may, in particular, concern social and environmental considerations.\"</p><p>France, Italy and parts of Scandinavia already have successful purchasing systems that push the competitive balance in favour of small, local producers. Their mechanisms to promote local purchasing are all similar to the East Ayrshire project and concentrate on freshness, by enhancing the local aspect as a quality factor; seasonality, demanding domestic varieties&#8212;perhaps a threat to having strawberries for the Christmas school dinner; organic production, which automatically favours local producers as the organic industry is far more fragmented than the conventional industry; and contracts that can be broken down into small lots, thereby allowing small producers to bid for parts of contracts.</p><p>The benefits of local food produce are clear to see: it is not rocket science. Public procurement is a powerful tool in ensuring sustainability. I sincerely hope that the Parliament and the Executive can work in conjunction with the public sector in achieving more locally produced food in our public services. It has been said that local procurement is the litmus test of the public sector's commitment to sustainable development. It is also the litmus test of the Executive's commitment to the health, economy and sustainable development of our great nation. I look to the minister and cabinet secretary for assurances that every effort will be made to engage with the public sector on the issue and that the Executive will deliver on this cross-party manifesto promise for our health, wealth and mother earth.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385974", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Food"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to talk about procurement in the public sector of locally grown, fresh and seasonal produce in my and the Liberal Democrats' first members' business debate of the session.

However, I make it clear that offsetting is not a suitable substitute for reducing emissions at source, although it can sometimes be the next best solution. There should be no complacency when considering carbon offsetting schemes. The bottom line is that carbon offsetting will not tackle the problems of the current Administration's anti-public transport agenda. We need systematic social change if the Executive is to deal with climate change effectively.</p><p>A recent <em>Financial Times</em> survey concluded that instances of people and organisations buying worthless credits that yield no reductions in carbon emissions are widespread and that many brokers provide services of questionable or no value. It also found a shortage of verification, which makes it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits. If Scotland is to pursue a policy of carbon offsetting, offset schemes, as well as infrastructure schemes, should be assessed independently for carbon emissions. There must be transparency, so that consumers can see what they are buying and how it works.</p><p>We must see the results of carbon offsetting immediately. For example, if an individual takes an international flight, the 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide that need to be offset are emitted within a matter of days. However, if they pay into a tree-planting scheme, the project may undertake to offset the emissions only over the next 100 years. That is far from ideal and, although it may provide people with a sense of social responsibility, it will not provide immediate reductions in carbon emissions.

I hope that it does so by pledging, at last, always to use Scottish malting barley in its Scottish whisky.</p><p>In coalition, the Liberal Democrats made huge strides on renewable energy. We set the target of producing 40 per cent of our electricity from renewables by 2020 and the target of 18 per cent was met three years early. We invested around &#163;100 million in renewables and energy efficiency support over the past three years, which puts us ahead of any other part of Britain and Ireland. Further, we provided support for more than 600 small renewable energy projects in Scotland. Liberal Democrats have delivered record recycling rates, which trebled under our governance, record renewable energy levels and public transport initiatives. My party has a proven track record in <place-holder colnum=\"671\"/> delivering green policies. We know what we are talking about and we know what is achievable.</p><p>Today, many of us have talked about renewable energy potential, which is hugely important. However, as a priority, we must address energy demand. In the UK, the demand for electricity for power is only 15 per cent, which is significant, but the demand for electricity for heat is 52 per cent, which is by far the biggest demand on our limited energy market. Insulation and energy efficiencies can go a long way towards addressing that situation. We believe that better energy efficiencies can be achieved through having tighter building regulations for new buildings and by providing serious encouragement for existing buildings to upgrade. By combining that with microgeneration in all new homes in Scotland, we can look forward to a greener, more environmentally sustainable future.</p><p>We therefore believe that the Scottish Executive must introduce a new energy efficiency and microgeneration strategy with targets. Combined with the greater use of renewables from not just one source but many, that will go a long way to address the energy gap. Some people try to balance a greener Scotland with economic growth as though those were different matters, but they are not. The key wording is \"sustainable development\". Without that, economic decline will happen fairly soon.</p><p>I said that heating places the main demand on our limited energy supply, but the second biggest demand comes from transport. That leads me to ask how the SNP Administration can shelve vital public transport plans&#8212;the tram project in our capital, the main airport rail link and the Borders railway&#8212;and simultaneously tackle climate change in a serious way. Although the Liberal Democrats welcome the new Executive's pledge to resist new nuclear power stations and its commitment to publish a bill on climate change, I share Mike Rumbles's concern that the Administration cannot deliver a greener Scotland while it cuts public transport plans and opposes renewables. We need joined-up thinking and decisions from the few cabinet secretaries whom we have.

I plead with the Government not to gamble with the rural industries, which are often bundled together as if they are only one industry.

I have, and I know that we live in an environment not of subsistence farming but of economic farming. We live in a capitalist world and, as there are no members of the Scottish Socialist Party in the chamber, I say as a warning to all that we must have profitable farming and economic activity in the countryside to deliver the kind of countryside that we are used to having and that we want in the future.
