It is very apposite at this time of year in particular to have the chance to discuss something such as Food Train.</p><p>As Elaine described, Food Train was launched in Dumfries in 1995 but it has been a vital service to many people across the country since that launch. I congratulate Dumfries and Galloway Food Train on receiving that fantastic investment of more than &#163;0.5 million. It was well deserved because Food Train has proven itself on the ground from its own customer satisfaction surveys, given the feedback from the people whom it is helping.</p><p>Elaine mentioned that there is a branch of Food Train within my constituency area, Stirling, and the residents of Stirling are very lucky to have it. Food Train in Stirling was launched two years ago under the leadership of&#8212;I will use one of Elaine&#8217;s words&#8212;the redoubtable Fran Thow. Fran works with volunteers from across the Stirling area to provide a shopping service for people over 65 years of age who cannot manage, as we might imagine, to do their own shopping.</p><p>I know that Food Train wants to expand into other areas, but it already makes 27,000 grocery deliveries across the six areas that Elaine mentioned, which says something about the existing scale of the grocery service and deliveries operation that the volunteers have taken on. That is why Food Train managed to get hold of that &#163;500,000 award, which is so important.</p><p>Within the Stirling area there are about 150 customers who use this fabulous service, with 55 local volunteers providing assistance. Over the past two years, the volunteers across the constituency have donated more than 12,000 hours of their time to help those in need of support.</p><p>Not only do the volunteers offer an extremely valuable service, providing groceries and home deliveries, but they have come to the aid of several people who have been found in distress, and of whom my constituency office is aware, helping them to gain access to the support services that they need in a wider sense.</p><p>I am also aware of the relationships that Food Train has built locally with many other third sector organisations in Stirling. It has been working together very effectively in partnership with the Royal Voluntary Service, Start-Up Stirling&#8212;which is also involved with one of the food banks in the Stirling area&#8212;and Stirling carers centre. It also supports work experience projects for Jobcentre Plus, Scope, youth services and organisations such as the Richmond Fellowship, creating opportunities for people to become involved in meaningful activities and help others in their community.</p><p>In Food Train&#8217;s annual customer survey, 98 per cent of the service&#8217;s users voted Food Train excellent or good. I wonder how many public services would get that level of recognition of the effort that they are putting into helping people. I am not in any way decrying public services and what they do, but obviously something exemplary is going on here. Sixty per cent of people said that they felt more able to stay in their own home because of the service on offer. That relates to Elaine Murray&#8217;s point about the importance of early intervention in ensuring that people can stay in their home with their family support network around them.</p><p>Over the past two years, Food Train has had a huge impact on the life of some of my constituents. It has allowed them to live independently in their own homes, safe in the knowledge that they will have their shopping delivered to them every week. Members should not just take my word for it. Service users have made the following glowing comments about Food Train in my area:</p><p>&#8220;All my shoppers are cheery and helpful&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;They make my day, can chat and laugh&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;Being a Type l diabetic, I find your service quite invaluable. I now feel confident that I can access foods for my diet&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;It makes our lives less stressful&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;An excellent service, fulfilling a great need, especially in rural areas&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;Food Train makes it possible for me to live independent of the help of friends for shopping&#8221;;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;I would find life very difficult without Food Train&#8221;.</p><p>The one l like best is, &#8220;They are magic.&#8221;</p><p>That says it all about the sort of organisation that we are talking about. To the staff and volunteers at Food Train in Stirling and throughout Scotland, I say &#8220;You have been doing a wonderful job&#8212;keep it up. We value the service you provide. Certainly the people who get your service very much value what you do.&#8221;</p><p>I was quite moved last week when I watched the launch of the Silver Line by Esther Rantzen. I was thinking about this debate and it made me realise just how important such services are when it comes to issues of isolation and loneliness among older people. I guess that I am getting closer to that myself now, so I am getting a bit selfish and ensuring that everything is in place before I reach that stage.</p><p>Well done to everyone involved in Food Train&#8212;it is a fantastic organisation&#8212;and to Elaine Murray for bringing the debate to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Train"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Elaine Murray for lodging the motion.

In saying that, I thank the clerks and all my committee members who helped the scrutiny process. It was done very well.</p><p>Reaching the stage 3 debate on the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill&#8212;I like that and I will repeat it: the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill&#8212;has been a much more positive and encouraging experience than many of us might have predicted at the outset of the process, which began in January 2012 with the publication of the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation paper.</p><p>Members might recall that, at that time, there were a great many stupid and silly scare stories about how the SNP was somehow hell-bent on gerrymandering the referendum process to fix the result that it wanted. The proof of the pudding is in the eating today. With the passing of the bill at decision time, those stories will have been proved just as silly and stupid as the Scottish Government claimed they were at the time.</p><p>Looking back over that period, I am reminded a lot of the hysteria that existed in some political and media circles about the advent of the SNP Government in 2007. Some predicted that the Government would not last a month, that it would certainly never get its budget passed and that it would be inherently unstable. Indeed, the four horsemen of the apocalypse could be seen riding towards Scotland apace.</p><p>Just like the silly and stupid scare stories around the referendum, those earlier predictions about the fate of the SNP Government never came to pass. What transpired was a period of stable and effective government that, in the circumstances, was unusual, if not unique, among western democracies. It was certainly unique when set alongside the churn and turmoil of political office that we see at Westminster, no matter whether there is coalition or majority government.</p><p>On the referendum, there were silly and stupid claims about the consultation on the bill, the question and even votes for 16 and 17-year-olds and service personnel. The Deputy First Minister rightly reminded the Parliament that the consultation attracted more than 26,000 responses, compared with only 2,857 responses to a similar exercise that the UK Government carried out.</p><p>The referendum question was submitted to the Electoral Commission, amended by that organisation and is now considered acceptable by all parties in the Parliament, contrary to what some of the doomsayers predicted at the outset.</p><p>That was all completed in a reasonable manner and with due regard to process, despite all the daft claims.</p><p>There was also much noise about the proposed date of the referendum but I believe, not unsurprisingly, that we will all support that proposed date when we reach decision time.</p><p>Of course, many of the scare stories&#8212;at least, those on the referendum process itself&#8212;ended with the signing of the historic Edinburgh agreement between the Scottish and UK Governments. That mature agreement, which was signed by both Governments, helped to lay the foundations for a parliamentary committee process that I believe was carried out in a highly effective and robust manner.</p><p>I acknowledge the significant role that was played by Michael Moore, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, in the drawing up of the Edinburgh agreement. The fact that the agreement was able to come into being was very much down to the constructive and reasonable approach that he and the Deputy First Minister adopted. I always found Michael Moore&#8217;s approach refreshingly candid and honest. He challenged when he needed to do so, but he always did so with the right tone and attitude. Talking of tone and attitude, I suspect that Michael Moore&#8217;s removal from office will soon become a matter of regret for Nick Clegg, if the recent performances of his self-styled bruiser are anything to go by.</p><p>The Edinburgh agreement has enabled the Scottish Government, the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee and the Parliament to have before them a bill that we can all endorse as fit for purpose and in which the people of Scotland can have confidence. As I said in the stage 1 debate, I was pleased to note that the Electoral Commission felt that the bill was</p><p>&#8220;a strong piece of legislation ... that truly puts the voter first&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 23 May 2013; c 421.]</p><p>I am delighted that, in the evidence that it has provided in advance of stage 3, the commission has confirmed its thoughts at that time.</p><p>During the stage 1 debate, I also said that we should ensure that the debate would be devoid of rancour and bitterness, and that</p><p>&#8220;If we can make it a debate that is about hope, aspiration and taking the people of Scotland forward, people from all parts of Scottish life will want to take part.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 12 September 2013; c 22411.]</p><p>Other members who took part in that debate, including Annabel Goldie, Tavish Scott, Lewis Macdonald, Alex Johnstone and Patrick Harvie, picked up on that theme.</p><p>It is obvious, however, that those voices have not been heard, given that a scare story a day emanates from Westminster and project fear. On this historic day, I say, &#8220;Keep it coming.&#8221; That strategy is guaranteed to produce a diminishing return and will serve only to undermine the enthusiasm for the failing structure of the UK of those people who have yet to decide how to vote.</p><p>Meanwhile, we will be relentless in sending out our positive message, which is about trusting the people of Scotland by putting them in charge of the huge richness of their resources, both human and natural. Putting the people of Scotland in charge and ensuring that they get the Government that they vote for every time will help to eradicate the unacceptable levels of poverty and inequality that, shamefully, still exist in our nation, while we continue to spend untold billions on weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>I will put my money on aspiration and hope winning out over scaremongering and fear, and on trusting the people of Scotland to be in charge of their own destiny.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742673", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wonder whether I would most enjoy dancing strip the willow or the dashing white sergeant with Annabel Goldie.

A situation has arisen through no fault of their own, and the current regulatory framework does nothing to ease their plight.</p><p>The bill is an opportunity to look afresh at the regulatory framework and identify ways in which to improve it&#8212;for instance, by making legislation that promotes better consistency of approach across the country and thus assists businesses in understanding what standards are expected, while acknowledging local circumstances.</p><p>I was taken by the mention of &#8220;pointless inconsistency&#8221; in the MSP briefing from the Federation of Small Businesses. That is what the bill is really about. That clearly causes frustration to businesses and I hope that it can be addressed by the bill&#8217;s proposals, as it is a recurring theme with the businesses and individuals I speak to in my constituency, particularly regarding the actions of local authorities and organisations such as SEPA and SNH.</p><p>Another key aspect of the bill is the environmental standards that it encapsulates. I very much welcome that thrust.</p><p>I turn to an environmental matter in my Stirling constituency. The bill has the potential to have a major beneficial impact on some of my constituents. I will explain what I mean.</p><p>Around 18 months ago, I was contacted by constituents from Blanefield about contaminated land in a part of the village that had been built on the site of an old printworks. It was found that the houses, which were built in the 1930s, were situated on land that had been contaminated with high levels of lead and other hazardous substances. After testing and retesting, 13 properties are now in need of remediation due to the level of contamination. The residents in Blanefield and Stirling Council have come together to work to find the best possible solution to that matter, but they face many obstacles.</p><p>First, the cost of remediation to Stirling Council and my constituents is extremely high, partly due to the cost of the landfill tax. Estimates suggest that the cost of cleaning the land is likely to be over half a million pounds.</p><p>Secondly, my constituents&#8217; main concern after remediation is that, although the land may be made safe, their properties will still be listed on the contaminated land register. As things stand, if a local authority finds a site to be a significant threat to human health, it may issue a notice that identifies the land as contaminated and places it on the contaminated land register, but even when the land is remediated and no longer meets the contaminated land criteria, it will remain on the register, as the legislation does not provide for a site to be taken off that public record. My constituents will have to endure the stress of their homes being on contaminated land, the financial cost of remediation and the upheaval during the clean-up process, and, once the land has been made safe, their properties will remain on the contaminated land register. As members can imagine, that is causing my constituents a great deal of unease.</p><p>The bill will provide an opportunity to alleviate some of my constituents&#8217; anxieties. I have been in correspondence with the Minister for Environment and Climate Change about the issue and he was able to inform me of the Scottish Government&#8217;s intent that the bill should give local authorities the power to declare that land that they have previously identified as contaminated is no longer contaminated and need not remain on the register. Closer examination of the bill&#8217;s provisions on that subject suggests, however, that further clarification is required. I say that because Stirling Council officials have pointed out to me what the SPICe briefing paper has to say about section 34:</p><p>&#8220;Section 34 relates to contaminated land and special sites, and amends the Environmental Protection Act 1990 by proposing the following provisions: ...</p><p>enabling the local authority or SEPA to remove from a register of contaminated land a notice designating a special site; if it considers that the land in question should no longer be specified as such.&#8221;</p><p>However, that provision appears to relate only to designated special sites and the SPICe briefing describes a special site as follows:</p><p>&#8220;This is a specific designation for land where e.g. oil has been extracted, purified, or refined; or explosives processed or manufactured.&#8221;</p><p>There does not appear to be a provision that would allow the land that could be determined to be contaminated land on the former Blanefield printworks site to be removed from the register of contaminated land once it has been remediated.</p><p>Providing this example, as I have done today on behalf of my constituents in Blanefield&#8212;I have no doubt that there are other affected communities in Scotland&#8212;demonstrates an area in which ordinary individuals&#8217; lives could be improved by the bill. I look forward to hearing the Scottish Government&#8217;s response today, or certainly before stage 2, so that I can consider whether to lodge amendments.</p><p>In the meantime, I fully support the bill&#8217;s intent to bring a better regulatory framework into being in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740298", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that, whatever our differences are this afternoon, we can agree on the need to place an emphasis in the bill on assisting business in Scotland and on creating an environment in which business can flourish, while recognising that we need to offer protection to people and the natural environment in which they live.

Scotland is in a stronger fiscal position than the rest of the UK.</p><p>From now on, therefore, the debate should be about which potential future is likely to deliver the best outcome in terms of sustainable growth in our economy, increased prosperity for all our people and the means to tackle the deep inequalities that, depressingly, still exist in this rich country of Scotland. Will it be a future in which we continue to be tied to a Westminster whose economic policy disproportionately benefits the economy of the City of London, or will it be a future in which the people who will gain most from Scotland making its own decisions on the future have some control? Will it be a future in which those who live and work in Scotland can tailor policies that are best suited to the Scottish need?

It is the remarkable advantage of renewable energy that I want to speak about in the rest of my speech.</p><p>Scotland can play a leading role in the low-carbon revolution, just as a couple of centuries ago we played a lead role in the industrial revolution. Scotland has the key strength to be a world leader in that revolution through our natural resources and our research and skills base. However, the piece of the jigsaw that makes Scotland one of the best places in the world to invest in renewable energy projects is our history of engineering and manufacturing expertise. Through the great success of our oil and gas sector over the past 40 years, we have developed knowledge and expertise in engineering in hostile deepwater environments that has few rivals anywhere in the world. That fantastic legacy will give a huge competitive advantage to the marine industry in the renewables technologies field.</p><p>We already have a sense of direction and clarity that is paying dividends as Scotland attracts major investments in renewable energy. Significant commitments have been made by leading international and Scottish companies such as Gamesa, Samsung, Mitsubishi, Areva and Global Energy Group. Already, about 11,000 people are employed in the renewables sector, and it is estimated that it could deliver up to &#163;46&#160;billion of investment.

We were all acutely aware of our primary responsibilities as parliamentarians on the committee to ensure that any proposed legislation that was put before us for scrutiny can command the confidence of not only the Parliament but, perhaps more important, the people of Scotland.</p><p>I was therefore very glad that the committee, following its deliberations, was able to unanimously agree that the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill provides an appropriate foundation for next year&#8217;s referendum, albeit that we have some specific requirements for clarification or amendment. Although committee members might differ on the preferred outcome of the referendum, there was a high degree of consensus that it should be conducted to the highest standard possible. To that end, the committee was pleased that the Electoral Commission told us that the bill is</p><p>&#8220;a strong piece of legislation&#8221;</p><p>that will deliver a referendum</p><p>&#8220;that truly puts the voter first&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 23 May 2013; c 421.]</p><p>Turning to the process of the committee&#8217;s deliberations, I begin by sincerely thanking my fellow committee members for their positive and robust approach to the job of scrutinising the bill. In particular, I thank my deputy convener, James Kelly, for his helpful and sage words at just the right time and when I required them&#8212;thanks, James. I believe that, as a group, we followed through on our recognition of the importance and significance of our role by appropriately questioning witnesses who appeared before us and examining the written evidence that was submitted to us.</p><p>On that note, I thank the witnesses, whose helpful contributions made our task so much easier, as well as the people who took time to provide written submissions.</p><p>Of course, we also heard from the Deputy First Minister and officials. We appreciated the Government&#8217;s positive approach to its responsibilities and its timeous responses to our requests for information. The Deputy First Minister today described a number of areas in which the Government intends to lodge amendments&#8212;indeed, those were set out in a letter to the committee earlier this week.</p><p>I thank our two advisers, Iain Grant and Professor Stephen Tierney, for their helpful advice and input throughout the scrutiny process. It is also appropriate to thank our parliamentary staff, including Scottish Parliament information centre staff and the media and legal teams who helped us. In particular, I thank the clerking team, which was led by Andrew Mylne. The team&#8217;s hard work and diligent and considered approach enabled us to meet our aims and objectives ahead of schedule, in a highly professional manner.</p><p>On the specifics of our report, the committee unanimously recommended that the general principles of the bill be agreed to. However, the committee was not unanimous on all our very detailed recommendations. In the time that is available today, I cannot do justice to the breadth of the subject areas that we examined and reported on, so I will concentrate on the most significant aspects of our deliberations.</p><p>On campaign spending limits, the committee was clear that any approach must meet the test that was set out in the Edinburgh agreement that the rules must be</p><p>&#8220;fair and provide a level playing field.&#8221;</p><p>Committee members also recognised the importance of protecting individuals&#8217; right of free speech and of encouraging as wide as possible participation in the debate. In that regard, the committee concluded that the Electoral Commission&#8217;s recommendations, which are reflected in the bill,</p><p>&#8220;achieve as good an overall outcome as is likely to be possible.&#8221;</p><p>We also took the view that</p><p>&#8220;a combination of public scrutiny and the oversight of the Electoral Commission should be capable of preventing spending power alone, on either side, unfairly affecting the outcome.&#8221;</p><p>That is important.</p><p>On purdah, the committee accepted the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s view that there is no reason to doubt the good faith of the UK Government&#8217;s commitment, in the Edinburgh agreement, to observe purdah restrictions that are equivalent to those that are imposed on the Scottish Government in the bill.</p><p>Nevertheless, a majority of the committee thought that there is a need to go further, to ensure that the expected level playing field is delivered&#8212;in reality and in perception. That is why the committee invited the UK Government to indicate whether it would be prepared to put the purdah restrictions to which it says that it is committed on a statutory footing, as will happen here in Scotland.</p><p>On purdah&#8217;s implications for the Parliament, the bill provides for the purdah period to commence on 21 August 2014. The committee noted that the Parliament has now agreed recess dates that include periods from 28 June to 3 August 2014 inclusive and from 23 August to 21 September 2014 inclusive. As is obvious, there will be a two-day overlap of the purdah period with parliamentary business.</p><p>The committee agreed to draw the issue to the attention of the parliamentary authorities but did not feel compelled to make specific recommendations in that regard. It is, of course, well within the parliamentary authorities&#8217; powers to deal with the issue if they think that it is appropriate to do so.</p><p>I hope that the parliamentary authorities at Westminster will want to ensure that, in the spirit of the Edinburgh agreement, that Parliament&#8217;s activities do not break the purdah rules. This year, Westminster was in recess from 18 July to 2 September and will be in recess from 13 September to 8 October. There is therefore potentially an issue for both Parliaments to consider and take action on, if they see fit.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, I begin my contribution to this important debate by recognising that there was no doubt from the outset that committee members appreciated the importance and significance of the role that they had been asked to undertake.

The parliamentary authorities, too, need to consider what, if anything, they need to do&#8212;it would be helpful if they made suggestions before stage 2.</p><p>On information from both Governments post-referendum, the committee acknowledged the Electoral Commission&#8217;s recommendation about providing voters with general information about the post-referendum process that would be followed in the event of either a yes vote or a no vote. Certainly, in my experience of talking to people about the outcome of the referendum, that is indeed information that voters would welcome.</p><p>The committee was therefore encouraged to hear that the Scottish Government and the UK Government are discussing those matters. As members might expect, we would welcome further information about the nature of those discussions and regular updates on progress.</p><p>On the declaration of results, the committee endorsed the approach taken in the bill, which allows local results to be made available before the national result and gives discretion on exact timings to the chief counting officer. Nevertheless, we would expect the chief counting officer, in practice, to authorise counting officers to announce local results without any unnecessary delay. As is made clear in our report, we would welcome further clarification from the Electoral Management Board for Scotland as to how those decisions are likely to be made in practice. It is worth pointing out at this stage that all committee members had strong views on that matter and there was a strong expectation that voters would be entitled to know the outcome of the referendum at the earliest possible date.</p><p>As we know, long after this bill has received royal assent, the debate on the constitutional future of Scotland will continue apace. It is now about the nature of how that debate is conducted. I know that if, as parliamentarians, we can put in place legislation that can command the confidence of the people in Scotland, so too we are more than capable of conducting a debate over the next 12 months that is respectful of one another&#8217;s deeply held views and devoid of rancour or abuse.</p><p>Of course, it will be a hard-argued and passionate debate&#8212;that is how it should be. However, when it is all over, we will still have a job to do for Scotland whatever the result, so let us conduct the debate in the spirit that the people of Scotland expect and deserve.</p><p>If we can make it a debate that is about hope, aspiration and taking the people of Scotland forward, people from all parts of Scottish life will want to take part.

Behind the scenes, many dedicated and committed individuals&#8212;whether they be ministers, special advisers or civil servants&#8212;have been working away hard. On the document itself, I know from experience that the minister responsible will be feeling some relief that it is finally printed and at the back of the chamber. They, the First Minister and other ministers should also take some satisfaction from still delivering so effectively on behalf of the Scottish people after more than eight years in government. The Government continues to demonstrate that it is an experienced team that works together on behalf of the people of Scotland and always puts Scotland first. It has a record to be proud of and is still driving forward positively to improve the quality of life of our citizens. Most important of all, it has a vision for the future that is about hope, aspiration and taking Scotland forward&#8212;a future in which the people of Scotland will gain from having responsibility for the political and economic direction that the nation takes.</p><p>With just over a year to go until the referendum, this debate is not only an opportunity to consider some of the Government&#8217;s significant proposals in the programme&#8212;in particular, I welcome the announcements on the housing bill, the community empowerment and renewal bill and the courts reform bill; it is also a chance for us to have a quick look back at the gains that the Parliament has brought to the people of Scotland since the advent of devolution. Those gains would simply never have been achievable if decisions in those areas had been left to Westminster. I pay tribute to the former Labour and Liberal coalition of the first eight years of devolution, which, as we have already heard other members suggest, ushered in leading legislation on land reform and ensured free care for the elderly in Scotland, for instance. Similar tribute can be paid to the Parliament and an SNP Government that swept away tuition fees, scrapped prescription charges and kept its promises to deliver an extra 1,000 police officers. None of those gains would have been possible had the reins of responsibility remained at Westminster.</p><p>There are many more demonstrations of how Scotland is making more appropriate choices for its future as a result of responsibility resting here in Edinburgh. Perhaps the most notable relates to Scotland&#8217;s national health service, which the First Minister alluded to. Scotland&#8217;s national health service is what it says on the tin; it is not the fragmented organisation south of the border that is in danger of meltdown as a result of Westminster&#8217;s flawed policy choices. On health matters, I am also pleased to see the mental health and adults with incapacity bill in the programme. That bill is important to protect vulnerable people.</p><p>I am not making the comments that I am making to applaud the actions of any one party or any one organisation in the Parliament; I do so for this institution&#8212;this place called &#8220;Holyrood&#8221;. I do so for the Parliament of Scotland. Over the years, the direction that Parliament has set for Scotland has served only to deepen my belief about who the best people are to make the decisions about our future. By that, I mean the people who happen to live and work in Scotland. They self-evidently have more invested in Scotland&#8217;s future and are therefore much more likely to make the appropriate decisions and better choices. The creation of the Parliament has demonstrated beyond doubt that Scotland has gained through having more responsibility in her own hands.</p><p>The revenue Scotland and tax powers bill is a historic but small first step, as the First Minister described it. However, it is now time to put responsibility for the full range of powers in the hands of the people I mentioned.</p><p>It is time to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to create new gains and make better choices through setting their own direction, and to give them the opportunity, for instance, to decide for themselves, if they so choose, to say no to a new generation of weapons of mass destruction based on the Clyde. It is time to give Scotland the opportunity to gain hugely from not having to take part in what is no more than a vanity project that is unjustifiable using moral, environmental, strategic or economic arguments.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, all unionist parties are now committed to throwing untold billions of pounds at a new generation of nuclear weapons based in Scotland. As the First Minister said earlier, last year the UK Government announced &#163;350 million more of spending on the next stage of Trident renewal. That sum is barely one third of one per cent of the &#163;100 billion of the total lifetime cost of replacing Trident. I cannot understand for the life of me why we are having this argument and why Scotland cannot make its own decision. We have a Government in Westminster committed not only to spending all that money on Trident but to bringing in the bedroom tax and welfare cuts, which are creating much misery in so many of our homes.</p><p>The one undeniable fact is that most people and Scottish parliamentarians are opposed to those abhorrent weapons. Irrespective of that, it is Westminster that will decide whether to commit billions of pounds on a project that is not worth the pennies that are spent on it.</p><p>The evidence is clear for everyone to see: the only democratic means by which we can halt the madness of siting a new generation of nuclear weapons only a few miles from our largest city, Glasgow, is independence.

That is easy to say, but the challenges of providing the capacity to drive that economic growth while at the same time improving safety, reducing carbon emissions, delivering better value for money for the passenger and cutting the level of public subsidy in a very complex industry should not be underestimated. The challenge means all those involved in the rail industry in Scotland&#8212;the Government, Transport Scotland, Network Rail and contractors&#8212;exploring new ways in which to deliver greater efficiencies and generate more revenue.</p><p>That challenge is exemplified by the fact that Scottish towns and cities have changed significantly since the regrettable public transport policies of Richard Beeching in the 1960s, and that how people use public transport and the distances that they travel and what they expect from their journey are also very different. Rail passenger numbers, as members have noted, are at record levels on a network that is half the size that it was pre-Beeching.

I wish that the Tories would reflect on that in some of their comments. Programmes inevitably have to be adjusted to take the real world into consideration, but significant work is going on in the EGIP programme; I will come on to that. We sit here in the Holyrood bubble, but real things are happening out there on EGIP.</p><p>Getting the central belt work right will provide the solid foundation for improvements to the line to Perth, Inverness, Fife and the north-east. Stirling, which is in my constituency, will also benefit, with the prospect of faster journey times to both Edinburgh and Glasgow and more reliable and resilient train services on quieter, greener trains.</p><p>Unfortunately, projects on that scale do not come without some disruption. I will give an example of that from the Stirling area. Faced with the significant constraints of a Victorian infrastructure, Network Rail has embarked, as part of EGIP, on a programme of clearance works to ensure that bridges are high enough above the rails to run electric cables. All that is to help facilitate the electrification of the line through Stirling and on to Dunblane and Alloa.</p><p>In 2012, Network Rail invested &#163;26&#160;million, as part of EGIP, in clearing bridges to prepare for electrification, including upgrading the Carseview bridge near Cowie, which cost &#163;2.3&#160;million and involved the original 1848 structure being replaced by a modern structure, through partnership working with Stirling Council. That work delivered improved approaches and a safer road alignment at the same time. Preparing for and delivering electrification between Larbert and Dunblane will represent an investment of almost &#163;90&#160;million. A further &#163;15&#160;million will be invested in modernising track works and signalling in and around Stirling station.</p><p>That volume of activity during the construction phase will bring immediate benefits to the city of Stirling through providing contractors with food and accommodation, and providing opportunities for local businesses to sell their services. At a time when we need investment, those programmes of work and infrastructure improvements will be of significant importance and will provide a welcome economic boost for the area. The work that will start soon in Stirling will see the replacement of the Seaforth Place bridge, the main access point to Riverside and Forthside. That will be a huge undertaking that will involve closing a road and bridge from June this year to February 2014. It is not as if nothing is happening on EGIP, because real work in a real part of Scotland is going on right now to deliver those changes.</p><p>Obviously, the work will create unfortunate disruption for the people who live in Riverside in going about their daily business. However, I have been impressed by the work that has been done not only by Network Rail but by Stirling Council to seek to minimise disruption for all and to provide additional assistance for those who need it during the bridge closure. I am aware that Network Rail has provided detailed information to the communities and businesses affected.</p><p>In my experience of all levels, from Government down through Network Rail to community councils and local businesses, both the vision and the delivery plans have been well laid out. That has led to a general acceptance that while there is disruption in the short term, the long-term benefits are there to be achieved by the local people and Scotland as a whole. EGIP is already progressing on the ground for real in Scotland, and that is how to do business in modern Scotland.

In doing so, I will inevitably have to go over ground that the Deputy First Minister covered.</p><p>A variety of witnesses gave evidence on the bill&#8217;s policy intention to lower the voting age for the referendum to include 16 and 17-year-olds. Robin Parker of the National Union of Students Scotland said that his organisation had</p><p>&#8220;for a long time supported the principle of votes at 16. It is extremely positive that the Scottish Government and the Westminster Government have agreed that we can extend the franchise for the referendum.&#8221;</p><p>Similarly, the Scottish Youth Parliament said that it had</p><p>&#8220;campaigned for votes at 16 for more than a decade&#8221;,</p><p>and Emily Shaw said that it was</p><p>&#8220;fantastic to see the principle being taken forward in the bill&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;Sixteen and 17-year-olds can be just as informed as over-18s are, and it is important that they have a voice&#8221;.</p><p>Andrew Deans commented that votes for 16-year-olds had received a high degree of support among youth organisations and young people, which included a consultation that received 40,000 responses. He said:</p><p>&#8220;We work with 16 and 17-year-olds all the time, and we see that they are very much ready to vote.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 14 March 2013; c 226, 228.]</p><p>Similarly, we heard from Tam Baillie, Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, and from Young Scot and the Electoral Reform Society, all of whom told the committee that they support the lowering of the voting age for the referendum. In fairness, we also received evidence from those who oppose the move&#8212;particularly Charles Clegg, a 17-year-old high school pupil who put across his views very clearly.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister explained the thinking behind the Government&#8217;s position when she said at the committee:</p><p>&#8220;Young people obviously take on a range of important rights and responsibilities at 16, and we believe that they should have the opportunity to have their say on the future of the country of which they are part.&#8221;</p><p>After taking on board all the evidence that it received, the committee decided to endorse&#8212;albeit by a majority decision, with all members apart from Annabel Goldie supporting endorsement&#8212;the extension of the franchise for the referendum to 16 and 17-year-olds.</p><p>Section 3 of the bill prohibits convicted prisoners who are being held in penal institutions at the time of the referendum from voting. As the Deputy First Minister said, that provision is identical to that which was made by section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.</p><p>The committee considered the compatibility of section 3 of the bill with ECHR. The Deputy First Minister described the legal position as clear and said that the Scottish Government had</p><p>&#8220;taken account of all the legal considerations and arguments in coming to the position in the bill.&#8221;</p><p>The committee noted the views of our committee adviser, Professor Stephen Tierney, and the Law Society of Scotland, and their conclusion that a challenge to section 3 on ECHR grounds would be unlikely to succeed.</p><p>The principle of preventing convicted prisoners from voting in the referendum was challenged in a number of written submissions and particularly in a joint submission from the Howard League for Penal Reform and others. Other written evidence, such as that from Quakers Scotland and the Church of Scotland&#8217;s church and society council, also opposed the ban on prisoners voting. However, the Deputy First Minister rejected those arguments. She recognised that the position might have to change for United Kingdom elections, but that is a matter for the UK Government. She said:</p><p>&#8220;Right now, convicted prisoners who are serving prison sentences do not get to vote, and I do not consider that there is a good argument for changing the position for the referendum.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 28 March 2013; c 303, 317, 313.]</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As convener of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the stage 1 debate on the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill.

On that basis, the committee was content with the proposed franchise as noted in the bill in respect of service personnel, but we went on to say that</p><p>&#8220;What matters now is that there is effective joint working between the Electoral Commission, EROs and the Ministry of Defence in order to provide information to these personnel about the registration options available to them.&#8221;</p><p>The committee urged the Government, in discussion with the UK Government, to explore all possible options for enabling young people to vote if they are of voting age and are resident outside Scotland only because their family have moved to be with a parent who is serving in the armed forces, and to report back to the committee before stage 2 begins.</p><p>I will quickly refer to the recommendations on awareness raising in our report. We took a fair bit of evidence on that issue from a number of appropriate organisations, but in particular I thank the officials from the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey who took the trouble to provide us with an overview of their experiences.</p><p>The committee agreed with the witnesses that the key point about awareness raising is the need for a co-ordinated approach&#8212;based on clear guidance&#8212;that maintains political impartiality. The committee also believed that the Electoral Commission has a central role to play in the process, working collaboratively with many other organisations.</p><p>The committee was not persuaded that bodies other than the Electoral Commission need a duty in law to encourage participation.

My son and I marched together with more than 100,000 people in Glasgow to declare that the war that was being planned would not be in our name. Millions marched in the rest of these islands and around the world. People marched with family, with friends, with neighbours and with strangers who would become their friends, on a day that was not without hope. We hoped that the people would not be ignored when they said, &#8220;Not in our name,&#8221; in such vast numbers. Naively, I believed that the Westminster Parliament would say no to an illegal war and thwart the warmongers Blair and Bush.</p><p>On 13 March 2003, as others have said, we debated the prospect of the invasion of Iraq in this Parliament. There were some notable speeches that day. In particular, I recall the intellect and passion of George Reid. &#8220;War looms as Prime Minister prepares to bypass United Nations&#8221; he said, and went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;The war has already claimed its first victim, which is the truth.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 13 March 2003; c 16446.]</p><p>How prophetic were his words: we learned later that the rationale for war had been built on a grossly sexed-up dossier regarding the claimed existence of WMD.</p><p>On Tuesday 18 March 2003, the Westminster Parliament, on the back of a case that was deliberately fabricated by the Labour Government, gave the go-ahead for war. On 20 March, the invasion began and the horror that was to become known as &#8220;shock and awe&#8221; unfolded.</p><p>The television pictures emanating from Baghdad at the beginning of that horror will stay with me forever&#8212;watching the bright yellow and orange flashes of missiles and bombs falling in the sure and certain knowledge that innocent people were being killed and maimed. Blair and Bush will never be forgiven for what they unleashed that night and for what was to follow.</p><p>Sami Ramadani, a political refugee from Saddam&#8217;s regime, wrote a heartfelt and powerful column in The Guardian recently. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Ten years on from the shock and awe of the 2003 Bush and Blair war&#8212;which followed 13 years of murderous sanctions, and 35 years of Saddamist dictatorship&#8212;my tormented land, once a cradle of civilisation, is staring into the abyss.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Blair, whom most Iraqis regard as a war criminal, is given VIP treatment by a culpable media ... It enrages us to see Blair build a business empire, capitalising on his role&#8221;.</p><p>Although the perpetrators of an illegal war have yet to pay the price, as we have already heard, at least 120,000 people have lost their lives and countless numbers have been maimed physically and psychologically.</p><p>As we know, that number includes the 179 servicemen and women from these islands who paid the ultimate price. Of course, the war has not been consigned to history, as the dead are still being counted. The explosions and shootings continue to kill the innocent.</p><p>It is the innocent to whom I now turn, and the impact on the children of that region. The children of Iraq have been grossly denied even their most basic rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention is clear about the need to protect children&#8217;s rights to life and to physical, mental, moral and spiritual development in a safe environment, but the reality is that children, along with the rest of the population, have been subjected to grave human rights violations.</p><p>As a result of the occupying powers&#8217; policies, the social fabric of the country has been changed. Divide-and-rule tactics along ethnic and sectarian lines were used to break up the country as the occupiers failed to contain insurgents. Indiscriminate bombing of residential areas destroyed purification systems and health and educational facilities. The institutional arrangements that should have protected the social and legal rights of women, youths and children are dysfunctional and unreliable.</p><p>The consequences of that have left children vulnerable and exposed on numerous levels. The killing, maiming, kidnapping, human trafficking, recruitment by armed groups, child labour and deprivation of liberty go on. The effects of infrastructure destruction, the release of toxins into the soil, air and water, and contamination from depleted uranium go on. The increase in levels of cancer, childhood leukaemia and birth defects goes on. Around 1.5 million children under the age of five are malnourished, so the hunger goes on. Children under the age of 14 make up 25 per cent of the victims of landmines and explosive war remnants, and the killing and amputations go on.</p><p>I know that John Lamont spoke with sincerity, but that is the reality of Iraq today. The horror for the children of Iraq goes on because, in their vanity, Bush and Blair tried to use their power to shape a new world order.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On 15 February 2003, we marched.

I am a self-confessed foodie, a bit like Orson Welles, although I am perhaps not the same shape yet. He once said:</p><p>&#8220;Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what&#8217;s for lunch.&#8221;</p><p>JRR Tolkien also said:</p><p>&#8220;If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.&#8221;</p><p>I get where they are coming from. In fact, I am pretty jealous of people like Richard Bath and Ron Mackenna, who are food critics, and I get a real buzz out of going to food shows whenever I get the chance.</p><p>Secondly, and more important, I am hugely excited about the Scottish food industry&#8217;s potential and the fact that today&#8217;s debate gives us the chance to celebrate the fact that Scotland has the best quality food store in the world.</p><p>Thirdly, I frankly want to boast about the truly fantastic food businesses that operate in and around the Stirling area.</p><p>Fourthly, the debate provides us with the opportunity to recognise that, although Scotland is blessed with quality food products, it is not acceptable that in the 21st century in this rich country of ours food banks are needed to feed our poor. That need is increasing and it will be made worse, as Elaine Murray said, because of welfare reform.</p><p>Lastly, as has been so vividly demonstrated by the enough food for everyone if campaign, Scotland must play its part in ensuring that the 800 million people who live in hunger on this planet get enough to eat, and in ridding the world of the shameful statistic that more than 2 million children die each year simply because they cannot get enough to eat.</p><p>I will get back to the main reason why we are here today, which is to celebrate our fantastic food products, and the fact that the sales of Scottish food have rocketed in recent years. Of course, that has not happened by accident. As Alex Johnstone did, I commend the Scottish Government and Richard Lochhead for showing the leadership that has grown our reputation for quality around the world. Wherever around the world consumers see Scotland on the label, they are seeing the stamp of quality.</p><p>I also like the way in which we promote our products by playing to our key strengths at home and abroad on premium, strong and internationally competitive brands, on our reputation for naturally healthy food, and on the provenance, quality, authenticity and trustworthiness of Scottish products. The fact is that when quality and consistency are essential, Scotland delivers. For example, our farmers are renowned for producing some of the finest red meat&#8212;beef and lamb&#8212;products in the world.</p><p>We are leading the world in the export trade, and also domestically. The Scotbeef plant on the outskirts of Stirling has impressive state-of-the-art slaughter facilities and processes approximately 2,500 cattle or 15,000 lambs a week. On Saturday, I was pleased to pay a visit to a fantastic local butcher in Cambusbarron in my constituency. It is run by Michael More, and the purpose of my visit was to demonstrate my backing for Scotland&#8217;s independent butchers and farmers and the quality of their produce.</p><p>The big supermarkets are now scrabbling to do all that they can to demonstrate the traceability of their meat products, but the good local butchers have been carrying out that good practice all along. Michael More sources the majority of his beef and lamb from Caledonian Marts, which is a local farmers co-operative in the Stirling and Oban areas. Again, on Saturday&#8212;and I am about to allude to my diet and what I said earlier about the Forfar bridie&#8212;I purchased one of Michael&#8217;s famous steak pies in the sure and certain knowledge that I was buying a premium product of the highest quality and, my goodness, I was right.</p><p>If there are colleagues in the chamber who, like me, like nothing better than a good pie&#8212;members will notice a certain theme in what I am talking about&#8212;they should know that I recently lodged a motion to recognise the success of Cameron Skinner from Kippen at the recent 14th world Scotch pie championships. If anyone is ever passing near to Kippen, I assure them that stopping off to purchase Cameron&#8217;s pies or sausages will be well worth the effort.</p><p>As I said earlier, I like to go to food shows, and when I am there I always try to buy the fabulous products of Edenmill Farm, which is run by the Gibson family from a real butcher&#8217;s shop and smokery near Blanefield. Of course, the Stirling area has many other producers of top-quality products across the range of foodstuffs, but I have had time to highlight only a few of those today. The Deanston and Glengoyne distilleries&#8212;both are in my constituency&#8212;also contribute to our remarkable export record as a whisky area, and because of that I am quite delighted about what they do.</p><p>However, I would not like to miss the chance to recognise the Mhor group, which is a unique family-run business based in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park. From the establishment of the fabulous Monachyle Mhor hotel 20 years ago on the banks of the stunning Loch Voil&#8212;known as &#8220;The Daddy Cool of the Trossachs&#8221;&#8212;to the creation of Mhor fish, Mhor bread, Mhor farm and Mhor to your door, the company has simply continued to produce the finest food and hospitality that Scotland can offer.</p><p>In closing, I want to recognise the fantastic efforts made by the members of Forth Environment Link to promote and encourage local food growing and consumption. I admire their work hugely and I know just how hard they work at getting their message across. How do I know that? I was involved in setting up one of Scotland&#8217;s first ever farmers markets&#8212;in Perth&#8212;when I was a council leader. I know how hard it was to get that established and put on a firm footing, but such markets now happen across Scotland and I am delighted by that.</p><p>I will close with one quick quote. I began by quoting some historical figures and I will end with a contemporary quotation:</p><p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve enjoyed most, though, is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them. Good food is a global thing and I find that there is always something new and amazing to learn&#8212;I love it!&#8221;</p><p>So says Jamie Oliver, and so do I.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686116", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was delighted to hear that the Government had chosen the subject of food policy for today&#8217;s debate, and for a number of reasons.

The result is prolonged agony for hard-working families trying to balance household budgets and the further stifling of hope for those seeking work.</p><p>It is abundantly clear that the chancellor&#8217;s chosen direction is having the opposite effect to his stated aims. We need only look at the most recent figures, which show that the UK economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year, to see that the evidence is staring us in the face.</p><p>By comparison, Scotland&#8217;s Government has of course long put forward a consistent case for additional capital expenditure to help to boost the economy and create jobs. As we all know, Scotland&#8217;s First Minister initially called for an increase in capital spending in 2008 and has been repeating that call ever since. That call was finally heeded by the chancellor in his autumn statement when he announced an additional &#163;331 million of capital spending, taking our cut from 33 per cent down to 26 per cent. Yes, it is a welcome movement in the right direction, but in the teeth of the latest depressing figures for gross domestic product, it is too little, too late.</p><p>The comparison between the dithering of the UK Government and the decisive action of the Government of Scotland could not be starker. In February 2012, the Government of Scotland announced a further capital spending package of &#163;380 million until 2015, which focused on housing, transport, health, digital and maintenance projects. In June 2012, the Government of Scotland announced another package of investment: &#163;105 million for shovel-ready projects. Investment in infrastructure is also being boosted through the&#8212;much maligned by Gavin Brown&#8212;&#163;2.5 billion pipeline of projects delivered through the non-profit-distributing model.

During my visits to the premises I have always been hugely impressed by their compassion, commitment and enthusiasm, as I know has Anne McGuire, the local MP. The fantastic work that the organisation carries out is supported by more than 4,000 individuals and 350 churches and groups.</p><p>On 27 January, more than 100 countries around the world will mark world leprosy day. World leprosy day falls on the anniversary of the death of Mahatma Gandhi, a human being who showed true compassion for people affected by leprosy worldwide. Gandhi not only preached to people that they should help people afflicted by the disease but was personally involved in the work. This year, world leprosy day celebrates its 59th year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Leprosy Mission Scotland continues to bring healing and justice to people who are affected by the disease in around 30 countries, in Africa, Asia and around the Pacific. It is the biggest and oldest organisation that specialises in the causes and consequences of leprosy worldwide. It is well known and respected by not just local communities but the large, established agencies that work in international development. It currently funds projects in Angola, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria and South Sudan.</p><p>Thank goodness for the Leprosy Mission Scotland&#8217;s work. The disabilities that leprosy causes affect around 4 million people worldwide and around 10 million people live disadvantaged lives as a result of the disease. Today, between 600 and 700 people will be diagnosed with leprosy&#8212;one person every two minutes. However, it is not all bad news. During the past 20 years, more than 14 million people have been cured of leprosy and the disease has been eliminated from 119 countries.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, more than half the newly-reported cases are in India, and high levels are still found in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Sudan, Tanzania and Timor-Leste&#8212;I read out the list to show members the scale of the problem.</p><p>As we know, leprosy can be permanently cured, through a six to 12-month course of multidrug therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the spiral of physical, social and psychological despair that people can find themselves plunged into, but many cases still go undetected each year, particularly for people who live in rural and remote places where even basic healthcare is limited. However, to cure and care for someone with leprosy for a year costs as little as 40p a day or &#163;12 a month.</p><p>The Leprosy Mission Scotland works hard to raise the resources to help transform the lives of people affected by leprosy, taking people affected from rejection to acceptance and from poverty to economic independence. It is a truly global fellowship, with the ultimate goal to eradicate the causes and consequences of leprosy.</p><p>Linda Todd, chief executive of the Leprosy Mission Scotland, visited South Sudan in September. Shockingly, Linda told me that, if the mission returns to that area of South Sedan, it will be the first organisation to do so. The Leprosy Mission Scotland has rightly made it its aim to return and help the people whom it met.</p><p>In 2010, the Leprosy Mission Scotland was awarded three years of funding from the Scottish Government south Asia development programme, totalling more than &#163;199,000. The funding is being used to fund the project in Chittagong in Bangladesh, transforming the lives of the leprosy sufferers in hill districts of Chittagong.</p><p>Leprosy is a cruel, cruel disease that affects the poorest in society, particularly women, robbing people of not only their physical health and wellbeing but often of their most basic entitlements. Fear, prejudice and superstition in many communities mean that people affected by leprosy have to cope with not just the effects of the disease but the stigma attached to it. Stigmatisation and alienation from the families and communities that form the fabric of their lives add to leprosy sufferers&#8217; devastation. As a former leprosy sufferer said:</p><p>&#8220;Leprosy is a ruthless thief, which first turns off all the lights before you notice that there is an intruder. Then in the total blackout it viciously created, it robs you of every single irreplaceable treasure you possess.&#8221;</p><p>On behalf of all my MSP colleagues, I thank from the bottom of my heart the Leprosy Mission Scotland for all its hard work and for helping to remind us that, with the right resources and investments, we can achieve a world without leprosy.

During the coming months, we will have the privilege of scrutinising the legislation that the Scottish Government will submit to the committee and which will&#8212;I feel the weight of history bearing down on me&#8212;enable the people of Scotland to make their most important decision in more than 300 years.</p><p>In autumn 2014, the people of Scotland will make their choice, and members of the committee are seized with an understanding of the importance of the role that we have been asked to discharge. Indeed, it is safe to say that the committee members feel honoured to have been asked to serve the people of Scotland in this way. I also know that we will all want to play a full part in ensuring that the legislation that is laid before Parliament is fit for purpose and that it commands not only the confidence of Parliament, and of both Governments but&#8212;most important&#8212;the confidence of the people of Scotland. It is therefore vital that the bills be subjected to the most detailed and comprehensive scrutiny. I know that the committee&#8217;s members are looking forward to undertaking those responsibilities.</p><p>We are already considering whether we should appoint an adviser to help us with our work, and next week we will begin the task of considering the evidence and information sessions that we will have to have in the new year to help us to get to grips with the potential complexities of the legislation. However, all that is for the future.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s first task was to consider the Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013 [draft], also known as the draft section 30 order, which provides the legal framework for the referendum bill and for the paving bill on aspects of voter registration. The draft order was, of course, announced as part of the historic Edinburgh agreement, which was signed on 15 October 2012, and the order was laid before the United Kingdom and Scottish Parliaments on 22 October.</p><p>The Edinburgh agreement commits the Scottish and Westminster Governments</p><p>&#8220;to work together to ensure that a referendum on Scottish independence can take place&#8221;</p><p>and to ensuring that the referendum will</p><p>&#8220;have a clear legal base</p><p>be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament</p><p>be conducted so as to command the confidence of parliaments, governments and people&#8221;,</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect&#8221;.</p><p>The committee took oral evidence from a number of witnesses, in particular from the Deputy First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, and from the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore MP. On behalf of the committee, I thank them both for the open and straightforward way in which they dealt with the questions that members put to them. I will come back to talk about the oral evidence sessions later.</p><p>The committee also received written evidence from nine organisations or individuals. At this stage, I extend my sincere thanks to all who provided us with evidence to help us in our deliberations. I also thank the clerking team, the parliamentary legal advisers and the Scottish Parliament information centre, all of whom helped to support the committee in its work and its coming to its conclusions.</p><p>The committee was established on 23 October and our call for evidence was published on 26 October. Oral evidence was taken at meetings on 8 and 15 November. That culminated in the committee&#8217;s report, which was published on 23 November.</p><p>The timescale that was set for undertaking our initial task looks pretty efficient to me. Much of that is down to the clerks, whom I thank on the committee&#8217;s behalf for diligently going about their tasks with short notice to get the show up and running. I think Tavish Scott was the first committee member to thank the clerks for the production of a well-constructed draft report. That certainly helped all members to sign up unanimously not only to the draft order but to the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>I thank my colleagues on the committee for the constructive way in which they went about their business. That made my job as a first-time convener of a parliamentary committee all the easier. I thank the committee for that and for gently reminding me that I am no longer a minister and that I now have a different modus operandi. I will try hard to remind myself of that as we scrutinise legislation that the Scottish Government introduces.</p><p>I return to the evidence that the committee took. As well as taking oral evidence from the Deputy First Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland, we heard from academics: Professor Aileen McHarg, Alan Trench, Dr Nicola McEwen and Navraj Singh Ghaleigh. I will touch generally on the evidence.</p><p>On the significance and effectiveness of the section 30 order, witnesses agreed that the order&#8217;s purpose was to ensure that Parliament has the legislative competence to pass a referendum bill. The Deputy First Minister summed up the order&#8217;s importance by saying that it puts the referendum&#8217;s legality beyond effective legal challenge by using</p><p>&#8220;a perfectly legitimate, tried and tested, robust process.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 15 November 2012; c 86.]</p><p>On the conditions that the order imposes, witnesses agreed that it would require a binary choice and that a third or middle option, such as enhanced devolution, would be excluded. The Deputy First Minister told the committee that she regrets that there will be no option of a second question, but was prepared to make that concession as part of negotiating a wider package.</p><p>Witnesses placed great emphasis on the importance of the Electoral Commission&#8217;s role in ensuring the fairness of the referendum process. Witnesses accepted that the commission is an advisory body rather than a decision maker, but its expertise means that its views should always be carefully considered. The secretary of state said:</p><p>&#8220;The commission has great moral authority and established credibility. For that reason, I think that it would be extraordinary if serious recommendations made by the commission were disregarded.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 8 November 2012; c 44.]</p><p>The written evidence from individuals also flagged up wider issues that will need to be considered during scrutiny of the referendum bill.</p><p>Scrutiny of the draft order has provided clarity about the referendum&#8217;s legality. The committee unanimously welcomed and agreed the draft order and&#8212;if I have got this right&#8212;the wider Edinburgh agreement. I thank all the committee members for the constructive approach that they have taken so far and I sincerely hope that that will continue as the committee moves in the new year into its main task, which is scrutiny of the two Government bills that will set out the detail of how the referendum is to be conducted.</p><p>In terms of the evidence, the committee was particularly keen on the last sentence of the Edinburgh agreement, which says:</p><p>&#8220;The two governments are committed to continue to work together constructively in the light of the outcome, whatever it is, in the best interests of the people of Scotland and of the rest of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p><p>That sets well the tone for the committee in the future.</p><p>It is appropriate that I recommend, on the committee&#8217;s behalf, that when we reach decision time, we unanimously approve the Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013 [draft].</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679130", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013 [Draft]"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin my contribution to this short but important debate by stating that all the committee&#8217;s members recognise the importance of the role that Parliament has asked us to undertake.

As Kenneth Gibson noted, even the Scottish Information Commissioner has said in evidence that she understands the logic of clarifying the act before extending coverage. As members are fully aware, the power to extend coverage of FOI already exists under section 5. That is the correct place in legislative terms for any Government to make that particular extension. That is why section 5 was drafted in the way that it was when the Parliament passed the bill and it became law. However, I welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s announcement today with regard to section 5, to the effect that she will lodge amendments at stage 2.</p><p>The main point is that we should at present be very careful indeed about considering extension. I support the principle of extending coverage to bodies such as arm&#8217;s-length organisations that have been created by local authorities&#8212;John Mason made a good point about that. There are also strong arguments for extending coverage to public-private partnership and PFI contracts and to some registered social landlords.</p><p>However, I question whether, at this time of significant economic uncertainty and pressures on public service budgets, we should add to the burdens on those who are already trying to balance their books in very difficult circumstances.

Those are worrying developments for everyone. Everyone saw the Bank of England&#8217;s report this week on the state of the economy. We have heard enough in the chamber about the challenges that hard-pressed public service organisations are facing without, at this time, making their lives even more difficult by placing more burdens on them.

I know that he recognises the honour and privilege of being a minister in the Scottish Government and I wish him all the best in future.</p><p>As other members have done, I will talk about David Livingstone. As has been said, on 19 March next year, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth. That explorer, missionary, medic and anti-slavery campaigner rose from humble beginnings in a tenement in Lanarkshire to become one of Scotland&#8217;s national heroes and one of her most famous sons.</p><p>When Livingstone visited Lake Malawi in the late 1850s, many of the lakeside towns there were Arab slave centres. That is what drove him. He was appalled by slavery and he became an important campaigner against the trade, publicising its horrors back in Britain. Livingstone&#8217;s association with the area was an important factor in drawing the British to Malawi. The establishment of missions by Scottish churches led the UK Government in 1893 to declare Malawi and the area around it a British protectorate, which lasted in various forms until 1964, when Malawi gained independence from the UK.</p><p>Malawi celebrates its national day by raising the flag every year about 6 July&#8212;it is not always exactly on that date. I like the story of the Malawi national flag, which has three horizontal stripes, of red, black and green, with a sun in the centre. The red represents the blood of those who fought for African freedom; the black represents the people of the African continent; the green represents the land and its natural resources; and the white sun represents the friendliness, peace and prosperity of Malawians.</p><p>Livingstone&#8217;s legacy in Malawi makes it entirely understandable that Scotland has retained such strong and close associations with Malawi and her people. However, I wonder what Livingstone would make of modern Malawi when compared with the three Cs, as he saw them, of Christianity, commerce and civilisation. On the face of it, Malawi remains predominantly Christian, with more than 80 per cent of the population still said to follow that faith. The economy remains predominantly agriculture based. However, there is no doubt that Malawi has inherent difficulties and needs investment. The extended credit facilities that it received from the International Monetary Fund have probably caused even more difficulties than might have been expected at the beginning of that process.</p><p>Even the simple things cause difficulties. For example, the price of concrete in Malawi is extortionate because of the weakness of the economy and the lack of ability to get credit. That means that building infrastructure is more expensive in Malawi than in modern western economies. The fragility of the Malawian economy is obviously a real worry. It is worth considering the plight in which the new president, Joyce Banda, whom members have mentioned, finds herself.</p><p>This morning, I happened to speak to a friend who has been involved in Malawi. Although I did not meet him to talk about that, he told me a moving story from when he had done some work there. He said that, when children are starving and in a famine situation, their eyes are blank and staring, but if we can start to feed them, after only a few weeks, the sparkle returns. My friend is concerned about some of the issues that Patricia Ferguson touched on to do with the impact of poverty, the lack of food and the current potential for famine in Malawi.</p><p>Malawi&#8217;s main products for trade are tobacco, sugar, cotton and tea. Is it not incongruous that, while Malawi struggles to export those products, its exports are often rendered unviable by subsidies that are given to western farmers here in the developed world? Malawi&#8217;s fledgling manufacturing sector struggles to deal with countries such as China, which can mass produce goods at cheaper rates. At the same time, the Chinese are buying up tracts of land in Malawi. Contradictions exist in the struggle of the Malawian people.</p><p>Malawi remains one of the 10 poorest countries on the planet. More than 40 per cent of Malawians&#8212;the majority in female-headed households&#8212;live in poverty. We know of issues of human rights and press freedom; people also talk about corruption. We cannot ignore that, but we should not let it affect the warmth of the relationship between Scotland and Malawi.</p><p>It is right that we continue to build a civic coalition with Malawi, so that we can fight poverty and contribute positively to the economic situation there. People from Scotland have worked with the people of Malawi for many years to develop basic education and health systems. I will not go over some of the ground that other members touched on. David Livingstone may be long gone, but his work continues through the David Livingstone centre for sustainability at the University of Strathclyde.</p><p>Since the Scottish Parliament came into being, many initiatives have been developed and strengthened to help the Scotland and Malawi relationship, which others have described well. That co-operation continues. I was particularly interested in Mike Russell&#8217;s recent announcement of more support for Malawi to deal with the fact that people there have no access to a reliable electricity supply. People are working on the ground to help Malawians with renewable energy needs. I think that 93 per cent of people there have no access to a reliable electricity supply.</p><p>My constituency of Stirling has made a significant contribution through Balfron high school, Kincardine-in-Menteith primary school and Doune primary school, as well as the active friends of Malawi group that operates in Killearn. The subject touches all of Scotland and everyone is involved where they can be.</p><p>Whether support for the Malawian people comes from the Government of Scotland or the communities of Scotland, that support has perhaps never been more important in this globalised world, given the economic conditions in which people find themselves and given that people who are on the margins are finding life tougher and tougher. As the manager of a children&#8217;s home in Malawi said to the journalist John Knox,</p><p>&#8220;Every child deserves a safe home to live in, food to eat, a school to go to, and a clinic for when they are ill ... is that too much to ask?&#8221;</p><p>That is why we must keep trying for Malawi.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the minister to his new role and congratulate him on his first speech in the Parliament in that role.

I welcomed the announcement last week about the Government&#8217;s third sector and social enterprise challenge fund to be spread across 24 organisations nationally. That means that more than 2,000 young people will be given a chance to improve their employability.</p><p>That fund forms part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s guarantee, unique in these islands, that all 16 to 19-year-olds will be offered a place in training or education.

I congratulate Recyke-a-bike, which is an innovative social enterprise that does excellent work in reducing the number of bikes going to landfill while at the same time creating employment and training opportunities in the Stirling area. It is a success story that shows how innovative and out-of-the-box thinking can be used to create and maintain employment, and it is something that Labour can perhaps begin to learn from. I hope that Stirling&#8217;s Recyke-a-bike will inspire others to establish innovative schemes in order to provide training and employment opportunities. Other innovative approaches can also make a significant and positive impact on employability.</p><p>Let me move on to the issue of apprenticeships, which is referred to in the motion. Frankly, Labour is all over the place on apprenticeships. In her cuts commission speech last week, Johann Lamont said that apprenticeships should be cut.

For example, despite the fact that the 2011 budget included provision for an additional 1,500 apprenticeships, which Labour had asked for, Labour voted against the budget. Now, during the deepest recession in years, when the SNP Government is delivering a record 26,427 modern apprenticeships, Labour is calling for cuts to the programme&#8212;it is simply incredible.</p><p>I commend the motion to members.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674359", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The college sector in my constituency has led the way in reorganisation in the past and is robust and strong.

The system and the need for certification will be reviewed in three years in a process chaired by the Lord President.</p><p>The reservations on health professions and corporate insolvency procedures, including those in relation to registered social landlords, will be removed from the bill.</p><p>The provision on the partial suspension of acts of the Scottish Parliament that are referred to the UK Supreme Court will also be removed, and the status quo on shared executive competence to implement international obligations will be maintained. There will also be a review of the regime for marine conservation.</p><p>I turn to the costs that will be associated with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs implementing the Scottish rate of income tax. The UK Government has estimated those costs to be up to &#163;45 million. We have argued that the UK and Scottish Governments should share the costs of setting up the Scottish rate in recognition that it is a UK Government policy and to provide an incentive to maximise value for money.</p><p>UK ministers have refused that proposal, so the costs of implementation must be met in full from the Scottish budget. That presents the Scottish Government and Parliament with a significant issue in terms of lack of accountability: HMRC will manage the implementation but will not be formally accountable to us for how it is spending our money. It is therefore vital that we find ways of sharing oversight of the project and ensure as best we can that HMRC maximises value for money while providing the best possible service to Scottish taxpayers. The Governments have therefore set up joint assurance mechanisms at senior official level, and implementation will be overseen by ministers through the Joint Exchequer Committee. The bill also now requires statutory reports from both Governments to the Parliaments on progress with implementation.</p><p>The proposal to adopt the Holtham commission methodology for the mechanism for calculating the block grant adjustment is much better than the Calman proposals that the UK Government originally supported. Under Calman, the block grant adjustment would have been calculated once&#8212;in the first year&#8212;and the proportion would have remained the same every year thereafter. Scotland would have lost out if the block grant adjustment was bigger than receipts from the Scottish rate of income tax&#8212;in other words, if UK public spending grew faster than Scottish-rate tax receipts. Therefore, the effect on the Scottish budget would have depended on movements in UK public spending, over which Scotland has no control or even influence.</p><p>As members know, we argue that, in past years, Scotland would have lost substantial amounts of money from the Calman approach. However, under the Holtham approach, the adjustment to the block grant will be recalculated each year, based on changes to the UK tax base on which the Scottish rate is levied. That means that, if Scottish rate tax receipts grow faster than the corresponding UK tax base, our budget will benefit. That is, Scotland will benefit if earnings and employment in our economy perform better than those in the rest of the UK. That is a better, more principled, arrangement and I am genuinely glad that the UK Government has adopted a different approach.</p><p>There is also a clear undertaking that both Governments should reach agreement before the package is implemented. The Scottish Government recognises clearly that it needs to seek the agreement of this Parliament as part of that process.</p><p>The Scottish Government freely admits that it would like more. Scotland can, should and will be independent. However, the Scottish National Party has never stood in the way of any legislation that will help the people who live in Scotland.</p><p>There was a time when the bill did more harm than good. It promised a financial mechanism that could have cut spending in Scotland by billions of pounds had it operated from 1999. That mechanism has now gone, and the damaging reservation provisions in the bill have also been removed, as I outlined earlier. We are therefore satisfied that the bill no longer poses a threat to devolved interests. In the Scottish Government&#8217;s judgment, the package of changes makes it possible for the Parliament to support the bill.</p><p>However, the bill could have been so much better. It could have provided real economic levers, for example by devolving corporation tax. A more competitive corporation tax rate in Scotland would boost output, investment, exports and overall employment. The UK Government is, even now, examining a lower corporation tax rate for Northern Ireland to boost its economic performance, yet there has been no action here.</p><p>The bill could have provided us with better capital borrowing powers, as recommended by both Scotland Bill Committees and the Scottish Affairs Committee, yet there has been no action on that. The management of the Crown estate in Scotland has been identified by everyone from Ian Davidson to both Scotland Bill Committees and even Tavish Scott as unsatisfactory and ripe for reform, yet there has been no action on that. Calman recommended a formal role for the Scottish Parliament in welfare, and the Welfare Reform Bill has shown the need for that. More intergovernmental dialogue was promised by the UK Government last June, yet there has been no action on that.</p><p>The purpose of our proposals was to strengthen the Parliament and improve the lot of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, there is nae point.

Let me finish by showing how democracy in Scotland is being undermined.</p><p>First, in the May 2011 election, the Scottish Government stood on a clear programme of improvements to the Scotland Bill. The Government was returned with an overwhelming mandate. We put forward our proposals for changes&#8212;backed by the people&#8212;to the bill. We provided detailed plans and answered questions when they were asked, but those very reasonable proposals fell on the stony ground of the anti-independence parties&#8217; intransigence. It is for others to justify that stance&#8212;I hope that they will do so today&#8212;despite the fact that many of their number are now arguing that many of those self-same powers should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Secondly, we are now looking forward to a referendum on our nation&#8217;s future. Independence, or what? It is for the Scottish Government to define the benefits of independence. We have done that, and we shall, but those who are telling Scotland to vote no refuse to say what that vote would mean. It is simply unacceptable to go into a referendum on the greatest question that our nation has faced in 300 years without telling the people of Scotland what they are voting for. &#8220;Only when you vote no can we work out what happens next,&#8221; is the only position that the anti-independence parties seem to share. Their proposition is everything that a referendum must not be. The anti-independence parties&#8217; position is unfair to the people. It is not open with the people, it is not clear to the people and it is profoundly undemocratic.</p><p>The Scotland Bill has now been bypassed by history and events. Its promoters are already looking past it, although so far they have been reluctant to say what they can see. The Government has a clear view. Independence is the only state that will allow Scotland to flourish to the full. We will allow the people that choice. In the meantime, we have secured a bill that will not harm Scotland&#8217;s interests and will provide some increase in responsibilities to this Parliament.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-8114 passed on 10 March 2011, notes the letters exchanged between the Scottish and UK governments on 21 March 2012 and agrees that the Scotland Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010, as amended, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will take no lectures from anybody who is associated with the UK Government on issues to do with alcohol.

I am glad that she has lodged the motion, because the issue deserves to be aired to allow some of the facts to surface.</p><p>I will begin with a fact that I think is already accepted: the Scottish Government has an overwhelming mandate to hold an independence referendum. The Secretary of State for Scotland, for example, told the BBC in May 2011:</p><p>&#8220;I firmly believe that the Scottish Parliament, if it so decides, can proceed with a referendum ... we could, I suppose, try to make a constitutional issue about where the powers lie or don&#8217;t, but I don&#8217;t think that would be a sensible use of anybody&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p><p>I happen to agree with him.</p><p>Similar comments&#8212;not all of them so detailed&#8212;have been made by senior members of the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. The common theme of those comments is that the election result last May gave the Government a mandate to hold the referendum, and that that referendum is a matter for the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government to determine.</p><p>The Scottish Government has repeatedly set out its view that the referendum should be designed and built in Scotland, after a thorough consultation process that takes account of the range of views across Scotland&#8217;s political parties and civic Scotland. As members know&#8212;and as they can see in today&#8217;s Business Bulletin&#8212;the Scottish Government will publish a consultation paper on arrangements for the referendum on Wednesday 25 January. We have taken into account the responses from our previous consultation and have considered lessons that have been learned from last year&#8217;s National Assembly for Wales and alternative vote referendums. Among other things, the consultation document will set out our proposals to ensure that the referendum will meet the highest international standards for transparency and fairness. Members will need to wait until next week to see the details of what we propose, but I will not give anything away if I confirm our thoughts on the franchise at the referendum.</p><p>The draft referendum bill that was published in February 2010 confirmed that it is our intention that eligibility to vote in the referendum should be based on that for the Scottish Parliament and Scottish local government elections. That means that those who are resident in Scotland will be eligible to vote, with the exception of the citizens of non-Commonwealth and non-European Union countries. I understand that that causes frustration for some people, including James Wallace, who will be unable to vote in the referendum.</p><p>The referendum will be of worldwide interest and it will, understandably, engage both the intellects and the emotions of the many people in the other nations of these islands and in the wider world who feel a strong affinity for Scotland. Scotland as a whole benefits hugely from the fact that so many people with ties here, but who live elsewhere, retain a deep and abiding interest in this country. However, in determining the rules for an independence referendum, the Scottish Government&#8217;s view is that voting rights should be based firmly on residency.</p><p>There are two very good reasons why the Scottish Government proposes to use a franchise that is based on residency. The first is practical. Estimates vary, but hundreds of thousands of people who were born in Scotland now live elsewhere in the UK and beyond, so registration and validation of entitlement to vote would add significant complexity to the task of electoral professionals in organising and running the referendum.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658877", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independence Referendum (Voter Eligibility)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elaine Murray on bringing the debate to the chamber.

I also make it clear that the Scottish Government is committed to public sector pensions that are affordable, sustainable and fair.</p><p>We think that it is wrong to increase public sector workers&#8217; contributions to pension schemes at this time and in the way that it is being done. It is a naked cash grab to reduce the deficit and will do nothing to address the long-term sustainability of pensions. We have made our principled position of opposition to the UK Government policy abundantly clear.</p><p>We recognise that this is an extremely challenging time for public sector workers&#8212;a time of pay freezes, significant increases in national insurance contributions, higher VAT, and rising inflation and fuel costs. We have sympathy with the substance of the concerns of the public sector workers and join with them in urging the UK Government to think again.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s handling of the situation has been misguided: it has been no way to run any kind of process, never mind one that will affect the livelihoods of millions of people. In contrast, the Scottish Government will continue to engage in full and extensive dialogue with trade unions and employers&#8217; representatives on the future of pensions provision.</p><p>As members are only too aware, the United Kingdom Government has made it crystal clear that if the Scottish Government does not implement the increase in pension contributions, it will reduce the amount of money in the Scottish budget by more than &#163;100 million in 2012-13 alone. I say to Mr Martin that that is exactly the point that Mr Swinney was making. We did not pass that on to local government as Mr Martin has accused us of doing; it is interesting that he gave no response to Mr Swinney&#8217;s point.</p><p>We all know that the UK issue will have a knock-on effect on Scottish public services. The Scottish Government has urged&#8212;and continues to urge&#8212;the UK Government to reconsider its position. That is why, as recently as 4 November, John Swinney again wrote to Danny Alexander on the matter.</p><p>All of us who were afforded the privilege of being elected to the national Parliament of Scotland have a responsibility to speak up on behalf of the people of Scotland about the issues that matter to them. That is why the Scottish Government will recommend to the Parliamentary Bureau that on 30 November we have a full plenary debate in Government time on the UK&#8217;s misguided handling of public sector pensions. Debating public sector pensions in this Parliament on 30 November will provide the perfect opportunity to shine a light on the failings on the Conservative-Liberal Democrat UK Government in that regard.</p><p>The purpose of this Parliament is to provide the forum and the focus for debate on issues that matter to the people of Scotland. It is clear that the UK Government does not speak for Scotland on this matter, so it is therefore even more important that the Parliament speaks for Scotland on 30 November.</p><p>Finally, I repeat that we are afforded the privilege of being elected to the Parliament to represent the people of Scotland: that is exactly what we should be doing. It is our responsibility&#8212;nay, it is our duty&#8212;to be in Parliament on 30 November to debate issues of such significance and importance to the people of Scotland.</p><p>The business motion that I moved is in the name of the Parliamentary Bureau.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Business Motion"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I make it clear that this Government fully respects the rights of employees who might choose to withdraw their labour on the day of action that is planned for 30 November.

In particular, I want to thank Rhona Brankin and John Farquhar Munro for their service to the committee and the Parliament since they were elected in 1999. I have enjoyed being their colleague and I am glad to have had this opportunity to thank them, because it might be my last chance to do so. I also acknowledge the worthwhile contributions of all the people who have participated in the committee&#8217;s meetings in the Parliament and in various locations throughout Scotland.</p><p>As we all know, the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s public petitions process has been a success story, as Rhona Brankin said, and has gained an international reputation. The Scottish petitions model has attracted interest from other legislatures, such as the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the Queensland Parliament, the Parliament of South Australia and many others.</p><p>What makes the Public Petitions Committee successful and provides a model for other Parliaments to emulate? Ministerial portfolios and subject committees change but, as a mandatory committee, the Public Petitions Committee remains a constant. In the early days, although the committee was unique, its role was restricted to a postbox function of considering petitions and, in the main, passing them on to other committees to examine the detail and take forward. In this session, the committee has taken a step forward and has taken responsibility for more detailed consideration of petitions on a wide variety of important subjects. It has worked without regard to politics on a genuinely cross-party basis and, importantly, has taken a mature and responsible attitude to working with the Government. We are grateful for that. The committee has sought to achieve agreement where it can be reached and change where it can be delivered.</p><p>A key to the committee&#8217;s success is that public petitions provide direct access into the Parliament for members of the Scottish public who want to have their voice heard. The committee&#8217;s work is set not by the Government, legislation or budget scrutiny but by issues that members of the public bring to it.</p><p>A prime example from this session followed from the petition by Tina McGeever, whose husband lost his life to cancer. It called on the Parliament to consider the national health service provision of cancer treatment drugs to ensure equality across Scotland. The committee launched an inquiry and made recommendations. The collaborative working that followed culminated in a parliamentary statement from the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, which set out the package of measures that were being implemented to improve access to all newly licensed medicines in the NHS in Scotland. In addition, new guidance was produced for health boards on introducing newly licensed medicines. That guidance made it explicit what boards were expected to do and that they had to be open and transparent about their processes and decisions.</p><p>The work of the committee on that issue benefited patients and families throughout Scotland and delivered meaningful change. It is a good example of people, the Government and the committee working well together. However, it has been recognised that the petitions process cannot stand still, and it has moved on.</p><p>I was particularly pleased that the committee took up the suggestion that Louise Perry made at the meeting in Fraserburgh of running a young people&#8217;s petitions meeting. That was a great suggestion and all credit is due to the committee for running with it. The resultant meeting on 29 October last year was excellent. I was extremely impressed by the contribution that was made and the enthusiasm that was shown by all the young people who took part.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s external meetings appear to have been successful and well received, with positive and enthusiastic contributions from all participants.</p><p>The petitions system needs to continue to reflect the Parliament&#8217;s founding principles and to build on the success that has been achieved to date. No one can take away from the committee what it has accomplished but, as members of the committee will recognise, it must avoid becoming complacent. The committee&#8217;s initiatives, particularly those that use new technology, attempt to reach out to the public and help to increase awareness of the petitions process, particularly among young people, more than ever. However, as we all know, technology moves fast and constantly needs reviewing and updating to ensure that it continues to excite and engage the public.</p><p>I am delighted with the level of co-operation and mutual respect that has been established over the past few years between the committee clerks and Scottish Government officials. They work well together. In the lead-up to the election, officials will continue to work closely with the clerks to ensure that, as far as possible, the tighter deadlines for responding to petitions&#8212;which are understandable&#8212;are met.</p><p>I highly commend the work of the Public Petitions Committee and the progress that it has made in evolving and developing its processes. We all recognise that it is vital to continue to build on that success to listen to the people of Scotland and to represent their interests.</p><p>I continue to look forward to working with the convener and committee members. The Government stands by to assist in whatever way it can.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions Committee"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the convener for her opening remarks and for the opportunity to contribute to this afternoon&#8217;s debate on the work of the Public Petitions Committee.

It might be my last chance to say to Robin Harper that I have enjoyed working with him since 1999. I wish him all the best when he retires at the end of the session.</p><p>Petitions are brought by members of the Scottish public who seek answers and look for change. As we heard in members&#8217; contributions this afternoon, the committee has continued its record of success into this session. By its nature, the petitions process is reactive; it responds to the petitions that are brought before it. The committee has also often taken on issues that are raised as catalysts for debate&#8212;issues that have ranged from the availability of cancer drugs to the display of sexually graphic material.</p><p>Like other members, I want to bore down a bit more closely into individual petitions that raised two issues in particular. The petitions have been mentioned already in the debate, but the issues they raise bear repetition. They are the significant petitions on vitamin D supplements and fair trade confectionery.</p><p>Bill Butler spoke about the petition on vitamin D supplements, which was submitted as part of the shine on Scotland campaign that is run by his constituents Ryan McLaughlin and the McLaughlin family. The petition attracted a lot of positive media coverage not only for the campaign but for the Parliament.</p><p>The petitioners called on the Parliament to urge the Government to give every child in Scotland vitamin D supplements and to fortify school milk with vitamin D. On various occasions, the McLaughlin family have met the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, the Minister for Public Health and Sport and the chief medical officer. The petition that the family began has made quite a contribution. The Scottish Government has committed to undertake an awareness-raising campaign on recommended vitamin D levels. In the first part of the campaign information was given to all GPs and health professionals to reinforce the importance of vitamin D supplements. Health Scotland is working on the second part of the campaign&#8212;a leaflet for the general public should be published in the spring.</p><p>Nanette Milne and Robin Harper referred to the fair trade petitions. These two petitions, which were submitted in 2009, called on the Government to amend regulations to allow schools to sell fair trade confectionery. They were very interesting petitions. The Government&#8217;s explanation that it had no plans to amend the legislation or change the regulations could have been seen as a sign of resistance or of not wanting to listen. In fact, as the discussions on the regulations brought out, there was already flexibility in the current regulatory regime&#8212;flexibility that would allow fair trade confectionery to be sold in schools. As a result, earlier this month, my colleague the Minister for Children and Early Years wrote to the director of education in each local authority to highlight the flexibility within the existing regulations to allow fair trade sales in schools and to draw their attention to the relevant guidance.</p><p>As those examples show, change can be delivered through the petitions process. However, we need to look to the future. The petitions process has been a success. When it first started we could not anticipate what would happen and where it might lead. The Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s inquiry two years ago into the petitions process showed that it was not afraid to look at its procedures and consider ways in which to improve them. I was pleased to be able to contribute to that inquiry, which made a number of recommendations on different aspects of the petitions process. How the recommendations were taken forward and implemented was key: done well and the petitions process would improve; done badly and there was every chance that it would stagnate. It is commendable to note that the committee has now implemented those recommendations and many others. The committee has been proactive; it has embraced change.</p><p>Where does the Public Petitions Committee go from here? Is there a risk that it is becoming too bogged down by the sheer volume of petitions in the system? Are too many petitions coming forward to allow it sufficient time to scrutinise and investigate petitions where change can be delivered? To my mind, the committee works best when it can focus&#8212;when it can bring to bear the skills, knowledge and, indeed, personality of committee members. I would like to see that focus further refined in the next session.</p><p>I again thank the members of the Public Petitions Committee who have worked hard this session and the clerks who deal efficiently with petitions. The Public Petitions Committee leaves a strong legacy. It is important that its successor committee should keep on going, maintain momentum and build on what the current committee has achieved.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions Committee"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the committee members for their contributions.

Since the decisions of the strategic defence and security review were announced in October, we have pressed the UK Government and the MOD for the clarity and certainty that members have asked for during the debate. Even before those decisions were announced, we worked closely with all parties in the Parliament to create a united front and to stress the need for the UK Government to take the social and economic implications of its decisions into consideration.</p><p>I believe that we need the argument to go beyond the strategic defence reasons. Michael Moore and Danny Alexander agree but, unfortunately, I do not think that we have yet got Liam Fox in that space. What is clear is that we still have a long way to go to convince the UK Government of that principle and to hold it to its commitment to engage with communities.</p><p>The strategic defence and security review has cast doubt on the future of all the RAF bases in Scotland. We already know that RAF Kinloss will cease to be an RAF base with the withdrawal of the Nimrod MRA4. The economic impact in Moray is already being felt, and I know that we all share concerns about the implications for the local community and the local economy.</p><p>However, our debate today is not about Moray. Today, we are discussing the very real threat to RAF Leuchars. The UK Government is conducting a full bases review, the outcome of which is scheduled for the spring of 2011.</p><p>The First Minister has been consistently clear on this issue, which is of national importance to Scotland. Throughout our engagement with the UK Government and the MOD, the retention of all of Scotland's RAF bases has been at the heart of our argument. There are clear strategic arguments for Leuchars to be retained. As others have said, it is currently home to the pilots of 111 fighter squadron, who fly Tornado F3 aircraft, which help to defend our UK airspace but which are being phased out. When 111 squadron goes out of service next spring, Leuchars will, however, continue to play an essential role through 6 squadron, whose Typhoon aircraft and crews will be on high alert to scramble and intercept unidentified aircraft approaching UK airspace.</p><p>However, decisions that are based solely on defence capability might not take into account social and economic considerations, both of which are equally important in the current climate. The cross-party submission that we made to the UK Government in September outlined the contribution that RAF Leuchars and the other bases in Scotland make to their local economies and to Scotland in general. All of the major parties <place-holder colnum=\"31626\"/> in this Parliament supported that submission, which was explicit on the need for decisions to take full consideration of the implications for local communities and the economy.</p><p>As Ted Brocklebank and others have said, aviation at Leuchars dates back to 1911, when a balloon squadron of the Royal Engineers set up a training camp in Tentsmuir forest. Today, RAF Leuchars employs 1,560 service personnel and 220 civilian staff.</p><p>Officials in the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Fife Council are already working to undertake an economic impact assessment. By the end of this week, Fife Council, supported by the work of Scottish Enterprise, will send to the UK Government an initial assessment of the economic impact of the base at Leuchars. That will be followed by a wide-ranging assessment of the social consequences of removing 1,800 employees from a village whose total population is about 4,000. I know that the issues affect an area greater than just the village, but we also know that people living on the base spend their money in the local shops and buy local services, and that the supply chain to the base covers a wide range of contracts with private sector companies across Fife and the whole of Scotland. That spend would vanish if the base closed.</p><p>As others have said, around &#163;25 million was recently invested in upgrading the runway at Leuchars, which has made it one of the RAF's best runways and one that will be fit for purpose for the next 25 years. A decision to close the base now would seem to dismiss the investment in creating that fantastic facility.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21142787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: RAF Leuchars"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Ted Brocklebank on securing an extremely important debate and on its timing.

Our discussion was constructive, and we agreed that Fife Council, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise will continue to work together to present a united case to protect the future of RAF Leuchars.</p><p>I applaud the initiative that Councillor Grant took yesterday in securing a united front across all the parties on the council over the future of RAF Leuchars. I know that Fife Council has asked for a meeting with Liam Fox to set out its concerns.</p><p>We will continue to press the MOD and the UK Government to be clear about their timetable for decisions and to do more to work with us to understand the potential consequences of their decision. The First Minister will do so directly when he meets the Secretary of State for Defence on 11 January. He will take the opportunity to press the case for the retention of RAF Leuchars and RAF Lossiemouth.</p><p>Our brave servicemen and servicewomen know that if they are divided and not unified they will not win the battle, and we must follow the same approach. We cannot allow the UK Government to operate a process of divide and rule, or to indulge in a process of asking Scotland to rob Peter to pay Paul. We must fight to retain both RAF Leuchars and RAF Lossiemouth in a unified campaign across Scotland. The Scottish Government has been in regular touch with MOD officials and ministers to press the case for the retention of both sites and to protect Scotland's interests in the outcome of the SDSR.<place-holder colnum=\"31628\"/></p><p>I will meet Fife Council, Fife Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, elected members and other parties next week to discuss robust and co-ordinated action to address the unwarranted threat to the base.</p><p>Other countries value their air bases. Our neighbours in Norway, for instance, have seven military air bases, but the UK Government seems to want to restrict Scotland to only one.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss nuclear weapons-free zones in the chamber.</p><p>The debate gives us the opportunity to remind ourselves that we have the chance to help our children to grow up with a philosophy of peace and a clear understanding of the implications of their actions in the world. We have the chance to lead by example and to take a statesmanlike approach to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.</p><p>Other parts of the world have shown us what Scotland could achieve if we were free to decide our own position on nuclear weapons. We may not currently have the scope to remove the weapons of mass destruction from Scottish soil, but we can still make a united stand against the possession, threat and use of nuclear weapons.</p><p>Nuclear weapons-free zones operate at both the macro and micro level. At the macro end, we have five regions covered by nuclear weapons-free zone agreements: Latin America, the south Pacific, south-east Asia, Africa and central Asia. They show what can be achieved when countries unite to stand against nuclear weapons. As Bill Kidd and Elaine Smith have mentioned, at the micro level New Zealand took a courageous <place-holder colnum=\"31443\"/> step towards a nuclear-free world in 1984 when it barred nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships from using its ports or entering its waters. New Zealand followed that with legislation that means that for more than 20 years its people have benefited from being the citizens of a nation whose nuclear-free zone status is protected by statute.</p><p>The approach in New Zealand is grounded in a long-term opposition to nuclear weapons. Three decades of anti-nuclear weapons campaigns culminated in the creation of nuclear-free zones, enshrined in legislation. That shows what a nation can do when it has control over its sovereignty and cultural identity. It sets an inspiring precedent for other nations to follow.</p><p>I was lucky enough to chair the working group on Scotland without nuclear weapons, which published its report in November last year. The creation of the group represented an important landmark in the Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration for Scotland to be free of nuclear weapons.</p><p>The group raised concerns about the ways in which nuclear weapons are stored and transported in our country. It highlighted the fact that local authorities are not always aware when nuclear weapons are being transported through their areas. Although there is a balance to be struck in ensuring that security-related information is not shared too widely, we believe that much more can be done.</p><p>The group also highlighted that we should start the process of peace education at a very early age. We already support peace education as part of the curriculum for excellence and we support teachers with material on peace education through Learning and Teaching Scotland&#8217;s website. Our young people have the potential to make a change and it must start with education.</p><p>Let us turn to Trident. In Scotland, we are in a unique position. Scotland is home to the UK&#8217;s nuclear weapons arsenal but, as a country, we are opposed to the possession, threat and use of nuclear weapons. As Bill Kidd said, a recent opinion poll considering cuts in defence demonstrated clearly that 67 per cent of the Scottish people do not want Trident to be replaced. In June 2007, the Scottish Parliament voted conclusively for a motion congratulating the majority of Scottish MPs on voting in the House of Commons to reject the replacement of Trident. Jackson Carlaw is not only in a minority in the chamber today; he is in a minority in the Parliament and in the country. We know that the Conservatives have never been particularly good at listening to the people of Scotland, or at listening to what the Parliament says in this regard. However, one would have thought that<place-holder colnum=\"31444\"/> they might be persuaded by some of the generals who have recently come out against the possession of nuclear weapons. Writing in <em>The Times</em> in April this year, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, General Lord Ramsbotham, General Sir Hugh Beach and Major-General Patrick Cordingley expressed &#8220;deep concern&#8221; that the future of Trident had been excluded from the strategic defence review that followed the election. They cautioned that suppressing discussion of the issues or dismissing alternatives would be &#8220;a big strategic blunder&#8221;. The generals say that the Government will threaten both front-line forces and global disarmament talks unless it considers different ways of spending the &#163;80 billion that is required to replace the fleet of Trident submarines.</p><p>The moral arguments against Trident have always been clear. There may have been an argument for a deterrent in the past&#8212;especially in the 1960s and 1970s&#8212;although I never accepted that argument. The trouble now is that those who argue for the deterrent policy position cannot tell us who the weapons would be pointed at or who the threat is. If there is a threat out there, they should tell us who it is and back up their argument.</p><p>The economic arguments against Trident are now crystal clear. So far, the UK Government has spent &#163;320 million on the replacement of Trident before even starting to build the first submarine. The approximate cost of procuring the submarines is a staggering &#163;25 billion and the total potential cost of maintaining the system, including new infrastructure and missiles and extending the life of the current submarines, is approximately &#163;100 billion. It already costs &#163;2 billion a year to keep the current Trident fleet operational. We cannot afford to spend that money on a deterrent that we do not need. It is equivalent to the cost of the new Forth crossing, which is estimated to cost between &#163;1.7 billion and &#163;2.3 billion. As Elaine Smith has said, that would buy about 4,000 firefighters, the same number of nurses or more than 2,000 junior doctors each year between 2012 and 2017.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to reiterate the Scottish Government&#8217;s opposition to the presence of nuclear weapons on our soil and I very much look forward to the day when Scotland can join New Zealand as a proud country whose nuclear-free status is firmly set out in legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137589", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Weapons-free Zones"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bill Kidd and congratulate him on raising this important matter in Parliament.

It is essential that the Government be fully involved in developing that guidance.

Clearly, not everyone can be successful in gaining an appointment, so it is essential that they are treated with dignity, professionalism and respect throughout the process. Constructive feedback is therefore a very important part of the process. The feedback must be based on gathered evidence and should be offered in a way that helps the applicant to learn from the experience and allows them to give feedback on how the process was for them.</p><p>The proposed code includes a responsibility on ministers to ensure that the person to be appointed is a fit and proper person for the role.

That is a conclusion that has my support. Improved dialogue and partnership among all four UK legislatures can only be of benefit to us all. Effective communications and mutual respect are good for governance and good for democracy. It is an approach that strengthens this Parliament and builds public confidence.</p><p>A number of the commission's proposals that with minor reservations we support&#8212;three to be precise&#8212;will require legislation. As we know, the UK Government is currently working to develop its proposed Scotland bill. In that regard, I had constructive discussions with Michael Moore and David Mundell in London earlier this month, and Fiona Hyslop will meet the secretary of state to pursue that dialogue.</p><p>As members might expect of someone on this side of the chamber, I remain hopeful that UK ministers will see good sense in the constructive suggestions that the Scottish Government has put forward. There are genuine gains to be made for all concerned. That may mean going beyond the proposals put forward by the commission. It means ensuring that this Parliament gains greater responsibility not simply over its own internal processes but in areas of wider public concern.</p><p>The need for such responsibilities is self-evident. The proposals explored in the committee's report are in a slightly different league from the powers that we know are already being discussed as part of the UK bill, including the potential for additional responsibilities for this Parliament in, for example, fiscal matters. We all know that such powers will be important in protecting the jobs and livelihoods of ordinary people across Scotland and in laying the <place-holder colnum=\"29026\"/> foundations for future economic growth and success.</p><p>As I said, the proposals in the committee report are in a different league, but they are not unimportant. I will deal in brief with some of the key points.</p><p>On the options for joint working between Scottish Parliament and Westminster committees, we agree with the committee that the best way to proceed is by means of better informal arrangements. I am also pleased to see in the report recognition of the work of the European and External Relations Committee in facilitating a close and productive working relationship between the Parliament and members of the European Parliament. That is a success story that demonstrates the Parliament's ability to work flexibly in its procedures and to co-operate in the wider Scottish interest.</p><p>On legislation and legislative consent motions, the committee concludes that there is no need for legislative provision in the Scotland bill. That is something that I am sure we can all support, as indeed we can support the commission's proposal that the Sewel convention should be incorporated into Westminster's standing orders. Such initiatives underpin and cement a genuine agenda of respect between the two Parliaments.</p><p>Mutual respect is also central to the commission's recommendations on intergovernmental and interparliamentary relations. Like the committee, I believe that there is already a very positive story to tell. Much of what the commission recommended either occurs already or could be readily implemented without the need for formal procedures and mechanisms. There is no requirement for new legislative provisions in this area&#8212;I do not know why we would want to legislate when we already have processes in the Parliament that work very well.</p><p>Like the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster, I take the view that such mechanisms must not become a procedural straightjacket limiting the flexibility of the Parliaments and imposing rigid obligations on ministers in all the Administrations. Invitations should remain at the discretion of committees or the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadcasting: \"The recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution regarding Scottish Parliament procedures\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee for its report on the parliamentary proposals put forward by the Commission on Scottish Devolution.

I am happy to support the committee's clear recommendation that there is no need for changes in relation to committee membership or the rules governing the establishment of sub-committees. The convener talked about those issues in detail and explained why such changes are not necessary. As he also said, there is already sufficient flexibility to allow a four-stage bill process, if required; however, a fourth stage is currently unnecessary. I agree with the committee that new rules for referring bills back to committee at stage 3 are not needed and that allowing any member to move that a bill be referred back to stage 2 would be going too far.</p><p>I was surprised, however, by the committee's support for a new obligation on members to provide a statement on legislative competence when introducing a non-Government bill. That would create a burden for which there is no real need and which would provide no real benefit. A bill that is outwith legislative competence will normally be identified in the Presiding Officer's statement. Requiring back benchers to jump through the same hoop seems unnecessarily burdensome on those members who are not members of the Government. Nevertheless, I do not want to fall out with the committee on that point. If members see merit in the proposal, the Scottish Government will not oppose it.</p><p>I agree entirely with the proposal to relax the existing limitation in the Scotland Act 1998 on the number of Deputy Presiding Officers. We do not need a plethora of Presiding Officers, but we know from practical experience that the current constraint could cause genuine difficulties should the Presiding Officer or a Deputy Presiding Officer be unfortunate enough&#8212;God forbid&#8212;to fall ill. It would make a great deal of sense to include a simple provision in the forthcoming Scotland bill to remove that constraint.</p><p>The only other recommendation with regard to which the committee makes a case for legislation relates to members' interests. The Scottish Parliament already has a robust framework for the registration and declaration of members' interests, and whether we should make changes to that regime is properly a matter for members' judgment.</p><p>The committee has made recommendations in favour of legislative provision in three areas: the number of Deputy Presiding Officers, the requirement for a statement on legislative competence, and members' interests. In other <place-holder colnum=\"29028\"/> areas, we must focus our efforts on better communications between Parliaments and Governments across the UK as a whole&#8212;a suggestion that has been supported by Robert Brown&#8212;a renewed commitment to co-operation and mutual respect, and the flexible adjustments that can be made using the standing orders and informal mechanisms. Those are conclusions that I endorse, and they are the reason why the Scottish Government will support the motion.</p><p>The UK Government's forthcoming Scotland bill needs to deliver real change for Scotland. It will have to address matters of fundamental public concern and the pressing economic and employment challenges that we face as a nation. However, there is no need for it to become bogged down in minor points of detail for which flexible solutions already exist.</p><p>I commend the committee's report to the Parliament and invite members to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadcasting: \"The recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution regarding Scottish Parliament procedures\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As long as there is flexibility and everybody understands what we are capable of within the rules that we have, there is the   prospect for liaison in the areas that Robert Brown identifies.

Any proposals to reform the functions of commissioners will need to be initiated by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. If the Parliament does not support those proposals, it will have the power to say no to any instrument that the Government lays before it. As David Whitton indicated in his speech, the current environment is completely different from that in which consideration of the bill started. If we began the debate today, the end result might be different from what it has turned out to be, given the reality that we face. As I said in my opening speech, it is inevitable that in the next couple of years we will need to re-examine not just this area but many <place-holder colnum=\"27082\"/> parts of the architecture of the Scottish public sector.</p><p>I hope that Jeremy Purvis will forgive me for referring to the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 on so many occasions in my opening speech, because there are substantial and material links between the 2010 act and the bill, not least with regard to prisoner complaints, Waterwatch Scotland and the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman.</p><p>As all members know, it is ultimately for the Parliament to take a view on its various commissioner roles and their performance. However, work on the bill so far and today's debate have shown that consideration of the topic is not a matter for the Parliament and the Government alone. All parliamentarians have a contribution to make; I was interested to hear David Whitton's comments on that point. The process includes not only the commissioners but the vulnerable groups that can and, sometimes, do look to the commissioners for help and guidance. The bill harmonises the way in which commissioners will work, which can only help to improve the service that they offer. It also helps MSPs to ensure, via the SPCB, that continuous improvement takes place in all the bodies that the Parliament supports and for which it is responsible.</p><p>As I said in my opening speech, we are acutely aware of the challenging financial times and the hard decisions that must be made collectively. The financial memorandum to the bill contains a key message for these difficult and challenging times. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This Bill will not initially deliver substantial financial savings ... However in due course, through in particular the new powers given to the Parliamentary corporation to direct in relation to office accommodation and the sharing of services, it is anticipated savings could emerge.\"</p><p>David Whitton made a good point about the number of services that could come together. The Scottish Parliament information centre briefing that accompanies the bill suggests savings of around &#163;66,000 between 2009-10 and 2012-13. As we all know, we might ultimately be required to consider savings beyond that. However, it is vital that the Parliament ensures that the opportunities that are presented in the bill&#8212;and any further opportunities that might be required to be taken&#8212;are for the sake of those whom the commissioners ultimately serve: the people of Scotland.

The Government has consistently highlighted the close links between the bill and the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. We are pleased with, and supportive of, the work on improving the landscape of parliamentary bodies and enhancing the Parliament's relationship with those bodies.</p><p>The Government has already taken a range of actions to simplify the public sector landscape and improve approaches to public services in Scotland. Our wider public services reform agenda, which the First Minister announced two years ago, has focused on simplifying and integrating public services. It is also focused on promoting the sharing of services through closer collaboration on matters such as procurement. The Government remains committed to reviewing and simplifying Scotland's complex landscape of national public bodies. The provisions in the bill are therefore very much aligned with the Government's aims.</p><p>As members have noted in previous debates, there is to be no dilution or diminution of the services that the affected bodies provide. The operational independence of all parliamentary commissioners will remain unchanged among a series of provisions that actively enhance their status and effectiveness. In fact, the bill should significantly enhance the effectiveness of the parliamentary commissioners. Not only will it enable support services to be shared, but it will enable for the first time a consistent approach to be taken to accountability for all the Parliament's commissions and commissioners.</p><p>The changes to the handling of prisoner complaints that the bill introduces are part of a wider set of changes that are linked to provisions in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. <place-holder colnum=\"27070\"/></p><p>In the debate on the original Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee report in June last year, the Scottish Government welcomed the proposal that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman should take on the new role of designing and implementing a single set of principles for complaints procedures. The 2010 act delivers on the commitments that the Government and the Parliament gave to take forward recommendations that arose from the Sinclair report, which examined complaints handling across the public services.</p><p>The 2010 act gives the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman the complaints standards authority role, which enables the SPSO to carry out the role that Sinclair suggested. The SPSO can now set out principles and good practice on complaints handling across all Scottish public services. Appropriately, those complaints handling principles must first be endorsed by the Parliament.</p><p>The bill will transfer some responsibility from the Government to certain bodies. That will not represent a saving for the Government, as the Parliament will simply top-slice the necessary costs for those bodies from the consolidated Scottish block, which will have the effect of reducing the overall pot before it can be distributed to Scottish public services.</p><p>As with all actions that we have undertaken that impact on public services&#8212;even before these straitened times&#8212;we will look for savings and efficiencies to be delivered, taking advantage of the changes that we make. The financial memorandum to the bill shows some of the transition costs in moving to the new structures as they are currently proposed. It is clear that the reduction in the number of bodies and the potential for greater sharing of resources between parliamentary commissioners that the bill introduces provide welcome scope for future savings. The bill gives the Parliament, through the SPCB, increased powers to scrutinise office-holders' budgets and their draft strategic plans.</p><p>All of us in the chamber recognise the implications of the financial pressures that we now face. The need is now even greater than it was when the bill was first introduced for us all to work together to deliver effective and efficient public services that reflect our shared priorities and ambitions.</p><p>I reiterate the Government's support for the bill, which is a key milestone in a shared journey towards reforming Scotland's public sector landscape that started in 2006 and has been taken forward by the current Government. Since the bill was first envisaged, the financial challenge facing Scotland's public services has changed, and it is now even more essential that we continue to work <place-holder colnum=\"27071\"/> together not only to deliver for the people of Scotland positive outcomes with regard to their engagement with the public services on which we all depend, but to ensure that we who provide those services are as efficient and effective as we can be and can be held to account.</p><p>Depending on the outcome of the comprehensive spending review, it might be necessary&#8212;indeed, unavoidable&#8212;for Parliament to undertake a fresh review of the architecture of the commissioners and commissions to see whether any further efficiencies and savings can be gained to help us to deal with the stark financial challenges of the future.

There have been many thoughtful speeches from throughout the chamber, some of which I have agreed with and some of which I have disagreed with. I, too, congratulate Cathy <place-holder colnum=\"26673\"/> Jamieson and Margaret Curran on their election to the House of Commons. I hope that they spend as much time as possible on those green benches at Westminster&#8212;I hope that they are nice and warm for them.</p><p>As my colleague Fiona Hyslop has made clear, the Scottish Government is keen to establish an open and productive relationship with the UK Government. Indeed, since the formation of the UK coalition Government, the Scottish Government has been working to build just such a relationship, founded on the principles of mutual respect and parity of esteem. The Scottish ministers have demonstrated their intention to work together with the UK Government for the good of Scotland and to build a positive dialogue with UK ministers. In that regard, I welcome the words in the Conservative motion that recognise the importance of a positive and constructive Government-to-Government working relationship. Nevertheless, as Fiona Hyslop, Cathy Jamieson, Michael Matheson and others have said, deeds and actions, not words, will ultimately be the true test of any relationship.</p><p>The UK Government's legislative programme, which was set out on Tuesday in the Queen's speech, is an early chance for us to consider areas in which we might have opportunities to build a strong relationship. Of the 24 bills that were mentioned in the Queen's speech, five are likely to require the consent of the Scottish Parliament. I will constructively and positively liaise with the new UK Government on those bills, as I did with the previous Government. My relationship with David Cairns and Ann McKechin was well developed and very positive. Yes, we faced challenges and there were difficulties, but not all of our relationship with the previous UK Government was difficult&#8212;there were areas on which we agreed.</p><p>The Queen's speech also introduced the prospect of a new Scotland bill, which demonstrates the fact that the UK Government recognises the validity of the Scottish Parliament attaining more devolved responsibilities. The issue is also covered in the Conservative motion. However, I hope that the chamber will accept our argument that the position that is agreed by Parliament at decision time would be strengthened with the insertion of the words \"and fiscal responsibility issues\" from the Government's amendment. It is now almost universally recognised that the current financial settlement does not provide the Scottish Parliament with the responsibility or the necessary mechanisms to boost long-term competitiveness or to respond to economic shocks. In short, Scotland's lack of financial responsibility has real long-term consequences. For instance, the Scottish Government has no scope to borrow prudently to invest in vital infrastructure projects, and neither <place-holder colnum=\"26674\"/> does it have at its disposal the full levers that are necessary to spur growth It goes without saying that the Scottish Government firmly believes that if Scotland is to achieve its full economic potential, it must have control of the economic levers of an independent country. However, we also believe that it would be better for our economy and our country if the maximum level of fiscal responsibility were devolved to this place. In contrast, Labour's position of absolute support for the Calman financial package does not recognise the reality of where we are now. The debate has moved on but, judging by their amendment, Labour members seem to be stuck in a time warp. They seem to be stuck in a time before the election campaign&#8212;indeed, in a time before their own former Government's response to the Calman report, which rejected many of its elements. My colleague Fiona Hyslop, in her opening speech, rightly highlighted and drew attention to the flaws and dangers that are inherent in the Calman financial proposals.</p><p>The Conservative motion rightly makes a point of highlighting the need for a positive and constructive relationship between the Scottish and UK Governments. The Calman financial proposals, as they stand, would put the potential for conflict and disagreement at the very heart of intergovernmental relationships. Derek Brownlee made that point well, as did Angela Constance. Angela Constance quoted Gerry Hassan, who wrote an insightful article in <em>The Guardian</em> yesterday. Referring to the Calman proposals, he wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sadly, though, the tax powers are not as straightforward or inviting as they look. They could be deeply damaging to Scotland's public spending and tax take, and encourage a culture of conflict between the Scottish and UK governments. They do not even advance fiscal autonomy very far, would not have fairness or transparency in them, and would not encourage responsibility, instead aiding conflict and disagreement. In short, they would have the potential of becoming an unpopular, detested 'tartan tax'&#8212;both north and south of the border.\"</p><p>The weaknesses in the Calman proposals are well illustrated&#8212;as they have been by other members this morning&#8212;by the UK Government's plans for income tax allowances and national insurance. Cathy Jamieson and Margaret Curran referred to the Calman proposals. To both of them, I say that the devil is often in the detail. Of all the Calman proposals, only 23 were accepted by the UK Government in its white paper, whereas the Scottish Government accepted 29 of them, so it is not fair to say that we were not prepared to take on board good ideas.</p><p>I turn to the proposals that have been put forward by the Liberal Democrats. I give credit where it is due&#8212;it is a very valiant attempt by the <place-holder colnum=\"26675\"/> Liberal Democrats to pretend that everything in the coalition garden is rosy. They knew, when they lodged their amendment, that it had absolutely no prospect of being supported at decision time. It is simply incredible to think that the Parliament could support&#8212;with no reservations&#8212;the whole of the new UK Government's programme, which is what the Liberal Democrat amendment asks us to do. Frankly, it is incredible that all of the Liberals in the Scottish Parliament could support the entire package of the coalition proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20811379", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Her Majesty's Government (Relations)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to offer some closing remarks for the Government on the motion and amendments that are before us today.

PR is designed to provide representation to parties that achieve a reasonable share of the vote. That applies to small parties with democratic values, but I accept that it can also apply, particularly in some systems, to extremist parties. However, as other members have said, the voting system does not cause that. A first-past-the-post system can also let in extremist parties. Recent local authority elections in Barking, Stoke-on-Trent and Burnley are examples of that. There is a vital difference between representation and control. Obnoxious parties can be represented under PR, but it is almost impossible for them to gain control. By <place-holder colnum=\"25866\"/> contrast, the BNP has all the borough council seats in part of Burnley despite having obtained nowhere near the majority of the vote.

For example, section 27 sets out clearly what is included in the term \"Scottish statutory instrument\" and section 30(4) sets out clearly which instruments need not be laid before the Parliament.

The minimum period at present is 21 days. The bill already provides for that period to be increased to 28 days. I must admit that I was surprised that Helen Eadie brought back these amendments, following the discussion at stage 2. As recognised by Ian McKee, having taken evidence and carefully considered the issues, the conclusion reached by the Subordinate Legislation Committee in its 2008 report, which formed much of the basis of this bill, was that increasing the minimum period to 40 days would probably be unworkable. In reaching that conclusion, the committee considered evidence that it received from the then Minister for Parliamentary Business, Margaret Curran, who said that a move to 40 days would cause</p><p class=\"indent\">\"considerable difficulties in keeping the show on the road.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Subordinate Legislation Committee</em>, 21 November 2006; c 2131.]</p><p>The idea of increasing the period to 40 days was raised again in the Subordinate Legislation Committee's stage 1 report. Committee members were divided on the issue. I concede that there was some feeling that the evidence that the Government had given for opposing such a move reflected worst-case scenarios, and members called for further examples before stage 2. The Government responded properly and provided those examples. After reflection on them, an amendment with terms identical to those of the amendment that we are considering now was voted down by the committee at stage 2. Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Scottish National Party members voted against the amendment, with only Labour members being in favour.<place-holder colnum=\"25734\"/></p><p>Let me briefly set out again the robust and reasonable case that the Government&#8212;and, for that matter, previous Governments and Labour ministers&#8212;made for setting the relevant period at 28 days. The decision was taken after close consideration and analysis of the broader constitutional framework and the day-to-day, practical impact on stakeholders. A move to 40 days would significantly reduce the speed with which Governments and the Parliament can transact business. That would be to the detriment not of Governments, which do not make statutory instruments for their own good, but of the people of Scotland. Such a move would also damage the Parliament's reputation.</p><p>The Government's formal response to the committee's stage 1 report offered what I consider to be a thorough, comprehensive and conclusive analysis of the practical difficulties that would arise. Increasing the period to 40 days would significantly reduce the speed and efficiency with which the Government and the Parliament can transact business. Although the difference between 28 days and 40 days is nominally only 12 days, obviously, it must be remembered that parliamentary recesses are not counted in the number of days.</p><p>If the proposal was applied in the current year, only instruments that were laid on 5 and 6 January, between 12 April and 16 May and between 25 October and 10 November could complete the necessary 40 days before the start of the next recess. On average, a negative instrument that was laid under a 40-day regime would take about 54 days to come into force. An instrument that was laid between 27 May and 28 June would take 103 days to complete scrutiny and an instrument that was laid between 29 June and 3 September would take anything up to 119 days to complete scrutiny.</p><p>As I explained in my letter of 12 February to the Subordinate Legislation Committee, such impacts cannot be addressed through improved management of Government business. It is the responsibility of any Government to ensure that its legislative proposals can be progressed without undue delay. Although it is true that amendment 24 seeks to make some attempt to lessen the impact by providing a complex mechanism for calculating the 40-day period, in practice it would alter only the points of the year at which problematic gluts of instruments would occur.</p><p>To Helen Eadie I say, as gently as I can, that I fully understand the implications of amendment 24.

As I took my place, Ross Finnie quipped that it must be my big day because, usually, I just formally move motions. If this is my big day I wish that a lot more of our colleagues were here to share the excitement with us and have the pleasure of speaking in the debate.</p><p>I make light, but we are talking about an important bill. It was interesting to hear Trish Godman's summary. She highlighted the strong <place-holder colnum=\"24856\"/> links between the bill and what the Government is working hard to achieve for Scotland. We have already acted to simplify the public sector landscape and improve approaches to public services in Scotland. Not least of those actions is the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, which, I hope, the Parliament will conclude tomorrow. We are therefore pleased that the RSSB committee has considered improving the landscape and the relationship with parliamentary bodies.</p><p>We can be assured that, as Trish Godman said, the bill comes after a great deal of hard work and thorough thought. In 2006, the Finance Committee considered in detail the accountability and governance arrangements for the parliamentary commissioners. The Finance Committee's work informed the independent review that was carried out by Professor Lorne Crerar. When the Parliament debated the Crerar report in 2007&#8212;another exciting debate that I took part in&#8212;we all endorsed the vision of a risk-based and proportionate approach to scrutiny with the user placed at the centre.</p><p>The bill is aligned with Lorne Crerar's direction and the Government's aims. The Government therefore welcomes the bill and will support it as it goes through the Parliament. I am sure that there is a great sigh of relief at that. The bill is to be welcomed as it will contribute to the simplification of the public bodies landscape and make things easier for the public. That is what the process must always be about. The independence and effectiveness of the roles of the parliamentary commissioners will be enhanced significantly. Crucially, the operational independence of all parliamentary commissioners will remain unchanged, although the bill will introduce a more consistent approach to accountability for all the commissions. That will make the relationship more akin to the one that the Government has with our public bodies.</p><p>Trish Godman rightly mentioned the changes to the complaint-handling system with regard to prisoners. The provisions on that are part of a wider set of changes to the system of complaints handling for all Scottish public services. That delivers on commitments to take forward recommendations that arose from the post-Crerar report by Douglas Sinclair, which considered complaints handling across public services.</p><p>In the debate on the RSSB committee report in June last year, the Government welcomed the proposal that the SPSO should take on the new role of designing and implementing a single set of principles for complaints procedures. It is clear that no other single organisation is as well placed or as well established as the SPSO to take on that role. That is being achieved through the Public <place-holder colnum=\"24857\"/> Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, as recommended in the RSSB committee report, and it will lead to a more streamlined and accessible approach to complaints handling across public services.</p><p>Trish Godman touched on the financial implications. It is clear that, as with all the actions that we undertake that will impact on public services, we must continue to look for savings and efficiencies to be achieved through the changes that we make. It is clear that the real savings to be achieved through the bill will come from organisations that undertake activities more effectively and efficiently through working together and sharing best practice.</p><p>The proposals in the bill will involve some realignment of how resources are split between the Government and the Parliament. The Parliament will need to reassess the level of resource that it requires from the Scottish block each year to resource the functions that its commissions take on from bodies that were previously funded by the Government. That means that there will probably be no overall saving to the Government from the proposals, but we all know that making savings is essential in order to balance the public finances. The reduction in bodies and the potential for the greater streamlining of accommodation and greater opportunities for parliamentary commissioners to share support services and resources provide scope for future efficiencies by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body.</p><p>The real benefit of the bill will come from the Parliament's ability to set, for the first time, consistent standards across all our parliamentary bodies. Every part of the public sector must manage its resources responsibly and deliver maximum value for the public purse, and all our public services must, without exception, provide good-quality public services that are valued by their customers. They must also ensure that efficiencies are applied consistently and proactively across the whole public sector and across all corporate or common services.</p><p>In conclusion, I repeat the Government's support for the bill, which is a key milestone in a shared journey that started in 2006. Four years on from the original Finance Committee report and nearly three years after the external scrutiny steps that were undertaken by Professor Crerar, the bill is a positive step that I am glad to support.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20720517", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Commissions and Commissioners etc Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Trish Godman, I am speaking from the front bench.

That is what members' business is meant to be about: local issues that are important to the people in the communities that members serve.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with Aileen Campbell when she talks about the important role that community facilities can play in bringing people together and creating a sense of identity in our towns and villages. As other members have done, I can reminisce about the times that I spent in local halls, whether it was the scout hall, or the record hops that I attended in the local church hall, or the youth facilities that I used in other places. I know that I am giving away my age by mentioning record hops.</p><p>Our community empowerment action plan, which was launched jointly with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities last March, makes it clear that we as a Government value what communities can achieve for themselves when they are supported to work together. I am pleased that South Lanarkshire Council's single outcome agreement recognises the benefits that the voluntary sector and voluntary action can bring, including communities running services and facilities for themselves. There might be opportunities in that for the Jubilee hall people and those who support them.</p><p>The Government strongly believes in the importance of community facilities in supporting <place-holder colnum=\"22865\"/> community empowerment, particularly in rural areas. We back up our belief by providing funding through rural community development grants, supporting the development of other assets such as schools&#8212;which Jim Hume dismissed perhaps a bit too lightly&#8212;and, increasingly, exploring and supporting the benefits of community asset ownership.</p><p>The rural priorities scheme under the rural development programme has invested about &#163;5.5 million to develop rural community facilities, including village halls. In Coalburn in South Lanarkshire, which is only 3 miles from Lesmahagow, we have committed nearly &#163;40,000 to the Coalburn Miners Welfare Charitable Society for the upgrade and improvement of its community centre, which provides facilities for nearly 50 community groups each week. Groups from mothers and toddlers to special needs and pensioner groups will benefit from improved access through a new porch and access ramps. I admired the amount of detail that Michael McMahon gave on the new facilities that will be provided in Lesmahagow. For a man who did not know much about the issue, he demonstrated a great deal of knowledge.</p><p>In addition, through the LEADER rural community programme, we have made available &#163;57 million in the period 2007 to 2013 to be directed at sustainable community-based projects, including rural community facilities. The aim is to increase the capacity of rural communities and business networks to build knowledge and skills, and to encourage innovation. To date, more than &#163;2 million has been invested in 600 projects and a further &#163;15 million has been committed to local community projects throughout Scotland. That demonstrates that, through those schemes, whether LEADER or the Scottish rural development programme, local organisations have the opportunity to access resources to make a difference for the communities that they serve.</p><p>We believe in the potential benefits of community ownership of assets, although care is needed because some facilities will be liabilities rather than assets and not every community group has the necessary desire or skills to own a local hall or building. We are investing &#163;0.25 million over two years in the Development Trusts Association Scotland to ensure that we share good practice and support local authorities and community groups to understand the costs and benefits of community asset ownership.</p><p>If it will help, I am happy to direct Scottish Government officials to speak with people from South Lanarkshire Council or community groups about the work that DTAS is doing on our behalf. The work is in the early stages and there are plans for a national seminar in the spring. I am happy for <place-holder colnum=\"22866\"/> representatives from South Lanarkshire to attend that event. Make no mistake: when community ownership of assets is done right, it can have remarkable results, and the Government is happy with that approach.</p><p>I understand that officials in South Lanarkshire Council are committed to continuing to speak with local groups about the provision of community facilities in Lesmahagow. I welcome that commitment and strongly encourage the council to think creatively and boldly about the future of the Jubilee hall and how the community might be involved in shaping it. Opportunities have come up through the Big Lottery Fund growing community assets programme. That fund is now closed, but the Government is involved in discussions about possible opportunities for a successor fund, which might yet provide opportunities to access funds to help restore halls such as the Jubilee.</p><p>I thank Aileen Campbell for giving us the opportunity to debate this important topic. I wish all the people of Lesmahagow best wishes in their on-going efforts to help their community thrive.<place-holder time=\"17:41:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:41.</em></p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20498112", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lesmahagow Jubilee Hall"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If the member had waited a little, I was going to add a caveat to what I said.

I am not saying that Margaret Curran was doing that with regard to the issues around part 4 of the bill, to which I know that she was referring.</p><p>I will refer in particular to the 28 or 40-day period. We heard from Jamie Stone and Helen Eadie, among others, that they continue to discuss the potential for moving the minimum time before a negative instrument can come into force from 28 to 40 days after it has been laid and that there should be specific provisions for reversing the effect of negative instruments following annulment. The Government remains opposed to both those proposals, but I hope that further discussion during the passage of the bill will serve to deliver an effective outcome. On both counts, I believe that there are persuasive arguments that the current system works well and that we would be ill advised to make changes that would certainly limit existing flexibility and may well have a negative impact. Even after much deliberation today, the perceived practical difficulties that it was feared might arise have not been identified. Indeed, Helen Eadie said that there have not been many annulments of negative instruments.</p><p>This Government, like the previous coalition, believes that for the bill to provide that all negative SSIs cannot come into force for a full 40 days after they are laid is unwieldy, disproportionate and impractical. I heard it said that I described the <place-holder colnum=\"22673\"/> worst-case scenario. If I remember correctly, it was the scenario painted by the previous coalition. However, I will try to provide a fuller menu of issues that provide a better picture in that regard. In my opening speech, I talked about another two areas in which I thought the issue was important: EU regulations and legal aid changes, which would have an impact. I will work with the committee to try to find a solution that will be acceptable to all.</p><p>I turn to the points made by Jamie Stone and Mike Rumbles about the pre-consolidation modification of enactments. A number of members called for the removal of part 4, which provides for the pre-consolidation modification of enactments and the introduction of provisions similar to those in the Law Commission Act 2009. I think that Margaret Curran was alluding to that in particular when she referred to Mike Rumbles. Although the Government agrees with the committee's comments on the role of the Scottish Law Commission in the consolidation of legislation, we are still of the opinion that the proposed power to make pre-consolidation amendments in part 4 would aid the maintenance and modernisation of Scots law. However, I will consider that recommendation further and provide the committee with my views prior to stage 2. I hope that my approach shows that I am trying to look for compromise and to find a good way forward. That is why I will consider further the recommendation that similar provisions to those in the 2009 act be included in the bill.</p><p>As for the application of legislation to the Crown, in response to our consultation and to the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, the judiciary, the Law Society of Scotland, the Scottish Law Commission and the Faculty of Advocates all expressed the concerns that Jackson Carlaw outlined about the Crown's position being reversed and suggested that the Crown's position should remain untouched. However, the majority of consultees agreed that the Crown should be in the same position as the public, unless specifically exempted from being bound by legislation, so we are reflecting the consensus of responses in the consultation process.</p><p>One small point that I did not have the chance to mention in my opening speech is that I will lodge a stage 2 amendment on exempting local instruments. People who have read the report will understand what that means.</p><p>I thank all members for acknowledging the Government's approach&#8212;I certainly acknowledge the approach that the Subordinate Legislation Committee has taken. I will always try to find a way to reach agreement, if agreement can be <place-holder colnum=\"22674\"/> achieved. However, with the proposed change from 28 to 40 days, we are in danger of having change for change's sake and of fixing something that ain't broke, so I will continue to resist that.

The Government welcomes and agrees with many of the comments and recommendations that were made by the Subordinate Legislation Committee. Inevitably, we have yet to find agreement with the committee on some matters that were raised in the report, although I am hopeful that that can be remedied.</p><p>The bill deals principally with interpretative and procedural matters, providing the fundamental legislative architecture that is required for a modern Scotland. The bill modernises, where appropriate, the Scottish interpretation code; it streamlines the scrutiny procedures for Scottish statutory instruments, replacing more obscure procedures with one of three standardised procedures; and it updates the provisions for the publication and preservation of SSIs. Broadly speaking, the approach that we have taken is to restate the content of the existing transitional orders on interpretation and special parliamentary procedures. However, after 10 years, we have rightly taken the opportunity, where appropriate, to modernise our interpretation code.</p><p>Part 1 contains provisions that will apply only to the interpretation of future acts of the Scottish Parliament. Existing acts of the Scottish Parliament and instruments will continue to be governed by the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Publication and Interpretation etc of Acts of the Scottish Parliament) Order 1999. Westminster legislation will continue to be interpreted in accordance with the Interpretation Act 1978.</p><p>I confirm that I agree with the committee's recommendation that it is important to put beyond doubt that acts of sederunt and acts of adjournal fall within the definition of \"Scottish instrument\". I <place-holder colnum=\"22654\"/> shall, therefore, as the report recommends, lodge an amendment clarifying that acts of sederunt and acts of adjournal will fall within that definition.</p><p>Part 2 serves as an excellent example of the constructive relationship between the Government and the Parliament. The thrust of the policy for part 2 stems from the Government's support for recommendation 1 of the Subordinate Legislation Committee's report, which said that, subject to some improvements, the current arrangements and procedures for scrutinising SSIs should be retained.</p><p>The bill also provides for the minimum period between the laying of negative instruments and their coming into force to be extended from 21 to 28 days. However, the committee's stage 1 report has called for further consideration to be given to the merits of further extending that period to 40 days. The Government has already provided the committee with information on the potential difficulties arising from such a move, particularly the introduction of delay to the smooth passage of the Government's legislative programme. The previous Administration agreed with our position that an increase to 40 days would be inappropriate. In evidence to the Subordinate Legislation Committee in November 2006, the then Minister for Parliamentary Business said that such an increase</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would cause us considerable difficulties in keeping the show on the road\"</p><p>and would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"create gluts in the system\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Subordinate Legislation Committee</em>, 21 November 2006; c 2131.]</p><p>She then proposed the compromise of increasing the time period to 28 days. A move to 40 days could prove problematic in respect of a couple of policy areas in particular. Obvious examples would be SSIs implementing European Union obligations or those that update the frameworks for eligibility to legal aid in consequence of Her Majesty's Treasury announcements on the retail prices index. I add that I have yet to see evidence that the current process is causing difficulties. If it is not, why would we want to fix something that is not broken?</p><p>The committee also recommends the inclusion in the bill of a maximum time within which the maker of an instrument could revoke it. I appreciate the committee's desire for clarity and certainty, but I reiterate that such a provision could cause practical difficulties. Much will depend on the circumstances of the instrument. It may not be possible to make appropriate arrangements within the given timeframe, especially if it is short.</p><p>In addition, I have considerable reservations about the proposition that, on the annulment of an instrument, its maker should make an order <place-holder colnum=\"22655\"/> restoring the original position. As the committee recognises, that will not always be possible or desirable&#8212;for example, when EU obligations are being implemented, or when a body corporate has been dissolved. As the annulment of an instrument is a rare event that is more likely to be prompted by policy considerations than by technical drafting concerns, I suggest that political, as opposed to technical, solutions are appropriate.</p><p>However, on both those issues, I will give further careful consideration to the points that the committee made and will respond to them fully in the Government's response to its report.</p><p>The provisions in part 3, on the publication of acts and instruments, raise important issues about the accessibility, publication and preservation of Scottish legislation. I confirm that, as the committee suggests, the Government will lodge amendments that will oblige the keeper of the records of Scotland to preserve all SSIs and the Queen's printer for Scotland to provide a printed copy of every SSI to the National Library of Scotland.</p><p>The pre-consolidation modification power in part 4 is intended to simplify and speed up the consolidation process. We are of the opinion that the provisions in question would aid the maintenance of Scots law, but the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee still have concerns about them. I will consider those concerns further and will provide my views on them as part of the Government's formal response to the report.</p><p>Part 5 sets out the procedure for instruments that by virtue of their parent act are subject to the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Orders subject to Special Parliamentary Procedure) Order 1999, which made transitional provision for such special procedure until an act of the Scottish Parliament could provide for it. The provisions in the bill replicate those in the transitional special parliamentary procedure order.</p><p>The Government notes that the committee has concerns regarding section 55, to which we are giving serious consideration. The issue at stake is technical and complicated. We will provide the committee with the results of our consideration before stage 2.</p><p>There are a few more points that I want to deal with at this stage. On the service of documents by electronic means, which is dealt with in section 26, I want to pick up on the concerns that have been expressed by certain sectors of the legal profession, including the Law Society of Scotland, which I know wrote to all MSPs yesterday on the matter. As I promised in oral evidence to the <place-holder colnum=\"22656\"/> Subordinate Legislation Committee, the Government will lodge an amendment to clarify that prior written agreement of the parties concerned would be required before documents could be serviced through the use of electronic communications.</p><p>I again thank the members of both committees for their work on the bill, which has been a fine example of the Government, the Parliament and civic Scotland working together for the good of Scotland. There are some issues that I have not had time to deal with, but I hope that I will have time to address them in my closing remarks. I look forward to listening to the views and comments of members.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495384", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take this opportunity to thank the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, and their officials, for the hard work and considerable thought that they have put into scrutinising the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill.

We need only look at turnout at elections to recognise that we have a problem that should concern us all. We need to do all that we can in our behaviour and in the way that we act to encourage the people of Scotland to take an active interest in politics in the widest sense.

We would welcome detailed discussions.</p><p>Decision time will take place in a few minutes. I do not believe that it is beyond the ability of the Parliament to unite on areas in which we are on common ground. We all know in our heart of hearts that we are sharing the path of progress on areas such as responsibility for air-guns, drink driving and elections administration. We should unite not simply because we believe that the governance of Scotland can be improved through further devolution but because we all know that, if we have those additional responsibilities, we can begin to make changes that will genuinely improve the lives of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20446391", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliament (Further Powers)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I must make progress.

I thank members for their interesting speeches.</p><p>As members have said, this centenary year of the great procession and the women's demonstration of 1909 gives us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate and commemorate women of the suffrage movement. We had the centenary procession in Edinburgh in October, in which some members here participated, as did other politicians from across the parties, members of women's organisations, trade unionists and many others. Complementary local events have been held throughout Scotland, such as the suffrage exhibition that is being held in the museum of Edinburgh. We have today held a timely debate, to which I am delighted to respond. Like other members, I thank gude cause for helping us and giving us the opportunity to reflect and celebrate.</p><p>Scotland's first suffrage groups appeared in the late 1860s. They demanded the vote for women as a basic human right and as a means of improving women's lives in the workplace, at home, in the courts of law and in education. They demanded justice and equality for all women and used peaceful tactics to try to win support. They sent petitions to Parliament, wrote letters to MPs, distributed leaflets and organised meetings. However, 30 years of peaceful campaigning produced only minor change so, in the 1900s, more militant campaigners&#8212;whom we know as the suffragettes&#8212;began to emerge.</p><p>We have heard about people from Edinburgh and Glasgow, so I will choose another city: Dundee. Two Scottish suffragettes&#8212;Ethel Moorhead and Lila Clunas&#8212;are celebrated in two of the 25 bronze plaques on the Dundee women's trail, which is a city-centre walk that Linda Fabiani opened last year. Ethel Moorhead was an artist and was known locally as the \"most turbulent\" of Dundee's suffragettes. She was force-fed in Calton jail&#8212;the situations that Christine Grahame described in that regard were telling&#8212;and she had a string of convictions, but her first recorded act of dissent was in 1911, when she threw an egg at Winston Churchill. It is ironic that St Andrew's house stands on the former site of Calton jail and is where all four female Scottish ministers have their offices, as did the female ministers in the previous Scottish Executive.</p><p>Lila Clunas was an elementary schoolteacher who ensured that working-class women were involved in the fight for the right to vote. She was imprisoned in London and went on hunger strike after an unlawful incident at 10 Downing Street. After world war two, that remarkable woman was elected to the council in Dundee, where she served until she was 88.<place-holder colnum=\"21711\"/></p><p>As a result of the pressure and agitation from the suffragists and suffragettes, Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave all women over 30 full voting rights. However, that was less than full democracy. Women continued&#8212;rightly&#8212;to campaign until 1928, when full voting rights were finally granted to all women over 21, as others have said.</p><p>Democracy had finally triumphed and the suffrage campaigners had won their argument. Without the suffragists, how long would it have taken to move on from an age in which women could not own property, hold public positions or vote? Without the suffragists, the Duchess of Atholl might never have become the first Scottish female MP. As a Conservative and Unionist Party member, she represented Kinross and Western Perthshire&#8212;my home area&#8212;from 1923 to 1938, although I was not there at that time. She was the first female minister in the Westminster Parliament.</p><p>The suffrage movement made a lasting contribution to Scottish democracy and society. It led the way in women making their voice heard, campaigning for an end to all discrimination and prejudice, and striving to achieve equality with men in all aspects of their lives. It is not easy to find proper recognition of the women who were and are part of shaping Scotland&#8212;those who made the country what it is today and what it can be in the future. By awarding proper recognition to women, we promote pride in communities and in Scotland and create role models for the rest of us, most importantly our young people.</p><p>This Government is committed to proper recognition for women in today's society. I spoke earlier about the Dundee women's trail. This year, the Government has demonstrated our commitment in other areas, too. Examples include ministers' involvement in the <em>Evening Times</em> Scotswoman of the year awards in January, international women's day events in March, the Scottish Trades Union Congress women's conference in November and, of course, the centenary suffrage procession in October.</p><p>The Government is committed to encouraging more women to become involved in political decision making. It is funding the Scottish Women's Convention to the tune of &#163;521,000 over a three-year period. The convention organises a large international women's day event in March each year. The theme for next year is the importance of the involvement of women in all aspects of the political process, from voting to becoming an MSP. In addition, the Government is providing &#163;245,000 over a three-year period to Engender, which is an information and research networking organisation for women that provides <place-holder colnum=\"21712\"/> opportunities for women to engage in focused debate on issues of concern and enables them to influence policy decisions.</p><p>We have heard in the debate about the rigours and hardships that the women's suffrage movement endured in the early 1900s. That reminds us of the significance of the right to vote. Voting is the single most important action that anyone can take to ensure that their voice is heard. By voting, we directly elect the people who make the decisions that affect us and our families every day, locally and nationally. We all&#8212;the men and women in civic society, political parties, trade unions and local authorities&#8212;need to focus on the reasons for the low turnouts at elections and do more to make people want to turn out to vote. We owe it to the memory of the women of suffrage to do all that we can to strengthen democracy.<place-holder time=\"17:42:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:42.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20411180", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Votes for Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Shirley-  Anne Somerville on bringing the debate to the chamber.

Perhaps business <place-holder colnum=\"19874\"/> managers do not always need to send e-mails to get what they want&#8212;we need only have people such as John Wilson on our side.</p><p>It is safe to say that some genuine issues, on which we can all agree, were raised in today's debate. First, the petitions process has a unique function. Its workload is set not by Government legislation or the need for public scrutiny, but by issues that are brought to the Parliament by the Scottish public. The committee was the first in the world to accept e-petitions, which shows the Parliament's progressive and innovative approach. The system has gained an international reputation, providing a model for other Parliaments and showcasing our innovative approach around the globe. It is considerably more advanced and more appropriate to the needs of modern democracy than is the archaic Westminster system.</p><p>In the past few days, in meeting John Bercow, the new Speaker of the Westminster Parliament, I have been impressed by the way in which he has asked questions about how we do business here and by how he has been trying to learn from how this Parliament&#8212;as well as others further afield&#8212;operates. I hope that through the process with which John Bercow is involved not only will Westminster learn from us, but we will have the chance to learn from others about how we can improve, adapt and make things here better in the future.</p><p>Bill Butler rightly touched on how the petitions process has produced genuine change. If I remember correctly, he spoke specifically about Mr and Mrs McQuire's petition on the prescription of beta interferon for MS sufferers. The then Scottish Executive responded to that petition and allowed all MS sufferers in Scotland to benefit. Bill Butler described that process eloquently and with feeling, as members might expect him to on such issues.</p><p>Other petitions deserve to be mentioned, such as the one on the Scottish burned children's club that sought to change building regulations, which happened in 2006. That example and others that have been offered by members around the chamber show clearly how the Government and Parliament of the day have responded to people's needs that are brought to them.</p><p>There was a petition from the small folk of Gillies hill, a group in my constituency, which engaged successfully with the Public Petitions Committee on numerous occasions to try to keep alive an issue in its backyard. The pertinent questions that were asked by the Public Petitions Committee of various organisations, as well as the Government, were helpful in allowing the group to see its petition to a successful conclusion.<place-holder colnum=\"19875\"/></p><p>The process is essential. It provides a direct route into Parliament for people who want issues to be considered and it makes an important contribution to the implementation of the consultative steering group principles, which I mentioned at the beginning of the debate, of openness and responsiveness.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the committee raised the possibility of having an annual debate on a petition in the chamber. I would very much welcome that; I am always willing to discuss securing more debating time for issues that arise from the petitions process. Regular debates on petitions would boost the committee's profile, promote its work and enable it to play a greater role in influencing opinion and policy. I look forward to more discussion around that.</p><p>The Government welcomes the committee's proposal to formally alert Government officials to new petitions when they are lodged. That will increase our awareness of issues that are coming forward and enable us to deal more proactively with the petitions once we receive them.</p><p>Over the past year&#8212;this reflects the committee's direction of travel&#8212;the Government has taken a number of steps to improve its internal processes for the handling of petitions, including setting up a tracker system to monitor responses. I will continue to seek further improvements within the Government in conjunction with the committee and its able clerks, who have been rightly applauded for what they do.</p><p>A number of members raised the issue of petitions being put to local councils. Councils are independent corporate bodies in their own right and it is up to them to determine whether a local petitions process would be appropriate in their local circumstances. We heard two good examples from Marlyn Glen. One of them was from my constituency of Stirling, which has a Scottish National Party council. The other was from Renfrewshire, where a local petitions system is working. Such good practice should be shared and other local authorities might look to see how they could bring it on board in their localities.</p><p>There was a fair bit of discussion about how IT could be better utilised. I look forward to seeing the benefit of new technologies. Social marketing tools can also be used; they can go hand in hand with social marketing strategy. I would be interested to see how the committee plans to develop that aspect over the coming year. We might want to return to that should the committee want to have an annual debate. That would be a good thing to have a debate on; it would allow a lot more parliamentarians to understand what is going on.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20195663", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Petitions Process Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Since everybody else has been handing out thanks, perhaps I should start by offering thanks to the committee convener before he even gets to his feet.

On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge the hard work that the convener and members of the committee have undertaken. Like John Farquhar Munro, I acknowledge the valuable input by all those who participated in the committee's evidence sessions and public meetings throughout Scotland. I am pleased to take part in the debate.</p><p>As we all know, the petitions process makes an essential contribution to implementing the Parliament's founding principles. The Parliament should be accessible, open and responsive and it should develop procedures that make possible a participative approach to the development, consideration and scrutiny of policy and legislation. The petitions process was designed so that the rules on who may petition Parliament and what happens to petitions are deliberately broad and inclusive. For example, Parliament is obligated under the standing orders to consider all competent petitions. Petitions can be submitted directly, including electronically, and they do not require the support of an MSP. Importantly, petitions may be submitted in any language.</p><p>That process is in stark contrast to the petitions system at Westminster, where individuals have the right to petition the Parliament through their member of Parliament, but have no guarantee that the petition will be given consideration. No doubt that is why the petitions process became one of the Scottish Parliament's successes and has gained a deserved worldwide reputation, with many other Parliaments looking at the Scottish example.</p><p>Although much has been accomplished and a great deal of progress has been made, we cannot be complacent. Professor Macintosh's warning at the committee's round-table discussion in April is clear&#8212;other Parliaments are moving ahead on processes and technology. In her words,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ten years is an awfully long time ... it is time for the Parliament to move on, too.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Public Petitions Committee,</em> 21 April 2009; c 1678.]</p><p>The committee's comprehensive report recognises that although the fundamentals of the petitions system are sound, more work needs to be done. We need to embrace new ideas for better engaging the Scottish people. We must connect with young people and the harder-to-reach groups&#8212;the people who, for differing reasons, find it difficult to be heard.</p><p>More effective involvement of young people in the development of policy has been a focus for the Scottish Government. \"Valuing Young People: Principles and connections to support young people achieve their potential\", which was published on 27 April, is a framework of principles that were agreed by the Government and partner organisations for working with young people in any <place-holder colnum=\"19844\"/> context. They include the delivery of services that reflect the reality of young people's lives, the recognition and promotion of young people's positive contribution to society, and the early involvement of young people in developing services and opportunities.</p><p>We need to tap into young people's creativity and how they think, and we need to be more open to ideas and approaches that might not be achieved through more traditional forms of consultation, as was rightly highlighted during the committee's inquiry. Several young people suggested new ways in which the committee could engage, such as through the social networking sites Digg, Reddit and StumbleUpon. Those sites were complete news to me, which shows members how much I have to learn about that particular way of going about social conversation. It is not easy: an active policy or strategy of digital engagement is needed in order for that to be effective. For example, we could use existing structures that work, such the Scottish Youth Parliament and the Young Scot portal to encourage users to carry the message through their Facebook and Bebo pages&#8212;I know about those. Any means that better engage the interest of young people and encourage an exchange of views and greater participation in the democratic process are worth using.</p><p>The same can be said in respect of increasing awareness among disabled people and facilitating their access to the petitions process. I welcome the committee's recognition of those issues and its intention to work with the Parliament's education and community partnerships team on that. The involvement of disabled people in the decision-making and policy process is a continuing concern of the Government. We will provide &#163;1.3 million between 2008 and 2011 for numerous projects that have the aim of increasing participation by, and inclusion of, disabled people in the work of the Government, and in all aspects of daily and public life. The funding has been provided through national disability-led organisations, such as Inclusion Scotland, the Scottish Disability Equality Forum, communication forum Scotland and the Scottish Council on Deafness. I mention those organisations because I believe that the committee could draw usefully on the expertise and knowledge of groups such as Young Scot, Inclusion Scotland and the Council of Ethnic Minority Voluntary Sector Organisations, to name just a few. They are organisations with which the Government currently works successfully and with which the committee could also engage.</p><p>I note from the committee's report that it proposes to invite several organisations to provide links from their websites to the committee's site so that the public can navigate from them to the committee's site. That is a useful idea and a good <place-holder colnum=\"19845\"/> start. I will be interested to hear how the committee develops that work in the year ahead.</p><p>It is vital to engage with more than the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"middle-class men of middle-class age\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Public Petitions Committee,</em> 21 April 2009; c 1680.]</p><p>as ex-Presiding Officer George Reid put it so elegantly&#8212;I guess he could have been describing me&#8212;during the round table discussion with the committee in April. With that in mind, the Government welcomes the fact&#8212;as was mentioned by John Farquhar Munro-that during the course of its inquiry the committee met in various locations throughout Scotland, including Duns, Glasgow and Fraserburgh. During those visits the committee engaged directly with school pupils, local residents and community groups. In building on the success of those meetings, it is good that the committee plans to undertake another series of meetings in various parts of Scotland.</p><p>I know that the committee met in Alness academy on Monday, because I heard a fair chunk about it on Radio Scotland when I was travelling in my constituency of Stirling. I thought that, given the way that young people described what was happening, the work that the committee was doing at the event was very valuable not just to the committee but to the standing of the Scottish Parliament. I thought that that was an excellent piece of broadcasting.</p><p>I also understand that as part of the preparation for the committee meeting, the Parliament's education outreach officers visited three secondary schools in Dingwall, Dornoch and Invergordon. That combination of outreach and the committee meeting seems to be a useful and practical way of not just explaining more about the work of the committee and the Parliament, but of allowing others to see it in action. No doubt that contributed to the success of the meeting. If that is repeated in the future, it could provide a real opportunity to open up the Parliament to many more people. I will be interested to see how the committee develops that work throughout the year.

Obviously, that new crossing will be a hugely important infrastructure project that will safeguard a vital connection in the country's transport network and provide economic security for the east of Scotland. The bill will not only seek authorisation for the construction and operation of the new bridge and linking roads; it will also seek the power of compulsory acquisition. Gil Paterson referred to that. The committee identified that that power will change the nature of the bill; it will become a hybrid bill rather than a public bill. Therefore, a new parliamentary process needs to be in place to ensure a fair outcome for the individuals and local organisations that are directly affected by the bill and wish to object. The hybrid bill process that the committee proposed in its report will provide that any objector will be able to put their case to a committee of the Parliament for proper consideration and a decision on their objection.</p><p>I turn to the recommendations. The committee was right to focus its inquiry on adapting the tried-and-tested procedures for public and private bills. The evidence that we submitted to the committee was based on that approach. We therefore support the committee's recommendations on changes to standing orders.</p><p>We note the committee's recognition in paragraph 8 of the report of the need to consider the publication of guidance on hybrid bills. Although we appreciate that the production of guidance takes time, we believe that it is imperative that the Parliament produces comprehensive guidance on the making and consideration of objections in advance of the introduction of the Forth crossing bill.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19979643", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission on Scottish Devolution (Report): \"Hybrid Bills\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Whether or not Tricia Marwick will be dragged on to that committee, her experience will be valuable, and she might find herself in that situation.

Clearly, there will be circumstances in which proposed improvements will impact on the statutory responsibilities of Government-supported and SPCB-supported bodies.</p><p>I echo Trish Godman's comment that we did not begin the discussions with a blank sheet of paper. We have the 2006 report by the Finance Committee, Professor Crerar's independent report, and the report of the fit-for-purpose complaints system action group, which was chaired by Douglas Sinclair, the chair of Consumer Focus Scotland. That group worked with stakeholders to produce practical recommendations on how the complaints system can be streamlined and made more accessible to the public. I am pleased that the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee firmly endorsed what Douglas Sinclair's group identified as the way forward: a strengthened role for the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman, with the SPSO leading the way in developing effective complaints-handling systems.</p><p>The committee recommends that, at stage 2 of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, the Government should include provisions for a new complaints-handling process. The fit-for-purpose complaints system action group's report was clear about the benefits for both consumers and service providers of simplifying the multiple complaints systems. Complaints processes that are easy to access, understand and use will help the less articulate and less confident to have the <place-holder colnum=\"18544\"/> confidence to complain, and simplification will also have benefits for service providers.</p><p>However, we also need a strong ethos throughout our public services that regards complaints as opportunities for learning and empowers complaints handlers to resolve as many complaints as possible at the first level, the first hurdle and the first goal, because the sooner complaints are resolved, the greater the saving to the public purse. Subject to the Parliament's agreement, the Government is therefore happy to propose such provisions at stage 2 of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill. The creation of an easier, shorter, quicker and wholly user-focused approach to complaints about public services in Scotland should be a priority for us all.</p><p>Last November, the Government said that it would put its proposals for the improvement of complaints handling to the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee for consideration. The proposals, which emerged from a broad consensus, include structural changes to the SPSO, Waterwatch Scotland and the Scottish Prisons Complaints Commission. I understand from the evidence that was given why the committee considered the transfer of complaints from Waterwatch to the SPSO a finely balanced issue.</p><p>It would have been useful to consider the benefits to users in the wider context, and the overarching benefits to the alignment of complaints-handling processes across all services. Those benefits could include simplification of the landscape for service users, a reduction in overall costs, and ensuring that lessons that are learned from complaints about one service lead to improvements in all services. In that wider context, we still believe that our proposal to transfer Waterwatch's complaints functions to the SPSO and its representative functions to Consumer Focus Scotland is a sensible rationalisation that accords with both Professor Crerar's view and Douglas Sinclair's work.</p><p>The Government also believes that the transfer of prison complaints to the SPSO might fit better in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill than in the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee's bill. However, we will be pleased to continue to discuss the best way forward as the two bills reach stage 2. Our rationale is simply that it is sensible&#8212;and easier for service users and the wider public&#8212;for all improvements to complaints handling to be dealt with in a single bill.</p><p>I remind the Parliament that the process began early in 2006. More than three years later, we owe it to the public to build on what has already been done and to deliver tangible benefits to the way in which they engage with public services. Now more than ever, in these difficult economic times, we <place-holder colnum=\"18545\"/> need to think about the needs of our country of five million people and ask how we can have fewer organisations, reduce duplication and have less bureaucracy in order to deliver better services for the people of Scotland.</p><p>I am happy to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "17369302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee Bill Proposal"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the convener and members of the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee for all their hard work and careful consideration of the often complex issues that they had to deal with.

We are considering some case studies and examples of effective practice and imaginative initiatives.

The average turnout across Europe was 43 per cent, whereas turnout in the United Kingdom was only 34 per cent. In Scotland, the average turnout was 28.6 per cent, with East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire achieving turnouts of 36 per cent and North Lanarkshire and Glasgow managing turnouts of only 22 per cent and 23 per cent. Overall turnout for the European elections was disappointing. Excluding countries that use mandatory voting, 14 member states experienced falls in turnout and 10 member states managed to increase turnout. However, those 10 included some notable exceptions: Estonia achieved an increase in turnout of more than 17 percentage points compared with 2004 and Denmark's turnout increased to 60 per cent, which is an increase of almost 12 percentage points.

I also thank other members of the Parliament, and people in the electoral community throughout Scotland, for their support for the bill.</p><p>The principles set out in Ron Gould's comprehensive report into the 2007 elections met with widespread support. Our response and our subsequent consultation on the Gould report received similar support, and I am pleased to say that support has continued through the parliamentary stages of the bill.</p><p>This is a straightforward but important piece of legislation. During the stage 1 debate last month, Gavin Brown went so far as to describe the bill as \"vital\". I agree with him. The bill separates future local government elections from elections to this Parliament, and it makes more detailed voter information available. Passing this bill will be a significant and necessary step towards improving the administration and management of elections in Scotland.</p><p>The bill will remove uncertainty in the polling booth and reduce the potential for confusion among voters in future local government elections. Voters will not be faced with two separate elections using two separate voting systems. Decoupling will also give local government elections the prominence that they deserve: local issues will not be overshadowed by national or United Kingdom-wide issues.</p><p>Our aim in future local government elections should not just be to ensure that more people turn out to vote; we need to foster and create a genuine local debate on the issues that matter to local voters. Turnout is important, but we must be ambitious enough to aim higher. We should not just look to increase turnout for its own sake. Ron Gould said that we should look to engage voters with the campaign in a meaningful way and to encourage them to make knowledgeable decisions on the casting of their votes.</p><p>Later this year, we will issue a consultation paper covering the remaining administrative recommendations from the Gould report. The paper, and the responses to it, will feed into the <place-holder colnum=\"18457\"/> election rules for the 2012 elections. We will work closely with the electoral management board for Scotland on that, and we will continue to work with the Electoral Commission, particularly in the important area of ballot paper design. In its response to the Gould report, the commission agreed to develop design standards for ballot papers. That work will help to ensure that, in future elections, ballot papers are as easily understood as possible.</p><p>The Electoral Commission's work will be published later this year. Scottish Government officials have already discussed emerging findings with it, and the political parties panel and the electoral management board discussed that work with commission staff just yesterday. That level of co-operation and involvement is a model of the way in which we should develop electoral proposals in the future.</p><p>Concern has been expressed throughout the passage of the bill about the effect on turnout of decoupling. In the context of the bill, we are concerned about the likely turnout in the 2012 local government elections, but the problem of low turnout is already with us.</p><p>We all agree that turnout is important and that something needs to be done. With the bill at stage 3, we now have to start thinking about what we can do to improve the situation. I have said before, and I am happy to repeat today, that I look forward to working with the Local Government and Communities Committee and others in Parliament to consider and develop ways of increasing voter turnout.</p><p>There is evidence that a combination of initiatives could be used to encourage voters. Information campaigns could be used to explain how to register to vote, and how, when and where to vote. Advertising campaigns could get across the importance of voting, and community or grass-roots activity could encourage groups and individuals to use their vote. This is not just a job for Government and officials; it is a job for everyone in society.</p><p>We could use the education system and process to encourage an interest in politics. Schools already have educational visits to Parliaments and hold mock elections, but we need to think about what more can be done. We could hold events around places of entertainment to draw people in and then give them information about the voting process.</p><p>We need to encourage individuals to vote, whether through inducements or simply through making the process easier. There are a number of things that might make it easier for people to vote: we could consider electronic voting, the use of the internet or, in the longer term, voting by text. Of <place-holder colnum=\"18458\"/> course, security of the ballot will have to be ensured in the safe use of new technologies.</p><p>We could consider using texts to issue voting information and reminders to vote. We could consider allowing voting in shops or other public buildings, and mobile polling stations could be introduced. Voting could take place over a number of days or even at the weekend, and we could encourage greater use of postal ballots. Convenience must enhance the voting process. It is important to think about different methods although, as I said, whatever we do must be weighed against the security of the ballot.</p><p>The legislation will make things clearer for voters and give local government elections the prominence that they deserve. The challenge for us all will be to ensure that the debate at local government elections focuses on local issues. Turnout is a challenge and a problem, but there is a lot that we can do to put it right.</p><p>The bill is the next stage in preparing for the 2012 elections, but there is still a great deal of work to do between now and then. We will do that work in co-operation with the Local Government and Communities Committee, the electoral management board for Scotland and all of the professional bodies that are involved in the elections arena.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16669360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by thanking the Local Government and Communities Committee for its consideration of and support for this bill.

It is no wonder, as they have made significant mistakes, such as the decisions at UK level on fiscal deficits and on a regulatory system that dropped the ball and was unable to respond appropriately to the challenges in the banking and wider financial system. The UK public finances have a forecast debt in excess of &#163;1 trillion in 2012-13. That is a truly mind-boggling figure&#8212;it is the equivalent of &#163;17,000 for every person in the UK.

It is increasingly clear that the consequences of the UK Government's high levels of borrowing will be felt throughout the public sector for years to come. Rather than follow the lead of others, the UK Government is set on swingeing cuts in Scottish spending. Those cuts come at the wrong time for our economy and they stand in stark contrast to the approach of President Obama in the United States, where stimulus will continue next year and will be focused on delivery at state level. In contrast, the UK Government will take money out of the economy next year and will reduce the money that we have to fight the recession and to support Scottish jobs. We must stop that, and the people can do so in a general election. The only way to protect Scotland from the cuts, and the best way to save the 9,000 jobs that are under threat from the UK Labour Government, is SNP success. The more SNP MPs there are, the better.

I say to Mr McNeil that I share the Local Government and Communities Committee's concern that not all of those who are eligible to vote are on the voting register, and so the real turnout figures are likely to be worse than recorded at present.</p><p>It is important to know the true position before we move on to improve overall turnout. I agree with the Local Government and Communities Committee that increasing the number of people who are registered to vote is important. Registration is reserved to the Westminster Government, but we will work with it to find ways to improve levels of voter registration. That will cost money, and we will need to consider the funding of registration work with local authorities <place-holder colnum=\"17473\"/> and Westminster. Funding for electoral registration makes up part of the Scottish Government's budget allocation from Westminster; the element to cover registration is passed on to local authorities as part of their settlement, but it is not ring fenced.

Alison McInnes said that we should not use gimmicky ideas. I say to her that that does not stop us from using our imaginations to improve turnout. Perhaps members on the Liberal front bench would like to think about that. For example, we could suggest to employers that they put reminders to vote in employees' pay slips or put messages on screen savers that say, \"Today is voting day.\" With imagination, lots of different methods could be used. Although they might be a wee bit gimmicky, they could make a difference to turnout.

The bill is based largely on proposals that were contained in two Government consultations; therefore, I also thank those who responded to the consultations.</p><p>It is now two years since the 2007 combined elections. If time has eased the memories of the events of 3 May 2007, as far as the administration of elections is concerned, it takes only a brief look at Ron Gould's comprehensive 120-page report to bring it all back. The Gould report identified complicated systems and structures, as well as complex legislation and a fragmentation of roles and responsibilities, as a critical barrier to the smooth administration of elections. The Local Government and Communities Committee has considered the Government's response to the Gould report to date. The bill takes our response a stage further, and implements a key recommendation of the report.</p><p>The bill will decouple local government elections in Scotland from elections to the Scottish Parliament by moving local government elections to the mid-point of the Scottish parliamentary session. We will achieve that by extending the current local government term of office&#8212;and subsequent terms&#8212;to five years, which will mean that the next two local government elections in Scotland will now take place in 2012 and 2017. After that, local government terms of office will revert to four years.</p><p>The bill will make post-election voter information available in greater detail. It will require returning officers to release information at polling station level, rather than at ward level as happens at present. Decoupling will simplify the election process and reduce the scope for confusion among voters. We owe it to the electorate to do that much; we owe it to our colleagues in local government to ensure that local elections are given the prominence that they deserve and are not diminished by being held on the same day as elections to the Parliament.<place-holder colnum=\"17440\"/></p><p>Local government is perhaps the level of government that has the most impact on the quality of life for ordinary people in Scotland. The services that councils provide are vital to people in their everyday lives, and those who are responsible for the delivery of those services must be properly accountable. That is why the Government believes that local elections should be held in a position of prominence, separately from other elections.</p><p>Local elections should focus on local issues such as schools and services rather than being overshadowed by national politics. Separating elections in that way will strengthen local government's mandate. Unison, in its written evidence to the Local Government and Communities Committee, stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Stand alone local elections will allow the focus of the election campaign to centre on local issues, so creating a real debate on local priorities that really matter to people\".</p><p>We are aware of concerns that decoupling could lead to a lower turnout in local elections, and that the focus and motivation of those who vote could still be on national or United Kingdom-wide issues. Concern about voter turnout is not new: in the 1974 regional elections in Scotland, 35 years ago, there was a turnout of 50 per cent. The next 11 sets of local government elections failed to reach that figure.</p><p>In 1999, the local government elections were combined with elections to the Scottish Parliament, and the turnout rose to 58 per cent. That figure fell back to 50 per cent in 2003, and rose to 52 per cent in 2007. I have used that figure of 50 per cent as a comparison, but I am certainly not suggesting that it should be a target. The maths is simple: even if we hit 50 per cent, it means that half of those who are entitled to vote have not voted. There is, however, no simple answer to that&#8212;improving turnout is a fundamental issue that must be viewed beyond the context of decoupled elections.</p><p>It falls on all of us&#8212;politicians, political parties, local authorities and civic society&#8212;to focus on the reasons for low turnout and to give people a reason to turn out in local elections. We need to encourage a greater level of public participation across the board; to raise the profile of local government issues and candidates; and to increase voter interest and the general understanding of the democratic process. We must consider the way in which we use voter education material and campaigns to explain the aims of elections and to motivate individuals to register to vote and use their vote.</p><p>The issue is also about access and inclusion. We need to ensure that as many people as possible have access to the democratic process and that they feel motivated to take part and be <place-holder colnum=\"17441\"/> included in that process. We must identify the groups in our society that are harder to reach, and find new ways to engage with them. In a strong democracy, groups that are less motivated to vote, and so are less likely to vote, deserve to be included in the democratic process as much as the rest of us. I look forward to working with the committee on examining ways in which the turnout for local government elections can be increased.</p><p>I have mentioned the importance of information campaigns, and I share the committee's view that improving voter information and raising awareness about elections is vital. In 2007, the vote Scotland campaign was run jointly by the then Scottish Executive and the Electoral Commission. It cost &#163;1.25 million, and was funded by the Executive. The information campaign ahead of the 2012 local government elections will be important&#8212;we will work with the Electoral Commission and local authorities to develop an effective campaign.</p><p>As part of that, we will need to consider the balance between national and local information campaigns; the committee considered that issue when it took evidence on the bill. Witnesses, including the Electoral Commission and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers, argued strongly and convincingly that it was important that local authorities and returning officers should promote local information campaigns. If we are promoting local democracy and local government, local authorities should share the responsibility for driving that forward.</p><p>The committee heard that there is a local dimension to voter information that justifies allowing a returning officer the discretion to use a set of messages that reflect the community in which the officer lives and works. Funding for local authority campaigns will form an important part of those discussions at the right time.</p><p>The committee heard evidence about the role of the Electoral Commission, which I discussed with members when I appeared before them. The Scottish Government has a constructive relationship with the commission, and, as I told the committee, I would be happy to consider formally extending the commission's role to cover local government elections in Scotland. However, before I sought to bring any necessary proposals to the Parliament, I would want to be convinced that doing so would improve the current situation.</p><p>The former Scottish Executive worked closely with the commission on the preparations for the 2003 and 2007 combined elections, in areas such as joint information campaigns and the preparation of training material for returning officers and their staff. I am willing to examine the issue further, but I do not believe that we should legislate for the <place-holder colnum=\"17442\"/> sake of it if the same effect can be achieved through informal and co-operative means.</p><p>With regard to the bill's provisions on increasing the availability of voter information, I am pleased that the committee welcomed the Government's proposals to publish voter information at polling station level. The introduction of the single transferable vote system and the use of e-counting have increased the amount of voting information that is available. The bill provides for the publication in the future of information on the number of preference votes that are cast and transferred at each stage between candidates at polling station level rather than at ward level.</p><p>I hope that it goes without saying, but I assure Parliament that we will do all that we can to ensure that the secrecy of the ballot is maintained. Our proposals are designed to increase the transparency of the electoral process; they are not intended to, and nor will they, affect the right of the individual to a secret vote.</p><p>Regulations will provide, in a situation in which there is even a slight possibility that a particular polling station is so small that there is a risk that an individual voter could be identified, for the voter information to be amalgamated with that from a neighbouring polling station until the number of votes reaches a minimum threshold. The threshold that we have in mind is 200, which is the level that is used for Scottish parliamentary elections.</p><p>The bill is a further important step towards improving the administration of elections in Scotland, and it will implement a key recommendation of the Gould report. It is part of a programme that involves working with others towards the common aim of giving voters the electoral system that they deserve. The bill removes a source of potential confusion for voters and should make the voting process easier for the voter, which must be our aim. Separating local government elections from elections to the Parliament will give those local elections the prominence that they deserve.</p><p>It is right that, as we debate the bill at stage 1, we put the voter at the centre of our thoughts as far as the whole process is concerned. All of us have regrets about the 2007 elections, and I am glad that the Parliament now has the chance to begin to put right some of the problems that existed at that time.</p><p>It is with pleasure that I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14980479", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Local Government and Communities Committee for its work in considering the bill and preparing the stage 1 report, and I thank those who gave evidence to the committee.

I will paint a picture to show just how antiquated and fragmented it is. Three arms of central Government are involved in elections in Scotland&#8212;the UK Ministry of Justice, the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government&#8212;as well as 32 local authorities, 32 <place-holder colnum=\"11674\"/> returning officers, eight regional returning officers and 15 registration officers. There are 18 pieces of primary and secondary legislation on the subject, and the steering group that deals with such matters is made up of nine other groups and needs six sub-groups to support it.</p><p>That is not a landscape in which we can run successful elections. It is a matter of common sense to have one authority that has responsibility for consolidating the legislation and decluttering the background. Anyone, regardless of their political views, would agree with that&#8212;it is certainly the view that was widely shared in January 2008. However, as things stand, that is not going to happen.</p><p>Some people talked about the Scottish Affairs Committee and its influence on the outcome of the UK Government's decision. I do not want to be disrespectful to that committee, but it took no evidence from any Government minister from Scotland, any Scottish Government officials or any MSP before it made its recommendation to the UK Government. If we were looking for a reliable and robust process of intellectual argument, there was a serious flaw, which is evident in the outcomes.</p><p>I am disappointed that Jim Murphy, the Secretary of State for Scotland has not agreed that the Scottish Parliament should have powers over the administration of elections in Scotland, even though, in January 2008, every party in this chamber agreed that it should. Bob Doris expressed his disappointment at the lack of movement on the part of the Scotland Office in that regard. Anyone who is a democrat, wants the situation to be sorted out and is committed to Scotland clearing up the mess that was visible to everyone in 2007 could do nothing other than sign up to the idea that this Parliament should have that responsibility. There can be no other intellectual end to that argument.</p><p>I will continue to press that matter, but I recognise that we are where we are and that we must get on with decluttering the landscape around elections, especially from the local government perspective.</p><p>We have already said that we agree in principle with the post of chief returning officer being brought into being. David McLetchie raised a fair point, however, when he suggested that having a chief returning officer for only local government elections in Scotland does not make sense. Surely, given the landscape that I described, it would make sense to give that chief returning officer responsibility for other elections in Scotland. Despite the fact that Jim Murphy turned down Bob Doris's suggestion, there is a glimmer of hope in that correspondence, as Mr Murphy offered the opportunity of discussing the matter further. I am keen to discuss further with him the <place-holder colnum=\"11675\"/> issue of whether the chief returning officer should also have responsibility for the other elections that are held in Scotland.</p><p>Alison McInnes talked about the Electoral Commission's suggestion that an elections management board, led by an elected returning officer, should be established&#8212;that will be fed into the consultation exercise. My initial reaction is that the proposal is complex and cumbersome and is a management response that deals with the symptoms identified by the Gould report rather than with the fragmented nature of the electoral landscape. It does not offer a clear, democratic solution for how Scotland should move forward. Under the Electoral Commission's proposal there would not be a great role for the Parliament, and it is important that the Scottish Parliament ensures that it is the place where people see that accountability lies. However, I will engage positively with the Electoral Commission to see whether any common ground can be found.</p><p>A number of members referred to turnout and decoupling. Michael McMahon started off in fine spirit in that regard and showed a maverick tendency that is unusual in a business manager. I was really quite impressed by his candour and wondered whether we were seeing the emergence of a new Michael McMahon. Unfortunately, he quickly reverted to type. It was a glimmer, however&#8212;although perhaps not a gilded glimmer, to borrow Des McNulty's word&#8212;and I hope to see more of that.</p><p>I heard no real argument from the Liberal Democrats about why the elections should not be decoupled. I know that the Conservatives support the proposal and I acknowledge Tricia Marwick's role in leading the SNP's efforts to decouple the elections. I wonder whether the reason why the Liberal Democrats are determined that decoupling should not take place is that they cannot put the people on the ground to enable them to be as effective as they need to be in elections. It is time to get away from such narrow political thinking and start to put in place an electoral system that delivers for the people.</p><p>David McLetchie mentioned that the Arbuthnott commission in 2006 and the McIntosh and Kerley commissions in 1999 all considered the issue and recommended that the elections should be decoupled. From that perspective, it is time that the Liberal Democrats woke up and smelled the coffee.</p><p>I say to Patrick Harvie that, if we are going to have a public holiday to count STV ballots by hand, we had better prepare for a holiday lasting four or five days, as that is how long it will take.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During the debate, a number of members have referred to the fragmented and antiquated nature of the legislation that we in Scotland are dealing with.

I said that I was grateful for the committee's detailed consideration of the important issues that arose from the 2007 elections and I am happy to repeat that message today.</p><p>Having considered the report further, I welcome it as an important contribution to the debate. I also thank Duncan McNeil for his positive contribution this morning across a wide range of issues. My speech will have to be a bit more focused, but I may get a chance when I sum up to come to other issues. I welcome the emphasis that Duncan McNeil placed on equalities and I support such an approach.<place-holder colnum=\"11634\"/></p><p>I was pleased to note that so many of the committee's recommendations echoed the commitments made in the Scottish Government's response to the Gould report, which was published back in March. Therefore, it is not surprising that I am happy to accept the majority of recommendations and comments. Ron Gould identified many problems with our electoral system; it is now up to us as a Government and all of us as members of the Parliament to ensure that we address them.</p><p>We should never forget that the electoral system is the bedrock of our democracy, so we must get it right. The Gould report identified that complicated systems and structures have been created over many years to manage our elections. It identified the complexity of the legislation and the fragmentation of roles and responsibilities as a crucial barrier to smooth-running elections. We have a lot to do. Nevertheless, if we can draw a line under the events of May 2007 and learn from them, there can still be a silver lining. We have the opportunity to address those systemic failures and to take the necessary steps to re-establish public confidence in our democratic process.</p><p>As Duncan McNeil said, Ron Gould stated that the voters in Scotland were \"treated as an afterthought\" and we must ensure that we never allow that criticism to be levelled at us again. We published our response to the Gould report in March 2008 and the committee's helpful report followed on from that.</p><p>In responding to the report, I make no apology for starting with the issue of jurisdiction. Where should the responsibility for elections in Scotland lie? The committee supported the central recommendation of the Gould report and the resolution of the Parliament that executive and legislative powers for administration of its own elections should be transferred to the Scottish Government and to this Parliament.</p><p>Ron Gould reached that conclusion in October 2007 and the Scottish Parliament reached the same conclusion in January 2008. The Local Government and Communities Committee made it a hat trick in June 2008. So far, unfortunately, the United Kingdom Government has failed to see the logic of the recommendation. On 24 June, it outlined its formal response to the Gould report. Although its response was disappointing, we will continue to press it to change its position. Judging by a letter that Bob Doris received from the new Secretary of State for Scotland, such a change is perhaps unlikely, but it would be in the interests of every voter in Scotland if it were to happen. However, we cannot wait for Westminster and put the work that we have to do on hold. For the moment, we must accept that we are where we are and we must move forward to undertake the <place-holder colnum=\"11635\"/> reforms that are deliverable within our current competence. We must focus on what we can do to restore public trust and confidence in the electoral system in Scotland.</p><p>On 3 September, the First Minister announced our legislative programme to Parliament. Among the bills to be introduced is the Scottish Parliament and local government elections bill, which will be introduced in January 2009 and will decouple the Scottish parliamentary and local government elections. When we consulted on the proposals earlier in the year, the responses showed that there was overwhelming support for our plans to separate the elections. There was even stronger support for the proposal that local government elections should be moved to the mid-point of the Scottish Parliament session.</p><p>The bill will give effect to that, and to the recommendations made by the Local Government and Communities Committee, by extending the current and subsequent local government term to five years. Subject to parliamentary approval, the next two local government elections will take place in 2012 and 2017. After that, local government terms of office will revert to four years.</p><p>The bill will also introduce provisions to allow returning officers to release information at polling station level, which will help to increase confidence in the overall result and will provide political parties with valuable information that they can use to analyse how their total vote is compiled. That change will also have benefits in respect of building confidence in the voting system, but we must ensure that the underlying principle remains the secrecy of the ballot.</p><p>The committee supported decoupling, the provision of post-election information and other large parts of the response to Gould. I will take the opportunity to comment on a number of recommendations in the committee's report.</p><p>On ballot papers, the committee expressed concern about the security and integrity of the ballot. I will be happy to consider anything that the committee has to say on the matter. We hope to address the problem next year when we consult on what can be summarised as the administrative Gould recommendations.</p><p>The committee also raised concerns about ballot paper design, which echoed Ron Gould's comments. We are already involved in work with the Electoral Commission and others to consider possible changes. The aim must be to develop a ballot paper that is easy to use and fair: an effective ballot paper that allows voters to vote the way that they want to and gives them confidence that their vote will count. A number of issues must be considered in that work and I know that many <place-holder colnum=\"11636\"/> in Parliament and elsewhere have ideas that they want to put forward.</p><p>As Duncan McNeil said, changes to ballot paper design must be backed up by public information and education campaigns. The designs must be tested extensively before they are introduced, and the test must be whether any changes put the voter first.</p><p>I am pleased to say that personal identifiers are an example of co-operation with the committee. My officials have shared with the committee a draft of the regulations that will shortly come before it through the formal procedures.</p><p>The regulations will specify how personal identifiers for absent voters should be collected and used for Scottish local government elections. They will also set a requirement for returning officers to check a certain percentage of the postal votes that are returned against the personal identifiers that have been submitted ahead of the election. The Electoral Commission recommends that 100 per cent personal identifier verification should be mandatory, and I am attracted by the idea of 100 per cent checks; however, I am also conscious of the need to consider the cost-effectiveness of such an approach. For instance, for other elections in the United Kingdom, the law requires that returning officers check at least 20 per cent of returned voting statements. That minimum requirement is set out in law, but I am told that, in reality, returning officers aim to check 100 per cent of postal votes. In this year's elections to the Greater London Assembly, for instance, virtually all the returning officers checked 100 per cent of the returned postal voting statements.</p><p>I turn to the introduction of the chief returning officer for Scotland. The Scottish Government agrees with the committee that it is vital that there are clear lines of accountability and responsibility for running elections and that a CRO would help to address the issue. A consultation paper, which we will issue before the end of the year, will consider possible models for a CRO for Scotland. As suggested by the committee, our work in drafting that paper will be informed by experiences elsewhere, including Northern Ireland.</p><p>We all know that the electoral landscape in Scotland has been fragmented, cluttered and confused, and we must not let that become a clich&#233;; it is a fact that we must do something about. We need a coherent and unified organisation of elections, based in Scotland, that is clearly accountable to Scottish ministers and to the Parliament. We need to develop a system that is right for Scotland. Yes, we can look at models elsewhere, but we must remember that they were designed for different countries with different traditions. We must be careful not to create new <place-holder colnum=\"11637\"/> posts or organisations if we cannot justify them. As everyone knows, the Government is working to simplify and consolidate the range and scope of public bodies in Scotland. We must keep that in mind in considering a possible CRO. There may be other ways&#8212;which I would like to hear about&#8212;of providing the co-ordination and coherence that we need.</p><p>I understand that the elections in London used electronic counting, and Ron Gould concluded that electronic counting is preferable to a manual count for an STV election&#8212;as one might expect. Given the complex counting procedures that are required under STV, it is right that we should encourage the use of electronic counting. Nevertheless, before we can commit to its widespread use in future elections, we must do all that we can to restore the credibility of the system and confidence in it. That means carrying out rigorous tests in comparable circumstances to those of elections, to protect against the failures that were experienced last year.</p><p>There is a lot to do, and we have a work plan to ensure that new arrangements will be in place well before the next elections. I very much look forward to working with the committee&#8212;indeed, with people throughout the Parliament&#8212;over the coming months to re-establish the confidence of the electorate in Scotland's electoral system.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wrote to the convener of the committee on 1 August to respond formally to the committee's report.

If those changes can raise the productivity of Scotland's private sector by just 1 per cent, the increased benefit to Scotland's economy will be around &#163;800 million.</p><p>In reforming Scotland's public bodies, our overall approach is first, to streamline decision making and increase transparency by extending our outcome-based approach to public bodies; secondly, to bring together organisations with similar skills, expertise and processes, and to deliver a 26 per cent reduction in the number of national public sector organisations by 2011; third, to stop activity that no longer contributes to the public purpose; and fourth, to apply much tougher tests to the creation of new bodies.</p><p>I will update the chamber on our progress since the First Minister's statement on 30 January, which set out the changes that we will progress to reshape and simplify the public service landscape.

The package will also make a significant contribution to the efficient government efficiency gains of around &#163;25 million that are required from the bodies that the changes affect directly.

It is clear that the events of the election night in May should not have happened and must never happen again. [ <em>Laughter.</em> ] Members are all clear that I mean the process.</p><p>The reason for this debate should be a matter of regret for us all. On the other hand, the Gould report gives us an opportunity to improve our systems for elections to the Parliament and to local authorities. It is an opportunity that we in this Parliament and our colleagues in Westminster should seize. It is therefore a matter for optimism that we are gathered here to debate the improvements that Gould identifies for the representation of the people of Scotland.</p><p>The problems that Gould identifies are not all of the Parliament's making, but they are nevertheless problems for us in this chamber. They concern public confidence in the elections to the Parliament, and we should be allowed to take ownership of, and responsibility for, putting matters right. Gould identifies a failure to put the voter first in the preparations for the 2007 elections. Our response to the report must not make the same mistake. It is therefore crucial that we take the opportunity provided by Gould to restore the trust of the voters in our electoral systems. It is incumbent on all of us who operate in the political system to regain the respect of the voters for the competence and integrity of that system. The Parliament represents the people of Scotland. They must have confidence that it does so properly. We must respond to the report in a sensible and pragmatic way.</p><p>Gould identifies a wide range of practical and organisational problems, which we believe need to be approached using common sense and logic, to <place-holder colnum=\"4958\"/> reduce the complexity and fragmentation that the report describes. We do not believe that current institutional barriers should be allowed to stand in the way of effective solutions.</p><p>The Scottish Government has given a clear response to the opportunity presented by the Gould report. The First Minister has accepted its recommendations. For example, we have accepted that local and Scottish parliamentary elections should be decoupled. As Ron Gould makes clear, the primary advantage of that change would be to give due prominence to local elections in their own right and ensure that the electoral processes&#8212;and the issues&#8212;are clear to the electorate. The creation of a chief returning officer is also recommended. The exact role and responsibilities of the new chief returning officer and their relationship with Scottish ministers, local returning officers and the Electoral Commission require further work.</p><p>We know that the Parliament's Local Government and Communities Committee has already taken evidence from Ron Gould and the Electoral Commission on the implications of the report for local government elections. I am sure that that work will make a valuable contribution to the Parliament's consideration of those issues, and I look forward to the committee's conclusions.</p><p>The recommendations on the decoupling of elections and the creation of a chief returning officer are, of course, of great importance in taking forward the Gould report to improve our electoral system. However, I believe that the main feature of the report, which colours the whole report, is the description in chapters 2 and 3 of the truly shocking fragmentation of law and responsibility.</p><p>To quote Ron Gould's conclusions:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our review of the present legislation, as it affects both the Scottish parliamentary and the local government elections, has led us to conclude that it is so fragmented and antiquated that it fundamentally interferes with the ability of electoral stakeholders to make timely decisions and to carry out all activities related to planning, organising and implementing an election effectively.\"</p><p>He arrives at those damning conclusions because, under the structure that we live with at present, five different arms of Government are involved in the election arrangements in this country.</p><p>Gould identifies a dozen pieces of primary and secondary legislation, dating back to 1973, that govern election night in Scotland. Some of those were made at Westminster and some here at Holyrood; some can be updated and changed by us, but many cannot.</p><p>It is perhaps not surprising that a steering group with representatives of nine different groups was required to organise the elections, or that that <place-holder colnum=\"4959\"/> steering group required no fewer than six sub-groups.</p><p>Ron Gould describes this landscape&#8212;with commendable restraint&#8212;as \"complex and fragmented\". He also talks about the patchwork approach that had been taken, and states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As long as the responsibilities for the decisions which have an impact on the Scottish parliamentary and local government elections are divided between the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government, it cannot be guaranteed that these electoral processes will be conducted effectively, due to the fragmentation of the legislation and decision-making in this context. As a result, we would recommend that exploratory discussions take place with a view toward assigning responsibility for both elections to one jurisdictional entity. In our view, the Scottish Government would be the logical institution.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395562", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gould Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I open the debate with mixed reactions.

I have absolutely no chance of winning anything with a postcard if I have to go on for that long.</p><p>I am sure that everyone agrees that the debate has been worth while. There have been some considered and detailed speeches from around the chamber, and I thank all members who have contributed. As the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Development said, the Scottish Government has welcomed the aspirations in the Crerar report. They are in line with our call for simplifying and rationalising the public service landscape and increasing local and public involvement in public service delivery.</p><p>As everyone has recognised, the report is important. Its recommendations are wide ranging. Evidence and views have been taken from service providers, scrutiny bodies, service users and public representatives as well as experts and academics. It is agreed across the chamber that that presents a real opportunity for the Parliament and Government to work closely together on developing a framework for better and more proportionate external scrutiny.</p><p>Professor Crerar believes that his recommendations would lead to a reduction in the number of scrutiny organisations and a radical increase in the sharing of information and co-ordination between bodies. I do not think that any members disagree with those recommendations and the overall perspective that he has set down. He has also set out a framework for external assessment that he believes should focus on the needs of the people who use the services that are under scrutiny and should drive improvement while ensuring the efficient and effective use of public money.</p><p>From the debate, I sense that there is a general consensus that members want a future scrutiny process to be based much more on self-assessment and best value. As Robert Brown said, let us get it right first time, rather than try to deal with complaints later. A number of speakers picked up on that general theme.</p><p>Professor Crerar also set out a longer-term aspiration&#8212;I underline the word aspiration&#8212;to move towards one national scrutiny body, one audit body and one complaints handling body for the whole public sector and that those three bodies could eventually handle the scrutiny and complaints functions of a number of stand-alone bodies that currently operate in Scotland. I listened to the concern that was expressed about that. Individual members from different political parties have rightly asked us to hold on a minute. I will <place-holder colnum=\"2372\"/> reflect on what Andy Kerr said in that regard, which was, in effect, that we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. In trying to get more simplified systems, we might lose what is good and effective and is working. There was consensus on that point throughout the chamber.</p><p>Andy Kerr also said that the issue is complex, which Professor Crerar acknowledged in the foreword to his report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I thought the problems were obvious - there are too many scrutiny bodies; they cost too much; they create needless burden and divert resources away from delivering services. Surely it was just a case of removing some of the organisations? Having spent a year examining the problems, I've reached the conclusion that the answer is not that simple.\"</p><p>Tom McCabe showed his depth of understanding of the matters under discussion and let us know his feelings about complaint handling, which is often an uneven contest. Members' reaction to his speech shows that there is a lot of support for his view on that. I put on record our thanks to Tom McCabe for kicking off the review, which is proving to be very useful.</p><p>John Swinney said in his opening speech that we need to be careful as we move to the aspirational goal set out by Professor Crerar of having one complaint-handling body.

The current framework has impacted on our capacity as a country to develop a more dynamic and sustainable economy.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's strengthening of the bill at stage 2, when it lodged amendments that will require ministers to prepare and publish what the bill refers to as a \"participation statement\". Although we welcome the move to describe the consultation process before Parliament scrutinises the national planning framework, we believe that a vital piece of the framework is missing. The process can pragmatically be made more robust, to create an increased sense of ownership of the final outcomes, provide Parliament with better information and strengthen Parliament's scrutiny role. The vital piece of the framework that is missing is the examination in public of ministers' conclusions on the national planning framework before it is submitted to Parliament for scrutiny.<place-holder time=\"14:45:00\"/></p><p>It is true that individuals and organisations will have the opportunity to give ministers their views on the initial proposals in the national planning framework, which is to be welcomed. However, what we will not have is the opportunity to contribute to or debate in public the minister's proposals prior to parliamentary scrutiny. That is exactly what an opportunity for an examination in public would provide. We believe that it is vital that individuals and organisations alike should be provided with the opportunity not only to be consulted at the initial stages, but allowed to participate much more meaningfully through the <place-holder colnum=\"29191\"/> process of an examination in public. As a result of such an examination, Parliament would be much better informed about the responses of Scotland's citizens and organisations to Executive conclusions.</p><p>The national planning framework will include a commitment in principle to strategic infrastructure projects in relation to transport, water, energy and waste, as well as projects involving major urban regeneration and large strategic business or industrial investments. Given the scale of the power that ministers intend to take to approve such strategic projects in principle, it is hugely important that people feel that they have been given the chance to make their voice heard on ministers' conclusions after consultation and before Parliament has its say.</p><p>The process of examination in public is not a new concept in spatial planning in the United Kingdom. As I pointed out at stage 2, other spatial strategies throughout the UK are tested by an examination in public. Such examinations are short, non-adversarial, focused sessions that last only a few weeks and, at the end, a report is produced that sets out the recommendations and modifications. That happens in Northern Ireland, in the London spatial strategy and in every single spatial strategy in England, unless exceptional circumstances indicate that it should not happen.</p><p>In a briefing, Scottish Environment LINK said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Equivalent documents across the UK are subject to a process called 'Examination in Public' which allows the assumptions and proposals to be tested and the objections of those affected by the proposals to be heard.

The committee produced a good report, which got to the nub of the issues.</p><p>We have had an interesting debate and have heard some interesting views. In his opening remarks, Allan Wilson was able to reflect on how much funds had reduced since the previous programme, from an allocation of around &#163;1 billion in the period 2000 to 2006, to a programme for 2007 to 2013 that has fallen by about 60 per cent to around &#163;400 million. Unfortunately, it is difficult for us to determine whether Scotland actually gets its fair share of those EU funds, because negotiations take place at UK level. I do not think that that is right, but I know that we should expect our fair share.</p><p>As John Swinney, Jim Wallace, Dennis Canavan and other members have said, the chamber is unanimous in being prepared to support the accession of new states, particularly from eastern Europe, and if we all support that, we must accept that the economies of those countries require greater support. That said, and although structural funding is welcome, it is a pity that, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Scotland should still require any structural funding at all because our economy is not developed as well as it could be. It is unfortunate, but a reality, that the cuts in structural funds will be felt in certain sectors of the Scottish economy because we rely on those funds and the <place-holder colnum=\"28713\"/> underperformance of the Scottish economy over a number of decades means that those funds are still required. The sums required might not be a great deal&#8212;in the order of 3 per cent, as Derek Brownlee said&#8212;but they are nevertheless important for certain sectors.</p><p>By the time we get to the end of the next programme, in 2013, I hope that we will have faced up to the challenges and opportunities that globalisation provides. By then, we should aim to have less need of structural funds, so that we can free up funding to help other areas of the European Union. By 2013, we should have an economy whose export base is considerably expanded, where investments in research, development and innovation are providing significant dividends, and where high-value-added employment is the norm and our people are highly skilled and continue to upskill to get ahead of the game in the modern labour market.</p><p>I was particularly taken by paragraph 64 of the committee's report, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee recommends that the Scottish Executive should closely examine other EU funding options and opportunities available to Scotland, such as the Seventh Framework Programme 2007-13, Globalisation Adjustment Fund and European Solidarity Fund\".</p><p>I have looked at the Scottish Executive's response to that recommendation, and I wish that I had the feeling that there was a bit more dynamism and energy in how it is written, because those funds could be crucial to Scotland in the future. Perhaps in his closing speech the minister will give us the feeling that the Executive takes the issues seriously.</p><p>Other members have mentioned the voluntary sector and the funding gap. The minister conceded that it was not simply a question of a funding gap but one of programmes coming to an end. However, the situation for the voluntary sector is much more complicated than that. Not only must the sector deal with the reduction in European structural funds, but it must face the complexities caused by lottery funding coming and going. It is probably more difficult than ever for voluntary organisations to sustain their future.</p><p>Members have received a briefing document from the voluntary sector, which explains the scale of the problem. I can recall the end of the urban aid programme. At the time, I was the leader of Perth and Kinross Council, and I think that Christine May was the leader of Fife Council. As the programme came to an end, all the voluntary bodies started to queue up at the door of local authorities and others to try to obtain mainstream funding to allow very worthwhile projects to continue. Local authorities did what they could to help. Now, someone referred to learning from history. I would have thought that we would have <place-holder colnum=\"28714\"/> learned from the ending of the urban aid programme and would know how to manage the present situation. The management has not been nearly as effective as it could have been.</p><p>Another problem will appear in 2013 because of co-financing. By that time, partners all over the public sector will be supporting the voluntary sector, and you can bet your bottom dollar that the voluntary sector will be knocking on the doors of co-funders just as they are knocking on doors now. The chickens are coming home to roost, because not enough was done to study the scale of the problems that would face the voluntary sector.</p><p>I hope, as John Swinney does, that the European and External Relations Committee's report has woken up the Scottish Executive. We welcome the new money, but perhaps it is a bit too late.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13369552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Structural Funds Programmes 2007 to 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The convener of the European and External Relations Committee, Linda Fabiani, laid out the position of the committee, the process undertaken, the conclusions reached and the recommendations made to the Scottish Executive.

As we all know, and as other members have said, a significant amount of freight is moved daily across the Forth road bridge.

The committee probably wanted to take more evidence on it, but committees cannot always do everything that they want to do in an inquiry.

I congratulate Dennis Canavan on the good job and all the hard work that he did as the committee's inquiry reporter. His report has come just at the right time. I accept that the Scottish Executive, including the First Minister and Allan Wilson, the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, has done much work on the matter. However, we must ensure that the improvement in the links and co-operation between Scotland and Ireland that began in the period after devolution is given new impetus.</p><p>Although Scotland and Ireland have a long shared history, with deep and intimate links, for too long those connections were not given the appropriate attention by academia or Government. Our pasts are deeply entwined, from the time of the wars of independence, to the mass migration of Protestant Scots to Ulster in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and the flow in the other direction, to which Dennis Canavan has referred, when people moved from all over Ireland to Scotland in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Indeed, it was an Irishman, Francis Hutcheson, who was born in Ireland and moved to Glasgow, who was much of the driving force behind what Adam Smith and David Hume achieved in the Scottish enlightenment.</p><p>Inevitably, the more closely we examine our relationship, the more deeply and intensely we see <place-holder colnum=\"28173\"/> our similarities and the things that we have in common. That can only help us to work together more effectively as ancient Celtic peoples and together shape a future that best suits all of our needs.</p><p>In the light of the continuing expansion of the European Union, the report has come along at the right time. It is true that Scotland will not benefit to the same degree in the future and that Ireland will not benefit from EU structural funds but, as the old saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. The minister and Dennis Canavan have referred to the co-operation programme that will come into being following the end of the Interreg programme. As the European Union expands and we need to maintain its cohesion, co-operation between neighbours will become a prerequisite to avoiding unnecessary conflict.</p><p>That changing picture provides us with an incredible opportunity to be more imaginative in accessing the new co-operation objective, allowing Scotland to take part in the cross-border programme for the first time. In its evidence to the European and External Relations Committee, the Scottish Enterprise network said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In general terms, we feel future benefits to Scotland through the Territorial Co-operation programmes could be increased by adopting a strategic, pro-active, partnership based approach and the SE Network would seek to play an active role in this.\"</p><p>We can all share that view. We also heard from Donegal County Enterprise Board, which said similar things. There is a will on both sides. However, we need to examine how best we can be flexible with the 150-mile rule of the new co-operation programme to find other ways to help spread the benefits throughout Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Enterprise network mentioned heritage trail work and tourism. We could learn something from the private sector. If we look at any website, whether it is advertising castles or golf, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are almost marketed as one destination. Perhaps we can work jointly to sell that idea of the Celtic peoples working together much more effectively throughout the world.</p><p>Finally, on the St Andrews talks, the clock is ticking. I sincerely hope that we can find a way to re-establish power sharing in Ireland and that all sides will go that extra mile to ensure that that can happen. Everyone is holding their breath and hoping that that will be the outcome.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368376", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operation With Ireland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the European and External Relations Committee sincerely for agreeing to undertake an inquiry into possible co-operation between Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

I do so because he has already altered course. He did not always believe, as he does today, in the need for the UK to maintain WMD.

At the end of the long march for peace, I saw a number of Labour members outside the Parliament join others to greet the marchers on their arrival here. The role of those Labour members in securing a majority vote in Parliament against the replacement or upgrading of Trident is paramount.</p><p>The people who took part in the long march and the majority of the people of Scotland, who believe that there is no strategic, ethical, moral or legal rationale for the UK retaining Trident, are hoping, nay praying, that Labour members will vote with their conscience at decision time.

Worse still, they are asking us to leap into an information void.<place-holder colnum=\"27834\"/></p><p>I believe that our job, as parliamentarians, is to scrutinise things properly and give them rigorous examination, especially the legislation that is brought before us. The proposals in the bill simply do not stand up to scrutiny. To Sarah Boyack, I say that we should not lower the bar of examination and scrutiny just because a proposal seems on the face of it to be attractive and has support.</p><p>There are many questions that remain unanswered. Is the promoter's proposed timetable deliverable within the current network constraints? Is the proposal to extend the rail network's operating hours realistic? Can rolling stock of the required quantity and quality be deployed? I heard what the minister said about that earlier. Will the fares structure that is being considered attract customers and ensure greater social inclusion? The committee explored all those questions and it can take further evidence on them. I accept that. Nevertheless, there are two aspects that should have set the alarm bells ringing and on which no firm conclusion was reached.</p><p>First, the project will disrupt Edinburgh airport during construction and in the long term to such an extent that the proposal is unsustainable&#8212;as was made clear by the managing director of Edinburgh Airport Ltd during his oral evidence when he said that he objects to the proposals. The written evidence from Edinburgh Airport Ltd is also salutary. It states:</p><p>\"Regrettably, contrary to any impression which may be created by the Promoter's Memorandum, there is a lack of agreement between the parties on many of the substantive issues contained in the Bill. In EAL's view this increases the financial, technical, safety and operational risk to both the Promoter and EAL. EAL consequently has serious concerns that the Promoter has failed to appreciate the interface issues and project risks associated with constructing and operating Edinburgh Airport Rail Link (\"EARL\") within an operational airport.\" That is pretty fundamental. That is not an issue that we can go on discussing; it is fundamental to the project.</p><p>Given such serious concerns, unless the minister can tell us different&#8212;as he seemed to hint earlier in an aside to me across the chamber&#8212;I cannot see why today, in the current environment, BAA would want to invest additional resources in this development.</p><p>In effect, we are being asked to sign a blank cheque&#8212;something that I, for one, am not prepared to do. There is no firm funding line. The Executive may say that there is an overall budget, but no one knows who is going to fund that budget.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367568", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not for one moment do I underestimate the scale and complexity of the task that faced the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee.

No right-thinking person could do other than agree that more decentralised energy would be good. Decentralised energy can make a significant contribution to reducing Scotland's ecological footprint. However, if we are ever to achieve one-planet living&#8212;instead of consuming resources at our present rate, which if everyone did the same, would require three earths to meet our needs&#8212;a massive change will be necessary in our attitudes to how we run the country, how we act as businesses and organisations and how we behave as individuals and communities.</p><p>As far as government is concerned, I can think of no time during my lifetime when a UK Government has had a coherent, strategic and deliverable energy policy. Annabel Goldie's cheap aside about the \"Celtic utopia\" tells me that the Tories have not changed: they are still anti-Scottish by nature and do not have enough faith, ambition or confidence in their people. I believe passionately that if we want to deliver a well-constructed energy policy, the necessary fiscal and policy powers must be vested in the Scottish Parliament. I have no doubt that we could deliver the changes that are required more successfully and on a much accelerated timescale. It is obvious that a unity of purpose exists among members that would allow us to make significant progress.</p><p>I congratulate Nicol Stephen on what he said this week about Scotland being able to get 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050, but he must accept that that will be possible only if all fiscal and energy policy powers are transferred to the Scottish Parliament. I must caution him&#8212;if he speaks to the energy industry, he will find that all the easy gains have already been made. From here on in, it will get much harder to meet the target that he has set. That is true of wind farms and offshore wind, in particular.</p><p>I turn to the Talisman Energy project for the North sea, the scale of which illustrates how we can deliver significant changes in how we do things in this country. I visited the Methil yard during the summer and was stunned by the size of the project that is being put together there, which involves a wind turbine blade that is the size of two football pitches put together. That massive project <place-holder colnum=\"27752\"/> has huge potential for Scotland, but there is a blockage in the system. At this stage, the UK Government has the power to grant permission for the project to go ahead, but the chat in the industry is that the Government is considering devolving responsibility for it to the Scottish Parliament. That would be a good thing&#8212;let us hope that the Government gets on with the devolution of those powers so that we can get the job done and ensure that the wind farm is put in place. I would like the minister to tell us whether the devolution of those powers to Scotland is a genuine possibility.</p><p>We must also be realistic about the Beauly to Denny power line, which is attracting a great deal of criticism up and down its route. Talisman is quite clear that without that line, it will not be able to deliver its project in the North sea. Investment might make it possible to develop alternatives to the line, but at the moment it is the only vehicle we have. I accept that mitigation measures need to be put in place&#8212;undergrounding and route diversions will be required in some areas&#8212;but we should not kid ourselves that campaigns against the line in parts of Scotland will do the country's offshore wind energy industry a huge disfavour. I have tried to be as honest as possible with people to whom I have spoken in the Stirling area&#8212;I have said that although I am prepared to help them on mitigation issues such as undergrounding, we must accept the principle that if we are to deliver the changes that are necessary, the new line is essential.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have a great say&#8212;other than through the planning process&#8212;in many of the issues that Parliament likes to talk about and influence, including those to do with the national grid. I will finish with a plea. If the Conservatives are serious about what they say in their motion, and if Nicol Stephen is serious about delivering the target that he outlined this week, they should realise that the only way that we will be able to achieve those objectives is for us to be able to do the work ourselves and for that to happen soon.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greener, Fairer Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by congratulating the Tories, who are obviously at the beginning of a journey.

Those service personnel were brave and committed people, who were doing a remarkable job in sometimes impossible circumstances.</p><p>Our sympathies should also go out to the innocents who have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Perhaps one of the most depressing headlines that I read during the recess announced <place-holder colnum=\"27188\"/> that 64 people had been killed in bombings within half an hour. The article was about the 64 people who were killed and 286 who were injured during a spate of bombings in eastern Baghdad last Friday. It said that the UN has calculated that every day during May and June about 100 civilians met a violent death. Iraq's interior ministry estimates that more than 3,000 people died in July.</p><p>I raise such matters during a debate on Scotland's future because I know that many members of the Parliament took part in the anti-war demonstration, to declare that the war is not in our name. However, like it or otherwise, we are part of the UK and we are involved in an illegal war. We must all share responsibility for the carnage and despair in Iraq. However, I believe in all sincerity that if Scotland had had control of its armed forces we would never have been complicit in the illegal war and subsequent occupation of Iraq.</p><p>We must consider what we would do if we acquired that control and responsibility. We would want to be part of the multinational peacekeeping force that is to help to sort out the mess in southern Lebanon. I am ashamed that our international position and image have been so tarnished by our involvement in the conflict in Iraq that we cannot send peacekeeping troops to Lebanon. Given the choice and the control, the Scottish people would much rather be seen as peacemakers in Lebanon than war makers in Iraq. That could have been Scotland today. We can still make it Scotland's future.</p><p>Unfortunately, we will not have any control over the momentous decision that is soon to be taken on whether the son of Trident and a new era of weapons of mass destruction will be foisted upon the Clyde. Here we are again on the brink of breaking international law. To replace Trident would breach article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which expects all signatories in good faith to cease the arms race at an early date and to work toward complete disarmament. It is self-evident that replacing Trident could not possibly be seen as working toward disarmament.</p><p>To date, I have heard no convincing arguments as to why the UK needs to create the son of Trident. Is it because two or three other nations now possess nuclear weapons? As far as I know, none of them has either the capacity or the motivation to attack the UK. Or is it because of the threat of terrorism? As I have said before, surely that cannot be the case. I would dearly love to know how a suicide bomber who was intent on martyrdom would be stopped as a result of Trident on the Clyde.

As our amendment states, the very least that we expect is for the Scottish Government to fight Scotland's corner and not to run for cover. The decision on whether to send Scottish troops to war or to have them act as peacemakers should be made here in Scotland. The decisions on how we should arm ourselves, protect our servicemen and servicewomen when in conflict and spend our resources should be made here in Scotland.</p><p>We have the confidence to let Scotland decide its future.

During stage 1 and through amendments at stage 2, I raised the matter of the formatting of the register of electors. The serious point that I was making was about inconsistency in the formatting of the register, not only between electoral registration officers&#8212;EROs&#8212;but in individual systems. During stage 2, the minister stated:<place-holder colnum=\"26900\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The electoral register, and its format and appearance, are reserved matters that we cannot deal with in the Scottish Parliament.\"</p><p>That is a pity, but never mind&#8212;that is the situation. The minister continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"However, the Scotland Office has advised that, as part of the consultation on the co-ordinated online record of electors ... the UK Government has asked for opinions on the format of the registers\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Transport Committee</em>, 30 May 2006; c 3788.]</p><p>I accept that point and I must obviously accept that the issue is reserved; it might be plain daft, but the situation that we are in is that the Scottish Parliament does not have powers over technical matters that relate to the electoral register. I see that the minister is moving his head in an affirmative manner. I am glad that I have his support on that.</p><p>I will provide the minister with some specific examples that he might find useful in dealing with the issue. I have tried to find out about the sort of difficulties that are created. In a recent by-election in Kilmarnock, the ERO spelled the word \"Kilmarnock\" in three different ways&#8212;sometimes with a zero instead of an \"o\"; and sometimes with the \"i\" and \"r\" missing. Members might not think that that is important, but it is when information technology is involved. Computer systems cannot pick up such errors, which can make things difficult for political parties. In South Lanarkshire, the ERO provided the 2006 register using the Scottish Parliament boundaries and then proceeded to send monthly updates using Westminster boundaries. As we might imagine, such inconsistencies can create difficulties for local authorities.</p><p>Even missing punctuation marks or punctuation marks that should not be there can cause problems for IT systems. Perhaps most seriously, some EROs have provided data in comma-separated variables format and some have provided it in XML format. All EROs were supposed to provide the files in XML format by 1 December 2005, but they have not managed to achieve that target. On the face of it, those might seem to be small matters, but in terms of oiling the wheels of democracy they are important for political parties.</p><p>The matter of personal identifiers has been raised by the minister. I note from the briefing that we have received that the Electoral Commission welcomes, as we do, the provisions to introduce personal identifiers for new absent voters, but we must also pick up on the Electoral Commission's point about personal identifiers for all voters. That is a position that the Scottish National Party supports. Such a provision would bring surety, assurance and confidence to the system.<place-holder colnum=\"26901\"/></p><p>In that regard, I would like the minister to deal specifically with the amendments that were tabled on Tuesday by the House of Lords to introduce personal identifiers for all as part of the UK Electoral Administration Bill. The UK bill is due to get royal assent at the end of June. If the House of Commons continues to obstruct the aims of the House of Lords, we may find that the Government will need to decide to accept the position of the Lords if it is to achieve its target date. In those circumstances, if the Lords were to prevail and if the bill were to be changed in that way, how would the Scottish Executive deal with the matter here? That is an important issue in the overall process. I do not usually use the House of Lords as an example of good practice, but on this occasion the Lords have got it right.</p><p>Presiding Officer, do I have any more time?

I cannot for the <place-holder colnum=\"26902\"/> life of me understand why we need to consult further on that. If there is an information technology system that can do it, that will avoid the political parties having to count using five-bar gates on election nights to work out what their share of the vote was in a given ballot box. There is no reason why a returning officer cannot now, at the end of the night, produce that information on paper and save everybody a lot of hassle. That might take some of the enjoyment away for those of us who are anoraks about the process, but it would nevertheless make matters a lot clearer. Importantly, it would allow political parties to know where their vote is, so that they can try to maximise turnout the next time.

The Scottish National Party endorses the report, which expresses general support for the bill while acknowledging that its proposals can be improved in certain areas&#8212;although I say to David Davidson that, no matter what improvements are made to the counting system, it will still struggle to find any <place-holder colnum=\"25315\"/> Tory votes. In the short time available, I will address a number of concerns and highlight some improvements that might be made.</p><p>First, I want to raise the vexed issue of electoral fraud because, after all, any change to the electoral process must have at its core the aim of raising public confidence. Although we warmly welcome attempts to make voting more convenient for people, we do not believe that such an approach should be introduced at the expense of the security and privacy of the ballot process. The committee comments on that issue on pages 16 to 18 of its report. The Executive must be guided by the principle of prioritising measures that will raise public confidence in the safety and security of the vote. That is why the issues that the Electoral Commission raised in its briefing to MSPs are so important and why we must listen to&#8212;and why the Executive must act on&#8212;the commission's comments about the pilots and the use of personal identifiers. The commission said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we are concerned that the pilot schemes proposed will not offer sufficiently widespread safeguards against postal voting abuse and are unlikely to provide an effective guide to the likely impact of a national scheme. Crucially, this approach gives no guarantees of improvements in security for postal voters ahead of the next Scottish Parliamentary and local government or UK Parliamentary elections.\"</p><p>The Executive should take particular note of that advice.</p><p>As the minister pointed out, sections 1 and 2 are intended to increase efficiency of electoral administration and seek to introduce the concept of performance targets to encourage best practice in service delivery. In paragraph 52 of the report, the committee makes it clear that it</p><p class=\"indent\">\"considers it important that when standards are developed they are specific and deliverable, and that there is uniformity and consistency\".</p><p>I would like to give a couple of examples, based on my personal experience and perspective, of ways in which a more consistent approach could help in the delivery of electoral services. My first point is to do with the formatting of the data that are held on the electoral register; the Labour Party has taken up that point previously. It has become clear from recent experience in a number of areas of Scotland that a uniform method of holding and producing electoral register data does not exist. The formatting of the data&#8212;with regard to addresses, for example&#8212;is not done in a uniform way across all electoral registration offices. It would be hugely helpful to the efficiency of the electoral process if that information were held and produced uniformly by electoral registration officers across Scotland. It would be particularly useful if the new register, when it is produced in December, were to include ward codes, because that would make a considerable difference to the <place-holder colnum=\"25316\"/> way in which political parties participate in elections.</p><p>It would be useful to hear from the minister when we expect the final ward boundaries to be agreed and brought into being. That point is not related to the bill, but the further that that slips, the more difficult it will be for the electoral process.</p><p>Secondly, we would support the development of a national online register, which we believe would be helpful in delivering a more effective and efficient service. I understand that the Executive is putting out to tender a process to do with raising awareness of individuals in the community about the elections next year&#8212;both the local government elections and the Scottish Parliament elections&#8212;and that is important. However, I seek assurances from the Executive that that exercise will go beyond just encouraging people to come out to vote and that it will include an attempt to begin to explain to people the complexity of the three voting systems that will be before them next May. There is a job of work to be done in that regard and I would like to hear whether it is intended that the tender should include an exercise of the kind that I have outlined.</p><p>There is a need for standards and for greater consistency between returning officers and electoral registration officers; I shall say more about that in a moment. First, however, I will mention the by-election in Moray, where political parties were denied the opportunity to sample ballot boxes. I know that the parties have no right to do that, but it is allowed in many other parts of Scotland. For some reason, it was not allowed in Moray&#8212;not that that mattered too much to us, given that we could have weighed the votes rather than having to count them.</p><p>While I am on the subject of Moray, I should also say that we ought to be able to deal with issues regarding election expenses, although the bill does not give us that power. Some of the sums of money that have been spent by the United Kingdom parties in recent by-elections in Scotland have been obscene; we need to control those amounts.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13360992", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank my former committee colleagues not only for making my stay on the Local Government and Transport Committee as enjoyable as it could be, but for their work in compiling the stage 1 report on the bill.

First, I will deal with the issue of nuclear weapons being seen in today's world as some sort of deterrent. I never accepted the old arguments, which were made during the cold war, that somehow the UK's nuclear weapons capacity helped to keep the peace and avoid further wars. It did not stop General Galtieri invading the Falklands, even though the Argentines never possessed the nuclear bomb. I never accepted the arguments, but at least there was a considered rationale that could be used by those who supported the UK's possession of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>The collapse of the cold war has entirely removed any justification for the UK's possession of strategic nuclear weapons. Perhaps they will come in the debate that Jackie Baillie wants, but I have heard no convincing arguments about why the UK needs to spend &#163;15 billion to &#163;25 billion on creating the son of Trident. That money could be much better used for our public services and to help our economy. It would also produce a heck of a lot more jobs than Trident ever did.</p><p>Should we replace Trident because two or three other nations now possess nuclear weapons? As far as I know, none of them has either the motivation or the capacity to attack the UK. Should we do it because of the threat of terrorism? Surely that cannot be the case. I would like to know how a suicide bomber who is intent on martyrdom would be stopped because we have Trident on the Clyde. I cannot believe that we would deploy a nuclear weapon against a Muslim city, creating a modern-day Hiroshima, because that truly would unleash an unimaginable conflagration. The truth is that the end of the cold war killed off any intellectual arguments that might have existed in favour of any UK requirement to retain weapons of mass destruction.<place-holder colnum=\"25227\"/></p><p>Of course, the UK now has a changed position, which was adopted first by the Tories; later, Labour abandoned its principle of no first strike in favour of defending vital overseas interests. That means that Trident could be used pre-emptively and, as Chris Ballance said, the very threat of that could be seen as illegal under customary international law because</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it would infringe the 'intransgressible' requirement that a distinction must be drawn between combatants and non-combatants.\"</p><p>It is self-evident that such weapons of mass destruction cannot be used against combatants only.</p><p>Replacing Trident would breach article VI of the 1996 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which expects all signatories, in good faith, to cease the nuclear arms race at an early date and to work towards complete disarmament. Replacing Trident could not be seen as working towards disarmament There is little or no prospect of the UK abandoning its commitment to WMD. It was the Labour Wilson Government of the 1960s that first built, launched and named the Polaris fleet. It was the Jim Callaghan Government that struck the Trident deal in a beach hut in Guadeloupe. The Labour Party's 2005 general election manifesto stated clearly that the party is committed to retaining an independent nuclear deterrent, therefore it comes as no surprise that Labour is intent on deciding during the lifetime of the current Parliament to create the son of Trident. The Tories are wedded to the arguments of the past every bit as much as Labour is, and we can see from the Liberals' amendment that their position is not much different.</p><p>It is quite clear&#8212;and no facile argument&#8212;to say that the only way and the best way to get rid of Trident on the Clyde and to rid Scotland of nuclear weapons is for Scotland to become independent. It is absolutely clear that all the unionist parties are wedded to the idea of continuing to have this weapon of mass destruction on the Clyde. I have heard others talk about Trident being some sort of independent deterrent for Scotland. Well, the US supplies the missile system because we lease it from there.

Campaign groups have been formed along the proposed route of the line that either oppose the erection of the line in principle or seek to mitigate the local effects through rerouting or undergrounding the cables.</p><p>Objectors have aired many reasons for opposing the proposals. I will name a few concerns in the Stirling area alone. There are concerns there about the line's impact on the amenity for local <place-holder colnum=\"23410\"/> residents and recreational interests; on the Ochil hills area of great landscape value; on tourism and the local area's economy; on historic sites of great value, such as Stirling castle, the Wallace monument and the site of the battle of Sheriffmuir; and on areas of ancient and important woodland. The number of objections has led Clackmannanshire Council to agree formally to object to the proposal, and it is likely that Stirling Council will follow that council this week, which will trigger the mechanism to commence a public inquiry.</p><p>It is a great pity that projects of such apparent economic importance to Scotland are considered in a vacuum and that there is no comprehensive energy strategy for Scotland to provide a context for such applications. I have great sympathy for both the proposer and the objectors. If a comprehensive energy strategy had existed and it showed that such a line would serve a vital national economic interest, perhaps the level of conflict could have been much reduced.</p><p>I refer to the substantive matter that is raised in the motion: the potential impact on human health of high-voltage power lines. There has been much debate, over a prolonged period, about whether high-voltage power lines can increase the likelihood of cancer, especially childhood leukaemia. However, it is indisputable that, in March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board, which later became the Health Protection Agency, published a review of the scientific evidence for limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields. That review concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"An association between prolonged exposure to intense power frequency magnetic fields and a small raised risk of childhood leukaemia has, however, been found, the scientific reasons for which are presently uncertain. In the light of these findings and the requirement for additional research, the need for further precautionary measures should be considered by government.\"</p><p>That advice was accepted by the Government and the stakeholder advisory group on electromagnetic fields was set up to explore the implications of a precautionary approach and make practical recommendations. SAGE is expected to make policy recommendations to the Government during 2006. I will come back to that at the end of my speech.</p><p>Since the setting up of SAGE, we have seen the publication of the Draper study in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> of June 2005. The study, which was funded by the Department of Health and was conducted by the childhood cancer research group at the University of Oxford, looked at childhood cancer in relation to distance from high-voltage power lines. It examined the records of more than 29,000 children with cancer, including 9,700 who had leukaemia. It investigated whether the proximity of those children's home addresses at <place-holder colnum=\"23411\"/> birth to the nearest high-voltage power line was associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer.</p><p>With regard to the result of that large study, I quote from Lewis Macdonald's letter of 31 October 2005:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This large epidemiological study ... found that compared with those who lived more than 600 metres from high voltage power lines at birth, children who lived within 200 metres had a relative risk of leukaemia that was 70% higher and those born between 200 and 600 metres had a relative risk that was 23% higher.\"</p><p>I accept the fact that some of the findings of the Draper study have been disputed; nevertheless, previous international studies have shown findings similar to those in the Draper study. That makes the work that is being carried out by SAGE all the more important.</p><p>That background prompted Stirling Before Pylons to undertake its own on-the-ground study into the number of homes that are within 600m of both edges of the proposed power line corridor. That was quite a task for that small group to take on, and it deserves congratulations on the detailed work that it has undertaken. The results of its work certainly impacted on me. It found that more than 870 homes were located within 600m of both edges of the proposed pylon corridor. That includes 578 houses in the village of Fallin and 48 flats housing about 330 students at the University of Stirling, which are within 200m of the edge of the proposed pylon corridor.</p><p>In the light of the Draper study and the work that is currently being carried out by SAGE, I cannot see how the Executive can do anything other than accept a cautious and precautionary approach being adopted in regard to the potential impact of the power lines on human health. I am interested to hear whether the minister would support the suggestion that has been made by Scottish Natural Heritage that an alternative route for the line be found to the west of Stirling, with undergrounding.</p><p>It is vital that the recommendations of SAGE are able to stand up to the most intense scrutiny. Those recommendations must be rigorous beyond reproach and should in no way be unduly influenced by interest groups from either side of the argument. People must be able to have faith in the recommendations, as otherwise huge amounts of human energy and intellect will be consumed in arguing the case for or against the health impacts of power lines for as long as they exist.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356333", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Beauly to Denny Power Line (Childhood Leukaemia)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank you, Presiding Officer, for allowing time for the chamber to get quieter and I sincerely thank all my colleagues who signed the motion and members who intend to speak in the debate or simply to listen.

I am glad that Nicol Stephen, the Liberal minister in charge of that matter, is present.</p><p>The SNP amendment goes on to consider constructively how best to deal with the vexed question of the Forth road bridge, its tolls and its future as a crossing. It will not be much comfort to the Lexmark workers at this time, but I am sure that all members would wish to express their sympathy for the uncertain future that those workers face. The SNP wants several measures to be put in place with immediate effect. First, we need targeted measures, similar to those what were introduced following the Motorola closure in West Lothian, that are aimed at assisting the workforce.</p><p>Secondly, we need a strategy from the Scottish Executive and Fife Council to drive forward the revitalisation of Dunfermline town centre. That proud town has a rich history and deserves a much better deal. It has been neglected for far too long. Let us use the opportunity of this difficult time for the area to ramp up the economic impact of the town centre with a vision for its future and a positive energy force to drive change forward.</p><p>Thirdly, Transport Scotland should, as a priority, be charged with responsibility for investigating how best to improve transport links into the area to the benefit of the economy. Fourthly, it is time to end the bickering between Labour and Liberal Executive ministers and the Brown-Darling London axis. The past week has seen a catalogue of spectacular stairheid rammies and contradictions of stated Government policy. No one knows any longer who is in charge of the issue, what to believe about the future of the tolls or indeed whether a second crossing is planned. When I saw the headlines in the press on Tuesday, I could not help but remember the immortal words of Burns:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!\"</p><p>It is time not only to stop the bickering but to give a boost to the east of Scotland economy by announcing a freeze on the tolls at the current level of &#163;1&#8212;the Scottish National Party's stated <place-holder colnum=\"22733\"/> and consistent position. The Executive cannot kid on that the tolls are a form of congestion charge when there are no alternative routes across the estuary that can deal in any meaningful way with the expected rise in traffic. It is time for the First Minister and the Liberal transport minister to stop hiding and to come clean about their intentions. If they continue to prevaricate, people will see their intentions for what they are: a cynical attempt to hide the truth until after the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election. It is interesting that, in response to an earlier question, the minister did not rule out a &#163;4 toll on the bridge. What will the new toll level be? Will it be &#163;2? Will it be &#163;3? Will it be &#163;4? Or will the toll double, like the tolls have in London, and be more like &#163;8 in just a few years? Today is the minister's chance to put to rest all the damaging speculation. It is time to come clean.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-3863.1, to leave out from \"opposes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes with regret the announcement by Lexmark that it intends to close its factory in Rosyth with the loss of 700 jobs; expresses sympathy for the workers affected; is concerned about the impact the closure will have on the economy of Dunfermline and West Fife; believes that, in response to the closure, an action plan targeted at assisting the Lexmark workforce should be introduced immediately; further believes that the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with Fife Council, should put in place, as a matter of urgency, a strategy for the economic revitalisation of Dunfermline town centre and that Transport Scotland should be directed to improve the transport links to the area in order to make it more attractive for investors; agrees that, as part of a package to help the economy of Fife, an immediate announcement freezing the level of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge at &#163;1 should be made, and further agrees that planning for a new crossing should begin immediately in view of the fact that the bridge will close to heavy goods vehicles in 2013 and to all traffic in 2019 if a satisfactory engineering solution cannot be found to overcome the bridge's structural problems.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13354541", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: East of Scotland Economy (Transport Links)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A large number of jobs could be lost, but the issue in Dunfermline and West Fife this week is the closure of Lexmark.

The consultation process was not satisfactory; it should have been done with more care and consideration. However, no matter how much consultation there is, there will be genuine concerns about the impact of the post office closures on the salary and terms and conditions of service for many staff. As Scott Barrie said, the position in Dunfermline is different from that in Dumfries, as the post office and the future Spar shop will remain in the same place. That does not, of course, remove the anxiety or concerns of staff. Despite the offer of voluntary redundancies or relocation, the closest place to Dunfermline is Glenrothes, as Scott Barrie pointed out. Many staff will want to remain with Royal Mail&#8212;although, looking at how the matter has been handled, one might wonder why. The Post Office must, as other members said, look very closely at what the motion says and at the number of members who have signed up to it.<place-holder colnum=\"22238\"/></p><p>On the issue of service, the briefing that we got from the Post Office says that the new branches will also offer customers a high-quality grocery store, as the branches will carry a range of shopping under one roof, and that in some branches the change may also mean longer opening hours on Saturdays. If my understanding is right, that will not affect Dunfermline, because it already opens on Saturdays. We need to enter into serious discussion with the Post Office about what it considers to be the improvements in real terms. As Scott Barrie said, there could be a reduction from 14 counters to eight in the post office in Dunfermline.</p><p>Leaving aside for a moment the issues of staffing&#8212;although that is by no means to diminish it&#8212;and service, it is important to ask ourselves honestly how we reached this position. For better or worse, the changes that have been made at Westminster to how benefits and pensions are paid have had a severe impact on the financial viability of post offices. Indeed, the Communication Workers Union has been led to say that the changes in how benefits and pensions are paid have had severe financial implications for the Post Office.</p><p>There is a dispute between the union and the Post Office about the scale of the financial implications. On the one hand, the union says that there has been a loss of &#163;71 million across the whole group; the Post Office, however, claims that the loss is only &#163;71 million across the directly managed units. No matter how we look at it, the Post Office is making a severe financial loss, and it is being told by Government that it must address that loss. It is taking action as required by the Westminster Government. Are Labour members saying that they are distancing themselves from the decisions taken at Westminster? Those decisions have led to the closures that we are debating.</p><p>While recognising the difficulties, we must be honest with ourselves. Fiona Hyslop hit the nail on the head when she said that we reap what we sow. We can protest about what is happening and about how staff are being treated and ask whether the service will be better. However, should we not also be protesting about the process that allowed us to reach this position in the first place?</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13353311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post Offices (Closure)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Elaine Murray on bringing the debate to the chamber, as it is important that we discuss the matter.

Others have commented on the lack of contributions from others in Scottish civic and industrial society. I draw Sarah Boyack's attention to the fact that the powers are not available to the Parliament to deal, through legislation, with aspects of the throwaway society that she talked about. For example, why cannot we introduce an obligation on companies to ensure, where appropriate, that the design of products incorporates waste minimisation principles at the development stage, including the capacity to repair, reuse and recycle? Why cannot we place a duty on producers to report in their annual statements of accounts on their use of natural resources and how they intend to reduce consumption? Unfortunately, the Parliament does not have the power to impose such duties; if we did, we could approach the issue more sustainably.</p><p>John Swinney raised the strategic waste fund. \"Choosing Our Future\" sets out the Executive's overview on reducing waste for the good of our health and well-being, which I accept. It also talks about how we can reduce Scotland's global impact and our footprint on the world. That is important. As I am sure the minister will accept, waste is a huge part of that. The Executive has set targets and has made good progress, particularly when we consider that Scotland started off as an international disgrace, at the bottom of the European recycling league. We are no longer there. Initial progress was slow but, to the Executive's credit, between 2003 and 2004 there was a 5.2 per cent increase in recycling. That is to be welcomed. The total rate of recycling is now 17.3 per cent. However, the rate of increase will need to reach 7.7 per cent by the end of this year if we are to stay on target.</p><p>The reality is that many of the early recycling gains have been made. The easy stuff has been done. We need to examine the real hard stuff&#8212;the investment in reclamation processes for the long term, where we have a significant difficulty, particularly when we consider the funding position. As John Swinney said, the amount has been reduced.

He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If I were to take you today some 70 odd years on to the grave of John Thomson, it would still be maintained with dignity and care and visited by football fans, not just Celtic fans but of other clubs, because he was a Scottish international goalkeeper.\"</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"What always intrigued me was the uniqueness of John Thomson that he should be remembered when statues of great parliamentarians are entertained in street squares only by pigeons&#8212;yet a 22-year old boy could inspire such affection and love\"</p><p>in all those around him.</p><p>Among John Thomson's many attributes, he was known as the prince of goalkeepers and, as Helen Eadie said, as a gentleman on and off the field. He was also a deeply religious man, having been brought up by his parents in the Protestant sect called the Church of Christ. Thomson carried <place-holder colnum=\"21679\"/> his faith and his Bible with him throughout his outstanding and exceptional career. Football fans came from all over just to see John Thomson in action on the playing field, and they were awed and inspired by his physical prowess. It was said that his eyes never left the ball on the field, and he was renowned for his bravery and fearsomeness. People who are involved in football say that someone who goes in hard will come out the other side okay and that someone who tackles hard will be all right. Tragically, however, as far as John Thomson was concerned, that was not how things transpired.</p><p>There is another side of the story that is not often talked about&#8212;another tragedy that happened to Sam English, the footballer who happened to collide with him that day. He was born in Ireland, in County Coleraine, but he grew up in Yoker in Scotland. During the 1930s, he played with Rangers and held records for Rangers for the most goals scored in one season. The official inquiry into the incident said that it was an accident and cleared Sam English of any blame&#8212;a view that was fully supported by John Thomson's family. He later transferred to play for Liverpool and also played for Ireland a number of times. No one ever seriously accused Sam English of malice in that situation, but he was constantly barracked by Scottish crowds, which caused his transfer to England, where he found that his reputation had preceded him and that he faced constant barracking from spectators when he played in England too, so he gave up football. He died at the Vale of Leven hospital in West Dunbartonshire aged only 58. A nurse who nursed him at that time said that he died before his time and looked very old. Therefore, two tragedies are associated with the death of John Thomson.</p><p>The song \"Johnny Thomson's Ghost\" is still sung by Celtic supporters:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"So come all you Glasgow Celtic<br/> Stand up and play the game<br/> For between your posts<br/> There stands a ghost<br/> Johnny Thomson is his name\".</p><p>John Thomson played in goal for Glasgow Celtic for the first team when he was, I think, only 17&#8212;it might have been 18 as Helen Eadie suggested. He also made four appearances for the national team.</p><p>As Helen Eadie said, 40,000 mourners turned up for his funeral; some of them had walked 55 miles from Glasgow to John Thomson's childhood home. I have a good friend in Milnathort called John Watt, who is a singer. He wrote \"The Kelty Clippie\" and \"Methil by the Sea\", but he also wrote the words:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Between the posts at Parkhead<br/> He was the Prince of Men<br/> <place-holder colnum=\"21680\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">John Thomson came from Bowhill<br/> Bowhill, Cardenden\".</p><p>Two special trains left Glasgow on that day to come to Bowhill and many people slept on the crags along the bing that night. The Bowhill pipe band and the Bowhill silver band were in attendance and, as Helen Eadie said, an aeroplane landed in the Daisy park in Bowhill.</p><p>John Thomson came to play for Celtic by chance. One Saturday he was playing for Wellesley Juniors&#8212;a pit team&#8212;against Denbeath Star. A Celtic scout at the game saw him play and signed him up. In his first game, Celtic won 3-1 in front of 20,000 supporters at Dens park. He was a hero from the first day he played for Celtic.</p><p>John Thomson's part of Fife is a tremendous area with a great history in the sport. It has produced a remarkable number of professional footballers: 50 players from the Cardenden area have played in the professional leagues in Scotland. John Thomson was perhaps one of the best of them all.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351949", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: John Thomson"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I know that John Thomson's memory means a lot to a lot of people, and Helen Eadie deserves some congratulations on having the motion debated tonight. \"They never die who live in the hearts they leave behind.\" Glasgow Celtic's manager, William Maley, penned that tribute at the time of the untimely death, at just 22 years old, of John Thomson, the first-choice Glasgow Celtic goalkeeper....", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Bruce", "last_name": "Crawford", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80020", "house": "4", "member_id": "80020", "person_id": "13971", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, "section_id": "13351949", "hpos": "386", "gid": "2005-12-08.21678.0", "epobject_id": "13351952", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2005-12-08.21675.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13971+section%3Asp#g21678.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "17:16:00", "speaker_id": "80020"}, {"body": "<p>I congratulate the member on securing the debate.

I have read out what the document I have says. Either George Lyon or Tom McCabe is wrong; they cannot both be right. I have read the bill and I know that exceptional circumstances exist.<place-holder time=\"16:15:00\"/></p><p>It is equally true to state that an application for a licence to remain open for a period of 23 hours and 59 minutes will not be considered to be exceptional and that there is a danger of that number of hours becoming the norm. The same applies to 19, 20, 21, 22 or 23 hours. To all intents and purposes, there is the prospect of 24-hour opening&#8212;or opening for 23 hours and 59 minutes, if members want to be pedantic. Such opening could become the norm, because it has not been defined as being the exception.</p><p>We do not believe that Scotland is ready for 24-hour opening. Whether we like it or not, we have a bevvy culture, which is extremely unfortunate. Report after report and statistic after statistic shows a depressing picture of how Scotland is failing to get to grips with alcohol abuse. Binge drinking and alcohol abuse by younger people are increasing. Drink-fuelled crime is on the up and ill health that is related to alcohol abuse is getting worse. Media report after media report paints a picture of public policy failure on alcohol abuse.</p><p>I realise that I am speaking about a long-term issue. <em>The Scotsman</em> of Tuesday 6 September contained the headline, \"Drunken weekend violence hitting frontline policing\". The paper quotes the deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders police force, Malcolm Dickson, as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"too many police officers are being diverted to deal with evening binge drinking in city centres instead of dealing with ordinary crime.\"</p><p>The paper stated that Mr Dickson also criticised</p><p class=\"indent\">\"government plans to introduce 24-hour drinking, claiming this will add to the stretching of police resources.\"<place-holder colnum=\"20717\"/></p><p>It is not only the deputy chief constable who is opposed to 24-hour opening; the Local Government and Transport Committee also opposes it. Paragraph 310 of its stage 1 report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee is not yet convinced that 24 hour drinking is required in Scotland, even in exceptional circumstances ... As things stand, the Committee considers that 18 hours is a more appropriate cut-off point than the 24 hour limit set out in the Bill.\"</p><p>The committee took that view simply because the evidence against 24-hour opening&#8212;even in exceptional circumstances&#8212;was overwhelming. The trade does not want it: the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and the Scottish Grocers Federation, which represent the trade, are against it. Alcohol Focus Scotland is opposed to it and&#8212;perhaps tellingly&#8212;so is Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson. In written evidence to the committee, he said that the provisions in section 60</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would not be triggered at all if an applicant were to stipulate an opening period of 23 hours and 59 minutes; but such a period would be likely to be seen as being just as objectionable as a period of precisely 24 hours. Consequently, if this provision is to remain, I would respectfully suggest that the trigger point should be a number of hours just beyond what might normally be regarded as acceptable&#8212;say, 18 hours\",</p><p>as per my amendment 62.</p><p>From the First Minister down, the Executive has told us that it is determined to tackle Scotland's booze culture, but the reality is before us. The Executive is prepared to usher in a process to allow 24-hour opening instead of taking a more reasonable and sensible approach. The mixed message that the Executive is sending out can only create greater confusion. On the one hand, it talks tough on antisocial behaviour and binge drinking; on the other hand, it says that people will be able to buy alcohol even more freely in future.</p><p>I know that there is widespread concern among members of all parties about 24-hour opening, and that that concern is shared by the country.

Surely the purpose of the debate is to approach the subject in a different way.</p><p>I, for one, warmly welcome the new powers that have been devolved to Scotland, and to the minister, from 1 April next year. They are a great idea. The powers will result in First ScotRail being contracted to the Scottish Executive through the franchise and Network Rail being contracted to First ScotRail in terms of the responsibility for track access arrangements. However, one of the missing pieces of the jigsaw is the need for Network Rail to be more accountable to the Scottish Executive. Further discussions should take place to improve the situation. I accept that <place-holder colnum=\"20619\"/> arrangements have been put in place, but they are not the same as having a binding contract or real accountability. The issue needs to be examined; we need to get it right for the longer term.</p><p>I recognise the considerable challenges that face the minister. The consultation paper is a good start. The first question asks:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Following the delivery of the current major projects, should we change the focus of investment in the railways to concentrate on securing the benefits from the existing network\"?</p><p>That is an important question. Fergus Ewing alluded to that when he spoke about the need to examine what the Executive has said about its planned projects.</p><p>We have to start getting the basics right: the challenge is staring us in the face. The small number of pinchpoints throughout Scotland give rise to considerable difficulties. If we were to lever in only a small amount of investment, it could make a significant difference to the rail network in that regard.</p><p>We need to get the fundamentals right. The question is how to get a lot more out of the existing infrastructure. I will move on to address capacity issues, but before I do, I will dwell on some of the significant questions that are raised by the Executive's planned extensions to the network.</p><p>What lessons can we learn from what has been happening, for example, with the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line? That line is very welcome, but the costs went up from an initial cost-base of &#163;37 million to something like &#163;60 million; the cost was never going to be the earlier figure. I have been told that there must be five appraisal stages for such projects before a robust cost analysis can be made, but the figure and the go-ahead for the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine line were announced at stage two. The result was an unexpected and undeliverable cost factor for that railway line. There must be much more robust financial planning before such announcements are made to ensure that they are much closer to the final, real sum.</p><p>The costs could have been much higher and matters could have been more difficult than they have been had not Network Rail been as flexible as it was on the grouting of the mineworkings that exist along the route. I understand that there is also conflict in Alloa, because the building of a new superstore means that the station car park will have space for only 50 cars. That is not enough space for the Alloa station car park in this modern day and age. We must try to resolve such conflicts. The Alloa link might become a route into Glasgow for a large part of Clackmannan, Fife and, indeed, southern parts of Perthshire. We <place-holder colnum=\"20620\"/> must examine the Alloa situation much more carefully.</p><p>Bristow Muldoon talked about the Airdrie to Bathgate line, which is important. However, significant issues must be resolved with regard to the tunnelling at Waverley. If the line is to be electrified, we must ensure that the improvement works at Waverley railway station happen at the same time as the works on the Airdrie to Bathgate line.

I did not sign his motion because I am not yet sure whether the way forward is necessarily the multimodal option; we might need to consider the Forth railway bridge and there is always the option of a cheaper tunnel. I am glad that Tavish Scott&#8212;who is not in the chamber&#8212;is the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications, because he has shown that he will respond positively to well-argued and evidence-led proposals.</p><p>The decision on whether to proceed with the building of a new Firth of Forth crossing will be one of the biggest challenges&#8212;if not the biggest challenge&#8212;that Tavish Scott will face. I challenge him to commission the new national transport authority to begin work on planning for a new crossing as one of its earliest priorities. That early decisions are made is hugely important because, even if we were to decide today to proceed, it would take 10 to 15 years to get a new crossing.</p><p>Why should the new authority take on the task? The answer is staring us in the face. As Scott Barrie said, a new crossing is crucial to the whole of Scotland's economy. It is patently obvious that the importance of such a bridge goes beyond the interests of those who live in Fife or the Lothians.</p><p>The existing bridge is a fantastic engineering and construction feat, but we have allowed it to become abused and to be used well beyond its original design capacity. As Scott Barrie said, the capacity is going up. Originally, the capacity was envisaged to be 30,000 vehicles a day, but on average 66,000 vehicles now use it. The increased loads that the bridge is expected to take as a result of heavier lorries should be added to that figure&#8212;that would give a picture that the designers could never have imagined. The structure is tired and struggling and is dealing badly with our living life in the fast lane.</p><p>To make matters worse, traffic is expected to grow as Dunfermline expands by around a third. The carriageways on the bridge are being pounded in a way that was never envisaged and there are worrying signs that the main suspension cables may be more seriously decayed than they were originally expected to be.</p><p>The future for users of the bridge is depressing. <place-holder colnum=\"20250\"/></p><p>At best, there will be longer and longer delays as a result of vital bridge maintenance; at worst, if anything more essential needs to be done to the bridge's cables, the situation will be disastrous. The consequences of not beginning work on the crossing now are bad enough for daily users of the bridge and for the environment, but the failure to begin planning could prove to be asphyxiating not only for Fife's economy, but for the whole of Scotland's east coast.</p><p>I know that the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications and the Deputy Minister for Finance, Public Service Reform and Parliamentary Business will need to talk to experts, but work needs to begin now to get a realistic position in place to ensure that we can plan ahead. The national transport authority must consider a crossing for the Forth and develop a strategic, future-proof solution that will serve us well for the rest of the century.

Not only policemen out there, but&#8212;unusually&#8212;members of the Parliament, are getting younger. I hope that he enjoys his time here.</p><p>I begin my discussion of the bill with praise for my colleagues on the Local Government and Transport Committee. The committee's pragmatic and sometimes challenging approach to its stage 1 report meant that it not only described well the bill's strengths but&#8212;crucially&#8212;examined the bill's weaknesses and provided potential solutions. I am glad that the minister, in what might be one of his last speeches on his current portfolio, responded to some of that positively.</p><p>I am also glad that the committee broadly welcomed and endorsed the bill's general principles. However, in welcoming the bill, we should not kid ourselves on that it will produce a cure-all for the alcohol abuse that&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;exists in Scotland. The bill can have an impact on underage drinking and binge drinking but, to tackle the underlying causes of alcohol abuse, we will need to foster a significant change in our culture, as the minister said.</p><p>Legislation on its own never has led and never will lead to a change in culture. It can help to usher in an improved framework and an environment that can set the right tone but, as the minister said, a much more significant initiative on public health <place-holder colnum=\"18167\"/> and a prolonged public awareness programme, perhaps over several generations, will be needed to change how Scotland sees its use of alcohol.</p><p>Even then, given the diversity of influences on our modern society, it will be difficult, in this age of global communication, for Governments to have an impact on their populations in the ways in which they might have in the past. A bevvy culture afflicts Scottish society and that must change. Individuals must look to themselves, and Scotland as a society must examine itself, if we are to alter behaviour. We acknowledge that the bill is important and will help to improve Scotland's licensing law, but I hope that we do not raise the bar too high for what we expect it to deliver.</p><p>The national licensing forum, to which the minister referred, will be central in the plans to modernise Scotland's licensing laws, especially given the intention that it will act as the minister's group of expert advisers. As the forum will play a central and crucial role in helping to shape future licensing policy through the advice that it provides to ministers, its proposed make-up and specific role is an issue in which the Local Government and Transport Committee will rightly take an interest. Therefore, I am glad that the minister has confirmed that he intends to keep the committee informed about progress on that during the summer. That is helpful.</p><p>The role that the national licensing forum will play will be essential in winning over those who have expressed doubts about putting too much power into the hands of local licensing boards. Although it is right that licensing boards should be able to shape and decide policy based on local circumstances, it is also right that good guidance and advice will come from the centre to help to deliver a reasonable degree of consistency and equity of approach throughout Scotland.</p><p>Understandably, considerable concern was expressed about the potential increase in costs that might need to be borne by licensed business, especially given that the costs of operating the new regime are to be contained within a self-funding framework. The last thing that any business in Scotland needs is for costs that are not within its control to increase to a level that was not planned for and which cannot be absorbed. That is why the committee was right to call on the Executive to examine closely how we can keep to an absolute minimum any additional financial burdens that might be placed on the licensed trade, especially the costs of the licensing standards officers and the one-off start-up costs that will be associated with the new regime. That is also why the committee recommended that consideration should be given to introducing a variable fee scheme to take account of the different types and sizes of premises.<place-holder colnum=\"18168\"/></p><p>Many licensed premises that are at the margins of what might be considered a successful business are the very establishments that might have the most difficulty in adapting successfully to the proposed new licensing regime. That is one reason why the committee also asked the Executive to consider introducing an interim licence of up to three years. I will be interested to hear the minister's comments on that idea when he sums up. In my view, such a licence would recognise the fact that some long-standing businesses will experience difficulty in adapting their premises to comply with modern building standards. Some will need time to gather together the investment. If they are to get up to today's expectations, they will need time to support the investment levels that are required. However, the committee was right to recognise that premises that fall below expected standards cannot simply expect to continue regardless.</p><p>Similarly, we cannot allow the practice of irresponsible drinks promotions to continue unfettered. It is right that the bill seeks to control the periods during which promotions can be made available in the on-licence sector. I am glad that the committee was able to challenge the Executive over its failure&#8212;until today&#8212;to examine how best irresponsible promotions in the off-licence sector might be improved. I am happy at what the minister had to say about that, but I will be interested to see what the stage 2 amendments actually say when they are lodged.</p><p>However, we could have done more. This Parliament does not have control over issues such as advertising and labelling. Ironically, legislative competence still lies at Westminster&#8212;I think that this is what Sylvia Jackson was referring to earlier&#8212;for powers that could have a much greater impact on Scotland's drinking culture in Scotland than the powers that are currently available to us. I am glad again that the committee accepted that point in its report.</p><p>The committee also expressed its disappointment about the level and extent of the enabling powers that are provided for in the bill. It is not helpful for the Executive to take so many enabling powers in the context of producing legislation that could have been both robust and well-constructed had it been subjected to fuller parliamentary scrutiny by the committee and during the stage 1 debate before the full Parliament.</p><p>In conclusion, I say for the record that the Scottish National Party will support the bill at stage 1, but we believe that the Executive still has a bit to go to produce a bill that will deliver on expectations. There are many areas on which the committee reflected but which have still not been addressed by the minister.<place-holder colnum=\"18169\"/></p><p>In particular, the minister needs to take cognisance of the committee's criticisms of the lack of robust financial information and of the rather sketchy nature of the information that was provided.

His argument is always consistent, but it is a pity that he is consistently wrong. The report that was produced for the Scottish Executive in 2001 by the Garrad Hassan outfit clearly showed that 60,000MW of capacity in renewable energy in Scotland can be achieved, 25,000MW of which would be from wind power. The SNP has led on that issue for some time. The spare capacity that exists is the reason why the lights have stayed on when the nuclear power stations at Torness and Hunterston have gone offline, which they have done more and more in the past few years. As they have gone down, the lights have not become dimmer and the kettles have not stopped boiling. The simple fact is that we do not have the gap that people, including those in the new nuclear brigade in Scotland, are talking about. Their arguments are utterly spurious and empty and do not stand up with any credibililty.</p><p>That does not stop the myths that come from new Labour politicians. Allan Wilson recently asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"does it make sense, at the very time when climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases have shot up the political agenda, to be planning the elimination of nuclear power?\"</p><p>Of course, he conveniently forgot to mention that the very ethos of the Kyoto protocol, which deals with the reduction of greenhouse gases, is to pursue advanced and environmentally sound technologies. The idea of phasing out environmentally damaging methods of electricity production by increasing the use of other methods that are equally environmentally damaging cuts right across the ethos of the Kyoto protocol and represents neither good environmental nor sustainable practice. In short, the idea is plain daft and shows that those who support new nuclear production are not doing so for altruistic reasons. The minister can be sure that the SNP council leader&#8212;who is the local councillor&#8212;voted in favour of the wind farm at Alyth. The minister should not come here and peddle untruths about what is happening in other parts of Scotland.</p><p>According to the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, which the Government established, even wastes from the existing power stations are conditioned and packaged. As Richard Lochhead rightly pointed out, there will be 470,000m<sup>3</sup> of deadly intermediate-level and highly radioactive waste in the UK and millions of tonnes of concrete and soil materials will be contaminated by low-level waste although warnings have been issued for 30 years that we must have a nuclear repository that will deal with intermediate-level radioactive waste. There have been delays after delays and consultations after consultations simply because the Government knows well that the <place-holder colnum=\"16031\"/> argument about nuclear power is being lost in this country and that it needs time to soften up the people to accept new nuclear production in the future.</p><p>In the circumstances, I am glad that an opinion poll that the BBC issued this week clearly showed that 83 per cent of Scots do not support new nuclear production in Scotland. Members should be absolutely sure that there will be the mother of all battles if the UK Government decides either to foist new nuclear power stations on Scotland or to give us new nuclear dumps to deal with all the UK's waste.

I am grateful to him for giving the chamber the chance to debate the issue today.</p><p>I agree with much of what Scott Barrie said. Like him, I recognise that rail services for Fifers are not what they should be and that they certainly require significant improvement. However, I hope that he will forgive me for saying that the motion is somewhat simplistic. For him to have heaped all the problems and blame on to First ScotRail is simplistic, given the complex nature of the arrangements for rail services in Scotland.</p><p>I agree that rail services will improve when powers are transferred to Scottish ministers on 1 April 2006. However, the complex arrangements <place-holder colnum=\"15966\"/> for investing in and running the railways that Fifers use at the moment involve Network Rail, the Scottish Executive, the Strategic Rail Authority and even Fife Council. It can be argued that Network Rail is as much to blame for the unreliability and lack of punctuality of rail services as First ScotRail is and that the SRA is as much to blame for the lack of investment in longer platforms as the franchisee is.</p><p>As First ScotRail happens to be the public face of the railway system in Scotland, it has to take much of the heat. However, I have no doubt in my mind that, although the proposed transfer of powers will improve the situation on the rail lines in Scotland, more control will need to be exercised in future over Network Rail, which in turn will need to have a great deal more transparency in its operations.</p><p>I know from personal experience and from speaking to other regular travellers that railway users in Fife not only suffer from reliability and punctuality issues, but are affected by the cost issue, which is one of the main contentions raised with me. Some passengers perceive that the Fife line is being used to subsidise other lines in Scotland. As far as Fifers are concerned, they are being hit with a double whammy too far, because not only do they have to pay tolls to cross the bridge, but&#8212;according to some of the available figures&#8212;they may be subsidising the rest of the line. For instance, on the Edinburgh to Dunfermline line, which is of the order of 19 miles, people are paying 20p per mile to use the service, whereas on the Edinburgh to Bathgate line the cost is 17p and on the Edinburgh to North Berwick line the cost is about 15p. I hope that the minister agrees that it is time that we had price rationalisation in Scotland, so that Fifers do not become the milk cows for the rest of the network.</p><p>As far as improvements are concerned, First ScotRail took over running the services only towards the end of last year and it will take a bit of time for it to get to grips with the whole system. There was improvement in the last period on the whole of the east coast line&#8212;perhaps not in Fife&#8212;but that has slipped back badly because of the storms at the beginning of the year and because the network was closed down by Network Rail for two days. First ScotRail has had to deal with those issues.</p><p>Scott Barrie is right to identify the fact that capacity at Waverley is the big issue for Fife. That might not seem to be the case for people getting on the train at Inverkeithing, but it is the big issue that has to be sorted out to deal with the problems in the long term. However, we need to jump forward in vision terms. Scott Barrie mentioned car parking. The situation is a nightmare for the people who live in Inverkeithing. Perhaps it is time <place-holder colnum=\"15967\"/> to consider a new station to the north of Inverkeithing with dedicated parking facilities to take the heat off Inverkeithing and to improve car parking in the area. There is no reason why we cannot in the longer term have a bus-rail interchange with designated car parking facilities in the Halbeath area.

Over the next 60 years or so, Governments of all political colours and ideologies were, generally, to follow the same direction with regard to housing policy. They did so because, for the most part, the <place-holder colnum=\"15380\"/> principle of allowing local authorities to develop housing plans to suit local need and to build and manage public housing stock worked.</p><p>There have been times when local authorities and builders got it badly wrong. The quick-fix housing solution of the 1960s was a particularly good example of housing policy going badly awry. Such quick fixes, which involved an unholy mix of housing planners looking for cheap, large housing developments and builders only too willing to make a quick buck on the supply side, cost Scotland dear in both financial and social terms.</p><p>Although I welcome the Executive's recent announcements on the setting of benchmarks and planning advice on a percentage of affordable homes in all new housing developments, we should be cautious about that. There are potential dangers, with quick fixes and profit-driven motives causing similar problems to those that arose in the 1960s. I will explain. Builders across the country are already expressing concern that the figure of 25 per cent could mean that developments do not add up financially, which could lead to homes being built at the low-quality end of the market with respect to construction methods, materials and size. That cannot be allowed to happen. The 25 per cent figure must be fully consulted on to ensure that people who are looking for affordable housing do not end up in a 60s repeat of cheap, bad-quality housing.</p><p>The generally accepted way of delivering public sector housing was thrown on its head by the Thatcher Government, whose ideological hatred of councils led to local authorities being written out of the script for new public sector housing provision. The right to buy might have had its critics, but the Tories' real sin was to introduce schemes such as the 75 per cent clawback of money accruing from council house sales. Those clawback rules stopped the building of new affordable houses for rent and the modernisation of below-standard council housing in their tracks.</p><p>Where are all the homes that are fit for heroes today? We all know that a great many of them have been sold. For example, more than 50 per cent of Stirling Council's housing stock has been sold, and in rural places such as Blairdrummond and Blairlogie 100 per cent of the council houses have been sold. Even in urban Stirling, 80 per cent of the homes in the Riverside area have been sold. The unfortunate effect of that high level of sales, together with vastly increased house prices and the lack of serviceable and appropriately priced land for new affordable housing, has led to nothing less than a modern-day housing crisis.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336005", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the period following the first world war, the Government of the day rightly recognised that the way to deal with the housing challenge that faced it at that time was to provide decent public housing, built and managed by local authorities.

However, we do not accept as a sensible solution the proposal to remove from Scottish ministers the power to determine the areas in which casinos may be located.</p><p>We all know that the public debate across the UK has centred mainly on the acceptable number of large and regional casinos that the UK Government will allow. As the debate has become hotter, new Labour has scaled back its initial plans for a bigger number of large and regional casinos. The problem is that, although this week new Labour may be shrinking back from its original proposals in the face of considerable hostility before an expected general election, there is absolutely nothing to prevent it in the months and years after the election from revising upwards the number of large and regional casinos. When it inevitably does so, Scottish Executive ministers will be able to do heehaw about it, because by then they will have abdicated their responsibility.</p><p>At present, casinos can be established only in permitted areas, defined by ministers. Paragraph 19 of the Executive's consultation paper on the devolved powers in the Gambling Bill states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This power is to be discontinued\".</p><p>It also states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is proposed that in future the location, number, size and character of casinos will largely be determined by the market and guided by existing planning policy objectives.\"</p><p>If that were not bad enough, the Executive is also agreeing to allow Westminster to remove the restrictions on live entertainment in casinos. What is the basis of the Executive's argument? In paragraph 56 of its consultation document, the Executive says that the UK Government's response to the Budd report</p><p class=\"indent\">\"accepted that the restriction on live entertainment should be removed as it prevented casinos offering a more attractive environment to consumers and was one of the obstacles to the development of resort casinos.\"</p><p>At present, the power to impose restrictions comes from the Gambling Clubs (Licensing) (Scotland) Regulations 1969. Those restrictions are in place for good and solid reasons. They are intended to prevent people who want simply to turn up to watch an act or to participate in wider family entertainment from being sucked into a destructive gambling habit. Separate provisions already exist in England and Wales. Paragraph 58 of the Executive's consultation paper states:<place-holder colnum=\"13404\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Licensing Boards were not enthusiastic about the removal of the restriction on live entertainment. They felt that the current system worked well.\"</p><p>We all know that the proposals will have social and economic impacts, and Scotland spends &#163;80 per person per annum on gambling, whereas the figure in the rest of the UK is only &#163;52.</p><p>If the reasons that I have set out are not good enough for opposing the Sewel motion, I point out that when the issue was considered by the Westminster Joint Committee on the Draft Gambling Bill it took no evidence at all from the Scottish operatives whose business would be affected by the bill's provisions. Moreover, no qualitative research has been carried out into the social and economic implications of casinos in Scotland.</p><p>The reasons for rejecting this Sewel motion are compelling indeed. For example, research from the United States of America clearly shows that people under 30 on low incomes and people with less formal education are much more likely to become problem gamblers. Westminster decides and we in Scotland pay the price of additional social problems and their inevitable impact on the public purse.</p><p>I have been asking myself, \"What is the difference between Charles Kennedy and Jim Wallace? Between Malcolm Bruce and Tavish Scott? Indeed, between the Liberal group at Westminster and the Liberal group at Holyrood?\" The difference is that, at the second reading of the Gambling Bill at Westminster, the Liberals voted en bloc against it&#8212;as did 31 Labour MPs. However, here in Holyrood, the Liberals will be doing new Labour's work for it.

The route has already put &#163;150 million into the Scottish economy, with 32 per cent of the passengers being first-time visitors to Scotland. In January, Superfast Ferries was voted the best ferry overall by <em>Holiday Which?</em> and, in November, it was voted best ferry operator by the Scottish Passenger Agents Association.

However, that romantic history should not blind us to the fact that, if CalMac is to survive today, it must do much to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>We need look no further than the financial analysis in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report to see that there is a requirement for further investigation into the operation of the company. The report drew attention to staffing levels, ship repair costs, pier dues and administrative overheads. However, the company's treatment of overheads on its balance sheet&#8212;which directly affected the profit or loss of individual routes&#8212;has caused alarm bells to ring and eyebrows to be raised. That is one reason why I strongly support Fergus Ewing's amendment, which calls for further investigation into the running of the company.</p><p>I will talk about the Executive's proposals for tendering the Clyde and Hebrides services, in particular the principle that the winning operator will be the one that requires the least subsidy. I am <place-holder colnum=\"12675\"/> aware that the Executive has emphasised issues such as safety standards, quality, reliability and performance. It can give as much weight as it likes to those elements in the tendering process, but the fact is that the lowest-subsidy requirement for winning the contract will mean that cheaper labour will be employed. Wage and social costs will be cut and the move from full-time contracts and overtime payments to fixed-term contracts and part-time labour will have a direct impact not only on the workforce, but on the sometimes fragile economies of the islands that CalMac serves. That is an inevitable consequence of the tendering process.</p><p>The effect on the workforce and communities will be compounded by the fact that EU rules require the term of the contract to be limited to six years. Such a short period will mean that there is little incentive for the operator to develop and invest in the market, even though a quick look at the document that the Executive produced today suggests that it intends to make an investment alongside the vessel-owning company. Short-term contracts lead inevitably to short-term asset stripping rather than to a long-term strategy for generating revenue.</p><p>I am astonished at the Executive's self-congratulatory, complacent and weak motion. Instead of robustly putting forward Scotland's case to the European Commission and arguing that ferry services should be exempted from maritime state-aid rules, the Executive seems to have surrendered abjectly. George Lyon can spout on about other legal advice that he has received, but, in such cases, it is one legal view against another and the Executive should have properly tested the Commission's position.</p><p>As Nicol Stephen has made clear, the Executive ran up the white flag in June when it issued a press release to say that, of all people, the chef de cabinet to the European commissioner for transport and energy had ordered it to put the services out to tender. That was the head of the commissioner's private office&#8212;in other words, his private secretary. Things have reached a sorry state when a minister of the Scottish Government is telt what to do not by a European commissioner or director-general, but by a private secretary. That is another good reason why I will support Fergus Ewing's amendment and I ask all members who refuse to be telt what to do by a private secretary in Brussels to join me in the vote at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13328995", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services (Clyde and Hebrides)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A lot of romance is attached to the history of CalMac.

I welcome it, too, given that it is more than half a century since we had legislation that focused on this area.</p><p>I will concentrate most of what I say on control rooms. The FBU argues strongly and coherently that reducing the present number of fire control rooms from eight to one, two or three would be a huge mistake. I am glad that the minister said that he would bring the matter back to Parliament. He has sought to give us assurances, but given that the matter was given such prominence in the Executive's policy memorandum, he cannot be surprised by the alarm, which, it strikes me, signals a degree of nervousness about the issue.</p><p>I am not surprised that that is the case. Genuine concerns about a hidden agenda will remain until the minister states unequivocally that he does not accept the central thrust of the Mott MacDonald report. I hope that the commitment to give the matter further consideration is not simply a mechanism for parking the issue until after the general election. That would be disgraceful.</p><p>The proposal to reduce drastically the number of fire control rooms alarms me not only as an MSP but as an ordinary member of the public who one day&#8212;God forbid&#8212;might have to rely on firefighters to rescue me, my family or my home. The Executive-commissioned Mott MacDonald report, which has been widely mentioned, concludes that Scotland would be well served by a reduction in the number of fire control rooms. However, the report has fatal flaws and does not represent the robust examination of the situation on the ground that is a prerequisite if safe conclusions and recommendations are to be made. The evidence that I have gathered from my visits to the Fife fire and rescue service control centre and from written material leads me to believe passionately that the Executive must listen much more to the experiences of operators on the ground and much less to its consultants.</p><p>The Mott MacDonald proposals do not take proper account of the local knowledge of fire operators, which includes knowledge of dialects and of local and informal place names. Local knowledge can mean the difference between a fire crew getting to a road traffic accident or a fire in time to save lives and people's lives being lost. I visited the fire control room in Thornton in Fife and spoke to Margaret, one of the control room operators, who told me that an appliance had gone to investigate an incident in Whimbrel Place in Dunfermline. I am pretty familiar with Dunfermline, but I did not know where Whimbrel Place was. Margaret did not have to look at her computer screen to be able to tell me that the street is close to a cinema and alongside the <place-holder colnum=\"12014\"/> motorway. There are thousands of little pieces of vital information in every operator's head, which save seconds and, ultimately, lives. Technology can never fill the gap that is left when someone like Margaret is lost.</p><p>There is a vital issue of public confidence. A person who reports an incident needs to know that the operator understands the area about which the caller is talking. If an operator gives the impression of having no idea where an incident is located, the caller will inevitably become frustrated or angry, particularly if they are at the scene of a road accident or major fire. If we go down the road of having one, two or three control rooms for Scotland, local knowledge and public confidence will be lost and there will inevitably be a much greater risk of lives being lost. We should also remember that there are many regional accents in Scotland and consider what misunderstandings might mean in lives lost.</p><p>However, regional accents are not the nub of the Mott MacDonald report; the report is about identifying savings. A significant health warning should be attached to such savings. The report fundamentally fails to grasp what really goes on in fire control rooms outside what are regarded as core duties. Page 21 of the report lists only six non-core activities that are carried out by control room staff, and those will not disappear if the control room vanishes. That demonstrates the level of ignorance about what goes on in control rooms. I know that the minister has seen the Fife control room's evidence&#8212;it is on the Executive's website. That submission lists 21 non-core duties that fire control room staff perform. Many of those duties must be carried out 24/7, so the proposed savings are, at best, illusory.</p><p>If local fire control rooms close, who will carry out the administration, monitoring, staffing, training, maintenance, health and safety and statistical recording tasks that control room staff currently undertake? The Fife fire control room's submission says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Whilst it might appear that Best Value could be achieved by merging Fire Controls ... this would totally ignore many of the core functions of a Fire Control ... and misunderstand the back up and support roles which are vital to the operation of an effective and efficient Fire and Rescue Service.\"</p><p>Change can be essential and can lead to improvement, but change for change's sake is never good.</p><p>Will the minister give an assurance on the specific nature of the further consideration that he will give to the issue and on what the consultation process will involve? What will the timescale be? Will the consultation take place before the general election? Will the outcome of the consultation be the subject of a full debate in Parliament, so that <place-holder colnum=\"12015\"/> all members can take part in the decision? I want to understand much better what the minister meant when he said that he would come back to the Parliament \"through the appropriate mechanism\".</p><p>I ask the minister not to go down the road that I have described. That would be a bad, bad idea.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327331", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We all know that we live in a fast-changing world, and even organisations such as the FBU are realistic enough to realise that change in the fire service is inevitable.

Call-boxes provide a service that is valued by the many people who still have no land-line or access to a mobile phone. The service is valued by those who happen to live in an area that mobile-phone network operators do not serve and by those who choose for health reasons not to have a mobile phone. The service is valued by tourists, by those who might find themselves in an emergency and by the elderly in particular. All those reasons have been submitted to me by various community councils that want the public call-boxes in their communities to be retained.</p><p>However, as we enter the 21<sup>st</sup> century, a huge increase in mobile phone ownership has led to a culture change in the communication world and means that far fewer people use public call-boxes. A review of the number of call-boxes was as inevitable as the fact that night follows day. However, people have the right to expect any review process to be robust and any consultation process to reach the communities that are to be affected.</p><p>We have been told that in the past three years alone, the number of calls that are made from BT's public call-boxes has almost halved and that revenue has plummeted by about 41 per cent. Scotland has 6,113 boxes, of which a stubborn 3,800 are not in a position to pay their way. It is therefore clear that BT has a difficult balancing act to perform. It is understandable that, as a public limited company, it wants to ensure that its <place-holder colnum=\"10966\"/> shareholders' interests are upheld but, at the same time, it is required to discharge its universal service obligations as laid down by the regulator.</p><p>In Scotland, 1,030 non-profit-making call-boxes that attract less than &#163;200 per annum have been targeted for removal, and 165 of them are in Mid Scotland and Fife. By far the majority of the call-boxes that are targeted for removal are in rural areas; the cities and larger conurbations fare much less badly.</p><p>There is a real danger of the process leading to discrimination against rural communities. To be fair, BT has told us that if a community objects to the removal of a call-box it will not proceed, but the reality is that the Office of Communications regulations do not allow BT to proceed with removal if it has received a simple written representation with reasons for objection. That shows that the Ofcom regulations are very weak; they place no requirement on BT or the other providers to construct a reasonable, criteria-based solution by which call-boxes can be removed.</p><p>To be fair to BT again, it has said that it is intent on retaining 850 call-boxes on the ground of social need. However, there is a fatal flaw in BT's procedures. If one does not establish clear and objective criteria for removing a public call-box where there has been no objection because the community or persons affected have been unaware, it is inevitable that unsafe decisions to remove call-boxes will be arrived at. That is one of the main reasons why the motion states that BT should \"reconsider its plans\".</p><p>In addition to the lack of clear criteria, BT's consultation process has not been as robust as it should have been. I say that because, in July 2003, Ofcom issued a new direction that clearly laid down the requirements that BT must follow if a proposal to remove a call-box is being considered. BT is required to give community councils notice of a proposal to remove a call-box and, when all reasonable efforts to do that have failed, BT can ask the local planning authority to give such notice. BT has chosen to use the route of consulting Scotland's community councils through the planning authority&#8212;I presume that it has done so on the basis that it thinks that it has made reasonable efforts directly to consult community councils. If that is its argument, I would dispute whether all reasonable efforts have indeed been made. I simply do not believe for one moment that an organisation of the scale and with the resources available to BT cannot make direct contact with the community councils that will be affected by the potential removal of call-boxes. If I, as an MSP with limited resources at my disposal, can get to a large chunk of Mid Scotland and Fife community councils, surely BT can manage to consult directly community councils in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"10967\"/></p><p>Some people might ask why the local authority is not relied on to do that job for BT. No matter how much we love oor cooncils, we all know that some are good at consultation, but that some are quite dreadful. In such circumstances, BT should surely make much greater attempts to consult community councils directly.</p><p>I would like members to hear the words of a couple of community councils that responded to BT. One community council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are ... deeply concerned that your version of 'consultation' appears to have been no more than a Notice displayed on the kiosk. In all previous exercises by yourselves of this description, we have been consulted as a COMMUNITY COUNCIL (even where the kiosks were not within our area). We suggest that your inadequate consultative procedure, should lead you to re-launch this current exercise.\"</p><p>Another community council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We again have to raise our concerns over BT's very poor local consultation procedures ... BT are obliged to contact local authorities down to Parish or Community Council level. Why has this not happened? ... Why is the first intimation ... beyond reports of notices in the boxes, via an MSP?\"</p><p>In considering the motion that is before the Parliament, I ask the minister to take on board the points that I have made, to support my motion and to ask BT to reconsider its plans and to start the consultation process again so that we can get directly to all the communities that are affected and so that no unsafe decisions are taken.</p><p>I thank the 29 MSPs who signed my motion.</p>", "hdate": "2004-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13324691", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Telephone Boxes (Closures)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the 20 th century, the red public call-box established itself as a much-cherished and valued part of our street scene.

I say that not to criticise the Executive, but to congratulate it; it has at last started us down the road to securing the future of the seas that surround Scotland for the generations that will follow us. The journey will not be easy; tough decisions will have to be made and you can bet your boots that someone will be prepared to put the boot in and criticise us if we are thought to be having an impact on their unsustainable practices. If that criticism does not arise, whatever strategy is deployed, whatever <place-holder colnum=\"8515\"/> policy is put in place and whatever action plan is implemented, today's debate on securing the future of the seas will, in effect, be a waste of time, because the debate should be controversial, provocative and far reaching. I say that because the future health of Scotland's marine environment will say everything about who we are and how much we care for the planet on which we live. The seas that surround us are of incalculable worth economically, socially and spiritually.</p><p>What do we really know about the value of the seas? If we are honest with ourselves, the answer is, \"Not very much\"; we certainly know a great deal less than we should. The truth is that we live in dreadful ignorance of what could be Scotland's number 1 ecological and economic asset. Our knowledge of the treasures of the sea, its complex ecosystem and how it works is at about the same level as was our knowledge of terrestrial forests at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. That is why it was so important for the minister to set up the marine sub-group and to establish it within the framework of the sustainable marine environment initiative. The group has begun the job of filling the huge knowledge gap that exists&#8212;it is undertaking a project that is aimed at examining the nature, scale and potential of the social, economic and environmental resources in Scottish waters. That work must continue.</p><p>The journey along the road to creating a sustainable marine environment for Scotland's territorial waters must be undertaken here, as no one else can do that for us. However, we cannot achieve our goals unless action is also taken on a wider, international front. That is why the work that the European Union initiated on integrated coastal zone management between 1996 and 1999 was so important. It helped to provide technical information about sustainable coastal zone management and started to stimulate a debate about how best to manage coastal zones, which led to the laying down of a requirement for member states to develop and produce national strategies by 2006.

The purpose of the committee's deliberations on the topic was to ensure that the process could be smoothed out with regard to the number of procedural motions required. We recognised that the timetabling of emergency bills could be controversial, so we took the opportunity to ensure that motions could be open to amendment and debate. That was the right decision. We believe that the changes that are laid out in the annex to the committee's report will achieve our objective, and we recommend that the Parliament support them.</p><p>I turn now to ordinary question time. There is a general view in the chamber that question time, as currently structured&#8212;and, in particular, since it became detached from First Minister's question time&#8212;has not proved to be as worthwhile an experience as it might have been, for either parliamentarians or members of the public. It has <place-holder colnum=\"5788\"/> evolved into a process of exchanging information, with little real atmosphere or bite. There is little or no opportunity to explore any particular issue in depth with a minister. That is why I hope that a move to thematic questions&#8212;although it would be more accurate to call them department-based questions&#8212;will be of greater worth. In the meantime, it is right that we continue to have a 20-minute slot to deal with topical issues that a member may raise. That will allow members to put a minister under greater scrutiny and will lead to a more forensic style of questions.</p><p>The proof of that particular pudding will be in the eating. That is why it is important that we have a trial period. It will be down to members to make oral question time much more relevant and to add value to the parliamentary week. It was right for the Procedures Committee to decide that we should continue to have an element of topicality so that members continue to have the opportunity of raising important and perhaps pressing constituency questions.</p><p>I said earlier that oral question time has had less value since becoming detached from First Minister's question time. I believe that that is true, but I also believe that&#8212;at least for the time being&#8212;we cannot allow oral question time and First Minister's question time to run together. Let me explain why I believe that, building on what Iain Smith said.</p><p>If oral questions are to be a success in their own right and are to bring real value to the parliamentary week, they must be able to stand on their own merits and not be propped up by First Minister's question time. That was what happened with the previous arrangement. It will be fatal to question time if it cannot show that it has its own value and if it has to rely on First Minister's question time for its oxygen. That is the main reason why I believe that the committee was correct to decide, for now, to keep oral question time apart from First Minister's question time. If, at the end of the trial period, oral question time has shown that it cannot stand on its own merits, that will be the time to re-examine whether reconnecting it with First Minister's question time would improve the parliamentary week.</p><p>At the end of the trial period, we will have to reconsider the impact of the 12 o'clock start for First Minister's question time on participation rates&#8212;in respect of attendance in the public gallery and of media exposure. The figures from \"Holyrood Live\" show that the number of people who watch First Minister's question time has dropped remarkably. However, some of the statistics from broadcasting organisations were suspect, to say the least. The disparity in the figures&#8212;7,000 one week and 36,000 the next&#8212;is so large that there must be question marks over <place-holder colnum=\"5789\"/> their accuracy. We must look into that in more depth, because I do not believe that the information that we have received is robust enough. When neither the quality of information, nor the quantity, is available, grounds for making an unsafe decision exist. The Tories&#8212;and Jamie McGrigor in particular&#8212;pressed hard on this issue; but I say to Jamie that we must consider more than just \"Holyrood Live\".

I wish them well this evening&#8212;sorry to all the Celtic fans here. Supporters of clubs that are in the situation in which Dunfermline Athletic finds itself do not feel very good, and there are many fans who feel like that in this country today.</p><p>I thank everyone who has taken part in today's debate on Scottish football. We may have our individual views on how the current crisis in the professional game has been arrived at&#8212;that is as inevitable as it is predictable&#8212;but I hoped that today's debate would allow us to achieve some sort of common understanding of the scale of the challenge that is faced and a shared view of some of the strategies and solutions that will need to be developed for Scottish football to survive in the short term and prosper and bloom in the longer term. From that perspective, the debate has been successful. We have recognised the importance of the economic, social and health impacts of football in Scotland, right through from the grass roots to the national team. We have also recognised that a soft landing for troubled clubs through public funding is not a realistic prospect; that structural change is an absolute essential to allow a much <place-holder colnum=\"5721\"/> more integrated approach to be taken in the governing of the game in Scotland; and that football clubs and their supporters must work together to harness investment in the clubs at both an emotional level and a financial level.</p><p>I hope that we have sent a message to lovers of football, and to those who are employed or involved in the game at whatever level, that we in the Scottish Parliament care about the future of the people's game. The phrase \"the people's game\" is a powerful and well-used description of the game. Certainly, at youth football level&#8212;not just in the schools&#8212;and for all the individuals throughout the country who are involved in the game, that description still rings true. Up and down the country, there is a band of dedicated volunteers who organise youth football, whose contribution to the sporting and social life of Scotland is not recognised often enough. We should pay tribute to them, as they are keeping alive the tradition and image of the people's game. In their hands lies the success or otherwise of the game of football in Scotland. They are the ones who require to be supported and nurtured if we are to breathe new life into the professional game and bring greater success to our national teams. That will not happen overnight and, as Kenny MacAskill said, it has got to start from the bottom and work up. In short, we have got to get the basics right and the fundamentals sorted.</p><p>Can we still call the game at the top level&#8212;the professional level&#8212;the people's game? At the very top, some players are paid more in a day than some people earn in a year. Dennis Canavan and Colin Fox alluded to that. Even in provincial clubs in Scotland, top players earn more in a month than the average person earns in a year. Many clubs have moved away from being clubs in the traditional sense. More and more, they are structured as companies that come under various forms of ownership. The professional game has moved a long way from being the people's game.</p><p>However, a consistent factor in football is the way in which the fans continue to show a long-term commitment to the clubs that they support&#8212;although perhaps not in the same numbers as in the past. That shows that, although the way in which the professional game is run may change, the game means so much to the fans that they will put up with an awful lot. I just hope that the current crisis does not weaken the connection between the clubs and their communities to such an extent that more famous names will be lost to the Scottish professional scene.</p><p>It is true that the economic base of Scottish football has changed and that running a football club is complex, but that cannot excuse clubs for consistently spending more than they earn and running up a combined debt of &#163;144 million, <place-holder colnum=\"5722\"/> according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. In its report, \"The PricewaterhouseCoopers Financial Review of Scottish Football - Season 2001/02\", PricewaterhouseCoopers stated that five clubs&#8212;not including Motherwell, as John Swinburne will know&#8212;were technically insolvent. Those were Dundee, Dunfermline, Hearts, Hibs and Livingston. The clubs in a net asset position all saw their positions worsen due to poor results. As members have said, that has resulted in Motherwell, Dundee and Livingston going into administration because they have not been able to service their debts. How many more will follow?</p><p>The choice for some clubs is either to go into administration or to take drastic but inevitable action to force down costs. That has an impact on everyone who is employed by the clubs. That is why our motion states that the Parliament</p><p class=\"indent\">\"sympathises with the backroom and playing staff of those clubs worst affected\".</p><p>I am surprised that the SSP in particular wanted those words to be removed.</p><p>Why has it taken so long for experienced businessmen to act and for the banks to intervene? That question puzzles me. As others have said, perhaps the reason is simply that football is still the people's game and the businessmen and banks are as wrapped up in its emotion and tradition as the ordinary fans are. If that has been the case, I hope that that heady cocktail does not prove too potent for the game to absorb.</p><p>I am sure that many club chairmen would cite a variety of reasons&#8212;some of which we have heard today&#8212;for the perilous state of the game. One reason is the costs associated with the Taylor report. As an individual, I still think that all-seater stadiums were not entirely necessary. Some room should have been made for terracing to allow mass spectator sport at a cheaper level for the fans. Other reasons include the Bosman ruling, the failure of the TV deals and the dash to keep ahead by buying success through inflated wages. There have also been falling attendances, which were in part caused by the product being overpriced for fans. Another reason is the clubs' overexposure to borrowing.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the professional game must change drastically if it is to survive. Some traditions may have to be left behind. I finish by quoting a recent article by the University of Stirling's Steven Morrow, who was mentioned earlier. I think that he said it all when he wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In the current situation there is little merit in blind defence of history or tradition if the consequence is the disappearance of the very thing you are trying to save.\"</p><p>I encourage all members to support the motion at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311092", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Football"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a season-ticket holder and a lifelong supporter of Dunfermline Athletic.

To be frank, I am amazed at the attitude with which Sylvia Jackson approached the debate&#8212;she spent most of her time attacking Brian and the Tories and spent very little time prosecuting the case on behalf of the pupils who attend Holy Trinity school and their parents.</p><p>Brian Monteith has provided us with the opportunity to bring to the Executive's attention some of the real concerns that exist in respect of the robustness of the decision that has been reached by Stirling Council to close Holy Trinity school: I believe that the case to close the school has not been made by Stirling Council. The minister should look extremely closely at a number of aspects before an irrevocable and unsafe decision to close the school is made.</p><p>Shortly after the start of the consultation period, I met a group of concerned parents of pupils at the school. It was clear from the meeting that the parents were able to put a case for keeping the school open that was clear headed and which was not based on a romantic attachment to a lost cause.</p><p>The easy option at that stage would have been to whip up emotions through the local press in an attempt to gain maximum political advantage, but I say to Sylvia Jackson that I think that the case for keeping the school open is too important to play politics with. I therefore wrote to the council to respond to its consultation process, in a serious <place-holder colnum=\"4569\"/> attempt to explain in what respects I thought that its proposals for closure were unsafe. In the letter, I asked specific questions of the council about its decision-making process. Unfortunately, I have received no response&#8212;perhaps that is no surprise.</p><p>I have also since written to the Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, to explain where I think that the decision that has been reached by the council is unsafe, and to state that the school should remain open.</p><p>The council's decision has been partly, but substantially, based on the cost of current spend per pupil at the school. With only 21 pupils attending the school&#8212;according to the council's records at the time&#8212;the council's own figures show that the current spend per pupil stands at &#163;7,647. However, that masks the reality of the situation because it does not show how pupil attendance at the school has been managed down to enable the picture of a high-cost school to be painted. Let me explain what I mean by that. In 1999, the number of pupils was 53, but every year since then pupil numbers have been allowed to fall. If 53 pupils were attending the school today the cost per pupil would be only &#163;2,750&#8212;that figure is lower than the average spend per pupil across the Stirling Council area.</p><p>The denominational issue is a catch-22 situation. I think that the reality is that Hoy Trinity is not a denominational school, but that begins to undermine some of the arguments for keeping it open. The council's rationale for the falling number of pupils is the status of Holy Trinity as an Episcopalian school. That status has allowed the council to avoid allocating it its own catchment area, and placements there are not offered to parents who are looking for first-time places for their children. If a real desire existed within the council to continue operation of the school, what prevented it from approaching the Episcopal Church authorities to have the school's denominational status removed? I cannot imagine for one moment that the church would have created any barriers if removal of denominational status would have meant that the school would continue in existence.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308319", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School (Closure)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I sincerely congratulate Brian Monteith on securing the debate this evening.

The estimated numbers of red deer in woodland, according to the report, is 100,000. That provides a conservative estimated total of 400,000. It is conservative, because the report says that the true figure is likely to be much closer to 454,000. The numbers of red deer alone have doubled since 1974, when the figure stood at 200,000.

It will be interesting to discover whether the Executive is intent on using that time to make a statement of significance to the people of Scotland. I hope that that is the case and if it is, we will be the first to say, \"Well done, but about time too.\" During the week after the recess, there is time in the morning and afternoon of Thursday 8 January that has not been allocated. The SNP wants to see the Parliament debate the cumulative effect of the many changes that are taking place in the national health service in Scotland, their impact on services and whether the Executive has adopted and put in place an appropriate strategic overview. The changes include the new deal for junior doctors, new consultants' contracts, new general practitioners' contracts, the European working time directive, acute service reviews and a framework for maternity services. All those changes will have an impact on staffing levels and, in particular, on the amount of time that doctors can spend with patients.</p><p>There are real fears about potential rationing of services, with health care professionals making decisions on what they can do with the increasingly limited services at their disposal, rather than doing what is best for the patient. Those fears are compounded by concerns over <place-holder colnum=\"4118\"/> the impact of additional drugs costs. There are also worries that centralisation, driven by recruitment needs, will lead to black holes as far as the provision of health services is concerned, with patients having to travel further and further to access services, leading inevitably to a postcode lottery of care services.</p><p>Equality of access to services was supposed to be a central plank of the Executive's ethos on the health service. That ethos is in severe danger of being undermined because no obvious strategic overview is being undertaken to deal with it.</p><p>We had a motionless debate in September on rising to the challenge of improving Scotland's health, but we need a serious national debate, led by the Parliament, on where our health service is going.</p><p>In <em>The Herald</em> on Monday, the first paragraph said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Patients in almost every region of Scotland are facing longer journeys for treatment as new laws on doctors and consultants' working hours shut hospital services.\"</p><p>A Labour MSP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are creating a crisis all over Scotland.\"</p><p>Duncan McNeil, who is a member of the Health Committee, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are not dealing with a series of local difficulties here.

Had we had a debate on the marine environment, I am sure that more members would have attended and spoken, although I understand the importance of this debate for certain parts of Scotland, as outlined by Murray Tosh.</p><p>I will spend some of my time examining the impact that some of the nuclear establishments in Scotland have through what they discharge into the marine environment. Sarah Boyack was right to say that we need to tackle some of the issues at source. We certainly need to tackle the nuclear issues at source. I will start with the impact of the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd facility at Chapelcross. BNFL operates four Magnox reactors at Chapelcross. Since 1980, a processing plant that produces tritium has also operated on that site. Gaseous wastes from the site are discharged into the local environment and liquid radioactive waste is discharged into the Solway firth.</p><p>Recent habitat surveys have confirmed that local people who have large intakes of local seafood are exposed to risks from radioactivity. In addition, wild fowlers and fishermen who tend stake nets are exposed to external radiation. The presence of caesium 137 from Chapelcross in geese that feed on the salt marshes is also marine derived. However, none of that shows up in the figures that we are dealing with today in respect of the designation of beaches.</p><p>Mark Ruskell has already talked about the shame of Dounreay. From the beginning of its life, it has been an ugly scar on the environment of Scotland. Not only has the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority establishment been contributing to environmental degradation and harming public health for decades, so has the adjoining Ministry of Defence Vulcan plant. It has been discharging liquid radioactive waste into the sea. The on-going shame of the finds of radioactive particles at Sandside beach demonstrate well the dangers of radioactive waste to Scotland's marine life, beaches and human life. That should be a factor in whether our beaches are designated as being safe.</p><p>Our nuclear power stations also discharge harmful radioactive waste into the marine environment. There are problems at the Holy Loch and at Faslane and Coulport, where those discharges are on-going. As far as the Forth estuary is concerned, there may be clean beaches that are beginning to get the blue flag but, if 27 submarines are cut up at Rosyth, that will lead to the discharge of even more radioactive waste into the Forth until 2025. The picture would be completely different if we included those issues in <place-holder colnum=\"4017\"/> consideration of whether the beaches are clean. We must do what we can to ensure that that work does not happen at Rosyth.

The annual negotiations on the common fisheries policy are taking place, as they do every year.

Given that energy issues are crucial to Scotland's economy, moves towards European Union rules over oil and gas are vital to Scotland's interests. The draft constitution's provisions on nuclear energy, which would continue the privileged position of nuclear energy within EU markets, would have a disproportionate impact on the Scottish energy market.

Labour Party members throughout the country are campaigning against wind farms just as SNP members are doing. Scotland has a problem and <place-holder colnum=\"3120\"/> no one can say that the problem does not exist. The problem exists because we do not have a proactive enough planning process. We need one that directs local authorities and does not give them woolly guidelines. The developer-led proposals that are coming through at present are creating problems to such a degree that we have eight applications for every one that is successful. That is no way to run things. We should have a much more directed process, one that helps communities and developers to have much more certainty about what is going to be successful. That is how we could start to deal with the problem.</p><p>The conflict that has happened is completely unnecessary. Had the guidelines been properly drawn up in the beginning we might not be in the situation that we find ourselves today. Why are we in that situation? If all our potential for wind was reached, only 2 per cent of Scotland would be used. Surely to goodness we can come to a solution that allows 2 per cent of Scotland's landmass to be used to reach our potential? We need to get the planning framework right.</p><p>What other factors are leading to problems? We have a problem with the grid that is leading to a concentration of resources in particular areas of Scotland, particularly down the east coast. The grid is not satisfactory in the very place that it should be, which is on the west coast, where we get most of the wind. Another concentration factor is caused by the Ministry of Defence which blankets parts of Scotland that cannot be used. The effect of that is to push people in a particular direction, which causes further concentration. SNH also causes concentration because it too blankets areas of Scotland and says that developers can go to only certain parts of Scotland. We are losing the 2 per cent&#8212;more and more of it is disappearing.</p><p>Another problem is the claim that is made by local authorities about lack of resources. I do not know whether the claim is true, but I am not entirely convinced by the argument. If we are not building as many houses as we used to and if fewer applications for industrial developments are coming through because the economy is not growing as fast as it can, surely local authorities should be doing something about that. One argument suggests that local authorities should be directed to put enough planners in place&#8212;they should have the resources to make this work.</p><p>Equally, at the moment, lots of consultants are running all over Scotland in an attempt to make a fast buck. The race for those fast bucks is also causing problems.

In any case, the people of Scotland rightly expect that their Parliament will express a view on issues of importance to Scotland, whether or not they are reserved.</p><p>There are approximately 360 nuclear-powered submarines in the world today. Russia has 48, the United States of America has 72 and there are numerous other countries with such submarines. Many of those countries are struggling to get to grips with how to dispose of them. I am concerned that whatever site deals with the United Kingdom's redundant submarines, it has the potential to become a world dump for that type of work.</p><p>The UK has 27 submarines. Approval was given in 2001 for three submarines to be built and three more are planned, subject to ministerial approval. Under current known plans, therefore, the UK will have 33 submarines. Seven are currently afloat at Rosyth and four at Devonport. Afloat storage uses the structure of the submarine and its reactor compartment to contain the radioactive waste and to shield radiation.</p><p>Prior to 1998, the Ministry of Defence's policy was to maintain its submarines and store them afloat for up to 30 years, with the capacity to go well beyond that if required. Incredibly, however, the MOD failed to recognise that by 2012 there would be no space left to store submarines afloat. In addition, there is continuing uncertainty because the establishment of a national waste repository is no closer. The best estimate is that it will be created in 2040.<place-holder colnum=\"2934\"/></p><p>Those factors, together with criticism from the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee that the MOD had no policy, led in 1998 to ministerial approval for finding an alternative to the afloat storage strategy. Thus was born project ISOLUS&#8212;interim storage of laid-up submarines. It beggars belief that the UK commissioned its first nuclear-powered submarine in 1960, but it took another 38 years for the authorities to start looking for a method to dispose of them.</p><p>When those submarines, which weigh about 8,000 tonnes, are no longer useful their highly radioactive fuel is removed and transported to Sellafield. The highly radioactive reactor compartment is left behind. That compartment is approximately the size of two double-decker buses, has a diameter of 10m and weighs about 750 tonnes. The MOD proposes to award a contract for storage of the reactor compartments for a period of 30 years.

I now come to address Jackie Baillie's point.</p><p>In June 1993, Malcolm Rifkind, the then Tory Secretary of State for Defence, awarded all future work on nuclear sub refitting to Devonport. Additionally, at that time, as part of the dockyard sale agreement, it was clearly stipulated that Rosyth was precluded from having any further submarines berth there until after it had ceased nuclear refitting work in 2000. That dockyard sale agreement was the only obstacle that prevented even more nuclear hulks being stored at Rosyth.</p><p>Clearly, there exists compelling evidence&#8212;contractual and financial&#8212;that the UK Government's first choice for all submarine work is Devonport. To the extent that the dockyard sale agreement protected Devonport from competition from Rosyth, it is clear that Devonport is the Government's choice. If it was good enough in 1993 for Devonport to get all the benefits, why should the Scotland of today be expected to bear all the risks?</p><p>I have questions for the minister. First, does he acknowledge the potential conflict in a Government policy that promotes Rosyth as an entry point for tourists from continental Europe, while it is being considered as a graveyard for nuclear-powered submarines?</p><p>Secondly, does he support the view that Devonport should deal with the nuclear hulks, and that the seven submarines that are currently at Rosyth should be moved to Devonport for final disposal? There are no safety concerns with that proposal. Because of the withdrawal of the Nigg option today, Devonport Management Ltd has accepted that it can move the submarines from Rosyth to Devonport safely. That is where those submarines should go. I hope that the minister shares that view.</p><p>Thirdly, will the minister consider using all the powers that are available to him through SEPA? SEPA has extensive powers in this area because it can be involved in the planning process. The disposal facility will need a waste management licence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and the management and disposal of any radioactive waste that arises will require separate authorisation under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. Will the minister consider using the powers that are available to him through SEPA, and the planning powers of councils, to block any sites in Scotland from being associated with work on those submarines?</p><p>Scotland expects the minister to do what is right.

There will always be a continuing need for change and we must embrace that. Without change, we will never improve ways of operating Parliament; without change and improvement, we will stand still and stagnate.</p><p>We cannot allow ourselves to hesitate over pilots, experimentation or trial periods for how Parliament goes about its business. Sometimes we will find a change that works to our advantage. On other occasions, the change may produce a negative reaction. So what? The key thing is that we get it right and produce solutions that work both for us and for the Parliament. However, any changes must also work for those who are at the interface between the Parliament and the people&#8212;those who facilitate the successful working of this place. That includes the wider parliamentary authorities but, crucially, it also includes the media.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to members that the SNP, like 94 per cent of those who responded to the Procedures Committee's questionnaire, fully supports the extension of First Minister's question time from 20 to 30 minutes. Until I read the business bulletin this morning, I thought that that proposal had general support across all the parties. Unfortunately, there is also no consensus on when First Minister's question time should start. That is a finely balanced argument. Good points can be made for why a 12 noon start or a 2 pm start would be advantageous. As we have a trial period until the end of the year, we can assess the success or otherwise of the new starting time, so that makes the choice between noon and 2 pm even more academic. However, a choice will have to be made, because of the amendments before us today.</p><p>What are the balancing factors and the issues that are to be weighed up? On access and participation, we have heard the minister saying that the move to 12 noon will be seen as beneficial. Because there will be two question times on a Thursday, more groups of school pupils <place-holder colnum=\"1309\"/> will be able to experience question time. Moreover, the earlier finishing time should avoid pupils having to leave halfway through question time. I am sure that we have all heard the rustling as pupils pick up their bags and leave to catch their buses. That is probably a good argument for changing to 12 o'clock.</p><p>Of course, as Jamie McGrigor said, the choice of start time will have the biggest impact on the broadcasting media. Some argue that the audience will follow First Minister's questions to noon, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. What we know for certain is that at least 20 minutes will be lost from Scottish Parliament broadcasting time on a Thursday. I understand that BBC coverage of First Minister's question time and other parliamentary business will cease at 12.30 with no prospect of an opt-out from the business programme \"Working Lunch\". That raises questions about time for analysis and consideration. Moreover, there is not much prospect of time being made available for question time later in the afternoon, because of understandable cost factors for the BBC. That makes 12 noon much less attractive and puts the balance of the argument in favour of a start around 2 pm.</p><p>Whatever we finally decide to do, a thorough analysis and examination of the trial period is essential. The final decision after the trial must not be taken lightly for reasons of perceived political advantage; it must be taken objectively on what is considered to be best for the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13300051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standing Orders (Changes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish National Party welcomes this debate on how Parliament goes about organising an important part of its business and we look forward to many more such debates in future.

What more could have been done to keep costs down? Has the contractor acted fairly and have the advisers given proper information and done their job properly? Many, many questions need answered before Scotland can move on and begin to put all this behind it.

I am seeking honesty and dignity for local authorities. On McCrone, we are already receiving reports that councils are having problems in supporting the classroom assistants. On recycling, there are capital investment and infrastructure problems. Particular problems for the elderly are arising in the delivery of community care. Energy efficiency measures, which are a prime target for spending to save, are suffering from problems to do with renovating old buildings and dealing with old plant.</p><p>On affordable housing, in places where there is little housing stock debt, such as East Lothian, <place-holder colnum=\"17953\"/> councils do not want to transfer their houses. For such councils, stock transfer is a bureaucratic problem that consumes resources. They need more section 94 consents, and that is what they are calling for.</p><p>I want to deal with a specific issue that affects roads. There is a problem in rural Scotland and in Stirling in particular. The present formula is based on the amount of miles of road, and the money is applied in each area according to that formula. However, we require a formula that is based on need, which would enable authorities to obtain the right amount of money and to focus it on the right areas.</p><p>Richard Simpson mentioned the benefits of PFI in schools and how it made up for years of neglect. He spoke about the things that Labour is supposed to have done for Clackmannanshire. It is interesting that the SNP's \"Connecting Clackmannanshire\" manifesto for the 1998 council elections put roads, railways and bridges at the top of the list, and all of them have been delivered since Clackmannanshire got an SNP council. I applaud that council's approach to PFI. If it wants to put more money into schools rather than into the pockets of profiteers, I say, \"Good on them.\" I have referred previously to the problem of the level of increase in council tax in the Stirling Council area. Labour tells people on the street that councils are getting millions of pounds in extra resources, but the result is that Labour councils get hammered for large council tax increases.</p><p>If there was an honest debate and an acceptance that the new burdens are not always fully covered by settlements from Government, the council tax payer might just be able to have a greater degree of faith in local government.

After all, organic farming is an ecological production system that promotes and enhances biodiversity and relies on minimal off-farm inputs from chemical&#8212;often synthetic&#8212;pesticides and fertilisers. Organic farming can help to keep our air, soil and water as well as our food supply free of potentially toxic chemicals.</p><p>It is obvious that less evidence is available as to the benefits for human health. Can anyone doubt, however, that using fewer synthetic chemicals and antibiotics and replacing them with naturally derived wastes and products can be anything but good for the health of the nation?</p><p>If we are agreed that organic farming is good for the environment and for human health, the question arises how best to grow the sector while ensuring that the consumer and the market are in sync. Crucially, how can we ensure that farmers are in a position to convert to organic farming with a reasonable degree of certainty about future income and profit levels? Obviously, the coming reform of the common agricultural policy could prove a distinct advantage if things are played right in that respect. However, as the minister said, most farmers will make a judgment on whether to convert to organic farming by considering the bottom line on the balance sheet. There may be a marked increase in the amount of land in organic production only when the incentives and market conditions are in place from which the majority of hard-headed farmers can see financial benefits.</p><p>On the bill's specific requirements, the setting of the arbitrary target of 20 per cent has caused most concern&#8212;I think that Robin Harper recognises that.

Countries such as Austria and Denmark have led the way in converting to organic farming. Long ago, they recognised that targets, action plans and incentives on their own would not result in the changes that are required.

Such a scheme is required for Scottish products, in particular for those that are sold close to their markets. That would give a big boost to organics.

Only if we place a duty on ministers to prepare and lay before the Parliament a national strategy for sustainable flood management will a strategic, focused and cohesive approach be achievable.</p><p>On 30 October 2002, Sarah Boyack stated in the chamber:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The bill should set the framework for a coherent overview on flood prevention and management.\"</p><p>Des McNulty stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I agree with some of Bruce Crawford's comments about flooding; for example, that we must have co-ordinated flood management systems. Indeed, we might well have to come up with a national flooding strategy\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2002-10-30.14736.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 30 October 2002; c 14740, 14736-14737.]</citation></p><p>Why did they support the concept of a national approach? They are concerned about the national overview and the fact that flood management will continue to be over-reliant on concrete flood defences and flood warnings.</p><p>The River Kelvin, for example, has its own flood protection system, but East Dunbartonshire Council has not consulted Glasgow City Council on areas where the river runs through Glasgow. That proves that there must be much more strategic thinking.</p><p>The minister used examples that involve grant schemes being run by local authorities. He misses the point that we should manage the process from the top, as well as use the bottom-up approach that is taken in the bill. If we are to avoid misery for householders and businesses, a much more proactive approach is needed. As WWF Scotland stated in its report \"Turning the Tide on Flooding\" in November 2002:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"With no national overview in Scotland, flood management is reduced to over-reliance on concrete defences and flood warnings.\"<place-holder colnum=\"17521\"/></p><p>WWF Scotland supports a national strategy because it recognises that only ministers have their hands on the levers of change that can make a substantial improvement to how Scotland deals with flooding. Only ministers can provide the policy overview that is required in agriculture, forestry, planning and industrial activity. Only ministers can effect real policy changes on land use through the issue of national planning guidelines. Only ministers can make the required changes to national policy in an integrated and cohesive manner and provide financial incentives to encourage the change from a hard, concrete approach to a softer, flood alleviation approach that works with flood plains and does not straitjacket them.</p><p>If ever there were an example of why that strategy is required, it can be seen in today's Executive press release in the name of Ross Finnie. The second last paragraph states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By incorporating a provision on sustainable flood management, we are reinforcing the existing approach whereby local authorities consider flood alleviation\".</p><p>I do not think that the existing approach has worked very successfully.</p><p>The bill should be about people as much as about the environment. We must do all that we can to ensure that the miseries and hardships that are experienced by human beings as a result of flooding occurrences are kept to a minimum. New responsibilities are placed on SEPA, local authorities and others&#8212;that is proper&#8212;but Scottish ministers, as the strategic policy makers, should be required by statute to develop a national flooding strategy, to provide the leadership to drive forward the changes in national policy and to provide the funding mechanisms that are required.</p><p>The minister has made it plain that he will not accept amendment 29. I understand from the minister's comments that the ad hoc group on flooding&#8212;a group that is so important that it has met only twice in the past year&#8212;will report by the end of February. Will the minister, when he sums up, advise us whether the ad hoc group will give serious consideration to setting up a national flood action group?</p><p>As Scottish Environment LINK said in a briefing that we received this morning:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In other areas where action is being taken to determine the best way forward there is a national overview group. In few areas can there be a more urgent need for such an action plan. Yet without a national group with an overview to design a route map for action across Scotland&#8212;there will be none.\"</p><p>Will the minister take that point on board today?</p>", "hdate": "2003-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13288675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 2 &#8212; The general duties"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I acknowledge that the Executive has come a long way in improving the bill with respect to flood management.

I was the council's environmental health convener for four years and during that time there was a lot of investment in ways in which to deal with the dog-fouling problem. Dog wardens were employed and we had exercise control areas, bins for dog excrement, free pooper scoopers and an education programme. However, despite the amount of effort that was made, not a lot changed because, to be frank, the law did not allow sufficient powers of enforcement. I am the first to accept that education must go hand in hand with enforcement and I offer my congratulations to Andy Kerr and the Executive for making available the extra investment of &#163;100,000. Because of past experience, it is my view that education alone will not make sufficient difference. All the carrots in the world will make no difference unless we are also able to use a big stick. Keith Harding's bill will allow us to go in that direction.</p><p>We need to have tougher penalties and we need to bring about a culture change. We must take pride in our country and in our communities. If that happens, irresponsible dog owners might begin to respond. Keith Harding has given us an opportunity to take an important step and he deserves plaudits for that.</p><p>Earlier, Keith Harding said that the legislation would apply in all areas to which the public has access. That worries me because the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will give the public the right to go into areas all over Scotland. As Tricia Marwick asked earlier, how will we differentiate between agricultural and rough areas? Further consideration needs to be given to that issue because the legislation might otherwise be undermined. For example, if action is taken against a person who allows a dog to defecate in a public park, that person might be able to argue reasonably that no action was taken against them when they previously allowed their dog to defecate in rough areas. I do not know what the answer to that problem is, but I think that the matter needs further examination.</p><p>As far as fixed penalties are concerned, it is a good idea to up the ante incrementally and to make it more difficult for offenders if they refuse to pay. Is 10 per cent enough? That is another question that needs to be examined; if the percentage uplift was greater it might increase the number of fines that were paid up front, and it might reduce bureaucracy further down the line. Perhaps that issue can be examined.<place-holder colnum=\"17142\"/></p><p>The issue that causes me greatest concern is young offenders&#8212;those who are under the age of 16. They have no income and no means to pay, as Bill Aitken properly pointed out. It might be that in practice, people who are under 16 will not be fined. However, in theory they could be fined and while that theoretical possibility exists, the potential exists for difficult situations to arise for people who are under 16.</p><p>The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals submitted further evidence to the Parliament today, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If a minor is in charge of a dog when an offence is committed, the person who gave the minor responsibility for the dog should be held responsible.\"</p><p>That suggests that the parents of children should be held responsible. Perhaps the legislation could address that, instead of fining young offenders.</p><p>There are other points that I would like to make, but I recognise the tightness of time.

Chapelcross produces 190 megawatts of electricity for the national grid. The proposed wind farm would produce 200 megawatts. Chapelcross was built to produce tritium for nuclear weapons&#8212;that is its origins. I have no doubt that it has provided employment in the past&#8212;no one can deny that&#8212;but the reality is that British Energy is getting a &#163;650 million Government handout to enable the nuclear industry to continue. Anyone who cannot see the future of nuclear energy is living in a past that should have been buried a long time ago, along with the waste.</p><p>Scotland has the potential to become Europe's green energy powerhouse. Although I am beginning to doubt the commitment of the Conservative party, members from all parties seem to accept that much of our future electricity needs will be met by using the massive potential of renewable energy. We have 25 per cent of Europe's potential for renewable energy.</p><p>I referred earlier to a report produced for the <place-holder colnum=\"16846\"/> Scottish Executive by Garrad Hassan &amp; Partners Ltd a couple of years ago. It indicated that a potential 59,000 megawatts could be produced from renewable energy sources. Of that, 11,500 megawatts would come from onshore wind; the capacity of offshore wind is 25,000 megawatts. The potential is massive.</p><p>If Scotland is to meet the Executive target of approximately 40 per cent of production coming from renewable resources by 2020, or the SNP's target of 50 per cent, large advances will be required in producing energy from offshore wind. That does not mean that this particular application should get the green light; it must be scrutinised properly, and that is why we will have a real debate later, once Tom McCabe and his committee have considered the proposal further. They have done a great job with the detailed information that has been presented and in explaining the complexity of the issue.</p><p>The legislation is very technical. I pick up on something that Alasdair Morgan said. I am concerned about the incredible complexity and many layers of legislative procedure that proposed developers are required to navigate. As I have said, I am grateful to the committee for producing such a lot of detail and for the comprehensive report that it has produced. However, as the report describes, not only are the promoters required to submit private legislation to seek authority to interfere with the public rights of navigation and fishing, they are also required to seek consents from Scottish ministers under a number of legal provisions. Those are section 39 of the Electricity Act 1989, section 5 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949. Also, because aspects of the development would cut across the border, there are requirements under legislation for England and Wales.</p><p>If we are serious about releasing Scotland's renewable energy potential, it cannot be right that a promoter is required to submit private legislation at the same time as having to apply for consents under three other pieces of legislation. Although I understand that there are sound reasons for such consents, and the details must be examined, there must be a way to sweep away some of the unnecessary bureaucracy and rationalise what appears to be a burdensome process for the promoter.</p><p>Yes, the promoters have to jump through hoops, but can we not bring the hoops together to make one basket and take a more single-door approach, rather than having such a spread of legislative requirements? I do not know whether it is in the minister's competence to address that through existing Scottish Parliament legislation, or whether something would require to be done at <place-holder colnum=\"16847\"/> Westminster, but a more focused approach is certainly needed.</p><p>We have heard about the number of jobs that are supported by nuclear power. In Scotland, 1,500 jobs are supported by nuclear power, but Denmark got at least 14,000 jobs out of its wind energy potential. Another thing that we need to look forward to is the Executive introducing a green job strategy that will enable the industry, developers, local authorities, central Government and various quangos to come together in a focused and cohesive way to map out a strategy for Scotland for wind farm development. It is essential that we have a review of both offshore and onshore planning, so that development can be more proactive, rather than being led by developers, and so that issues that cause conflict in communities can be resolved a lot earlier.</p><p>Local authorities should be asked to draw up advisory plans for their areas and they should be able to say clearly, after consultation with their communities, where they will allow wind farms and where they will not allow them. That would give us a process to speed up the number of applications that will come through. We should also have a process that speeds up what appears to me to be the burdensome and cumbersome process when a developer seeks consent. I hope that when the Executive sums up, as well as reflecting on what has been said about the technical nature of the bill, it will also consider the wider aspects.

The question is which level of government should implement such a trading scheme.</p><p>In the UK, we are on course to have the first economy-wide emissions trading scheme; however, the scheme will not be without its difficulties. On 23 October, the European Commission issued a draft directive on the introduction of an EU-wide scheme in 2005. Industry has signalled its fear that a go-it-alone UK proposal would prove incompatible with the EU scheme. The correct solution for Scotland might be to await the implementation of the EU directive and avoid unnecessary transition costs for government and business alike. However, without full scrutiny of the bill's impact on Scotland, no one in the chamber can be certain whether we should await the EU directive or proceed with the UK proposals. I therefore submit that, on the issue of carbon emissions trading, it would be premature to agree to Allan Wilson's motion.</p><p>Part 1 deals with waste. It is incredible that Scottish ministers are prepared to pass to the UK Government responsibility for setting maximum levels for biodegradable municipal waste that is sent to landfill. As the minister said, Scotland's record on recycling is a disgrace. The setting of maximum levels of waste, as a policy tool, would have a major impact on that record. We are at the bottom of the European recycling league, and it must be our responsibility to sort out the mess that we have created for ourselves. Passing the buck to the UK Government to sort out that mess is nothing short of an abdication of responsibility.</p><p>The Executive has made an astonishing U-turn on this issue.

Wherever Scots go in the world, they can be sure that they will defend the name of Scotland, but when it comes to the menace of litter, why are our people not willing to show the same spirit in relation to their own front doors or back yards? For too long people have taken a walk-on-by attitude to litter. Why is it important to tackle that attitude? Litter has a negative effect on the quality of life. It impacts on the economy and on our capacity to attract tourists to local environments in which we must all live our lives.</p><p>How can we realistically expect the people of Scotland to care more about the future of the planet if their own backyard has been despoiled by litter? That echoes some of the sensible comments that Duncan McNeil made earlier.</p><p>It is therefore imperative that the nation as a whole tackle this menace. In order to eradicate the problem, we must begin to instil in people a pride in Scotland's culture. We need effective campaigns as well as greater education and awareness raising; however, all the education in the world will not by itself change the culture. As an environmental health convener from 1988, I was the first person in Scotland to employ litter <place-holder colnum=\"15135\"/> rangers, who served fixed penalties on litter louts under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, their primary job was to get into schools and raise pupils' awareness about the problems of litter.</p><p>It is a pity that many of those young people ever grew up, because when they turned into adults, all their responsibility genes seemed to evaporate. Although education will help, we have to get serious and tackle the serial litter louts who have not got the message. It is time to adopt a no-holds-barred approach and to create a climate of zero tolerance. We must declare war on the litter louts and hit them where it hurts most&#8212;in their pockets.</p><p>People hoped that the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 would mean a major change in how litter was dealt with. Although it is true that the 1990 act introduced some major steps to combat the menace of litter, experience has shown that there are major weaknesses in its enforcement provisions and in the powers that are available to local authorities. The minister said that many powers already exist to deal with the problem and that we must just use them better. Moreover, he claims that he still has some sympathy for local authority workers. That might be true, but the reality out there is different. For example, in its response to my member's bill on litter, Scottish Natural Heritage told me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In principle, we support the aim of the Bill to strengthen litter control.\"</p><p>COSLA also supported my view that existing legislation needs to be reviewed. Furthermore, the City of Edinburgh Council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A fundamental of the fixed penalty scheme is that individuals who litter are witnessed and properly identified. It is perhaps this factor more than anything else that leads to a relatively small number of fixed penalty notices being served.\"</p><p>There are fundamental weaknesses in the existing legislation and we still await the minister's proposals. Unfortunately, because he has kicked in his consultation process, everything has been stalled and the non-Executive bills unit cannot proceed with my bill. That raises a question about the Executive's real intention in kicking in its consultation. Is that consultation simply a stalling mechanism? It has taken the Executive a long time to come up with the goods and it is time that it delivered.</p>", "hdate": "2002-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13282480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Quality of Life"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Duncan McNeil would have been better sticking to his notes, because when he went off them at the end, he really lost it.

It is a pity that we do not have enough time today to talk about all the good things in the bill and I will instead have to focus on some of the areas in which there must be improvement. However, there can be no doubting the importance of the bill: it represents a real chance to safeguard Scotland's rich water resource and to continue the process of reversing decline. Just as important, the bill provides unique opportunities, if we are prepared to grasp them, to secure considerable social and economic benefits.</p><p>In the past, United Kingdom Governments have been slow to react to European environmental legislation. The Scottish Executive, to be fair, cannot be accused of being slow off the mark in relation to the water framework directive and it deserves recognition for the efficiency of its response. However, we and others have concerns <place-holder colnum=\"14724\"/> about the efficacy of some of its proposals.</p><p>The Transport and the Environment Committee and the Finance Committee have highlighted what they believe are shortcomings in the bill, most of which can be addressed at stage 2. The committees are to be congratulated on their thorough scrutiny of the Executive's proposals.</p><p>One of the areas in which there has to be improvement is flooding. In its report on the bill, the Transport and the Environment Committee said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"one of the most obvious ways in which it will be possible to judge where the WFD has made a difference will be in relation to Scotland's ability to take preventative measure to reduce the incidence of flooding over the coming years.\"</p><p>The word \"preventative\" is important in that context. This winter, we will again witness major flooding events across the country being tackled with sandbags and canoes. In effect, we are asking people to fight a losing battle. We are tackling the symptoms and doing nothing to prevent future flooding events.</p><p>I have seen at first hand in Perth the utter havoc and hardship that flooding can bring to ordinary people's lives. In retrospect, it is incredible that we allowed sprawling housing estates such as exist to the north of Perth to be built on natural flood plains. Had agricultural practices further upstream not interfered even further with the natural flood plains, the scale of the flood defence works for Perth could have been much reduced.</p><p>We must ensure through the bill that human activity does not in future unnaturally constrain a river to the detriment of people and biodiversity alike. The Transport and the Environment Committee has made some important recommendations in that regard. Those recommendations would improve the situation and I am glad that the minister will consider them, although I do not believe that they go far enough.</p><p>I do not want to divest local authorities of the important powers that they have in regard to flood defences. The councils are the relevant bodies: they have the technical skills to deal with such matters. When it comes to flood defences and dealing with the consequences of flooding, councils can do a good job, as they have shown. However, when it comes to understanding a whole river system and taking a more preventive flood-avoidance approach, they do not have the expertise, wherewithal or powers to act appropriately.</p><p>I know that the bill provides for river basin management plans, but the bill's provisions&#8212;even with the Transport and the Environment Committee's improvements&#8212;do not provide a robust enough framework for dealing with the growing menace of flooding. We need to develop <place-holder colnum=\"14725\"/> a national plan or strategy to deal with flooding in an integrated manner throughout Scotland. We cannot go on with the sandbags-and-canoe strategy that we have at present. We need a structure that can ensure that a strategic, focused and consistent approach is taken at river basin level and sub-basin level.</p><p>The current position will inevitably perpetuate a fragmented approach, with ad hoc policy and decision making that will end up being costly to the taxpayer and fail to make the expected environmental improvements. I urge the Executive to reconsider its position. To develop an appropriate strategy would be to do no more than is already done in, for example, the national waste strategy plan, through which SEPA has an overview.</p><p>I conclude with a look at the financial implications, as they are important for the bill. At <br/> 5 pm today, we will be asked to vote not only on a bill whose principles are sound, but on the financial resolution that supports it. However, the reports from the Finance Committee and the Transport and the Environment Committee provide grim reading on the adequacy of the financial memorandum.</p><p>The Finance Committee report tells us that various arms of government&#8212;Scottish Water, Scottish Natural Heritage and the local authorities&#8212;were unable to quantify the likely costs of the bill for their organisations or how those costs might be paid for. Indeed, Scottish Water felt obliged to state that it would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"extremely difficult&#8212;if not dangerous&#8212;to put a figure on the costs\".&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Finance Committee</i>, 10 September 2002; c 2173.]</p><p>That void of information is alarming, given that the customers will ultimately have to bear the costs. The Finance Committee felt so strongly about the issue that it questioned whether the bill should complete stage 1 without further specification of costs.</p><p>The minister provided more information in a letter to the convener of the Transport and the Environment Committee on 27 September. Unfortunately for the minister, that additional information cut no ice with the committee, which, in its stage 1 report, also recommended that the financial matters be resolved before the bill's principles were agreed to. The minister tried again to get the committee on board in a letter dated 25 October, as he said. However, incredibly, the minister conceded in that letter that all the information that could be provided had already been provided. That means that, despite the fact that the minister has failed on two separate occasions to provide the robust financial information that the committees sought, he still expects the Parliament to agree to the financial <place-holder colnum=\"14726\"/> resolution.</p><p>I have considered closely WRc plc's report, on which the minister has placed so much credence today. I understand the difficulties of trying to forecast long-term costs. However, that consideration has raised more concerns and questions, not least of which is why we have not seen any evidence or comment from the group that will be hit hardest by the costs that the bill will impose. The agricultural sector will bear the largest burden of the costs&#8212;more than &#163;250 million&#8212;yet we have no real idea how it will meet them.</p><p>The report \"Evaluating the Economic Impact of Abstraction Controls on High and Medium Volume Water Users in Scotland\" was published just last week. It raises even more uncertainty. I quote from page 5 of the report, on sectoral impacts:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The evidence suggests that the Directive may raise issues of catchment sensitivity for the distilling, fish farming, agricultural and paper sectors. Because of limited information on groundwater status it was not possible to draw any general conclusions about the possible impacts of the Directive on sectors abstracting groundwater.\"</p><p>With regard to additional capital expenditure requirements on the part of Scottish Water, the report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It was not possible to calculate with much precision the likely additional capital costs to Scottish Water. This can only realistically be done when licence conditions are established and least cost options investigated.\"</p><p>All that information came too late for either the Transport and the Environment Committee or the Finance Committee to scrutinise it, but it adds to a picture of confusion and uncertainty over costs.</p><p>In effect, the minister is asking us to take a leap in the dark with him as far as future costs are concerned. The whisky industry, for instance, already contributes almost &#163;600 million in excise duty alone to the United Kingdom Treasury, yet the minister asks us to take that leap in the dark on the charges that will be levied against the industry for abstraction.</p><p>No one expects the eventual legislation to have a cost-neutral impact&#8212;that would not be possible&#8212;and there is no doubting the fact that the benefits that it will bring will be significant. However, it is up to the minister to provide robust information on the social and economic costs of a system of management that is currently failing us; to provide tangible and realistic future costs of implementing the bill; and, on the positive side of the equation, to provide much more detailed information on future cost benefits and savings.</p><p>The Scottish National Party will be voting for the bill today, but the minister will have to go a long way to persuade us to vote for the financial resolution, because we sincerely believe that the <place-holder colnum=\"14727\"/> financial resolution is weak and that the background information supplied was not adequate. We support the Transport and the Environment Committee and the Finance Committee in their views.

The opportunity has been spurned, however, so we will never get near the water quality that prevails in England.</p><p>When I intervened on the minister to ask about the modernisation of the aqueducts that carry Glasgow's water supply, I was far from impressed with his answer. The ducts are very old and very long; one is 115 years old, while the other is 145 years old. According to public health officials, it now seems very likely that those aqueducts and the cattle living alongside them were the source of Glasgow's most recent cryptosporidium problems. <place-holder colnum=\"13719\"/></p><p>The incident control team report will, in all likelihood, confirm that.</p><p>The minister told us that the sheep in the Loch Katrine area were the cause of the outbreak. It appears on this occasion not to have been those much-maligned sheep but cattle living near the aqueducts that caused the problems. The question that everyone is asking now is whether Ross Finnie knows the difference between his cattle and his sheep. Let me show the minister these two pictures: the first one is a coo; the second one is a sheep.</p><p>More seriously, why has no action been taken since the report on the aqueducts landed on the minister's desk 10 months ago? Will he confirm that Scottish Water will have the necessary resources to carry out the costly modernisation of the aqueducts?</p><p>This is an important debate. Spending figures aside, the debate is also about honesty on targets, on track records and on the resources that are available. Two years ago, almost to the day, Jack McConnell, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, announced the spending allocation designated for Scotland following the 2000 UK spending review. He not only announced the spending levels for 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04, but said what the resources would be spent on. He announced new targets for transport, education and health and the amount of money that would be spent on those key areas. It is simply unacceptable for a minister with responsibility for finance to appear two years later and announce the same money again. It is equally unacceptable for ministers to claim that a new method of presenting money on a balance sheet represents new cash injected into the Scottish budget.</p><p>Of course, new resources and uplifts in the budget are welcome, but there should be honesty and transparency rather than double dealing and misrepresentation. Such behaviour does no good to the Executive and the reputation of the Parliament.</p><p>Whenever I listen to a Government minister making a spending announcement, I am reminded of a schoolboy showing his friend the latest card trick. It does not matter how often the trick has been done or how obvious it has become&#8212;he insists on playing the same card trick time and time again. I say to the minister that the trick is an old trick.</p><p>I close with an appeal.

The issue of Scotland's water and the fundamental right of her citizens to have access to a clean and safe supply is very serious and deserves to be treated in that manner. Everyone is aware of the communications fiasco that surrounded the recent cryptosporidium outbreaks in Glasgow and Edinburgh. I will say more about that later.<place-holder colnum=\"13296\"/></p><p>Before this summer's outbreak in Glasgow, the previous significant incident occurred in spring 2000. There were 90 confirmed cases as a result of that outbreak, six of which required hospitalisation. Tragically, one elderly person died. No one can doubt that cryptosporidium is anything but a serious risk to public health.</p><p>As a result of the outbreak in 2000, an outbreak control team was formed to investigate and report on the circumstances. The OCT produced its report in November 2001. Although many of its recommendations have been implemented, several key recommendations have either not been implemented at all or are being implemented only today after an unsatisfactory delay of 10 months as a result of the ad hoc committee's report. The Parliament deserves to know this afternoon why it has taken 10 months to begin to implement some of those vital recommendations. Indeed, some have still not been dealt with.</p><p>For example, the OCT recommended that all the livestock should be moved from Loch Katrine. However, on 7 August, the <em>Daily Mail</em> reported that 3,000 sheep were still located in the Loch Katrine catchment area. We need to know today how many sheep remain and when we can expect them to be removed.</p><p>It was also recommended that the water authority should discuss the status of Loch Katrine with the regulator, with a view to providing specific advice to food and drinks manufacturers. The advice was to refer to the continuing risk of cryptosporidium to ensure that manufacturers could introduce local treatment options if necessary. Why has that recommendation not been acted upon? What has been done since the recent outbreak to implement it? Today's report appears to contain no reference to how that matter will be addressed.</p><p>Moreover, it was recommended that the Greater Glasgow Health Board, in conjunction with the water authority, should consider advising the public about the status of Loch Katrine water to allow the public to decide for themselves the on-going precautionary action that they should take. Additionally, it was recommended that advice should be issued to all doctors in the Greater Glasgow Health Board area to enable them to decide on the on-going need for the very young, the elderly and immuno-compromised patients to boil water. Why were those recommendations not acted upon 10 months ago? Why are we beginning to act on them only today as a result of the ad hoc report? That delay jeopardised public health.</p><p>What about the recommendation that, in the interests of impartiality and transparency, the water authorities should not form part of any future OCTs? Again, the recommendation has not been <place-holder colnum=\"13297\"/> implemented, and again we ask why. Perhaps the answer lies hidden in the small print at the end of the OCT report, where it states that West of Scotland Water did not endorse the report because it did not agree with the recommendations. As a result, it was agreed to refer the report to the Scottish Executive for&#8212;in the report's own words&#8212;\"further direction and input\".</p><p>The ad hoc group's report, which we received today, says that the OCT reports should be sent routinely to the Scottish Executive. Well, that did a lot of good. For goodness' sake, it was sent to the Executive 10 months ago in November 2001.</p><p>What has happened to the report since it reached the Executive? After all, Ross Finnie's own water quality team was aware of the findings of the OCT report&#8212;it attended all the OCT meetings. The Executive's own water quality report, issued in August 2001, stated that it awaited the outcome of the OCT report. Just what happened to the report when it entered the black hole of the Executive? On whose shelf did it sit gathering dust? Why was no action taken? Surely the minister was aware of the report's existence. Why, even today, have we no idea what further direction and guidance was provided by the Executive, apart from what is contained in the ad hoc report?</p><p>The dangers of cryptosporidium are well known. The Executive's own document states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the water authorities are required to implement an approach based on assessing the risk of, and taking precautionary steps to limit, contamination by the end of 2000.\"</p><p>It did not take long for the Executive to realise that that target would never be achieved. Therefore, in March 2000, a direction setting out the so-called strict timetable to reduce assessed risks by 2005 was issued. The minister referred to that. However, with the failure of the recent planning application, even that stretched target begins to look increasingly unachievable.</p><p>Not only do we have the problem of cryptosporidium, but there are trihalomethanes and lead as well as other contaminants. Scientific studies have linked the existence of THMs to an increased risk of cancer, to reproductive problems and to miscarriages. From the most recently available water quality report for 2000&#8212;the minister failed to tell us this&#8212;it is clear that 34 per cent of Scotland's water zones are failing to meet the regulatory requirements because of the level of contamination from THMs. Yet in 1996, that figure was only 24 per cent. If the failure rate in 2000 is even higher than it was in 1996, it far from inspires confidence that the Executive's targets for the reduction of THMs are achievable under planned levels of expenditure.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13277829", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Water Supplies and Public Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, let me say that we very much welcome today's debate.

Indeed, it could be described as a piece of legislative Kerplunk: if one element is taken away, the entire framework could come crashing down. Consequently, before we began to consider amendments, we had, as Donald Gorrie said, informal briefings, which Mike Rumbles and officials from the non-Executive bills unit attended.</p><p>The Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Business asked how Donald Gorrie and I had given Mike Rumbles a hard time.

Indeed, one of the stage 2 amendments on the admissibility of complaints&#8212;to which Mike Rumbles referred&#8212;stemmed from those informal discussions.</p><p>Although the bill was not subjected to extensive amendment at stage 2, that should not be taken to suggest that the committee did not subject it to thorough examination and scrutiny.

It is a pity that more coverage has not been given to this positive aspect of parliamentary life.

We are not for gambling with Scotland's farms, gambling with Scotland's environment, or gambling with Scotland's public health.</p><p>Time after time&#8212;in the public arena before today and again during the debate&#8212;ministers have tried without success to allay the fears and concerns about the impact of GM crop trials in Scotland. In particular, they have cited advice provided to them by their scientific advisers&#8212;specifically, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment&#8212;and claimed that the advice left them with no choice but to consent to GM crop trials in Scotland. I say to Ross Finnie that ACRE is only one advice-giving body and that, in following the regulations on the process of giving consent, he is in no way bound to accept the advice of just one advisory body.<place-holder colnum=\"12339\"/></p><p>I think that I heard Allan Wilson say that ACRE was the be-all and end-all of advice centres for the Executive. However, in a letter of 31 July, ACRE said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ministers are not obliged to take ACRE's advice nor is the committee's advice the only consideration for ministers when issuing a consent.\"</p><p>I say that because, out there in the scientific community, there is much evidence&#8212;about which ACRE has advised the minister&#8212;that runs contrary to the recommendations that ACRE has placed before him on GM crop trials. It cannot be argued, from any credible intellectual standpoint, that the European Environment Agency report \"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs): The significance of gene flow through pollen transfer\", which was published earlier this year, provides anything other than evidence of harm. Statements in the chapters of the report dealing with oil-seed rape&#8212;the only GM crop that is grown in Scotland&#8212;make for remarkable reading when set alongside the advice that the minister has been given by ACRE. I know that the minister knows of the report, but has he read it? Did ACRE tell Ross Finnie exactly what the report says? If he has not read it, I suggest that he do so very soon, because the advice that he has been getting has not been very good at all.</p><p>For instance, did ACRE tell the minister that, as the report says,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"some pollen transfer and fertilisation up to 4km can be expected\"?</p><p>Was the minister told that bees are capable of flying 5km, meaning that pollen can be transferred over distances of up to 10km? The report throws into question the accuracy and validity of the response that the minister provided to the question put by the Transport and the Environment Committee, which asked how far the nearest non-GM commercially grown crops are sited from GM crop trials at Munlochy. The minister told the committee that such crops were sited 1.3km, 1.5km and 1.7km away. His letter continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Successful cross-pollination over the distances involved must be considered extremely unlikely and, in the opinion of all our expert advisory bodies, does not give rise to any safety concerns.\"</p><p>The minister should be reconsidering the advice that he gets from his advisers. The European Environmental Agency report blows a huge hole in the arguments with which the minister is being furnished. The report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The risk of hybridisation between oilseed rape and some wild relatives ... is high.\"</p><p>It also says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Oilseed rape can be described as a high risk crop for pollen mediated gene flow from crop to crop and from crop to wild relatives.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12340\"/></p><p>However, even more worryingly, on consequences, it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"From an agronomic point of view, the transfer of novel genes from one crop to another could have a number of implications, including depletions in the quality of conventional and organic crop seed leading to a change in their performance and marketability.\"</p><p>The European report is quite clear. The minister should be listening to that scientific advice. The report is full of advice that such crops can be harmful to Scotland. The message could not be clearer. Ross Finnie is putting at risk the high-quality product of Scottish farms.</p><p>The question must be asked: in view of the report, why can the minister not put an end to the trials of GM crop seeds? There is no scientific reason to prevent such action on the ground of the precautionary principle. All that it would require is for Ross Finnie to have the political courage&#8212;that is what this is about&#8212;to say that the advice that he has received is not all that it should be and to put a stop to the trials. As the minister said in an article in the <em>Sunday Herald</em>, it is about more than simply losing face. Ross Finnie should not be afraid to lose face in this case&#8212;the environment is at risk.</p><p>After all, calling off such trials is exactly what the Belgian Government has done, regardless of the rubbish that Allan Wilson told us. On 29 and 30 April, the Belgian Government blocked the go-ahead of three GM crop trials involving oil-seed rape, specifically because of the findings in the European Environment Agency report. The Belgians were prepared to take and use that advice and so to ban the trials. In blocking the trials, the Belgian invoked the precautionary principle as contained in article 174 of the EC treaty.</p><p>There are no scientific barriers in Scotland&#8212;there are only political barriers that have been erected by a Liberal minister and backed up by Labour and Liberal back benchers. It is time to put the future of Scottish agriculture, the environment and public health first. It is time to follow the Belgian example, to implement the precautionary principle properly in Scotland and to stop worrying about losing face. It is time to put a stop to the trials for the good of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13275164", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Genetically Modified Crops"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I make it plain from the beginning that the SNP is not anti-GM per se; we are anti-taking risks with the environment.

Progress is being made towards realising some of that potential, including the work of Robert Gordon University in the Pentland firth, the work in Islay, where hydrogen fuel that has been generated from wave power is stored, and the offshore wind facility that is based in the Solway firth. Iain Gray mentioned earlier the on-the-horizon development in the Moray firth. Those developments are exciting, but the industry is really only in its embryonic stage. The instabilities that the chancellor and his Government's fiscal policies have created will deter oil companies from putting much-needed investment capital into the young industry.

The number of road miles will increase as a result of the aggregates tax and that will create real difficulties.</p><p>Why does it take so long for this country to implement EU environmental directives to which it has signed up? If the problem is not with recycling, it is with the fridges mountain. In future, we will no doubt have similar problems with the directives on end-of-life vehicles, or waste electrical and electronic equipment&#8212;the proposed WEEE directive.</p><p>It is correct that we should recognise that partnership working has been going on. However, it is another thing to commend progress, as the motion does, particularly when that progress has been painfully slow. The minister accepted that today. It is also correct to welcome the preparation of waste plans to establish best environmental practice and the other motherhood-and-apple-pie ideas in the motion. It is a different matter to ignore the fact that the time scales for the production of area waste plans have slipped and slipped. I am, however, pleased that we now have draft plans in all areas.</p><p>To accept the terms of the Executive's motion, we have to divorce ourselves from the reality that is staring everyone in the face. There has been some progress on recycling, but it has been patchy and driven by leadership from individuals and individual communities instead of being led by the Government. There has been additional Government support, but it pales into insignificance when set alongside the &#163;50 million per annum of landfill tax that wings its way out of <place-holder colnum=\"12043\"/> Scotland to the UK Treasury.</p><p>The most startling fact about the Executive's motion&#8212;unlike the minister's speech&#8212;is that there is not the slightest recognition that Scotland is at the bottom of the European recycling league. The Executive's commitment cannot be taken seriously until it demonstrates an appreciation of the scale of the challenge that Scotland faces to change its image as the rubbish coup of Europe.</p><p>That image has only been strengthened by the importing of waste from Northern Ireland to a landfill site near Lendalfoot. That flies in the face of the proximity principle, which says that waste should be treated or disposed of as close to its source as can be achieved, and which encourages communities to accept that the waste that they produce is their problem. Incidentally, that principle is at the forefront of the national waste strategy that the Executive signed in 1999.</p><p>To begin the process, we need mandatory targets as early as possible. I see from SEPA's national waste strategy integration progress report that SEPA has set a target that the minister could use as a mandatory target. We need to do more than just consider mandatory targets. Why cannot we consider establishing a recycling pathfinder scheme for Scotland that is based in an area waste plan area? That would allow test bedding of the most appropriate and cost-effective kerbside collection system and the development of recycling markets.</p><p>Further measures could be taken to stimulate the recycling market and deal with waste minimisation. For instance, obligations on producers could be introduced to increase the amount of recycled material that is used in products. A requirement could be placed on major waste producers to develop and introduce waste minimisation studies and report to SEPA on the waste that they produce. Obligations could be placed on companies to ensure that the design of products incorporates at the development stage waste minimisation principles, including the capacity to repair, reuse and recycle.</p><p>Those measures would begin to make a difference not only to the level of recycling, but to the market for such products. Much more can be done on waste minimisation, packaging, reuse, refurbishment and composting. All that we have called for requires more ambition and boldness than the Executive has displayed. We have been asked to settle for a wishy-washy motion that is divorced from reality.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-3105.1, to leave out from \"supports\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes that in February 2000 the European Commission applied for a declaration that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations in particular under Council Directive <place-holder colnum=\"12044\"/> 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste, and that the UK accepted this failure and the European Court of Justice found the UK (including Scotland) in breach of a number of waste related Directives; further notes that the National Waste Strategy was published in 1999 together with a commitment to the production of Area Waste Plans by the end of 2000 and that this target date was subsequently extended to a final deadline of March 2002; is concerned with the slow progress being made towards the better management of waste in Scotland, and believes that in order to speed up progress the Executive must firstly introduce mandatory targets, on an all Scotland basis, of 30% to 35% for recycling and composting of household waste by 2010.\"</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13274483", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Waste Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Anyone in Scotland who is prepared to support the aggregates tax does not understand the damage that it will do to the long-term sustainability of the environment.

They do not acknowledge Scotland's full potential and, as far as we are concerned, they lack ambition. Our approach is to acknowledge progress, but to be constructively critical where we feel that that is warranted. The targets might meet the ambitions of the Lib-Lab coalition, hemmed in as it is by UK positioning, but they do not nearly meet the ambitions that the SNP has for Scotland and, like the indicators, they do not acknowledge Scotland's full potential.</p><p>I will return to the targets later, but first let us look at the indicators. Indicator 1 is on sustainable prosperity. There is no mention of the tonnes of coal or gallons of oil that will be extracted from Scotland in the future, but those fossil fuels will impact on the warming of the planet. We will of course burn many of those carbon fuels here in Scotland but, given that we export a great deal of what we extract, the exports will have no bearing on Scotland's emissions of climate change gases. Just because we do not burn the fossil fuels, however, we cannot absolve Scotland of responsibility for the release of carbon dioxide that will inevitably follow. We owe it to future generations not only to look at what we do at home, but to examine the consequences of our actions internationally.</p><p>Indicator 2 is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Work: people as a resource\".</p><p>It mentions unemployment, but there is no examination of the number of skilled and unskilled workers. We know that the lack of skilled workers is having a serious effect on the Scottish economy and that that is affecting the sustainability of small businesses in particular.<place-holder colnum=\"11639\"/></p><p>Indicator 7 deals with climate change, but it makes no attempt to measure the basics, such as the mean temperature, the rainfall from which Scotland suffers or the average wind speeds. It is incredible that it does not even attempt to measure the sea levels that will rise as a result of climate change. Instead, we are given the usual platitude that Scotland will somehow make</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an equitable contribution to the UK Kyoto target\".</p><p>I have often wondered exactly what that means and how the Executive might define the target for Scotland. Will the minister tell us today whether he intends, now or in the near future, to set separate targets for Scotland, given that the picture in Scotland on the output of climate change gases is very different from that in the rest of the UK?</p><p>Does the minister intend to divide up the various sectors and set separate targets for agriculture, transport and energy, for example, as happened in the UK strategy? Alternatively, does he think it appropriate that Scotland should simply muddle along? When we reach 2010, will he say, \"We've done our bit,\" irrespective of what we have done? That is what looks likely at the moment.</p><p>Indicator 10 deals with the biodiversity of Scotland but gives no indication of whether we will count the number of threatened species, the bird population or even the number of grey seals, which would be a good yet simple indicator for the health of our seas. There is no indicator for annual forest increment and drain, for cultivated and fallow land or even for a percentage of land that is organically farmed. It is also disturbing that there is no attempt to produce indicators for the amount of pollution or toxic contamination. It is in that area that the people of Scotland are suffering perhaps the greatest environmental injustice. Surely the minister should make some attempt&#8212;if not now, in future&#8212;to measure the emissions of volatile or poisonous compounds, pesticide use and sales, dioxin levels in breast milk&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13273545", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sustainable Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The SNP welcomes the debate.

At long last, the Executive seems to be prepared to set targets for recycling. I welcome the statement in the document that a target for recycling waste will be set. However, the document does not say whether that target will be mandatory. Perhaps the minister will answer that point when he sums up. The document also states that Scotland's current figure for recycling is 6 per cent.

I would much rather that we did that because we want to than because the European Commission has forced us to.

It was interesting that the minister noted that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"article 5 lists a wide range of activities for public authorities, all of which promote ... dissemination of information.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Justice 1 Committee</i>, 5 March 2002; c 3343.]</p><p>It is true that the provisions of article 5 are wide ranging, but they are also vital with regard to the provision of, and ready access to, up-to-date, transparent and relevant environmental information for the general public.</p><p>At stage 2, the minister argued that because of the nature of some of the activities listed in article 5, it would be better for its provisions to be addressed administratively. I would like to put that <place-holder colnum=\"11184\"/> to the test and to examine more closely the specific provision that environmental information should progressively be made available on the internet. I would like to examine the Executive's plans for that.</p><p>Will the minister please tell us exactly what administrative processes will be employed? When can we expect members of the public to be able to access via the internet the type of information that is described in article 5? The minister argued that it would be better to await the revised European Commission directive on public access to information. That directive, which will come into force in December this year, is expected to translate the Aarhus convention into European Union legislation. What I find mystifying, given the minister's view that we should await the directive to deal with the Aarhus convention, is that the Executive is cherry picking articles 3, 4 and 9 of the convention for inclusion in the bill, but is not prepared to include article 5.</p><p>In any case, what guarantees can the minister provide that the European Union will translate the important provision that is contained in article 5 into the legal framework designed for member states? If that does not happen, when can we expect the provision to be brought into Scots law? I seek such guarantees because the Executive does not have a good track record on infraction proceedings brought against it by the European Commission for failure to implement EU law.</p><p>If the directive deals successfully with translating the convention into the EU framework, what instrument would the Executive employ to incorporate it into Scots law? Whatever instrument is finally applied, the desired effect will not be achieved as speedily as it would be if the Parliament were to agree to amendments 74 and 75.</p><p>It is difficult to understand why the Executive has so far resisted including article 5, given that all that we seek to do is to provide the Executive with the power to make provision if it feels that it is appropriate to do so. Is the real reason for the Executive's concern the fact that it considers that such provisions go a step too far, because section 4 of article 5 requires every country&#8212;including the UK, which has already signed up&#8212;to publish and disseminate a national report on the state of the environment? Would that tie the Executive into commitments that it does not wish to make? I might be wrong, and if so, perhaps the minister will let me know how and when the Scottish Parliament will be provided with an opportunity to debate a desperately needed report on the state of the environment in Scotland. If the minister can tell me that the Executive will produce a report and hold a debate, and when it will do so, I will reconsider my position on amendments 74 and 75.<place-holder colnum=\"11185\"/></p><p>I move amendment 74.</p>", "hdate": "2002-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13272313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 62 &#8212; Power to make provision relating to environmental information"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members who have been following the progress of this bill will be aware that the SNP has taken a close interest in incorporating the provisions of article 5 of the United Nations Aarhus convention.

The hard work and commitment that went into the establishment of Rachel House before it was built are a tribute to those who are involved now and those who were involved in the past.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be the local councillor at the time that CHAS decided to come to Kinross and Margaret, with whom I was involved at the very beginning of the project, was a magnificent human being who put a lot of work into making the site work.</p><p>The hunt for the site in Kinross was not easy. It was a bit of a struggle and it was a long hunt, which was supported superbly by the <i>Daily Record</i>. CHAS settled on an old orchard in the grounds of Kinross house, owned by Sir David Montgomery, who contributed significantly to ensuring that it could be a successful operation. There were a range of problems, such as those with the sewage works, which were unable to deal with the capacity that the place would produce because Kinross had sewerage problems. There were also problems with access, but all those problems were overcome because everyone understood the significance of what CHAS was trying to achieve in Kinross. Many unsung heroes have opened doors and worked tirelessly for years to ensure that the project works.</p><p>Susan Deacon said rightly that many MSPs have visited the site; I know that the Deputy Presiding Officer, George Reid, has been there on a number of occasions. Members are always struck by the fact that it is a special place. The building won an award for its design soon after it opened. Its location on the banks of Loch Leven is also special. People know that they are entering a <place-holder colnum=\"10922\"/> special place even before they get through the front door, because of the location and the feel of what goes on there. Once they get inside the front door, they feel the aura of the place, which Margaret Smith described well.</p><p>I am not trying to draw direct comparisons, but the only place that had the same impact on me was the island of Iona. I know that the two places have different ethos, but I got the same feeling of happiness, togetherness, help and support on Iona that I got when I visited Rachel House.</p><p>I am delighted to support CHAS. The minister has heard members talk about funding problems, such as the 47 different funding streams. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that we get those problems sorted out before the second hospice is up and running. Somewhere along the line, some organisation will be unable to contribute the amount that it contributed in the past, which will cause a hiatus in funding. The quicker we get those problems sorted out and put CHAS on a firm footing, where it knows exactly where its funding will come from over a reasonable period of time, the quicker it will be able to plan successfully for the future to develop the new hospice on the banks of Loch Lomond. I am sure that the new hospice will be an equal success to that of the hospice on the banks of Loch Leven.

I invite anyone who disagrees with me to rise from their seat now and tell me that the final decision should be taken elsewhere.</p><p>The motion is about the powers of the Parliament, but we all know that the underlying argument is about whether new nuclear power stations should be built in Scotland. It is well known that the SNP has a long history of opposition to and active campaigning against nuclear power&#8212;to be fair, so do the Liberals. The Labour party went into the 1997 general election with a policy position that was similar to that of the SNP and the Liberals. However, the most recent Labour manifesto made no mention of nuclear power. Perhaps the 1997 policy is still accepted by the majority of MSPs, but who knows what Labour's policy is now? Perhaps the minister will tell us what Labour's policy is, but I somehow doubt that.<place-holder colnum=\"10220\"/></p><p>I have no doubt that the Tories will tell us about the virtues of nuclear power. The news for them is that, if the Romans had invented nuclear power, we would still be living with the deadly radioactive consequences.</p><p>I want to achieve something else today. I want to bury the lie that Scotland is somehow nuclear dependent. It is true that nuclear power makes up 50 per cent of Scotland's market share of about 5,000 megawatts. That is only a small part of the picture because, at 2,500 megawatts capacity, nuclear power accounts for only 26 per cent of our overall generating capacity of 9,600 megawatts. Even without nuclear power, we could continue our existing level of exports with room to spare.</p><p>Scotland's future is inextricably linked with the massive potential for green, renewable power, mainly in the forms of wind, wave and tidal power. A recent report that was produced for the Executive described how Scotland could produce 75 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from renewable sources. The report said that, if we were to use every possible source of power, we could have a capacity of about 75,000 megawatts. Even if we took up only a tenth of that capacity, the opportunities would be massive.

Those amendments will put the interests of customers at risk, as they effectively neuter some important powers that the water industry commissioner will have on behalf of customers.

The venture might involve bundled services, laboratory services&#8212;which the minister mentioned&#8212;billing activity or even a farming activity such as the one that, until recently, was taking place around Loch Katrine.

I shall follow Sylvia Jackson's convention and use the acronym PRTR.</p><p>I hope that Sylvia Jackson will discover from the minister that a door is ready to be pushed open and that the Executive's position is to push forward at speed. It would be incredible if the Executive was not prepared to introduce a register. As Sylvia Jackson said, information for England has been on the internet since May 1999. Why on earth are we so far behind in Scotland? Why has there not been more progress to date? As Sylvia Jackson said, we have made some progress. We have an integrated pollution control system, but we need to go further and introduce a PRTR.</p><p>I will return to the motion's substantive point shortly, but it would be wrong not to comment on the motion's introductory sentence, which</p><p class=\"indent\">\"congratulates the Scottish Executive on its proposals to cut particle air pollution\".</p><p>That seems all good, well and reasonable. However, if one digs underneath that, one finds that the congratulations are perhaps somewhat misplaced. In a press release following the previous minister's statement on air pollution, Friends of the Earth Scotland stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The new target on particulates is still not as tough as the one Labour inherited from the Conservatives in 1997 ... A real target to protect health should be something tough that we need to work hard to meet. The proposed standard is unambitious because it will be met with little effort and long before the 2010 target date\"</p><p>That is what we face. The targets that have been set by the Executive are far too lenient, because they are already being met in most of Scotland's cities and large towns.</p><p>We need to challenge the Executive on the introduction of a PRTR and to reconsider its air <place-holder colnum=\"5912\"/> pollution targets. The Executive should introduce more meaningful, stretching and demanding targets.</p><p>The Executive has the perfect opportunity to enshrine in statute the requirement for a pollution register. On 17 January, during the debate on the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill, I asked the Minister for Justice to incorporate article 5 of the Aarhus convention into the bill. If that was done&#8212;and I hope that it will be&#8212;it would ensure that a full and easily accessible pollution register would be required by law and would have to be produced. I hope that the minister will confirm that that will happen, as I have received no confirmation from the Minister for Justice.</p><p>Why are the proposals necessary? It is not simply a matter of providing MSPs or councillors with appropriate information about pollution levels, or providing non-governmental organisations with more information with which to beat the Government about the head. It is much more important than that&#8212;it is about the fundamental rights of individuals and communities to access information about matters that affect their health, their environment and their quality of life. That is what this is about&#8212;a fundamental point of human rights.</p><p>I refer to an example from Westfield in Fife, where I was last week. The community held a public meeting about a proposal regarding a possible landfill site together with a recycling facility. The people of that community would have grabbed the opportunity for such a site with both hands 10 years ago, because it would have meant jobs. Quite rightly, they are now asking what a landfill element means. They have heard in the press about all the health scares that landfill will bring about and they are asking whether they want jobs at that cost.</p><p>If people had access to information about the real impacts of landfill on their communities and on their lives, that would enable them to make clear decisions about what they want to do in their communities. That is a prime example of why we need to have the register. We have to give people the information and empower them so that they can make the decisions that will affect their quality of life in the future.</p><p>I congratulate Sylvia Jackson on securing the debate today.</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13265756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pollution Inventory"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sylvia Jackson on securing the debate.

The European Union directive on access to information is likely to be <place-holder colnum=\"5485\"/> revised soon, and the UK Government is expected to ratify the United Nations Aarhus convention. New regulations on environmental information are being developed to accommodate those changes. I understand that the Executive intends to introduce those regulations while the bill goes through Parliament; perhaps Richard Simpson will deal with that point.</p><p>It is obvious that it is an ideal time to introduce a bill that is good enough to comply with the EU directive and the Aarhus convention. I hope that the Executive will make the proposed information commissioner responsible for harmonising the time scales for environmental information and other information.</p><p>At present, articles 3, 4 and 9 of the Aarhus convention will be incorporated into the bill, but article 5, on the collection and dissemination of environmental information, will not. That is a worry. Concern has been expressed that any pollution register that is introduced in Scotland will not be comprehensive enough to comply with the Aarhus convention. If that is to be addressed, article 5 must be included in the bill. I ask the minister to reflect on that.</p><p>How does Richard Simpson intend to ensure that when ministers make promises about the release of information, they stick by those promises and deliver when they said that they would? In March 2000, the \"Scottish Climate Change Programme Consultation\" was published. On page 10, the Executive promised to produce, with effect from 1998, an annual inventory of Scottish greenhouse gases. Given the importance of those figures and the fact that this is the year of the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg, is it not a disgrace that the most recent figures date back to 1998? That is not to say that information does not exist. It has sat on Ross Finnie's desk for months. A Scottish Executive memo that has come into my hands makes it clear that no figures will be available until the end of March at the earliest. Why are those figures not being published? What bad news is being hidden? How will the bill stop such activity?</p><p>Perhaps the minister will also tell me how the bill will change the Executive's working practices. On 8 October 2001, I submitted three parliamentary questions about a large number of infraction proceedings that the European Commission had initiated because Scotland was considered to have broken European laws.</p><p>Incredibly, it took Jim Wallace until 28 December to tell me that he was not prepared to release the information. It took him a full 81 days to tell me that he would keep the information secret and yet I was able to secure information directly from the European Commission, through the offices of my good friend Ian Hudgton MEP. How is it that <place-holder colnum=\"5486\"/> Margot Wallstr&#246;m, the European Commissioner for the Environment, is prepared to provide specific information on infraction proceedings involving Scotland, but the minister with responsibility for freedom of information in Scotland is not?</p><p>Perhaps in summing up Richard Simpson will be good enough to tell me whether the bill will ensure that the Executive will not be so secretive with such information. There is no point in spouting on about the intent of a bill if it does not deliver a change in culture and practice. There is no doubt that without changing the culture of secrecy, there will be no change. Changes in culture require to be driven by leadership from the top. It is time for the ministers to show such leadership and to ensure that their own practices are an example to others.</p><p>PFI and PPP issues have been raised this morning.

Although it is true that many jobs will be created, equally significant is the fact, which Alasdair Morrison confirmed, that the project will have the capacity to produce 600 megawatts of clean green Scottish energy. That <place-holder colnum=\"5436\"/> 600 megawatts, which represents about 10 per cent of Scotland's energy needs, is equivalent to half the electricity production of Torness but will cost only a fraction of what it cost to build Torness. When one considers the downsides of nuclear energy and the need to dispose of nuclear waste, there is no question but that renewable energy by far outstrips nuclear energy in terms of value for money.</p><p>Compared with nuclear energy, the environmental case for renewables is overwhelming and needs no further explanation but, given the scale of the development, that is not to say that Lewis will not have any environmental difficulties. Alasdair Morrison was right to say that we should let the people there decide what they want to do.</p><p>The Isle of Lewis project is a huge opportunity for renewables in Scotland. However, we have seen false dawns before. Companies have invested and people have been ready to go, but it has turned out to be yet another damp squib. We cannot let that be true on this occasion. We must maximise employment opportunities to the benefit of the whole Scottish economy. It would be a sin if the turbines to be driven by the Western Isles wind were to come from somewhere such as Denmark.</p><p>Denmark has reaped the economic benefits from the 15,000 jobs in wind turbine manufacture that should have been ours. With 25 per cent of Europe's potential for renewables, Scotland should have had a natural market. We cannot lose out on the next generation of renewables. This evening, I would like to hear from the ministers what the Executive's strategy will be to ensure that turbines are developed and manufactured in Scotland for the benefit of Scotland.</p><p>It can be only a matter of time before we have the announcement of the biggest offshore wind farm in Scotland. The Executive must ensure that Scotland is seen as Europe's green powerhouse not only on the supply side but on the manufacturing side.</p><p>The decision to base this project in the Western Isles is very much linked to the development of the Celtic ring, as discussed by Alasdair Morrison.

I apologise to him as I did not fulfil my duties: I should have signed his motion, but I did not notice it until it appeared in today's business bulletin.</p><p>For some time, the Scottish Executive environment and rural affairs department and the ministers at its head have argued that there are reasons of economic efficiency for the moves that they are making. The department might argue that&#8212;although I think that Brian Monteith made some good arguments to the contrary&#8212;but the moves, whether they are efficient and effective for the department, are certainly not efficient or effective for farmers, who will suffer following the reorientation of services.<place-holder colnum=\"4772\"/></p><p>As we are more than aware, farmers throughout Scotland have put up with a hell of a lot in the past few years. They have been through the mill with BSE, E coli, salmonella and foot-and-mouth disease&#8212;the list could go on. After all those problems in the farming industry, the one thing that we should not do is remove services from farmers' communities, where their businesses are based. This is the time, more than any other in the farming industry's history, when farmers need support. To start a process of centralisation, when&#8212;instead of that&#8212;many more people are required to give help on the ground, beggars belief. The way in which the department is dealing with farmers, particularly in the areas affected by the forthcoming changes, indicates an approach that is not customer oriented, but that stems from a culture of introspection.</p><p>I want to comment on what Sylvia Jackson said about the choice of locations. I, too, could argue that Stirling would be a better base than Perth, but if we pursue such arguments, we are allowing ourselves to be divided and ruled. In the circumstances, we cannot argue for different locations, one against the other. Everyone who represents all the communities concerned should tell the minister clearly and in very strong terms that we do not accept the decision that has been taken and that we ought to reconsider how we deliver services in future.</p><p>It is all well and good for the Executive to come out with grand policies on agricultural strategy&#8212;I thought that some of that was good and I agreed with some of it, but I also disagreed with a lot of it. In any case, decisions such as the one that we are discussing begin to undermine all the strategic documents that have been produced, because of their effect on farmers in the communities concerned.</p><p>Brian Monteith mentioned particular problems in west Stirlingshire. The problems that exist around such communities as Balfron and Strathblane relate not only to the extra travel time or the cost of fuel involved in making a longer journey; when farmers in such areas are not on their farms doing the work that they should be doing, they require to bring in labour&#8212;and cover the additional labour costs&#8212;so that work on their farms may continue.</p><p>Brian Monteith also spoke about information technology and demographics&#8212;farmers who are a bit older and who are unsure whether they should enter the IT world and send stuff down the line. Those were good points, but even if all farmers were IT-literate, the decision to move the department's offices at this time would still be a bad one.</p><p>There is anger, disbelief and disillusionment in the farming community. If the minister is saying that that does not exist, or that there is not real <place-holder colnum=\"4773\"/> concern out there, he is putting his head in the sand. I hope that he can come up with answers to some of the questions that have been put to him.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13262553", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Environment and Rural Affairs Department Offices (Closures)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Brian Monteith and congratulate him on securing the debate.

An absolute guarantee must be included&#8212;and the guarantee ain't there&#8212;that Scottish Water will not be able to become a private company without the passing of primary legislation and full parliamentary scrutiny. That is a fundamental issue of parliamentary democracy. <i>[Interruption.]</i> <place-holder colnum=\"4549\"/></p><p>Members say that Ross Finnie called Scottish Water a company, but the Executive has done that several times, including once in an answer to John McAllion a couple of weeks ago, so some Freudian slips are being made.</p><p>It is generally understood and accepted that the water industry requires unprecedented levels of investment. The Executive estimates that the investment requirement is about &#163;2 billion in the next four years. How are charges to be kept under control? We know that the water industry commissioner&#8212;the WIC&#8212;has demanded efficiency savings of &#163;135 million, yet charges are still expected to rise by up to 25 per cent in the East of Scotland Water area and the West of Scotland Water area.</p><p>Although the WIC and the minister are confident that the efficiency savings of &#163;135 million from operating costs can be delivered, people are sceptical about whether such savings are achievable. It is assumed that much of those savings will come from job losses, but as the minister told the committee on 14 November:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The real trick is how we achieve the other savings\".&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Transport and the Environment Committee</i>, 14 November 2001; c 2299.]</p><p>I hope that job losses are kept to a minimum and I hope for the charge payers' sake that such savings do not prove to be a trick too far and an unachievable illusion.</p><p>The industry worries that the scale of proposed job losses could leave it short of vital skills and put health and safety in jeopardy. As we debate the issue, we can be sure that the public's primary concern is the level of charge that they will be expected to pay. What more can be done to keep charges down? The main driver for increasing charges is the extraordinary level of capital works that are being financed from current revenue by the existing authorities. For example, in a letter dated 5 November, West of Scotland Water said that in the current financial year, it had a capital programme of &#163;187 million, of which &#163;96 million, or 51.3 per cent, came direct from revenue. That picture is replicated in the two other authorities.</p><p>According to figures that the WIC has supplied, the level of capital finance from current revenue is estimated to be more than &#163;300 million for each of the next four years. Paying in the short term for capital works directly from current revenue is the real driver for increasing charge levels. What can the Executive do about that? What is the alternative? For starters, if even an element of the &#163;350 million that is committed from current revenue to pay for capital improvements were used for longer-term borrowing, the impact on the charge payer could be kept down significantly.</p><p>I will now raise a fundamental issue of <place-holder colnum=\"4550\"/> discrimination and unfairness to Scotland that needs to be dealt with to sort out the problem of inherited debt levels and leave ample room for new borrowing.</p><p>At the time of reorganisation of the water industry in England, when the industry was privatised, the debt of the former public utilities was written off. The slate was wiped clean to allow the new organisation to get the best possible start. Prior to reorganisation in the south, the water industry received benefits amounting to &#163;9.2 billion&#8212;&#163;1.5 billion of aggregated direct cash support and tax allowances of &#163;7.7 billion. Those figures are not SNP figures, but figures taken from the Transport and Environment Committee's report into the water industry which, on page 31, describes that cash support as a \"green dowry\". The background factors and debt profile for Scotland are not dissimilar to those of England at the time of reorganisation in that the current debt level in Scotland, as at 31 March, was &#163;1.9 billion.

Many column inches have been written recently about cronyism and job creation for the boys. The passing of the bill is an opportunity for a Liberal Democrat minister to put himself beyond reproach in this regard. More important, it is a <place-holder colnum=\"4551\"/> golden opportunity for the Scottish Parliament to show, in the clearest of terms, that the appointments procedure to public bodies in Scotland is as transparent as it can be and that it operates fairly. Ross Finnie can do that by accepting the amendments that the SNP will lodge at stage 2.</p><p>The first amendment that we will lodge is to ensure that the democratic legitimacy of local authority councillors is recognised and that Scotland's councillors are represented on the board. That would strengthen local democracy and ensure that at least some directly elected people are represented on the board.</p><p>I am glad that the minister seems to be giving way on the second point on which we plan to lodge an amendment, which is that non-executive directors should be in charge of the board. The third amendment will propose that members of the board be selected on the basis that is outlined in the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) (Scotland) Bill and that the Scottish Parliament be provided with the opportunity to approve or veto appointments.</p><p>It is an absolute precondition for the SNP that Scottish Water remains in public hands. Although it is proper for the new entity to be expected to operate in a more commercial manner, it will be formed as a traditional non-departmental public body or quango. With more than 5,000 employees and an annual revenue spend of almost &#163;1 billion, it will be the largest quango that Scotland has seen. The shape and form of Scottish Water will be vital to ensuring that it is the outstanding success that Scotland deserves. It will be interesting to hear from the minister, in his closing speech, what consideration is being given to other public sector models. For instance, what level of consideration is being given to forming Scottish Water as a not-for-profit trust?</p><p>The minister discussed how charities are to be treated and the impact that the bill will have on them. My colleague Richard Lochhead will explore that issue further. I ask the minister to agree that it cannot be right for an organisation such as Rachel House, the children's hospice for Scotland in my home town of Kinross, to be required to lose the equivalent of two full-time nurses as a direct result of the bill. That should not happen. I make a genuine and heartfelt plea to the minister to take another look at that issue before untold damage is done throughout Scotland. We need to have an impact assessment, which Richard Lochhead raised in his intervention on the minister.</p><p>Finally, I leave the Executive with the clearest of messages. The SNP's support at stage 3 will be dependent on an absolute guarantee being written clearly into the bill that before the decision is taken to create Scottish Water as a private company, the <place-holder colnum=\"4552\"/> decision will be the subject of full parliamentary scrutiny through primary legislation. The Executive will get no blank cheques from the SNP on this issue and no carte blanche to do as it pleases.

It is also true to say that there is support for action, as witnessed by the 10,000-signature petition that calls for wildlife crime legislation. Such legislation is urgent because it is well known that wildlife criminals are targeting Scotland since tougher laws have been implemented in England. Wildlife <place-holder colnum=\"3880\"/> criminals now view Scotland as a soft touch. It is time that the Executive acted to sort out what Donald Dewar called a national disgrace. There will be great disappointment in many parts of Scotland that no timetable was mentioned today.</p><p>The issue of modernising SSSIs is another area where reform is desperately needed. Under the current system of designating SSSIs, wildlife has continued to decline on many protected sites. It is also true that the people who live and work in the countryside are concerned that those designations affect their livelihoods. They await action, not more words.</p><p>There is a pressing requirement to introduce a much stronger voice for local communities, local authorities and landowners, to improve consultation with them on the designation and management of SSSIs and to ensure much more open and transparent decision making. Crucially, we need to sweep away much of the time-consuming and confusing bureaucracy, but we do not yet have a timetable for doing that.</p><p>Those matters were glaring omissions from the recently announced programme for government and nothing has changed today. Why is that? I hate to say it, but we told you so. The lack of action was inevitable from the day that Ross Finnie was appointed as Minister for Environment and Rural Development. At that time, we pointed out that&#8212;through no fault of his own&#8212;Mr Finnie's portfolio was overloaded. We asked how he could be expected to deal with the fishing industry and the catastrophe of foot-and-mouth disease and to guide through two water bills, at the same time as taking action on his environmental responsibilities.</p><p>The lack of action is visible to everyone in the failure to act on commitments in \"The Nature of Scotland\". We warned of the potential for conflicts of interest. Unfortunately, those have been only too visible in the decision to give the go-ahead to new genetically modified crop trials at Munlochy or the refusal to concede a public inquiry into the contentious issue of sea cage fish farming. The pending coronation of the new First Minister is the perfect opportunity to correct the wrong and muddle-headed decision to combine portfolios and to ensure that there is a dedicated minister for the environment, who will champion environmental concerns and ensure that the Executive adopts an integrated stewardship approach.</p><p>What is stewardship about? At its simplest, stewardship is the notion of entrusting people with the responsibility to care for the community to which they belong, for the land they own and work on and for other living things. The concept also involves a strong culture of pride in the things that are special about Scotland. By necessity, it means Government, individuals, communities and organisations&#8212;public and private&#8212;taking a pride <place-holder colnum=\"3881\"/> in Scotland. It means that Government must recognise that, for all to thrive, the nation has a responsibility to live within particular boundaries. Those boundaries need not be onerous for Scotland.</p><p>Stewardship simply requires Government and the nation to accept that future generations have a legitimate interest&#8212;to ensure that valuable assets that past generations helped to create for us, such as our natural heritage, can be passed on in good order for future generations. It also means that Government must act not only for the good of individuals or organisations, or for its own benefit, but to increase the common good. In recent days, when the press has been full of accusations of cronyism, some quarters would do well to pay heed to that ethos.</p><p>Government must also recognise that we might have to accept a reasonable constraint on our freedom to act, but that does not need to mean a welter of new regulation. On the contrary, if a greater sense of individual responsibility, common good and recognition of our mutual obligations can be fostered, there might be fewer requirements for burdensome regulation and legislation.</p><p>A stewardship approach by the Executive would inevitably lead to some searching and fundamental questions about whether funds are being used for the common good and about how the decision-making framework can be developed to take account of the interests of future generations and the species with which we share the place that we call Scotland.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-2444.2, to leave out from \", and agrees\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and the many open ended commitments in the policy statement <i>The Nature of Scotland</i>; calls on the Executive to publish a timetable for the introduction of a Wildlife Crime Bill and a modernised system for the protection and management of Sites of Special Scientific Interest; records its concerns over the portfolios of rural development and environment continuing to be the responsibility of the same Minister, and further calls on the Executive to adopt an integrated 'stewardship' approach to the development and implementation of its policies in regard to the natural heritage and resources of Scotland.\"</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13260257", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Natural Heritage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am so concerned about it that I was the only person to mention it during the programme for government debate, unlike any Government minister or back bencher from the Liberal Democrats or the Labour party.

Safe to say that in the early days in December 1999 there was a lot of youthful enthusiasm about our vision for the development of a roll-on-roll-off ferry service from Rosyth to the continent and the speed with which it could be achieved.</p><p>We are a bit more hard-bitten and cynical these days. We are certainly frustrated about how long it takes for the wheels of progress to turn.</p><p>The purpose of my motion is to ensure that parties in Scotland are seen to be pulling in the same direction, to ensure that a Rosyth to Zeebrugge service becomes a reality, to provide a focus for all our efforts and not only to see the service operating but to give it every chance of being the undoubted success that it can be.</p><p>It was also my intention to ensure that nobody&#8212;the Government and the various agencies in particular&#8212;sits back on their laurels, pats themself on the back and thinks, \"That's that then. The service is on its way. We can all relax now.\" This is not the time for relaxation; it is a time for even greater effort if the port of Rosyth is to deliver all that it can for the Scottish economy.</p><p>Last time we debated this subject I talked about the development of the ferry service being important because of the high level of exports that our small nation sends to the continent. If that was important in December 1999, it is certainly doubly important now. In December 1999 the economy was at the peak of its cycle. Since then, there has been a general economic slow-down, which has been made much worse by the horrific events of 11 September and the current conflict in Afghanistan.<place-holder colnum=\"3719\"/></p><p>The development of the Rosyth port will produce an immediate benefit through the creation of construction jobs. The improved access to our major trading partners in Europe that will be created can only enhance the competitiveness of Scotland's exporting companies and provide a much-needed boost to Scotland's tourism.</p><p>What has happened since December 1999? Action has been taken and movement has been achieved, albeit that it has probably proved to be more challenging than the \"future challenges\" that the Minister for Transport and Planning outlined at that time. There has been a study of the market, an examination of how best to attract ferry operators and a competition to select an operator&#8212;and Superfast Ferries from Greece has been selected.</p><p>I pay a sincere tribute to the owners and management of Superfast, who have conducted themselves with the utmost dignity and patience as the story of securing the vital resources for the required infrastructure at Rosyth has ground wearily along. When, in May, Superfast brought its magnificent new ferry to Rosyth to demonstrate its product, it effectively threw down the gauntlet to the Government to deliver the cash to do the job. Superfast declared loud and clear that it has the ambition to invest in the potential of Rosyth. It was up to the Government to match that ambition. Without Superfast's commitment and professionalism, I doubt whether the project would be as near to potential lift-off as it is now.</p><p>That message from Superfast should have provided a wake-up call to everyone in the Government to ensure that they did what was required when it was required, but since May there has been rumour after rumour about delay, failure to submit applications timeously, contracts being late going out for tender and behind the scenes shenanigans. For example, everyone will know by now that, in a disgraceful attempt to protect Hull, P &amp; O and the Associated British Ports tried hard to stop the &#163;12 million freight facilities grant from the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions being allocated to Rosyth.</p><p>Thankfully, the attempt was to no avail and we heard yesterday that the &#163;12 million cheque has now been signed. Unfortunately, it has not yet been posted&#8212;and cannot be until the European Commission gives the go-ahead. I do not know who put the bite on the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, although I could have a pretty good guess about who it would be&#8212;there are some major players in Fife. Whoever it was, I say well done to them.</p><p>I have it on pretty good authority that EC approval is all but a formality. It is required only to tick a few boxes, and approval will be forthcoming in the next two or three weeks. What intrigues me, <place-holder colnum=\"3720\"/> if EC approval is such a formality, is why it is suddenly an issue now. Why are we dealing with the signing-off process at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour? If all that had been dealt with earlier, the recent anxieties could have been avoided.</p><p>The questions that I would like the minister to answer this evening are these: who is responsible for the clearance from the EC&#8212;the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions or the Scottish Executive? Has the official request been submitted to the EC? If so, on what date? These are important questions as the plan could still go badly wrong if the crucial deadlines are not met.</p><p>I will conclude by laying down three challenges to help ensure that Rosyth is able, for Scotland's sake, to reach its full potential. Let us make sure that Wendy Alexander kicks a few butts in VisitScotland to ensure that, in the next couple of weeks, it is active in Holland, Belgium and the low countries, selling the new direct service into Scotland. Get VisitScotland to contact all Scotland's tour operators to help finance supplementary brochures to advertise the service. Undoubtedly, because of the delays, brochures will be produced that will contain no information about the direct route. That initiative is important to ensuring that it gets off to a good start.</p><p>I ask Lewis Macdonald or Sarah Boyack to go to the Baltic and Scandinavian countries and sell the benefits of the direct service to Rosyth to those countries. They should do their Christmas shopping in Tallinn or Copenhagen, get them on board and bring Scotland home a present that we could all do with.</p><p>It is time to sort out the mess that is the missing rail link from Dunfermline to Stirling. It is vital to creating the freight transport hub that can bring added value to the way we do business with Europe and can help get freight off our roads. When all that has been achieved, ministers can tell their civil servants that the programme has been delivered and that they can relax and perhaps even take an afternoon off. In the meantime, in anticipation of the EC approval, it would be churlish of me not to say well done to Sarah Boyack. I know that it may have been a struggle, but, in the end, it will all be worth while.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13260016", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rosyth-Zeebrugge Ferry Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank everyone who signed the motion for this evening's debate.

I, too, took the opportunity to sign it on the morning of the summit.</p><p>The signing of a declaration is all well and good. However, Michael Grade, who chaired the summit, was right when he said that political leaders needed not just to make bold statements, but to take bold actions. There can be no question but that bold action is required around the seas of Scotland. We do not have to look far to see where that bold action is required. I know that the minister is personally committed on many issues, but infraction proceedings have been initiated against Scotland in a number of areas to do with the seas. Some of the proceedings relate to bathing water directives, others to habitat directives and eutrophic waters. That can only be of concern, particularly because of the problems that we have with agricultural diffuse run-off and the blooms that it creates. Bold action is required to deal with those problems.</p><p>The plea from the summit was loud and clear: Governments must be bold in their action and they must take a much more strategic and holistic approach if we are to deliver the environmental benefits and improvements that are so desperately required for this most important part of the world's ecosystem.</p><p>At the summit, Robert Napier, the chief executive of WWF-UK, provided us with some poignant statistics.

However, it is now time for bold action&#8212;action that will bring Scotland into line with its international obligations and that will reduce pollution from oil-related activities or chemical output. We should follow the lead of nations such as Australia, which has taken a holistic and strategic view on the issue.</p><p>Finally, we need bold action to sort out the scandal that is Sellafield, which is casting a nuclear, radioactive shadow over not just our nation of Scotland, but our international neighbours in Ireland. It is time for us to stand full square with the Irish in their fight with the UK Government to have the mixed oxide plant at Sellafield closed and to stop radioactivity flowing out of it, which is ridiculous.

"80142"}, {"body": "<p>It is good that there is recognition on page 36 of the forward strategy document that the <place-holder colnum=\"3058\"/> problem of climate change exists. Given that agriculture, land use change and forestry account for at least 25 per cent of Scotland's carbon emissions, it is startingly obvious that farming must play a crucial part in reducing Scotland's carbon emissions. Therefore, it is not good enough that action point 52 says only that more research will be carried out and that help will be provided to farmers with more flood risk planning. That is good, but not good enough.</p><p>The Executive's review work estimates that the real cost of the farming system to the UK economy is around &#163;2.3 billion. BSE and new variant CJD cost around &#163;607 million and greenhouse gases cost around &#163;1.1 billion. However, there is no real comment on those figures, despite the fact that they represent 48 per cent of agriculture's total external costs. Given that the major emissions of climate change gases come from agriculture, forestry or land use change, the minister must tell us what further practical action the Executive proposes to take to begin to reduce those emissions. For instance, what action does it intend to take to protect high-carbon soils, such as Scotland's peat reserves, from exploitation?</p><p>Scotland could learn a thing or two from New Zealand, where the options that are currently under review include converting agriculture to forestry, improving livestock nutrition, using selective breeding of animals for reduced methane production and reducing direct fossil fuel use. The Executive should consider those options and I am surprised that the strategy does not contain more about them.</p><p>I turn to agri-environment measures. In comments about the lack of resources allocated to agri-environment measures, the National Farmers Union of Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Farmers are now coming up with good ideas and want to make environmental improvements. But the funding is not there. Our Government simply isn't taking the environment seriously enough. This needs to be put right.\"</p><p>Many farmers have benefited from the measures, but when Scotland is compared to other countries in Europe, it does not fare well. The combined budget for the old and new schemes, including organic conversion aid, comes to about &#163;30 million a year. In comparison, Ireland invested &#163;100 million in agri-environment measures, Wales invested &#163;80 million and, from what we are led to believe, England has virtually an open cheque book. The World Wildlife Fund's submission on the strategy suggested&#8212;as did Robin Harper&#8212;that Scotland has the lowest level of support in Europe for farmers who convert to organic production.</p><p>An examination of the important rural stewardship scheme, which was discussed earlier, reveals difficulties. In 2001, the number of <place-holder colnum=\"3059\"/> applications to the scheme has been understandably and inevitably low, as a result of the delayed launch and of foot-and-mouth disease, but there have been 476 applications for a total of &#163;28.5 million. However, a maximum of only &#163;5 million has been made available. Therefore, it is likely that the level of success among applicants will be low&#8212;around 10 to 15 per cent.</p><p>It is patently obvious that the scheme, which is designed to help the environment, will be inaccessible to most farmers. The position is exacerbated for hill farmers and small tenant crofters because of the system used to rank rural stewardship scheme applications, which favours mixed or arable farms by giving credit for undertaking management options specific to arable farming. None of the credits is helpful to hill farmers or small crofters. Therefore, the rural stewardship scheme is likely to be skewed towards the Lothians, Fife and the Borders to the disadvantage of, for example, the Stirlingshire or Perthshire hill farmers, or the crofters in the Highlands or on the west coast of Scotland.</p><p>In conclusion, we need more action on climate change. That is a crucial area for the future of the planet and it needs more action from the Executive. We need action so that we can be the best in Europe through the rural stewardship scheme and to get spending up to the level in the rest of the United Kingdom. We do not need more consultation, more review, more research or more delay; we need more action. We call for that today.</p>", "hdate": "2001-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258306", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection: \"A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is good that there is recognition on page 36 of the forward strategy document that the   problem of climate change exists.

Such a move would be widely supported, and would help us deal much more effectively with environmental concerns on a strategic level. That bill also provides a vital opportunity to consider how best to deal with such matters as diffuse agricultural run-off and the growing problem of marine eutrophication, on which Scotland sadly continues to be in breach of its international commitments.</p><p>There will be disappointment that, following the Executive's publication of \"The Nature of Scotland: A Policy Statement\" earlier this year, no bills are being introduced to carry forward that excellent piece of work.

In December, a press notice from Mr Wilson said that the Executive is developing policy. Well, the Executive is still developing policy. I wonder how long the gestation period is for Executive policy. After all, it took the Executive 12 months to come back with the contribution that other people had made. Perhaps, when the minister sums up, he would be kind enough to let us know when we can expect specific action to flow from this process. When can we expect various changes to legislation, amendments to regulations, instructions to local authorities and&#8212;crucially&#8212;the resources for pump-priming for change? It is legitimate to ask what the time scale is and when we will see the programme for action. If it is true that the minister will shortly be issuing a policy document for discussion, what are we doing here today, discussing the subject? We may be returning soon to go through exactly the same process.</p><p>No one doubts the importance of the subject matter, but what is the purpose of this debate, other than to listen to the minister's navel-gazing wanderings? Mike Russell obviously struck a few chords: almost everyone on the Executive benches has had a go at him. He must have hit home with some of the truth.</p><p>At a recent architecture event, someone said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The purpose of building is to meet human needs. It is about creating places in which individuals can flourish, it is <place-holder colnum=\"745\"/> about reviving hope and realising potential in our communities and it is about helping to create and sustain a decent and inclusive society.\"</p><p>Those were the words of Allan Wilson, but he probably did not recognise them. He said them in Glasgow last December, or at least that is what the Executive's press notice says. Those are fine words and I hope that the minister means them&#8212;at least, I hope that he means what his press officer said. They are fine words, because one of the factors that will judge whether this debate has all been a waste of time is the specific plan of action that the Executive proposes, particularly for ecologically sustainable construction.</p><p>I particularly commend to the Executive the Finnish Government's programme for ecologically sustainable construction, which was introduced in 1998. In Finland, for the construction and property sectors, ecological construction is about paying much greater attention to such issues as the consumption of energy and water, waste disposal, indoor air quality, durability and the life cycle of buildings.</p><p>What have the Finns done? They have introduced a classification system for emissions from finishing materials to improve the indoor climate of buildings. They have ensured that half of their homes are connected to district heating schemes. They have instructed local authorities to incorporate ecological construction into their programmes for sustainable development. The construction industry has been directed to increase the use of renewable energy sources, and targets have been set for housing construction and the public sector. Two thirds of new single-family houses have heat-recovery systems fitted. Since 1970, all new buildings have had triple glazing fitted and a requirement for solar heating and geothermal heating is already built into the building regulations.</p><p>That is the sort of thing that we need to see being proposed in an action programme from the Executive. The Finns are ahead of us in so many other areas.

Those levels are where the real difference is made.</p><p>As the minister said, the EU's fifth environmental action programme, between 1992 and 1999, produced tangible results in member states. Some important improvements were made, such as cutting the industrial emissions of lead and mercury. Emissions of sulphur dioxide have been reduced, helping rivers and forests to recover from acidification. In most of the EU, sewerage and water treatment have been improved. I am aware that the EU's sixth environmental action programme, which covers the period until 2010, is the subject of Executive consultation. Before tackling the future, the Government should sort out its past failures. The EU might have been a driver of change, but it is a pity that, in many areas of delivery, successive UK Governments have not provided the vehicles for improvement.</p><p>I will take a few examples. Despite the introduction of a basic water quality standard&#8212;the bathing water directive&#8212;more than 25 beaches in Scotland still fail to come up to scratch. The requirements for such standards have been in place for decades. The original directive&#8212;76/160/EEC&#8212;dates back to 1976; so much for the track record of successive UK Governments in <place-holder colnum=\"504\"/> implementing Scotland's requirements under the European framework.</p><p>In 1991, the urban waste-water treatment directive came into force and set the time scales and standards for sewage collection and treatment. Despite a full decade having passed since then, in April this year, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion concerning this country's failure to fulfil its obligations under that directive. The Commission's main point of concern was the Executive's performance in dealing with eutrophic waters. If the case ends up in the European courts and the Executive loses, any fine or penalty will come out of the Scottish budget. The daft thing is that, under the current constitutional settlement, the Executive could not take the case to the court; incredibly, the UK Government would have to take up the case even if Scotland had to pay. That is another example of why the Parliament needs more powers.</p><p>The infraction cases that the UK has lost at the European Court of Justice have cost money and promoted our image as the dirty man of Europe. Eighteen of the 28 or so pending cases lie in the environment or transport arenas; so much for the UK Government standing up for Scotland in EU affairs.</p><p>Whether in relation to bathing waters, infraction proceedings, recycling targets or investment in renewable resources, the UK's performance on Scotland's behalf has been dreadful. Things will only get worse, because now we do not even have a dedicated environment minister. More than half the member states of the EU have a dedicated environment minister. Even countries as small as Malta, or countries that have a population as tiny as Iceland's realise the importance of having a dedicated minister for the environment. If ever there was a glaring example of why Scotland needs to represent herself at the top tables of Europe, it is the environment. The UK's track record of failure is there for all to see.

We support the view of Friends of the Earth that a separate Scottish GM advisory body is required. The Minister for Environment and Rural Development might deal with science that is similar to that which his UK Government counterpart deals with, but there can be no question that there are distinct economic and social circumstances in Scotland. More important, there is a distinct natural and agricultural background. Andy Kerr referred in particular to the crofting communities of Scotland. In the light of those differences, it is important to ensure that any advisory body acts properly and appropriately in advising ministers. That could be more efficiently achieved if a separate Scottish GM advisory body were established. There are separate bodies all over the place that advise ministers, so the nonsense from Murray Tosh about setting up another body is a red herring. There should be a body that is closer to ministers and that has a greater understanding of Scottish circumstances, rather than a body that is distant from ministers <place-holder colnum=\"346\"/> and which does not focus fully on Scottish requirements. Executive ministers have many advisory bodies.</p><p>Murray Tosh should look at the evidence.

On three separate occasions, Kenny MacAskill did not receive an answer from the minister. We want to protect and enshrine the Scottish position by having a separate advisory body.

That said, I was very disappointed to read the Executive's motion. The Executive says that it is committed, making progress and investing at record levels, but the motion does not give even a hint of a recognition that huge problems still exist with rural transport in Scotland. We heard only a tiny bit from the minister, at the very end of her speech, about some of the problems. If she wants more money in her budget, she could find it from the Barnett squeeze. The levels of expenditure in Scotland on transport over the next three years are due to grow by only 16.1 per cent compared with 23.1 per cent in England&#8212;that is a gap of &#163;180 million. She should go see the chancellor.</p><p>As far as complacency is concerned, either the Executive does not have a clue about the challenges faced by rural communities or it is beginning to believe its own spin. In the past couple of weeks, I have travelled throughout Scotland to gain first-hand experience of the type of problems that local people face. Let us begin in the north-east, with the town of Elgin, which is a good example of a rural town that could benefit hugely from greater integration and targeted investment.</p><p>Elgin sits on the main rail line between Inverness and Aberdeen&#8212;a rail line between two of Scotland's cities that serves many rural communities along its route. For a minor level of investment in the Orton loop, improvements at two platforms and some expenditure on modernising signalling, an hourly service could be achieved between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking 25 minutes off the journey, which could transform the service. That would have the benefit of taking the pressure off the A96, which the locals are screaming requires upgrading.</p><p>The A96 is bad enough, but the journey south on the A95 to link with the A9 at Aviemore is horrendous. The A95 is in no shape to handle the large number of trucks that travel up it each day. For example, the three major supermarkets in Elgin alone generate 30 trips per day on the route. Elgin also boasts many other national chains and superstores. All their trucks are trundling up and down the A95. Added to that mix is the volume of traffic generated by the whisky industry, which <place-holder colnum=\"191\"/> transports billions of pounds-worth of product on the route.</p><p>One notable malt distillery has more than &#163;2.5 billion-worth of product on its site alone. Incredibly, on the outskirts of Elgin town centre there is a redundant rail goods yard that is still in the ownership of Railtrack. Here is a prime example of where we could get goods moving on to rail from an A-class road. Here is an example of where a modal shift could be achieved for real and commitment to rural Scotland demonstrated.</p>", "hdate": "2001-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Surely no community in Scotland has seen so many barriers to achieving its potential erected as that on the Isle of Skye. Not only did it lose its airport in 1987, incredibly it was saddled with prohibitive costs to cross a private bridge. Furthermore, it costs &#163;22, even off peak, for two people and a car to travel by CalMac ferry to Mallaig&#8212;only to be met with only three trains per day into Glasgow, and one bus. The Executive parties promised to remove the tolls, but failed, and have left Skye with damaging additional costs. When the SNP says it will remove the tolls, it will.

Not only is it important to the south-west of Scotland, it is central to Scotland's economic wellbeing, yet it is starved of <place-holder colnum=\"192\"/> resources while the A5/A55 route from Holyhead gets countless millions. When will the Executive put up the &#163;75 million to bring the A75 up to an appropriate standard? Surely the foot-and-mouth crisis affecting Dumfries and Galloway is enough to make the Executive cough up the required amount. It is time to match the ambition of the people of Dumfries and Galloway. It is time to match the ambition of the ferry companies. Indeed, it is time to match the ambition of the Irish, who are investing heavily in their side of the route.

It is fair to say that Fife's Labour council has not always thought of or acted in the best interests of the people. That is especially true for recycling. I hear what Scott Barrie says about improvements that have been undertaken, which are to be applauded. To be fair to Iain Smith, the north-east Fife Liberals did quite a good job of putting together the recycling packages there. It would be interesting to look furth of Fife and see the picture elsewhere.</p><p>It is right to say that the European Community's new directive on the landfill of waste will impact on our local councils. As a former council leader, I know how difficult it is for councils to balance the increasing pressures to invest in new waste management systems with the increasing landfill taxes that do not allow them the freedom to do that. The Accounts Commission report&#8212;Iain Smith is reading it right now&#8212;shows that SNP councils perform better than most, even in difficult circumstances.</p><p>In my years at Perth and Kinross District Council, we invested quite heavily in recycling. Perth and Kinross has wheelie bins, but it also has the best recycling record in Scotland. Therefore, recycling is less to do with wheelie bins, and more to do with the mechanisms that are in put in place behind them to support recycling. SNP-run Angus Council has also increased its recycling capacity year in, year out, as has Clackmannanshire Council. The only SNP council that is going the other way is Falkirk Council, but we have been in control there for only a few weeks. I am sure that that situation will be reversed in the coming years.</p><p>Reducing dependency on landfill has been one of the SNP's political priorities for many years. Our 1999 local government manifesto committed us to prioritising a reduction in the use of landfill sites and to adopting alternative strategies to deal with waste.</p><p>SEPA's national waste strategy has been introduced. It sets out a framework to shift fundamentally the way in which Scotland's waste is managed. I am glad that the new minister is listening to the debate. I say to her that I have <place-holder colnum=\"938\"/> received feedback from local authorities and others involved that some of the local authorities that are involved in the national waste strategy are severely dragging their heels and are brought into the process with some difficulty. From the Executive's perspective, and perhaps that of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, work must be done to champion the cause and to bring on board the councils that are not so keen on the idea.</p><p>The landfill tax that the Tories introduced and which Gordon Brown has increased every year is making it difficult for local authorities to make the changes necessary to allow the principle of the six Rs to apply. In 1997, &#163;23 million was paid in landfill tax. Today, it is estimated that we are paying about &#163;40 million.</p><p>As with many other issues that the Scottish Parliament debates, surely the answer is that instead of sending that &#163;40 million to Gordon Brown and the London Treasury, we should keep it here in Scotland, to be used by the Scottish Parliament, through the Executive. The revenues could be spent here on our recycling activities. They could help us to upgrade facilities and aid councils in meeting the exacting requirements of the European Union's landfill directive. They could also help councils to invest in new technologies, such as composting and segregated waste streams. In addition, we could consider the hypothecation of tax revenue. That is not SNP policy; it is my own thought.</p><p>The Presiding Officer is indicating that it is time for me to wind up, so I will do that.</p><p>Local councils need resources to invest in directing waste to solutions other than landfill. The problem is that the year-on-year settlements that local government gets do not make that easy. That goes for Fife Council and every other council in Scotland. It is a pity that other small nations can do it. The difference is that they have control of their own nation's resources.

The Minister for Rural Development is in the midst of a crisis of quite extraordinary proportions. That is accepted by the Executive in the wording of its motion for this afternoon's debate on rural Scotland. Given that the Executive has acknowledged the crisis, and given that Ross Finnie has to deal with it, how can it be right that he is expected to absorb the environment portfolio into his already overburdened work load?

The minister should be devoting all his time, energy and abilities to dealing with his current work load. Our farmers and fishermen expect nothing less.</p><p>The decision is also deeply concerning from an environmental perspective. There is a huge job to be done in the environment brief and there are many important negotiations to be undertaken in the European Community. The immediate issues, which any environment minister must get their teeth into, include the shocking record on recycling. The target that has been set is 25 per cent by 2000, yet 13 councils in Scotland are still at only 4 per cent. Scotland's record on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is equally concerning. The latest figures show that Scotland's emissions are going up while England's go down. This week, we have had a report on the condition of our bathing waters and beaches, which shows that we are still one of the dirty men of Europe. Much work also needs to be done on organic waste and encouraging renewable resources.</p><p>The First Minister has received a letter from Scottish Environment LINK, which puts the matter quite succinctly. It highlights the negotiations that will be needed on the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy and continues:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Furthermore, who will speak for Scotland in vital EU negotiations on issues such as the sixth Environmental Action Plan and lead Scotland's international effort on sustainable development?\"</p><p>That deals with the question of the work load, but what about conflicts of interest?

It is inconceivable that governmental authorities will be able to refuse to provide information if it will cost more than &#163;500 to do so. That point is particularly relevant when it comes to the provision of environmental information. Ordinary citizens, when faced with threats to their quality of life, must be able to access information that will provide a counterbalance against organisations that are often stronger than they are; which have effective public relations units; and which represent either a perceived or real threat. That is true for citizens and communities who attempt to halt the erection of a mobile phone mast, or to stop the spreading or dumping of harmful waste in their area, or for people who are concerned about the long-term effects of living in the shadow of a nuclear or petrochemical plant.</p><p>Often, the only weapon that individuals or campaigning groups have with which to arm themselves, in what often are unequal struggles, is information. That information is often detailed and complex. The high costs that are being proposed will act as a debarment to, or a brake on, the ability of individuals or communities to defend their quality of life. The Executive cannot allow that to happen. I implore the minister to have a good look at the issue. He should not let his civil servants get away with this. By better management of information systems through a policy of genuine openness, the Executive should be able to find efficiencies that would cover any additional burdens. The experiences of Sweden and the Netherlands show that costs can be reduced through freedom of information, rather than increased. Efficiencies should be used to overcome the burdens.

Even if the Commission were to accept the somewhat flawed proposals for a separate vessel-owning company, the routes would still be exposed to a form of competitive tendering. I hope that, if the tendering becomes a reality, any tender submitted by CalMac will be successful.</p><p>This process could, unfortunately, result in the prospect of a foreign operator winning tenders for some or all of CalMac's routes in Scotland. We could end up, for example, with the preferred bidder status being awarded to a Greek ferry operator, as happened for the proposed Rosyth continental ferry on the east of Scotland. If a foreign-owned company were to win the tender for the network there is real&#8212;and I have to say understandable&#8212;concern that the work force may be faced with a drive for lower wages at the expense of staff and safety.

Indicators should become as regular a part of public monitoring information as are the unemployment figures. As the minister stated, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions recognises that indicators are a vital part of sustainable development, in order that we can keep track of progress in a way that is clear, comprehensive and useful to a wider audience. I have counted the indicators.

A year ago, in February 2000&#8212;the last time we debated the issue&#8212;the then Minister for Transport and the Environment announced that Scotland would have its own set of indicators. In March 2000, in a speech on integrating environmental issues, she said that she expected to report in the early summer of 2000 on indicators of sustainable development in Scotland. In a news release on 9 August, she said that she would publish a consultation document on sustainable Scotland later that month.</p><p>That was followed by an answer to a parliamentary question on 9 October, when the minister said that there would be a contract to develop proposals for indicators&#8212;that is similar to what we have heard from the minister today. There is a serious gap in the Government's toolkit. We have had an explanation about what is going on, but we want substantial progress.

After all, even the Tories managed to do that in 1995.</p><p>The warnings of a public policy disaster were loud and clear from the beginning, but the minister chose not to listen; instead, she stumbled into a catalogue of errors over the tendering process. The result is the immediate threat to between 400 and 500 jobs, with 3,500 jobs potentially under threat as the loss of economies of scale begins to bite across local government. The council tax payer will be left to pick up the tab for redundancy costs and the loss of surplus income from the contracts.</p><p>The minister also failed to heed the many warnings about the quantities detailed for materials. Those figures were seriously flawed. In many cases, the base quantities differed from historical actuals by as much as 60 per cent. Incredibly, the Executive posted out the base quantities information, which was to be used in its assessment model, only after the deadline for the submission of tenders. That was far too late to allow tenderers to use it to inform their bids.</p><p>Those are the reasons why Scottish councils took the extraordinary step of going to court to challenge a decision of a Government that most of them support. It is important to note that, unlike <place-holder colnum=\"1281\"/> the minister's media spin, the courts were sympathetic to the views of the local authorities. Lord Macfadyen found that the local authority consortia had established a prima facie case and that existing tenderers, who had used accurate historical information, were disadvantaged because of the grossly overstated quantities.</p><p>What was the impact of those serious errors on the bidding process? For the north-west unit, Highland Council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We estimate that the overall effect of the revision of the quantities used would have the effect of slicing a staggering &#163;70 million from our tender assessment.\"</p><p>The south-west unit estimates a reduction of &#163;60 million, the north-east estimates one of &#163;21 million and the south-east estimates one of &#163;20 million. As the minister knows, the bids could have been reduced by those sums if the quantities had been properly stated. If the process not been flawed, the bids of the existing consortia could have been reduced by &#163;174 million over the five-year life of the contract.</p><p>Contrast that with the minister's hollow boasts in her press release of 23 January, when she said that she would save &#163;75 million over five years in comparison to the existing arrangements, and with her constant plea that the decision would save money. It could not be clearer: if she had heeded the advice of the majority in this Parliament, she could have saved an additional &#163;90 million over and above what she claimed was achievable.</p><p>What has the minister done, having got things so wrong? She has not taken steps to put them right; instead, she has compounded the errors by announcing an independent review, which is nothing of the sort. The so-called independent review has been undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a company that was a major part of the minister's performance audit group for the tender assessment panel and was substantially and materially involved in interviewing the organisations that had submitted bids. The review was not independent; it was&#8212;and was always intended to be&#8212;an internal whitewash.</p><p>There has been a genuine independent review, however&#8212;the one carried out by Trett Consulting for the Clyde Solway Consortium. That report's conclusion is very damaging to the minister's case. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is undoubtedly the most onerous contract we have ever reviewed. The Scottish Executive have endeavoured to abdicate all responsibility . . . The contract virtually decrees a master and serf relationship and in our opinion is an affront to fair and reasonable contract drafting.\"</p><p>The process has been an affront to justice and fairness and an affront to the Parliament. The actions of the minister have been an affront to the <place-holder colnum=\"1282\"/> position that she holds. In view of the evidence that is stacked against any claim that the process was fair or just, it is reasonable to ask what was driving the minister. What was her motivation? Was it that, come hell or high water, she was determined to reach her budget targets, regardless of who got in the way and regardless of the dangerous impact that that would have on jobs and public safety? This was a minister driven by fear to misjudgments and errors in an effort to reach her targets. If she had referred the matter to the Transport and the Environment Committee, she might have saved even more money and many people's jobs.</p><p>Those who vote against the SNP motion will show that they have confidence in the way in which this whole sorry mess has been handled. They will show that they believe that public safety will be best served, that the minister has gained best value for the taxpayer and that 3,500 jobs were not worth saving.

I know that much concern has been expressed in the past. For a couple of decades after the second world war, there was a major investment in hydro power by the North of Scotland Hydroelectric Board. That process was brought to an end in the early '60s, when the UK claimed that the future lay with cheap oil and nuclear power. Now, hydro is by far the cheapest source of electricity in Scotland and it supplies about 13 per cent of our needs.<place-holder colnum=\"1071\"/></p><p>In retrospect, I think that the hydroelectric power programme was a magnificent investment for a sustainable future. Sadly, no more plant was built and Scotland received more than its fair share of UK nuclear power. The UK gets about 20 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power, but the corresponding figure for Scotland is about 50 per cent. The development of RE in Scotland has been severely hampered by the nuclear industry. Oversupply of nuclear-generated capacity has been an excuse to cut Scotland out completely from the first two rounds of the UK's very modest renewable energy programme.</p><p>How do we ensure that Scotland becomes the world leader that we know it should be? At the moment, the Scottish Parliament has a limited remit to encourage RE in Scotland. I believe that Scotland will need to achieve the status of a normal nation in Europe before we begin the fundamental shift in attitudes and vision from the old policies of the UK Government that have left Scotland far behind in RE technologies. Only by achieving that status will it be possible for all to see that they can play their part in making Scotland Europe's green powerhouse.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13245085", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "George Lyon talked about the problems with the grid on the west coast of Scotland.

We are concerned that the Labour Minister for Transport is embarked upon an irreversible decision-making process that is unfair and unjust. She is set on a course of action that will have a seriously damaging impact on Scotland's capacity to maintain its trunk and local roads to a satisfactory standard, and on its ability to continue with a safe and reliable winter maintenance service. That view is supported widely in the chamber and across the political divides. Today, we ask members to support our motion, not only because their consciences demand it, but, more important, because it is in the interests of good government and best value for the public purse.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have heard much from new Labour about the need for joined-up government. We might not always like the <place-holder colnum=\"568\"/> soundbites, but no one could deny that the objectives are anything but laudable. However, when faced with the current set of proposals for the trunk road network, only one conclusion can be drawn; that all the talk of joined-up government is no more than a sham. This Parliament cannot allow itself to be blinded by that illusion. We must see the truth about the scale of the mistake that Labour may be about to make, because it is a mistake that will impact on almost every community in Scotland, as potentially thousands of jobs are lost, levels of service deteriorate, and there is chaos during winter emergencies.</p><p>I will provide some reasons why I believe that the route upon which the Executive is intent is fundamentally flawed. First, it is obvious from even a cursory glance at the evidence that no real attempt was made before, during or after the tendering process to assess the impact that awarding the work would have on the delivery of services at national and local levels.</p><p>To help me to assess the impact, I wrote to every local authority, and I received a plethora of replies. To give a flavour of the responses, I will quote what a few of them say about joined-up government and best value. For example, Stirling Council tells me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Private sector contractors maintaining the motorway and trunk road network, quite separate from the local road network, will create duplication of resources and increased costs to the public purse as economies of scale that are achieved by integrated service delivery are lost.\"</p><p>There are many other quotes from Labour-run councils that I could use, so here we have it&#8212;Labour councils the length and breadth of Scotland criticising their own Executive.</p><p>The immediate impact has been estimated at the loss of anything between 500 and 600 jobs, and anything up to 3,500 jobs once secondary employment issues are taken into account and the effects on economies of scale begin to bite, making direct labour organisations less competitive and unable to win other tender work. Inevitably, that will lead to the closure of local depots and quarries that often are significant employers, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>The Minister for Transport has singularly failed to examine the tendering process in an integrated manner. As Aberdeenshire Council put it:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Council firmly believe that the principles of Best Value across the public purse as a whole has been ignored by the Scottish Executive.\"</p><p>As a result, the Executive is in danger, by default, of privatising more jobs than the Tories managed to privatise in 18 years. Sarah Boyack said yesterday that the jobs issues were only rumours. If she had taken time to contact only a handful of local authorities, she would have discovered that <place-holder colnum=\"569\"/> she is living in a dream world. It is time that she woke up and faced the reality that is staring her in the face. Highland Council said in its letter to me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the council would have to shed about 200 staff. Perhaps 100 of these will end up being made redundant and 100 being transferred.\"</p><p>Scottish Borders Council tells me that it will have 50 redundancies, and there will be 30 in East Ayrshire, 28 in Stirling, 23 in Dumfries and 100 across Tayside.

More and more families are calling for children to be given greater protection when accessing or exiting school buses. We can raise the awareness of drivers and children, but such dreadful accidents will continue to happen. It should be the duty of the Parliament to attempt to extend protection to children when they are using school buses. Earlier this afternoon, Nora Radcliffe referred to the number of children who are injured or killed on roads in Scotland every year. I am sure we are all aware of accidents in our own areas, because they attract media attention.</p><p>The amendment would place a duty on local authorities to carry out a review of their area to consider where school bus priority routes could be introduced. It would also provide local authorities with the power to make an order that prohibited any motor vehicle from overtaking a stationary school bus on a designated school bus route. I have tried to create as flexible an amendment as possible, recognising some of the difficulties that may need to be overcome. I acknowledge that it is for local authorities to decide when the time is right for them to take the power to create school bus priority routes&#8212;giving local authorities such powers could be an important step in creating a safer environment for our children.</p><p>I congratulate FirstGroup plc, which has introduced schemes for school bus routes, particularly in Wales, and a yellow school bus service. Their documentation shows that, after research on road safety with schools, transporting children under supervision and in controlled conditions on a near door-to-door basis improves road safety. It also shows that congestion can be reduced by up to 20 per cent. This is about getting children to school reliably and on time and in a frame of mind to start the day and giving parents peace of mind.</p><p>Perhaps the minister finds that there are issues raised by the way that my amendment is drafted and, because we are at stage 3, I must consider those issues. I would like to hear from the minister whether, if the thrust of what the amendment is trying to achieve cannot be achieved at this stage, it can be looked at in the future.</p><p>I move amendment 4.</p>", "hdate": "2000-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13241947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: After section 71"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to my colleagues on the Transport and the Environment Committee for introducing this amendment at stage 3 of the bill.

We are not doing too badly in economic terms, despite the many barriers in our way. We are doing okay, but that is not good enough if we want to prosper and compete effectively in tomorrow's global market. To prosper&#8212;not just to do okay or to survive&#8212;we must remove the barriers that hinder Scotland from achieving her full economic potential.</p><p>Scotland is putting herself at a competitive disadvantage because we are not as well connected, internally or internationally, as we should be. For Scotland to prosper, we need to improve radically the way in which we move our materials, goods and people. Without a first-class transport infrastructure, how can we expect to compete effectively in global markets?</p><p>The Confederation of British Industry Scotland has said that business in Scotland needs high-quality, free-flowing interurban roads; a high-quality Scotland-England transport corridor; good road and rail connections to Scottish ports and airports; and good access to ports and airports outside Scotland, including the channel tunnels. However, it was Lex Gold of the Scottish Chamber of Commerce who said recently that Scotland had a transport infrastructure akin to that of a third-world country. Comparing the ambition with the reality as seen through the eyes of business people makes depressing reading. The reality of Scotland today is that we still have many barriers to overcome in relation to transport.</p><p>Let us consider some of the starker examples. The M8 is a complete joke of a motorway&#8212;a two-lane shambles, which is not even constructed to motorway standard between Baillieston and Newhouse. The Forth road bridge has horrendous levels of congestion at peak times, which would be greatly eased by the upgrading of the A8000. In financial terms, that would need only a modest contribution, but the Executive would rather squabble with City of Edinburgh Council about who should take responsibility rather than just get on and get the job done.</p><p>Rural Scotland also faces severe problems in maintaining its road network, especially given some of the reductions in local authority funds for <place-holder colnum=\"584\"/> minor roads. For example, Highland Council has warned the Executive that on the basis of current resources, the fabric of the B roads in that area will deteriorate to the extent that some might face closure on safety grounds.</p><p>As far as the railways are concerned, the least said, the better is probably the view of the Minister for Transport. Unfortunately for the minister, she has no real powers to act when it comes to Scotland's railways. The minister can talk a good game, but she has no real clout when it comes to issues of funding rail infrastructure&#8212;no real clout, and no guarantee on funding.</p><p>To enable our nation to prosper and overcome barriers, investment from the Executive at levels not seen in Scotland will have to be achieved. For the moment, the Executive has allocated &#163;1.27 billion over the next three years to transport.

To ensure that Scotland prospers, is not it time to transfer the powers over rail, air and shipping that currently rest with the UK Government to the Scottish Executive, and use those powers to spend Scotland's &#163;18 billion share of Prescott's treasure chest in Scotland on Scotland's priorities?</p><p>If members believe in Scotland and its future economic prosperity, they must believe that the Parliament needs to have within its remit the powers stretching across the entire transport arena, together with the wherewithal to get the job done.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13240051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Here we are in Scotland at the beginning of the 21 st century, a small nation of 5 million people on the periphery of the continent of Europe.

The requirement for site designation to protect particular areas is vital, not only to meet our international obligations but to join nature conservation with sustainable development. When designating areas as special areas of conservation, there are real opportunities to unlock funds for sustainable rural development. To enable those funds, including structural funds, to be released and utilised to the full, a much greater emphasis must be put on education and awareness raising by Scottish Natural Heritage and by the Executive.</p><p>Something else that must be tackled is the level of confusion that is prevalent in the plethora of different designations. There are sites of special scientific interest, special protection areas, special areas of conservation, national nature reserves, world heritage sites, environmentally sensitive areas, natural heritage zones and Ramsar sites. Confusion creates uncertainty and fears that are greater than the reality on the ground. At some stage, a rationalisation of designations must be attempted, otherwise confusion and fear will continue to exist at unnecessary levels.</p><p>That confusion is not helped by the announcement today of SNH's withdrawal of the four moorland areas for SSSIs. At the same time as withdrawing them, SNH is telling everyone that it intends to recommend that those sites be considered again as SSSIs. I am afraid that SNH has painted itself as an organisation that does not know what it is about, leading to further confusion and fear. It cannot be denied that many people in rural Scotland are fearful of Scottish Natural Heritage and believe that it is beyond any real democratic control. My colleague Fergus Ewing, acting to help overcome such fears, has extracted a promise from SNH that it will automatically inform all MSPs when it begins consideration of whether an area should be designated.</p><p>It is well known that Scottish Natural Heritage must advise the Government on the environment, but its duties are not always fully appreciated. For example, it is a little-known fact that, under its founding statute, the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991, Scottish Natural Heritage must exercise its functions to take account of the needs of agriculture, fisheries and forestry, the need for social and economic development in Scotland and the needs of local communities. Many people believe that SNH does not take proper account of those matters. Some would say that a body that is, almost by definition, primarily concerned with the environment is not always best placed to take account of those matters.</p><p>I suggest that we need a root-and-branch review of the various designations that exist as well as a rationalisation. We also need a fundamental review of Scottish Natural Heritage itself. If the <place-holder colnum=\"299\"/> Executive is really interested in what people think and if ministers are progressive pragmatists who really want to take action to bring quangos to account, I suggest that they begin with SNH.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239215", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protected Area Designations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No right-thinking person could object to Government having mechanisms for delivering its   objectives on biodiversity.

I think that Andy Kerr did a good job of putting the case on the committee's behalf.</p><p>I will tell the chamber a sorry tale about what can happen as a result of what is permitted under the current guidelines, particularly with regard to replacement masts, and about why I believe that the procedure of prior notification will not suffice and why I believe in the committee's recommendation that full planning permission should be the starting point.</p><p>In the spring of 1998, a neighbour to a new mast development contacted me to alert me to the erection of a monster mast in an area of outstanding conservation in Kinross town, 25 m from Nick Johnston's window. Directly across the street is the local high school, attended by 800 pupils. The new mast is to replace one of a slim pole variety, erected many years previously. The original 27 m mast had been granted planning permission in 1986 for use by the police. The new mast, erected by Orange with the police's consent, despite being of the same height, is a large lattice-type structure, a bit like a poor man's Blackpool tower. The mast is a carbuncle on the Kinross street scene, and has caused much angst, anger and concern.</p><p>But enough of that. The real issue is that, according to Perth and Kinross Council, the mast did not require planning permission, and could be erected under existing permitted development rights, despite being in an outstanding area of conservation. According to the council's legal department, the Town and Country Planning <place-holder colnum=\"542\"/> (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that development is permitted when it consists of the installation, alteration or replacement of any telecommunications apparatus\".</p><p>There are always, as may be obvious, lots of caveats to that, but it seemed that, in this case, the development was indeed permitted. In short, the mast which previously existed required planning permission, whereas its replacement was erected under permitted development legislation.</p><p>Some people might suggest that the matter could have been sorted out if a procedure of prior approval or notification existed. Not so. Under regulation 67(5) of the 1992 order, it is made quite clear that the erection of a mast in a conservation area is permitted, subject to the condition that the operator shall give prior notice in writing to a planning authority not less than eight weeks before development has begun. That eight weeks of notification was observed, and Orange proceeded to erect the mast.</p><p>What is at issue is that, although the planning officers knew what was happening, the local community was entirely unaware of Orange's proposals. Even the local elected members were not alerted beforehand. All that would not have happened had full planning permission been required. The whole point of the planning procedure is to ensure that there is a process of checks and balances between what the planning officers think and what the elected council members think, with planning officers working to policy guidelines and elected members representing the legitimate concerns of their community.</p><p>That procedure best guarantees that an issue of substantial concern to a community is properly discussed in an open and transparent manner. It is a shame that those rules did not exist previously as a lot of damage has been done in this country and I do not know how we will redress it and how we will regain a proper perspective. Perhaps the minister will talk about that later. There can be no replacement for enabling communities to participate in the decision-making process with their elected representatives. Folks, this is democracy. I suggest that we lay democracy aside at our peril.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13227588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Telecommunications"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to begin by congratulating the Transport and the Environment Committee on its work and on its report.

The message that I took from that was that&#8212;despite the attempts in things such as the concordats to hem Scotland in, and despite the attempts of many in this chamber to stick with the status quo&#8212;the process is evolving anyway, and the Commission is beginning to realise that Scotland will have to have its own distinctive voice.</p><p>It was also salutary to learn that 80 per cent of the legislation emanating from, and developing in, the European Community will have a direct effect on Scotland's domestic policy. Given that the vast majority of legislation made, and of other decisions taken, within the framework of the European Community&#8212;through the Commission and the many Councils of Ministers&#8212;affect Scotland directly, it is concerning, to say the least, that Scotland does not have the opportunity to contribute in the way that other normal nations do. Scotland's distinctive needs cannot be articulated in the same way as can the needs of the Irish, the Dutch or the Danes.</p><p>There is another lesson to be learned from the growth in the number of discussions that are taking place at official level between like <place-holder colnum=\"1401\"/> departments in the various member states. I wonder whether the southern-based big UK departments, when they are involved in talks with like departments in the European Community, have the best interests of Scotland at heart, and whether those interests are properly represented.</p><p>The most salutary lesson of all comes from the experience of the Irish. From everyone I have spoken to in the European Community, it is clear that the Irish have made an art of cutting a niche for themselves. In Brussels or Strasbourg, all sorts of people talk about the terrific networking of the Irish, and about the way in which they are superbly able to secure the best deal that they can for their people. It is no accident that their ability to do that is directly related to their status as a normal nation within the European framework.</p><p>I heard Jack McConnell talking about trying to create a relationship between us and England.

Although the Secretary of State for Social Security has announced that there will be no compulsory move to ACT until 2003, the central question of whether the Post Office will be fully automated by then or will be able to provide an alternative banking facility has not been answered.</p><p>The Government says that it is responding to market conditions by creating choice for people, and we saw the minister brandishing his document this afternoon. However, that claim is not borne out by the facts. According to existing data, 80 to 85 per cent of current benefit claimants have bank accounts, yet as many as 70 per cent choose to receive cash payments through their post office. There is a variety of economic and social reasons for that, but anybody making an objective assessment of the statistics can see that the customers are voting with their feet.</p><p>The House of Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee has been examining the issue and some of its conclusions are quite interesting. The Secretary of State for Social Security told the select committee that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the vast majority of new entrants into the system . . . are opting to go to ACT.\"</p><p>The committee did a bit of digging, and came up with this conclusion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We sought the latest figures on ACT for new benefit claimants. The image presented of a flood of new entrants opting for ACT is exaggerated. Most new pensioners are in fact <i>not</i> opting for ACT. Fewer than one in 10 income support recipients elect for ACT. Fewer than 1 in 3 of new benefit recipients opt for ACT.\"</p><p>The customers have made their choice and it is quite clear that they are not happy with what they see.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13223019", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Post Offices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not give way to Mr McLeish.

Computers, telecommunications equipment, chemicals, whisky and fish and other food products carry the \"Made in Scotland\" label and directly support 120,000 jobs in Scotland.</p><p>There was a time when we thought of our home market as being the 5 million people who live in Scotland, or even the 55 million in the United Kingdom. That is no longer the case: Europe, with a market of about 320 million people, is now our home market. Scotland exports more to France and Germany individually than it does to the USA and the Commonwealth countries combined.</p><p>Our exports to the European Union represent 58 per cent of Scottish exports. Indeed, 78 per cent of manufactured exports from Fife are EU-bound. Those are remarkable statistics for a nation on the periphery of Europe. We succeed despite the lack <place-holder colnum=\"1254\"/> of a fast, efficient route into mainland Europe&#8212;our marketplace.</p><p>In its major study into transportation networks, the North Sea Commission said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the majority of Ro-Ro and Container traffic is routed to/from English ports. In this context, without significant investment in Ro-Ro and passenger facilities, Scotland will continue to suffer from peripherality.\"</p><p>Is it not madness to be an exporting nation but to make it so difficult for our exporters to reach their primary market? We could do so much better.</p><p>Fifty per cent of the traffic that passes through the ferry port of Hull is believed to have its origin or destination in Scotland. A large proportion of the journeys of the 250,000 passengers who use the Newcastle-Amsterdam ferry originate in Scotland. I would like the Parliament to think about the cost of the fuel to get goods and passengers to and from those ferries, the impact of those journeys on our roads system and the pollution that that additional traffic creates in our environment.</p><p>A Scottish lorry driver also needs to think about time. More congestion means that Scottish lorry drivers may be unable to reach southern port destinations in a legal driving day, which adds to their costs. Add to that the plans to introduce motorway tolling&#8212;now plus VAT&#8212;all heaped on to Scottish exporters trying to operate competitively from a peripheral European nation. The motion supports the view that there is a market for a direct ferry service from Scotland to the heart of Europe, with more and more finished goods transported by rail to the quayside, and on to their markets in Europe.</p><p>How do other small nations access key European markets by sea? The Danes, for example, are well served by Fredrikshavn, Arhus and Esbjerg. In Norway, more than 80 per cent of the country's imports and exports are transported by ship and/or ferry. However, it is about more than just goods. We need to look only at Shetland to see the huge economic and social benefits that can be had from an international sea link. Hotels, pubs and guest houses in Shetland are full of Scandinavians with plenty of money to spend.</p><p>If it can do that for Shetland, imagine what sea access to the continent could do for the rest of Scotland. Opening up Scotland to tourists must be part of the agenda. Imagine a tourist thinking about coming to Scotland without first having to think about an eight-hour car journey. How much more attractive it would be if one could travel from Zeebrugge, Zeeland or the Eemshaven and sail into Rosyth by the next morning. The journey itself would be a holiday, part of the great Scottish adventure. The Scottish Tourist Board's figures show that, in 1998, more than 60,000 Dutch <place-holder colnum=\"1255\"/> people made their way to Scotland by sea and tunnel. Imagine how that figure could be increased with a port at Rosyth.</p><p>The reason that I brought this motion to the Parliament is to encourage action. A lot has been said over the past few years and encouraging noises have been made, but it is now time to move from the noises-off stage to getting passengers and freight on board.</p><p>I am aware that the minister has already confirmed that the Executive is responsible for those ferry and marine freight operations that start and finish in Scotland. I would therefore welcome her confirmation today that freight facilities grants would apply to a ferry terminal facility at Rosyth. We all know that Rosyth has good access to the motorway system and the potential for a direct rail link. It is also an excellent location for storage and logistics operations and has a port facility that is accessible, irrespective of the state of the tide.</p><p>As far as the rail link is concerned, I am sure that the minister is more than aware of yesterday's announcement by Railtrack about its preparedness to invest in the rail link between Dunfermline and Stirling and the vital importance of that link to the future development of this exciting port opportunity, which would create hundreds of jobs and retain highly skilled engineers at Rosyth. I hope that the minister will be able to confirm that that will strengthen the case for substantial investment for this line from the next round of public transport fund announcements.</p><p>Scottish Enterprise has chosen Rosyth as its preferred east coast port and has already identified a five-point action plan. I also ask the minister to report back to Parliament on the progress of that plan. I am sure that she is aware that Babcock Rosyth is at the forefront of developing the engineering capability to move containers from road to rail to ferry. That multimodal approach and the building of low-deck wagons at Rosyth will allow container traffic to pass through tunnels and bridges previously unsuitable for rail container traffic. Babcock Rosyth estimates that the new engineering enterprise will create significant numbers of jobs. Can I ask the minister to confirm that everything possible will be done to assist Babcock Rosyth to make the product a success?</p><p>The Parliament should recognise the efforts of others: Fife Council, Fife Enterprise and other bodies. We need to provide the vital support, encouragement, energy and cajolement to ensure that this venture&#8212;of huge potential for Rosyth, Fife and Scotland&#8212;becomes a reality, not tomorrow but today.</p>", "hdate": "1999-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13216586", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Freight and Passenger Terminal (Fife)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who signed the motion for today's debate.

There was no special win. After that letter, I did a bit more digging and I am now clear that the level of spin and deceit being practised over the so-called special deal is staggering.</p><p>For evidence we need to look no further than the European Commission's own analysis of the reform of structural funds in 1999, which gives the European Commission's view of the Berlin council and an accurate picture of the Berlin decisions without the spin attached.

There is widespread worry that the boundaries may have been drawn too tightly and, as a result, some obvious candidates for inclusion may have been missed out. I hope that the minister notes that, with our reasonable amendment, we are being constructive in seeking to help the areas across Scotland that rightly feel hard done by.</p><p>Additionality is a concept that has always bothered the Labour party. Who could forget the difficulties that poor old Bob Gillespie got himself into during the Govan by-election, when the concept of additionality was raised with him? There is a paradox in the Government's position that requires to be exposed through deeper understanding and greater transparency.<place-holder colnum=\"80\"/></p><p>Let us examine a couple of the European Commission's definitions of additionality and contrast them with the Executive's stated position.

For examples of that, we need look no further than the First Minister.

It has been a dreadful experience. I was the leader of Perth and Kinross Council when the mast was erected. It was erected under permitted development rights, and under powers that were delegated to officials, and so was in the process of being erected before many of us became aware of it, although the people next door to the mast&#8212;who happen to be here today&#8212;became aware of it sooner than we did.</p><p>The mast has been called a number of things, such as Kinross's folly, and I have heard it called Crawford's folly, because I was the leader of the <place-holder colnum=\"57\"/> council at the time. The mast is a hideous abomination and we must find a way to address that, perhaps through legislation. I know that we cannot legislate retrospectively, but a method must be found through a legislative process to get rid of the carbuncles that already exist. I do not know what that process might be, but we must find a way to do it.</p><p>In dealing with the issue of masts, I was concerned that we had a dispute between what the planners were saying and what the local people understood the legislation said. Unfortunately, the matter will need to be resolved by the courts. There are extremely grey areas in the legislation around the interpretation of words such as differing and sizes. That must be sorted out.</p><p>As we have heard, many local authorities have taken prudent avoidance action with regard to their schools and other places. Many fire brigades are doing the same, and a number of police forces are now waking up to the issue. The mast in Kinross that I referred to is at the back of a police station. I understand that Tayside police are reviewing their policy on telecommunications masts because of the difficulties that have arisen.</p><p>As a Parliament, we need to take on board the thrust of the Maastricht guidance on prudent avoidance and on the precautionary principle. Other countries have done that. New Zealand has a safety limit that is 1,000 times less than that which exists in the UK, so we must take on board international evidence when we deal with the issue.</p><p>We have seen masts taken down because of public pressure. I hope that because of Nick's actions today, through the work of all-party groups and through all-party pressure, we can have the mast in Kinross removed from our shared constituency. I also hope that through joint action and joint agreement in this Parliament we can introduce proposals that can start to deal in a much more meaningful way not only with future masts, but with the masts that have already been erected, so that we can resite them to much more satisfactory positions.</p><p>I could go on and on about the subject, because it has driven me to distraction for a number of years, but other members wish to speak and I will let them do so.</p>", "hdate": "1999-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13213123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Telecommunications"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Nick Johnston for his motion.

I have been fortunate enough to have had a unique insight into the challenges and difficulty that the public sector faces. From May 1996 to May this year, I was not only leader of a local authority, but served on the boards of an area tourist board and a local enterprise company.</p><p>On the structure of the public sector, we have <place-holder colnum=\"658\"/> inherited a situation in which the lines of responsibility are, to say the least, confused, and in which transparency of policy formation and of delivery mechanisms is severely lacking. That has created an environment in the private arm of the industry where innovation and investment are stifled, and where ownership of strategic direction is low or non-existent.</p><p>The public sector players are at national level: the Scottish Tourist Board and Scottish Enterprise. At a local level, there are the area tourist boards, the local enterprise companies and the local authorities. All those bodies, to a greater or lesser extent, are trying to ensure that we have a tourism product that we can be proud of. They all mean well and attempt to do their bit through various partnership arrangements. The unfortunate reality is that, if we look beneath the veneer of partnership working well, we find territorial disputes, suspicion, considerable frustration, slow decision-making processes and perceptions of a lack of support among other partners. In short, the public sector of tourism is fragmented. It is unable to form a common position for direction or delivery and it is in dire need of realignment, refocusing and integration.</p><p>I will now refer to financial support and the sustainable funding of ATBs. Area tourist boards find themselves in the incongruous and unenviable position of being creatures of statute but without statutory obligation to raise funds themselves or to be supported by other public bodies. That unsatisfactory situation has left eight ATBs struggling financially since their inception. Many of them are also currently reliant on EU structural funds, and when that picture changes soon, many ATBs will go out of business.</p><p>From the local authority perspective, with further swingeing cuts inevitable again this year, the area tourist boards are in a no-win situation. In the competition for resources with the likes of education, social work and police, they do not stand a snowball's chance of receiving a sustainable funding package. Instead of being fed on a diet of uncertainty with, at best, standstill budgets, which means cuts in real terms, area tourist boards should be nourished with the certainty that they are funded on a sustainable basis through three-year funding packages. It would be useful if the Tories at least apologised for the fuel escalator and for the damage to area tourist boards caused by the cuts that they made in previous years. In all likelihood, the review of tourism will be the last chance in a generation for Scotland to get it right. We have a chance to become a world-class tourist destination with a world-class product.</p><p>I would like to say well done to the Executive for undertaking the consultation process to develop a <place-holder colnum=\"659\"/> new strategy for tourism. That is an important first step, but at the end of the day, the Executive's actions will speak louder than words. For Scotland's sake, we must get this right. The tourism industry and the minister have been heard to say \"service, service, service\". However, the public service requires funding, funding, funding to ensure that it can deliver.</p>", "hdate": "1999-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13211217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall concentrate on the structural and financial challenges facing the public sector of the tourism industry.

It would be too much to expect everyone to be fully satisfied with the outcome of the commission's work. The least that we can expect is for all, especially the Government, to give its findings full, detailed and proper consideration. </p><p>From the minister's statement, I am glad to see that the Executive has, for the most part, embraced the spirit of the commission's findings. Having said that, I am concerned, like others, about the departure from the report of an independent inquiry into local government finance. I am disappointed that the Executive has not considered building on the commission's report by taking the imaginative step of announcing how it may deal with community planning powers for local government. The minister will be aware that for the past year, five local authorities-I will not name them because of time restrictions-have been battling the authorities in that area. I hope that the deputy minister will deal with that in his summing up and tell us when we can expect that area to be considered. </p><p>I will comment quickly on the prospect of proportional representation, local government, pay and conditions for councillors and the potential for executives. The Executive is be applauded for not allowing the self-interest factions, which have been so vociferous in the past 10 days, to deflect them from the path of improved democratisation in local government. It is good to see recognition of the fact that changes are badly required in political decision making and remuneration. </p><p>It is a great pity that the political dinosaurs who currently form the administration of Perth and Kinross Council do not have the foresight to grasp this culture of change. That unholy coalition of Tory, Labour and Liberal councillors recently refused to endorse a report from a forward-looking chief executive who recommended a review of the council's political decision-making process and remuneration packages for councillors. Perhaps the minister would have a word in the ear of the <place-holder colnum=\"912\"/> Labour provost, the Tory depute provost and, while she is at it, the Liberal depute leader of the administration, and see if she can drag them into this century before we reach the next. </p><p>Impossible tasks aside, I would like quickly to turn to the matter of local government finance. I say in all sincerity that, in terms of laying down a solid foundation for the future and creating a real and meaningful relationship between local government and the Parliament, all the good intentions could be in danger of being undermined if we do not have an independent review. </p><p>We need an independent review with a brief to establish a needs-based methodology that assesses the demographic and social profile of an authority, and not just on the basis of per head of population and geographical location. The issue is not just about how the cake is distributed: it is also about the size of the cake-the amount of money that is available to local authorities. That needs to be taken on board. </p><p>McIntosh raised that issue in his report because of the din that was made by local authorities across Scotland. Indeed, that din was converted into fine words by COSLA in its document about local government in Scotland, which was endorsed earlier this year by all of Scotland's former council leaders, including Frank McAveety, who is now Deputy Minister for Local Government, Kate Maclean, Tom McCabe, Ian Welsh, Peter Peacock, and, I have no doubt, many other councillors here. I hope that they will continue to lobby in the same way that they did when they signed up to that contract. </p><p>This has been an interesting and lively debate. I will make one final point, because I can see the Deputy Presiding Officer looking at me. It is crucial that we agree to four-year terms for councillors, but it is also crucial that we resist robustly the idea of having council elections on the same day as the parliamentary elections. That would not be good for democracy and the empowerment of local authorities in this country. </p>", "hdate": "1999-07-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13209022", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that we can all be confident that everybody in local government will recognise that the consultation process undertaken by the McIntosh commission has been an exemplar in terms of active listening and deserved outcome.

Much of Scotland has accepted, rightly or wrongly, that Holyrood should be the site of the Parliament. </p><p>If the amendment wins today-and, rightly, it should-it will need to be explained carefully to the Scottish people. If the First Minister's motion is defeated, the position should be accepted as one of pragmatism, common sense, and, hopefully, in the end, consensus. Scotland deserves no less. Nobody can doubt that incorrect decisions have been hurriedly taken at crucial moments. Frankly, the whole process has been handled extremely badly in terms of public relations, design consultation, and finance. There is a perception that it has been a complete boorach. </p><p>There can be no doubt that serious and difficult questions remain to be answered about the way in which this project has been managed from the outset. The key decision takers must answer those questions. I dread to think what derision might have been visited on councillors if this had happened in a local authority.

Donald Gorrie's amendment gives us the opportunity to secure the greatest level of support possible for Holyrood. Those who are committed to Holyrood should have nothing to fear from a further delay to ensure that others can be convinced. If it is the best site, its merits will shine through.
