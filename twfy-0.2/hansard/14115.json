I also thank the supporters of Tibet who are members of the cross-party group on Tibet and the members of the Tibet support group Grampian for their tireless work in my area in fundraising for cultural and educational projects in Tibet and highlighting human rights issues there to the people of Grampian, sometimes on cold and windy days on Banchory High Street.</p><p>My thanks also go to Dr Martin Mills, the director of the Scottish centre for Himalayan research at the University of Aberdeen, whose knowledge of what is happening in the region is a great asset. I thank him for his briefing. I cannot forget the passionate supporters of Tibet from the University of Edinburgh who add much to our cross-party group meetings.</p><p>The main reason for bringing the motion to the Parliament is to highlight the extraordinary and distressing actions that some Tibetans are moved to take in protest against Chinese policies in their region. In the past five years, 127 Tibetans have self-immolated&#8212;or, in other words, set themselves alight&#8212;overwhelmingly resulting in death.</p><p>Self-immolation began in 2009. In the early days, it was mainly Buddhist monks in the Tibetan areas of Kham and Amdo, which lie outside the Tibetan autonomous region. The practice began at Kirti monastery in Ngaba. During the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s 18th national party congress in Beijing in November 2012, tragically, almost one Tibetan a day was self-immolating, by which time it was mainly farmers, nomads, students and schoolchildren.</p><p>Since then, self-immolation has decreased, but that has mainly been due to extremely draconian oppression by the Chinese authorities. There has been a heavy military crackdown in communities where self-immolations have occurred&#8212;restrictions on movement, the closure of satellite communications, restrictions on mobile phones and bans on the sale of SIM cards. In many cases, friends and relatives have been threatened or bribed by authorities so that self-immolations are denied or even covered up. There have been threats that state support and services such as electricity will be withdrawn from whole communities that are associated with self-immolations and that monasteries that have held the funerals of self-immolators will be closed.</p><p>It should be said that self-immolation seems to be part of a wider and escalating pattern of protest and public suicide in the People&#8217;s Republic of China but, in Tibet, the Chinese authorities view those protests as splittist or about sovereignty. That has led to the collective punishments that I described and the application of the crime of intentional homicide to all those aiding, abetting, encouraging or even photographing self-immolation. There have been widespread communications blackouts, and prison sentences have been imposed for disseminating information on such protests.</p><p>As only 4 per cent of any self-immolation protests have involved a demand for independence, we must ask what is driving people to do this. It is a response to restrictions that are being put on religious freedoms, language rights, access to employment and the destruction of water resources and grazing lands by large-scale mining projects.</p><p>The restrictions on Buddhist religious life remain one of the dominant bones of contention in Tibetan areas, with the day-to-day management of Buddhist monasteries being increasingly dominated by party officials, and impositions being placed on large religious gatherings.</p><p>Language restrictions exist, as Tibetan has been increasingly phased out as the language of instruction in Tibetan state schools, hence the self-immolation by students and&#8212;distressingly&#8212;schoolchildren.</p><p>The pollution of water resources and grazing lands has been the result of the substantial growth in the mining of oil, copper and gold resources, which has also resulted in the large-scale relocation of populations. Airport construction has also attracted self-immolation protests, along with other forms of protests. For example, the construction of Gannan airport has been resisted because it has involved building on a mountain that is sacred to local Tibetans.</p><p>The Chinese Government has been encouraging unrestricted migration into the Tibetan region, and this has been particularly noticeable in urban Lhasa.</p><p>In reading up for this debate, I was struck by the writing of Tsering Woeser, an ethnic Tibetan human rights activist who was educated in Beijing and who, as a result of her abilities in Mandarin and English, has been able to communicate to the outside world the plight of her people and what she calls the Chinese Government&#8217;s attempts at &#8220;beautifying&#8221; Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, which involves modern infrastructure being built at the expense of the city&#8217;s historical architecture. Woeser has called on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to stop the destruction of the ancient city of Lhasa, which is part of the destruction of the traditional Tibetan landscape, environment and culture.</p><p>There have been many delegations to China, led by the First Minister, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs and other members of the Scottish Government. How can we persuade the Chinese authorities that the repression of culture is not a sustainable way forward in any country? Would the cabinet secretary consider writing to UNESCO to encourage it to do more to protect Tibetan heritage sites, and thereby the culture, and negate the pressure that results in some Tibetans feeling the need to undertake the horrific act of self-immolation?</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22880050", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Self-immolations in Tibet"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is quite difficult to follow that historic vote.

Indeed, the cabinet secretary and his staff have an impossible task in reconciling all the competing interests. I am glad that we are having the debate now, as part of the consultation stage, because from some of the frankly hysterical correspondence that I have had from NFUS in the north-east, members might think that everything was done and dusted, and that everything was doom and gloom as far as farmers were concerned. However, the overreaction of NFUS office bearers in the north-east does not seem to have been replicated among the wider farming community, which is evidenced by the optimism of the Bank of Scotland survey and the reporting in The Press and Journal&#8212;a newspaper that has its finger on the pulse of the rural community throughout Scotland. Its headline states that &#8220;Survey results are at odds with leader&#8217;s claims over CAP&#8221;.</p><p>Let me return to the straitjacket in which the cabinet secretary finds himself operating. Europe broke the link between payment and production, so as a result the Scottish Government is trying to support production while being barred from doing so by the EU. We also have the Conservatives and their coalition partners arguing in EU negotiations for single farm payments to be phased out altogether, so I find Alex Fergusson&#8217;s words a bit hollow. Things could be so much worse if Scottish farmers were left to the UK Government. That is on top of the UK Government&#8217;s refusal to pass on the full convergence uplift: refusal that all parties in this Parliament have agreed is unacceptable. Perhaps some of farmers&#8217; concerns would be overcome if we were arguing about how to divide a much bigger cake, rather than just a slice. It would be helpful if NFUS in Grampian put more of its energies into lobbying the Westminster Government on that.</p><p>As my colleague Christian Allard has said, if the French Government treated its farmers in that way, seriously obnoxious-smelling material would be dumped in front of the French Parliament and the &#201;lys&#233;e palace.</p><p>I note that the suggested modulation rate of 9.5 per cent is lower than the rates for England, at 12 per cent, or Wales, at 15 per cent. It is also, of course, lower than that which has been proposed by the Labour Party in Scotland, which proposes the full 15 per cent, as in Wales. We have a situation in which Scotland is discussing cuts when other countries throughout Europe are deciding how to invest their increases. It is little wonder then, that support among farmers for independence and a yes vote is moving in the right direction, as they see the unfairness of the Westminster Government withholding funding and showing little support for the agriculture sector.</p><p>In contrast, we have the Scottish Government&#8217;s active promotion of Scotland&#8217;s food and drink sector, which now accounts for 18 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s overseas exports, compared with a figure of less than 1.5 per cent for the UK as a whole. We know that Scotland can sell all the beef and lamb that it produces, whether it is sold at home or abroad, and we have the capacity to process all the product. Farmers who continue to strive to produce a premium product are rewarded with higher prices and a ready market for their products.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has a difficult job to do in encouraging our hill farmers to increase their cattle heads and sheep flocks to meet demand, which will only increase rather than decrease. I am heartened by the recent Bank of Scotland survey that showed that 32 per cent of farmers believe that they will increase their beef operation and only 12 per cent will decrease it, and that 29 per cent of sheep farmers anticipate increasing their operations. Of course, the demand for barley increases as the whisky industry surges forward.</p><p>Although I did not agree with much of what Claire Baker said, I agree with her that the farming sector could make much better use of pillar 2 and SRDP money. We must increase headage and carry out more land improvement to compensate for the fact that far too much prime agricultural land has been sold off at high prices to developers for housing. I commend the cabinet secretary for his work, and I know that he will find the best way forward for the whole of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870021", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate has already proved to be lively and diverse because&#8212;as is usual with discussions over CAP&#8212;nothing is simple or straightforward.

I know how difficult it is to find time to do such work.</p><p>My interest is twofold. I am interested as a constituency member who has constituents with on-going problems with factors involved in land maintenance, as already mentioned by Christine Grahame and others. I am also interested as convener of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, which next week will begin consideration of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which covers many areas relating to housing, including the right to buy, licensing requirements for mobile home sites with permanent residents, allocation of social housing and the use of the Scottish secure tenancy. It also includes the amendment of local authority powers to enforce repairs and maintenance in private homes, a registration system for letting agents, and part 3, which, among other things,</p><p>&#8220;allows local authorities to apply to the private rented housing panel for enforcement of the repairing standard, setting out the procedure for such applications and the right of appeal.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that Government officials who are dealing with the Housing (Scotland) Bill will have read the Justice Committee&#8217;s report and its recommendations, which I certainly will quiz them on. I will also ensure that my committee&#8217;s clerks have a conversation with the Justice Committee&#8217;s clerks, to see whether anything can be included in the bill to strengthen it and deal with some of the issues raised by the Justice Committee&#8217;s inquiry.</p><p>John Lamont articulated very well much of what I wanted to say about land management issues. I am a constituency member for Aberdeen, an area in which there is a housing boom. It is a large part of my constituency casework. Like John Lamont, I am concerned that home owners are not always well informed of their legal obligations on the purchase of a home. I remember that when my husband and I purchased our house more than 20 years ago, the solicitor told us among other things that we could not keep chickens. However, Mike Marriott from the Greenbelt Action Group said in evidence that buyers do not have the obligations spelled out to them, which I think is more common.</p><p>Like John Lamont, I believe that ideally green spaces in new estates should be looked after by local councils, as they look after green spaces in older estates. As a regional member, I was at the meeting with Greenbelt in 2011 that Christian Allard mentioned, which was very heated, as he said. It really is sad that these situations arise simply because companies such as Greenbelt cannot agree with house owners what level of land maintenance their fees should cover. As Alison McInnes said, there is not a simple solution because Greenbelt owns the land, so changing factors will not necessarily make much difference.</p><p>I sympathise with Patricia Ferguson and Sandra White on the factoring of the beautiful Glasgow tenements, which lots of people have bought to let, meaning that there is not the pride in those lovely tenements.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I must admit that when I saw this debate listed in the Business Bulletin last week, I did not immediately want to get involved in it, but on closer inspection I realised that the issues that were raised in the inquiry have probably been raised with the majority of MSPs by their constituents at one time or another.

The importance of these announcements should not be underestimated as part of the Government&#8217;s aspiration to fundamentally transform the world of work in Scotland and enhance the part that women can play in that better future for the country.</p><p>In Scotland as part of the UK, women&#8217;s participation in the labour market lags behind other EU countries. For example, Sweden has the highest rate of female participation in the workforce in the EU and Finland and Denmark, too, are above the EU average. In Denmark, 79 per cent of mothers with children under six work, while in the UK the figure is 59 per cent. I also note that a 1 per cent increase in Scotland&#8217;s economic activity rate is the equivalent of an extra 30,000 people in the labour market.</p><p>Such policies have a clear impact on gender equality. For example, the top four countries in the World Economic Forum gender gap index are Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden, and Denmark, too, is in the top 10. Moreover, our Nordic neighbours are leading the way in standards of care for the elderly, and those countries also have the highest satisfaction rates.</p><p>As we can see, our ambitions for an independent Scotland require transformational policies that no Westminster Government has ever contemplated. Indeed, a Scottish Government analysis shows that many women in Scotland are already and will be worse off as a result of Westminster changes to the benefits system. According to an Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis, single female households will lose out most from welfare reforms from 2010 to 2015.</p><p>Our opponents say that focusing on childcare is a cynical ploy to woo the female vote for independence, and even today many of them, particularly those on the Labour benches, do not understand the pivotal nature of childcare provision in growing the economy and reducing gender inequality. However, although we have seen that expanding childcare will in itself increase job opportunities and despite the fact that Professor Ailsa McKay has written that</p><p>&#8220;Every woman in Scotland should welcome the commitment to a &#8216;transformative expansion&#8217; in childcare&#8221;,</p><p>women who are in employment or who want to return to work face other barriers. The women&#8217;s employment summit, which was held in September in partnership with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, discussed such barriers and, as a result, a number of strands of work are progressing. For example, the Government is funding the women into work project, which tracks the progress of and outcomes for women on employment programmes; the careerWISE Scotland project, which builds on the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8221; report, is working to step up action to encourage young women and girls to consider careers in science and engineering; and the cross-directorate occupational segregation working group, which aims to tackle occupational segregation, has also been re-established.</p><p>While those proposals are progressing, the industry sectors are picking up on this issue. As I think Nanette Milne mentioned at question time earlier this afternoon, Aberdeen Journals through The Press and Journal energy supplement and the energy voice website and women in the oil and gas industry are beginning to challenge male chauvinism and domination in that industry. In the renewables sector, the women in renewable energy Scotland forum, or WiRES, has recently been launched with the aim of increasing women&#8217;s participation and progression in that industry through networking, mentoring and information sharing. Finally, I welcome the University of Aberdeen&#8217;s intention to celebrate this year&#8217;s international women&#8217;s day by hosting a women&#8217;s world event and inviting high-profile women, led by Anne Glover, to inspire other women.</p><p>As usual, Iain Gray moans but conveniently fails to mention that employment law, equal pay, the minimum wage and so on still reside with Westminster.

The campaign about a child&#8217;s Christmas wish that its parents did not shout and fight is one of the saddest that I have known.</p><p>We have no way of knowing whether the increase in recorded domestic abuse incidents represents an increase in domestic violence itself or a greater willingness to report cases in the knowledge that such abuse will be taken seriously by the police and other services.</p><p>I welcome the 62 per cent increase in funding since 2007 to &#163;34.5 million between 2012 and 2015, and the comments from Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid that, as the awareness of the issue increases and professionals receive more training, more women are encouraged to report the abuse that they experience rather than suffer in silence. I hope that it is the former.</p><p>I continue to be appalled by the discrimination against women that I come across and the lack of awareness among men of what is and is not acceptable behaviour. For example, I have received some appalling comments from pretty prominent people in the community about a recent high-profile sexual assault court case in Aberdeen. The idea that several women individually should not report behaviour that they find unacceptable and threatening shows a total lack of respect for women.</p><p>I agree with Jackie Baillie that attitudes are the key to eliminating domestic violence. Until we live in a country that has a thread of equality running through every single aspect of society, we will have men who believe that it is acceptable to treat women as their inferiors and to commit acts of violence, whether physical or psychological, against them. That thread means parents giving the same opportunities to their children, whether boys or girls, and not steering them into gender-stereotyped roles from an early age. It means schools ensuring that all pupils have access to and assistance with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects so that all career opportunities are open to women and men. It means equal pay for work of equal value, and that means giving caring and nurturing roles the gravitas and value that they deserve.</p><p>I welcome the advent of a strategy that is aimed at tackling all forms of violence against women, and hope that a very large part of it will be about education about violence against women being totally unacceptable and as illegal as drink-driving or not wearing a seat belt. However, it should also be about penalties. That is why I welcome the proposed changes on the requirement for corroboration. Far too often, constituents of mine who have been subject to domestic violence have been unable to get redress in the courts. Those constituents have received excellent support from the police domestic violence unit in Aberdeen, but they, like the victims, are frustrated that allegations do not proceed to court, let alone conviction. I know that, in the north-east, the procurator fiscal is as frustrated as the victims and the police. The sooner corroborative evidence does not have to be from another person, but can be other obvious factors, the better.</p><p>Rhoda Grant should think hard about the consequences of what she proposed&#8212;forcing prostitution underground and hugely increasing the harm to women.

We know from its record of inaction that that would be the Labour Party&#8217;s reaction. Even in the good times, before the crisis, Labour&#8217;s record on house building was woeful. It is worth repeating that Labour built only six council houses in its last four years in government compared with the 3,724 council homes that were completed by the SNP Government in the six years to June 2013. Also in the six years to June 2013, 27,023 housing association homes were completed&#8212;a rise of 16 per cent over the six years from 2002 to 2007, when Labour was in power. That can be said to be typical of Labour, as in Wales Labour has built only eight council houses in the past few years.

Today, a similar emotion flows on the SNP benches in relation to the freedom and equality that we seek for our country, Scotland, and its citizens.</p><p>In a few months, it will be 40 years since I joined the Scottish National Party. Getting to the point at which we have a white paper on Scotland&#8217;s future has been a long, hard slog for not only many on these benches but, more important, as Mark McDonald said, the thousands of members and supporters of the SNP for many decades. Some of us have been more closely involved than others in that individual struggle and sacrifice. It is entirely due to the opportunity that I had to observe Westminster and how it works at close quarters that I came to realise that the legislators and their advisers knew nothing and cared less about Scotland and its needs and that full self-government is the best way for Scotland&#8217;s citizens to be served by their legislators and for the country as a whole to reach its full potential.</p><p>That belief was further reinforced during my 14 years working in the oil and gas industry, when I saw those resources squandered by the Westminster Government. For successive UK Governments to swallow up the revenue from those finite resources was a scandal. We are the only country bar Iran not to have an oil fund&#8212;I will come back to that. Fortunately, voting yes can stop that and begin to leave a legacy for future generations.</p><p>In an independent Scotland, we would have full responsibility for oil and gas reserves and would maximise the safe production of those reserves. I welcome Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s interim report on the review of maximising recovery from the UK continental shelf, in which he comments that fiscal instability is a significant factor in underperformance in the UK basin. Over the past decade, there have been 16 subsequent changes to the fiscal regime. Those frequent changes&#8212;which have often been made without prior consultation with the industry&#8212;have earned the UK a reputation for fiscal instability, inhibiting new investment and, more important, decreasing the lifespan of some fields and damaging the Scottish economy.</p><p>There is no doubt that operators place a big premium on working under a stable and predictable tax regime, so that tax returns from investments can be appropriately evaluated. That stability is also important to underpin Aberdeen&#8217;s position as the oil and gas capital of Europe, a position that has built up over many decades. It is recognised as a centre of excellence in the field.</p><p>In 2012, oil and gas production is estimated to have contributed around &#163;22&#160;billion to the Scottish gross domestic product. In 2013, oil and gas was the largest single sector in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies. It is a sector in which Scottish firms are leading and global players.</p><p>Scotland has the vast bulk of the UK&#8217;s oil and gas reserves, which has an estimated wholesale value of &#163;1.5&#160;trillion. As well as in the North Sea, there are substantial reserves west of Scotland including, as Chic Brodie has discovered, in the Clyde. It is estimated that we have the largest conventional oil reserve in the EU and around 60 per cent of the EU&#8217;s total reserves. We also have the second largest volume of proven gas reserves after the Netherlands.

The Government is the first that has as a priority to connect all our cities with dual carriageways, and the effect of that should not be underestimated. It will be a key factor in convincing people that they can still live in rural towns and villages, many of which are not on rail routes, and be able to get access to employment further afield. I am pleased that the projects are progressing well and that, for example, consultation with communities along the A96 is taking place at present.</p><p>I have to take issue with those who complain about and oppose the dualling of these roads. I think that they come to the issue from a central-belt perspective. The central belt is already well served by a network of motorways and dual carriageways. Those who are against improvements to the road network to and in the north and north-east are clearly not subject to the daily frustration that my and other colleagues&#8217; constituents face as they try to go about their daily lives. Those who are concerned about air pollution fail to take into account the increase in cars that have very low emissions and, although they are still in their infancy, the number of electric vehicles, which is increasing.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister mentioned the AWPR. In a survey by Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce this spring, 87 per cent of respondents identified the AWPR as the key infrastructure investment that will drive economic growth in the region. We have already seen the unlocking of many large-scale developments in the region because of the progress that is, at last, being made on this vital project.</p><p>Some of the briefings that we have received for this debate complain that more investment is going into roads than into rail, but transport economists and those who are involved in the rail industry tell us that investment in rail has not been higher in Scotland for years, and that the other parts of the UK are envious of the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to rail.</p><p>Spending of &#163;4&#160;billion since 2007 has supported new rail lines, new and better services, new stations and new trains. There were 83&#160;million passenger journeys in Scotland last year, which represents a 33 per cent increase since 2004. Rail freight continues to grow and it is pleasing to see the recent move to rail of that most valuable of freight: whisky from Moray.</p><p>I am sure that not many members of the Scottish Parliament, with the exception of Alex Johnstone and the Tories, do not regret the deregulation of bus services, especially when we see how effectively, efficiently and cheaply Lothian buses work in Edinburgh. Would that we could have such a system in Aberdeen. However, Iain Gray and Mark Griffin have yet to say where the money for that would be diverted from.</p><p>Members mentioned ports and airports. I share Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s hope that expansion of the Aberdeen port will be included in future Government plans. Other members and I recently met representatives of the port; the project is exciting.</p><p>I appreciated Fiona McLeod&#8217;s speech. Cycling has a strong lobby in Scotland, but far more people walk, especially women and children. In the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s deliberations, I ensure that time and consideration are given to safe streets for walking.</p><p>Alex Johnstone mentioned high-speed rail, which he believes will be delivered to Scotland only by a Westminster Government. To me, HSR demonstrates most visibly the London and south-east-centric nature of the Westminster Government, which is not concerned about&#8212;or listening to what people are saying about&#8212;the economic future of the north-east or north-west regions of England, let alone that of Scotland.</p><p>Only in an independent Scotland, which has full responsibility for all modes of transport, ports, airports and air passenger duty, will the people of Scotland get the integrated transport infrastructure that they deserve and can fund.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be speaking towards the end of this debate because, as convener of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, it has been interesting for me to hear views from members across the chamber on a matter that occupies much of our time in committee.

I also thank the committee staff and the communications staff, because social media played an interesting part in the inquiry.</p><p>The inquiry and report would not have been possible without the significant input of time and effort by community transport groups, representative organisations and service users. The committee hopes that the report will go some way towards highlighting the good work undertaken by these community transport operators in providing a vital service to communities across Scotland.</p><p>I also thank our colleagues on the Health and Sport Committee and the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee for their interest and participation in the inquiry. In particular, the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s evidence session on transport for health was very helpful in informing the committee&#8217;s considerations.</p><p>The purpose of community transport is the provision of safe, accessible, cost-effective, flexible transport for those who are unable to access or use public or private transport. It is provided by several types of organisation, including dedicated community transport providers, community groups and private individuals using their own vehicles.</p><p>We learned that no two organisations are the same and that a mixture of voluntary and paid staff meet the specific needs of a local area. However, early in the inquiry the committee identified key barriers and issues that many community transport providers have in common that significantly impact on providers&#8217; ability to run services. Those are: funding arrangements; driver training and licensing; joint working with partnership organisations; leadership; and the lack of definitive information and data on the provision of community transport throughout Scotland.</p><p>The committee made a number of recommendations to the Scottish Government and is pleased that the Minister for Transport and Veterans indicated, in evidence to us, that he would carefully consider our recommendations. Indeed, in its response to our report, the Scottish Government said that it would look into ways to scope out the practicalities of and take forward some of the committee&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>It is vital that the issues are addressed now. Given Scotland&#8217;s ageing population, inevitably there will be increased demand for and reliance on community transport services. Getting it right now could bring enormous benefits for Scotland&#8217;s population in future.</p><p>It will come as no surprise that, during our inquiry, funding arrangements emerged as the single biggest problem that community transport operators face. The committee heard that following the transfer of funding responsibility to local authorities, under the concordat, the level of funding that local authorities provide to community transport groups has varied significantly across Scotland. The committee was concerned that that could lead to additional financial pressures, particularly in capital funding, on community transport operators in areas in which local authority funding is lower than it was under previous schemes or is not provided at all.</p><p>Although we acknowledge that decisions on their spending priorities are matters wholly for local authorities, we are of the view that the variation in the availability of funding for community transport throughout Scotland presents significant financial challenges to many operators, which, in turn, can impact on the provision of services to users. The committee called on the Scottish Government to explore the potential for the provision of funding to further assist the community transport sector, particularly with the capital costs of new and replacement vehicles. We were pleased that the Scottish Government noted in its response that it is considering the possibility of a grant scheme to fund new vehicles and that it welcomes any steps that can be taken towards alleviating that significant burden on providers. I would welcome an update from the minister on how the Government&#8217;s consideration of that important matter is progressing.</p><p>During evidence, the committee heard a range of views on whether a more co-ordinated approach to community transport in Scotland is required. Some responders argued that such an approach would be beneficial in overcoming some of the barriers that providers experience. However, other witnesses were keen to emphasise the importance of community need-responsive services. The committee agreed that community providers are better equipped to understand local needs but was of the view that they could benefit from a higher level of support and advice at a national level. In its response, the Scottish Government supported the committee&#8217;s view.</p><p>The committee recommended that the Community Transport Association in Scotland would be well placed to take on an expanded role in Scotland, providing leadership and promoting shared standards across the sector, and we called on the Scottish Government to work with the CTA in Scotland to that end. The Scottish Government responded that it will continue to work with and support the CTA to strengthen the services that it can provide to support and encourage community transport initiatives. The Scottish Government also noted in its response that the CTA has been invited to submit costed proposals for an expanded role. The committee was pleased to hear that that recommendation is being explored and that options are being evaluated.</p><p>The Scottish Government also agreed to explore how existing approaches such as the CTA&#8217;s quality mark and the west of Scotland community transport network can be developed further to support groups throughout Scotland and to drive up standards. We welcome that news and believe that the development and adoption of common standards across Scotland will benefit operators, users and funders.</p><p>During our inquiry, we were struck by how little information is available about the community transport sector in Scotland. The consequence of that lack of information is that it is hard to establish where gaps in provision exist, what and where the unmet need is and how to plan for future need. It is also hard to establish, beyond an anecdotal level, what the additional benefits of community transport are, elements of which the report sought to highlight. The Scottish Government stated that it proposes to commission a new piece of qualitative research that will collect information from a selection of community transport providers in Scotland on their services, including benefits and costs, and to deepen its understanding of what services are currently available. We welcome that commitment.</p><p>Another significant long-term challenge for community transport sector providers is the impact of minibus licensing changes, which is already starting to be felt. In short, the challenges come from the costs associated with training volunteers for their D1 licence, which can be significant and burdensome, especially for small providers. Over the course of the inquiry, the committee suggested that there might be scope for cost saving through more effective co-ordination of training, with larger and smaller services working together. To that end, the committee recommended that training co-ordination be looked at in the context of developing a wider means of supporting community transport throughout Scotland.</p><p>Another significant theme of the evidence in the inquiry was the call for greater joint working between agencies providing transport, particularly for health. As many members will know, that call was made in Audit Scotland&#8217;s report &#8220;Transport for health and social care&#8221;, it was a recommendation from the Scottish Government&#8217;s short-life working on patient transport and it was echoed in the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s report to the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee. The Scottish Government responded to that call by saying that it would continue to work with regional transport partnerships. I look forward to Duncan McNeil expanding on that issue in his speech.</p><p>I will briefly mention concessionary travel, an issue that featured in our deliberations. The committee concluded that, due to the significant logistical issues of extending the national concessionary travel scheme infrastructure to all concessionary travel schemes, including car schemes, and the potentially extremely high financial costs, that was not option. However, we recommended that the Scottish Government explore how to address the iniquities in community transport provision.</p><p>The importance of community transport in the lives of those dependent on it should not be underestimated; nor should the invaluable contribution of those who volunteer and work in the community sector. It is vital that those lifeline services can develop and grow and, importantly, be sustained as we work towards making Scotland a fairer and healthy society for all.</p><p>I hope that the Parliament finds our report both informative and interesting, and I look forward to members&#8217; speeches.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s 7th Report, 2013 (Session 4): Report on Community transport (SP Paper 377).</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee welcomes the opportunity to debate its report on community transport and its recommendations to the Scottish Government.

I welcome the opportunity to input into this debate on how the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 might be reformed.</p><p>It is absolutely right to revisit 40-year-old legislation, not least because the profile of offenders has changed dramatically. I cannot speak to the change over 40 years but, as many members know, I was a member of the HMP Craiginches visiting committee for 12 years, from 1994 until I entered this place in 2006. I am very aware that that prison&#8217;s demographic changed over that time&#8212;the population changed from persistent burglars in their 40s and 50s to a majority of young male offenders, whose crimes often relate to drug and alcohol abuse.</p><p>It is absolutely necessary to look at the offending population&#8217;s profile and to tailor any legislative change accordingly. I am not sure that, even 40 years ago, low levels of literacy and of numeracy and childhood neglect and/or abuse were not factors, but much more attention is now focused on background circumstances&#8212;and much more needs to be done to correct such wrongs.</p><p>I am pleased that all sides of the chamber seem to be on board with reviewing this legislation. It is certainly important that the Conservatives focus on this area, given George Osborne&#8217;s comments this week and the need to turn words into action.</p><p>After all, the UK statistics are striking: 68 per cent of those entering custody were unemployed in the month before; 13 per cent of prisoners have never worked; 48 per cent are below the reading level for 11-year-olds; 65 per cent are below the numeracy level for 11-year-olds; 47 per cent have no qualifications; 41 per cent of male offenders, 30 per cent of female offenders and 52 per cent of young offenders have been excluded from school; and only one in five prisoners is capable of completing a job application. However, offenders who undertake prison education are three times less likely to reoffend than those who do not and 68 per cent believe that a job is essential in preventing reoffending.</p><p>Our punishment of offenders has also changed in ways that the 1974 act could not have foreseen. When it is possible and when no risk to the public is predicted, community service is viewed as a viable alternative to prison; it helps to lower reconviction rates, is seen as making a positive contribution to society, keeps families together and maintains employment.</p><p>That is borne out by the release earlier this month of statistics that, as the cabinet secretary has already highlighted, show that reconviction rates in Scotland are at their lowest level for 14 years, with a marked fall in convictions among all groups but, in particular, in people under 21. For me, the most interesting aspect of the statistics is that the one-year reconviction rate for those sentenced to prison for three months or less is 58.9 per cent compared with 31.6 per cent for those given a community sentence. As a result, whenever it is possible&#8212;and, indeed, safe&#8212;keeping offenders out of prison is a win-win situation for offenders and the public, but where incarceration is the only option every effort at rehabilitation must be made.</p><p>That is why I was keen to see what progress had been made in the construction of HMP Grampian. I was very impressed by the amount of teaching and workshop space in the new facility. I wonder whether the cabinet secretary knows what level of interest there has been in occupying those workshops. I think that that will be key.</p><p>That said, all of that effort goes for nothing as long as a third of employers keep saying that they will never hire ex-offenders, even those charged with petty crimes. Interestingly, in a recent article in the Serco journal Ethos, Yvette Carter, the company&#8217;s representative on the employers forum for reducing reoffending, calls that approach</p><p>&#8220;a disaster for business and equality&#8221;</p><p>and goes on to discuss her determination to break down the barriers in employing ex-offenders.</p><p>Ms Carter makes it clear that</p><p>&#8220;Serco has been employing ex-offenders for years&#8221;,</p><p>saying:</p><p>&#8220;It is an opportunity to widen the pool of talent, and plenty of anecdotal evidence shows that these employees offer a ... greater degree of loyalty, commitment and engagement.&#8221;</p><p>She goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Recruiters often don&#8217;t realise that, unless there is a &#8216;need to know&#8217; situation because of the nature of the role, the potential risks are the same as with any employee. In fact, if you hire someone who responds to an ordinary job advert, you just have to believe their CV and references. A candidate could easily hide the fact that they are an alcoholic, drug addict or have other behavioural issues that could affect their work. If you recruit an ex-offender from prison, you can choose to find out everything about his or her past, and therefore be prepared for any possible challenges.&#8221;</p><p>She also says:</p><p>&#8220;At Serco, we don&#8217;t keep a strict record of the numbers of ex-offenders on our staff as we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary. But given that one in five men of working age has committed an offence more serious than a driving conviction, and given that Serco is a major employer, there are inevitably many ex-offenders working for us, many of them employed in our catering, street cleaning, transport and recycling contracts. Recruiting ex-offenders is something that Serco wants to actively pursue.&#8221;</p><p>I am sure that there are other enlightened employers around.</p><p>Ms Carter continues:</p><p>&#8220;The only way to find out how to make this work is by trying it, one case at a time. My feeling is that if someone goes to prison, they&#8217;ve paid the price, and they shouldn&#8217;t be penalised for ever after. And for every pound of tax I pay, I don&#8217;t want it spent on somebody being incarcerated. Helping ex-offenders to start afresh is simply the right thing for us to do.&#8221;</p><p>I whole-heartedly concur and believe that the review is the right thing to do to help such employers.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to follow Alison McInnes&#8217;s thoughtful speech.

Although there is still a long way to go, employment in Scotland is at its highest level in almost five years, economic inactivity dropped by 20,000 over the past quarter and we have the highest youth employment rate of any nation in the UK, at 57.2 per cent compared with the UK average of 49.8 per cent.</p><p>Scottish Enterprise has played an important role in driving economic growth in the Scottish economy, and its ambition is to grow the number of companies under its account-managed arm. Some 300 of its account-managed companies are in the oil and gas sector and about 250 are in the food and drink industry, with 46 of those in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.</p><p>An example of the help that Scottish Enterprise has given is its work with Hydrasun in my constituency, where the First Minister launched the oil and gas strategy. Hydrasun is a leading supplier of fluid connectors, hoses, fitting instrumentation and process control products, coupled with added-value services including integrity management, primarily to the oil and gas sector but also to a wide range of secondary sectors including the petrochemical, marine and defence industries.</p><p>Scottish Enterprise has supported Hydrasun to export to 58 different countries. Interestingly, it employs a number of linguists to help with that. Scottish Enterprise has helped with an acquisition in Brazil and has helped to drive Hydrasun not only to export but to establish operational bases and manufacturing facilities in Angola and the United Arab Emirates. The company also services the Gulf of Mexico oil industry and has partnership and distribution agreements in Egypt and Thailand. Its truly impressive growth has been helped by Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>While Scottish Enterprise has helped by account managing that company and others, it has not helped them on its own. It has worked with Scottish Development International on exports and with local universities on research and development. Many of the quarterly meetings that politicians in the north-east have with Scottish Enterprise Grampian have been at the premises of account-managed companies, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The advice that has been given has not just been sectoral. Middle managers were initially sceptical about having management skills training with colleagues from other industries, but it proved to be very worth while. I am sure that it would not have happened without the help and co-operation of Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>Work with other organisations has been particularly evident in the food and drink sector. The food and health innovation service, which is based at the Rowett institute of nutrition and health in Aberdeen, directly supports food and drink companies that seek to exploit the burgeoning market for healthy food and drink products, which is estimated to be worth &#163;20&#160;billion in the UK and more than &#163;300&#160;billion globally.</p><p>In that regard, Scottish Enterprise works with Scotland Food and Drink and, for example, the James Hutton Institute, in my constituency, and its crop research arm in Dundee, which has helped to develop soft fruit production by introducing new products. Scottish Enterprise also works with other people in the food and drink sector, of course.</p><p>I am particularly interested in how small and medium-sized companies grow their businesses, access the skills of our university graduates and take on apprentices. The Scotgrad scheme has much merit but needs far more publicity. There also needs to be more co-ordination between the business gateway and Scottish Enterprise, with a view to driving companies into greater growth, as many members said.</p><p>Scottish Enterprise is on the right track. I have met no one in the agency who is in any way complacent or thinks that it cannot continue to improve its service to the Scottish economy and Scottish companies.

However, I have been substituting in recent weeks, because although David Stewart is incapacitated, so too is my colleague, Adam Ingram. We wish them both a speedy recovery.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the petitioner, Professor Crichton, has brought his considerable knowledge on the subject to the committee in highlighting the problems that are faced. I suspect that members do not have to be on the committee to know about the problems, because many people go to MSPs&#8217; surgeries with flood-related problems.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s positive work with DEFRA, the other devolved Administrations and the Association of British Insurers to make flood risk information more widely available, so that those who are at risk can have affordable insurance. Insurance is a necessity, but it is a pain not only to organise insurance but to read the small print and then hope that everything is covered. That is why it is important that agencies such as SEPA work with the insurance industry to make things better for our constituents.</p><p>I understand that data sharing has been an issue, and that the ABI does not have access to the Scottish flood defence asset database when setting premiums. That makes it much more difficult for insurers to take into account flood risk when setting premiums for people in Scotland. SEPA has been working with the local authorities. I was pleased to hear the minister say that all 32 local authorities have now responded to the requests.</p><p>The Scottish Government has been proactive on the issue of reducing flood risk. &#8220;The National Flood Risk Assessment&#8221;, which was published in December 2011, provides for the first time a national picture of flood risk across Scotland. That is a major milestone towards Scotland targeting efforts to plan and invest in reducing the impacts in those areas that are most vulnerable to flooding. The sum of &#163;8 million has been invested in developing a state-of-the-art national flood warning dissemination service. In addition, a joint Scottish flood forecasting service between SEPA and the Met Office has been established.</p><p>I want to make the case for prevention to be at the top of the agenda. By that, I do not simply mean putting in place flood defence systems; such systems are often extremely expensive and, as Elaine Murray and Stop Climate Chaos Scotland highlighted, their infrastructures are extremely carbon intensive. Other forward planning by councils and SEPA is also needed.</p><p>I am pleased, for example, that SEPA has relaxed restrictions on deepening straight watercourses. However, landowners must be encouraged to clear and deepen ditches and burns much more and to allow land to be set aside for upstream flooding. I know from helping a constituent in Portlethen, who has been flooded twice in recent years, how difficult it is to ascertain who the landowner upstream is and to contact them and encourage them to act. I am not sure whether the powers of enforcement exist with local authorities or SEPA to force landowners to act. Furthermore, when a householder is encouraged&#8212;as my constituent was&#8212;to build their own flood defences around their property, there seems to be a lack of agreement among the agencies about what is required for, or will be acceptable to, insurance companies.</p><p>Surely, councils have an obligation not to allow residential or commercial development on flood plains. I for one am not convinced that it is sufficient for the builder to put in earth defences between a development and the watercourse. Such developments simply should not be allowed.</p><p>New developments can disturb the water table and normal watercourses. That is a problem for my constituents at Checkbar, and near where I live in Durris a new development has disturbed the watercourse, so that existing properties are more liable to flooding. It is disturbing that no one seems to want to take responsibility for alleviating such problems. I have had to hold meetings to get builders, SEPA and the council round the table and knock heads together to see how problems can be resolved. Meanwhile, people are living with flood risk.</p><p>I am not sure that developers and local authorities adequately take account of the disturbance of existing watercourses and the water table when they consider proposed new developments. Does the minister know of anything further that can be done in that regard?</p><p>I understand that people in the merchant quarter of Kevin Stewart&#8217;s Aberdeen Central constituency have had difficulties with insurers because of constant flooding in the locale. Kevin Stewart told me that many affected businesses have had to wait ages for payouts and face the prospect of not getting insurance at all unless Scottish Water and the council resolve the problem to the satisfaction of insurance companies.</p><p>As members said, for many small and medium-sized businesses one flood is a tragedy that might tip them over the edge; more than one flood is often far too much for a business to bear, particularly when insurance companies leave people in the lurch.</p><p>Although some householders who experience flooding do not have a good experience with their insurers, some insurers try to help as much as possible. We need consistency across the industry, and we need something in place that can replace the statement of principles.</p><p>I hope that the flood risk assessment maps and plans that are produced under the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 will provide information that enables the insurance industry to offer premiums that more accurately reflect the lower risk in Scotland. I hope that the information that is held on databases can be shared with the industry, so that individuals&#8217; premiums more accurately reflect the risk.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

The number of briefings that has been received is one of the highest I have ever known. An extremely broad range of organisations submitted briefings, from charities such as SCIAF and Oxfam to care organisations and construction and other business organisations. Even the British Medical Association sent a briefing, on the ethical procurement of surgical instruments. As Linda Fabiani and Tavish Scott said, there are high expectations of the bill. I am not sure that they will be met but I can reassure members that the committee will try as far as possible to listen to and accommodate all the contributions.</p><p>Like Elaine Murray, I attended the David Hume Institute seminar on procurement in January. I was impressed by the amount of interest in and enthusiasm for meaningful change that was shown by the speakers at that event and in the informal discussions afterwards. We heard about the importance of sharing good practice in public procurement and the willingness of a variety of organisations to do that. We heard about concerns about the cost of quality bids from prospective contractors, which can sometimes be in the region of &#163;1 million for a &#163;40 million project. Those costs are ultimately paid for by the public purse as part of the overall contract costs. In some cases, the bid costs are also paid out to unsuccessful bidders, which is not unreasonable. Again, though, that adds significantly to overall costs. Perhaps it would be worth while to identify any steps that could be taken to reduce or streamline the work that is required to formulate and deliver bids and therefore reduce the overall project costs.</p><p>As has been mentioned, it is expected that the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee will conduct formal scrutiny of the bill at stage 1. We will certainly call on all areas of the public, private and third sectors to engage fully and directly with us in the formal scrutiny of the bill. We will seek to work with the various representative bodies on how we might best encourage that engagement.</p><p>In addition, I fully expect that the committee will seek to identify opportunities to hold informal discussions with representatives of all sectors to hear suggestions for improvements that would make a meaningful difference to the ability of all sectors to engage with the procurement process in future.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688659", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Procurement Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been extremely useful and I thank members very much for their contributions.

It was interesting to hear from members who thought that the committees that will scrutinise other bills that will go through Parliament, such as the health and social care bill and the community empowerment bill, could in doing so take on board some of the points that have been raised today.</p><p>A few themes can be identified in this afternoon&#8217;s debate. Chic Brodie, Kevin Stewart, Linda Fabiani and others spoke about breaking down the barriers and stopping the inclusion of risk-averse conditions that are there simply to cover people&#8217;s backs. We need to ask questions and challenge existing practices to see whether they are delivering the best for the taxpayer, the user and local businesses. I was interested to hear about Mike MacKenzie&#8217;s experience and I liked what he said about being not risk averse but risk aware. The financial viability of the businesses and organisations that are tendering for work is vital. I often feel that third sector organisations are subjected to much more scrutiny than private sector organisations are, and I do not think that that is fair.</p><p>Members raised the idea that people sometimes hide behind EU procurement rules. It is important that, before contracts are awarded, the bidders are made fully aware of what is required in the contracts. I was interested to hear the Minister for Housing and Welfare say that, when a public meeting was held to discuss the contract for the Aberdeen western peripheral route, a huge number of people turned up to find out what the contract was all about. I take on board Elaine Murray&#8217;s comment about the need for feedback, so that organisations feel that, even if they have not won one contract, they can tender for others.</p><p>I say to Tavish Scott that I raised at the David Hume Institute seminar, which was mentioned earlier, my concern about hubs and consortia. There is a role for Scottish firms coming together in consortia in order to bid for large contracts, but I have a feeling that a too-cosy situation might develop between companies that have the major contracts and bodies that require work to be done, and that people might just go with the contractors that they know. I will keep that in mind when we scrutinise the bill.</p><p>Many members mentioned the living wage, blacklisting and tax avoidance. A lot of hot air was expended on the subjects, as well as some light being shed. The public sector has made significant progress on the living wage and the Scottish Government has led on making it be seen much more as something that should be the norm rather than not, as is the case in some companies. As a former human resources professional, I think that blacklisting is sloppy HR practice. Companies should not have dealings with companies that have a blacklist. Instead, they should do their own recruitment to a much higher level, if that is what is required. On tax avoidance, the public have led by example by boycotting the companies that have been trying to avoid paying tax.</p><p>I was pleased to hear what the cabinet secretary said in her closing remarks about the sustainability issue.</p><p>This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate.

We thank them for their contribution to the scrutiny process and for assisting us in our deliberations.</p><p>The bill is short and technical, and it is an important element of the Scottish Government&#8217;s strategy to upgrade the Forth crossing transport network. As the minister said, its main focus is to pave the way for a single operator to carry out the management and maintenance of the Forth road bridge and the new Forth crossing.</p><p>The bill provides for the dissolution of FETA, which currently manages and maintains the Forth road bridge, and allows for the trunking of the Forth road bridge, which brings it under ministers&#8217; direct responsibility. It also allows for the transfer of all FETA&#8217;s assets and liabilities to Scottish ministers and for FETA staff to be transferred into the employment of a new single bridge operator to be appointed by Scottish ministers. Each of those issues is addressed in the committee&#8217;s short stage 1 report.</p><p>Although the committee welcomes the bill, we note the concerns that were expressed about the consultation process during the bill&#8217;s development. Instead of carrying out public consultation on the bill&#8217;s proposals, Transport Scotland officials adopted a targeted approach to consultation, involving only organisations and community groups that it had identified as having a direct and local interest in the Forth road bridge&#8217;s management and maintenance, and stated in evidence that, given the bill&#8217;s relatively narrow scope and technical nature, that kind of approach was considered more appropriate than a wider public consultation.</p><p>Although the committee acknowledges the obvious value of close and continuous dialogue with stakeholders directly affected by a legislative proposal, it is concerned that restricting consultation to only those groups can potentially disenfranchise others who might have a legitimate and relevant interest. An example of the risks of such an approach was highlighted in evidence from the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, which advised the committee that it had not been made aware of Transport Scotland&#8217;s limited consultation process and was therefore unable to participate. In fact, the union had a very clear interest in the bill&#8217;s proposals, given their impact on FETA staff.</p><p>The committee is aware that its session 3 predecessor committee, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee, raised similar concerns in relation to the Scottish Government&#8217;s failure to carry out a public consultation on the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill, which was clearly also related to the Forth road bridge. Regardless of whether legislative proposals are considered to be of limited or narrow interest, it is expected that an appropriate and proportionate public consultation will be carried out to ensure that everyone with an interest can input their views. As a result, the committee in its report</p><p>&#8220;calls on the Scottish Government to reflect on its approach to consultation in relation to future legislative proposals.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal to contract a single bridge operating company to manage and maintain the new Forth crossing, the Forth road bridge and connecting roads in the vicinity of the two crossings received strong support in evidence to the committee. The committee shares the view that contracting a single bridge operating company is the most appropriate and cost-effective approach to the management and maintenance of both structures and is also reassured that, under the new arrangements, the valuable expertise and experience of FETA staff will be available to the new operator, which will ensure a strong element of continuity.</p><p>Although content with the proposal for a single operator for both crossings, the committee considered it unfortunate that, with its valuable and extensive experience of and expertise in managing and maintaining the Forth road bridge, FETA was not able to be considered for the role of carrying out those operations for both crossings. However, as the minister has said, the committee was advised by the Government that if FETA had participated in a tendering exercise backed by Scottish Government funding, there was a very real risk of such a move being found in contravention of European Union state aid rules.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687687", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee welcomed the introduction of the Forth Road Bridge Bill and agreed to recommend to the Parliament that the bill&#8217;s general principles be agreed to.

The Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal is for the contract to have a five-year duration plus add-ons that could take the term up to 10 years in total. However, FETA indicated in written evidence that it had a 15-year planning cycle for major maintenance and works programmes. FETA suggested that, in recognition of that, a minimum contract length of 10 years would be required.</p><p>Although the committee has no strong view on the optimum contract length, it recognises the importance of the contract duration being appropriate for the maintenance regimes that will be required.

I will outline the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s view of the report. First, I thank everyone who gave evidence to the committee and I thank the other three committees, whose work on the report means that there has been proper scrutiny of an important and extensive document.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of our academic witnesses could not attend our evidence session, so we may not have received as balanced a view as we could have done. We focused on two main themes: energy efficiency measures in homes and communities, and transport. We made some practical suggestions about the clarity of the document to the Government and I am pleased that the Minister for Housing and Welfare said in evidence that she will reflect on suggestions for improvement in the presentation of material in RPP2 made by our and other committees.</p><p>We are clear about the enormity of the challenge facing the housing and transport sectors in contributing to meeting Scotland&#8217;s ambitious and world-leading climate change targets. We will need significant behavioural changes across Scottish society if we are to meet that challenge. It was made clear to the committee that improving energy efficiency in our homes is key if we are to meet the emissions reduction targets. However, that it is not an easy task&#8212;not least because of the large number of existing hard-to-treat properties in Scotland. We feel that regulation for minimum standards in private housing and energy-efficient building standards for new homes will help Scotland face the challenge. It is essential that we reduce the cost of heating our homes through energy-efficiency measures and that we seek to mitigate the associated cost and other barriers that make it difficult for home owners to do that.</p><p>We are concerned that it is not clear how the UK-based policies aimed at addressing this&#8212;for instance, the energy company obligation and the green deal&#8212;will work alongside Scottish policies. We recommend that the Scottish Government works closely with the UK Government to ensure that the Scottish-specific issues are fully recognised in the delivery of those schemes. Our committee will be writing to the UK Government about that.</p><p>We welcome the new national retrofit programme and the warm homes fund, which will help those in the most fuel-poor areas. It is important that the Scottish Government works with stakeholders and especially with local authorities, who have a key strategic role in identifying fuel-poor areas and housing stock that badly needs upgrading. The current economic climate and the impact of the welfare reform agenda make it even more important that programmes like that are rolled out to those who need them most. We look forward to seeing the detail of how the retrofit programme will be delivered when the Scottish Government publishes its sustainable housing strategy.</p><p>I will move on to the transport sector and what the committee believes is vital if RPP2 is to set Scotland on the right path to meeting the targets up to 2027. The Government must be able to embrace emerging technologies and innovations to meet the challenges in this sector. That is why we support a flexible approach to proposals and policies for the period up to 2027. I am pleased that the Government is funding a wide range of initiatives and programmes, such as those on decarbonising vehicles, promoting sustainable communities and encouraging people to change their travel practices and behaviour.</p><p>We do not know what the economic climate will be like in 2027, nor what budget levels future Governments will have. Since the 2009 act setting our emissions targets was passed, the economic climate has changed significantly and it will be a hugely significant factor in our ability to deliver the changes and improvements required to meet those targets.</p><p>The committee also acknowledges the positive impact that a shift to more sustainable procurement methods and procedures might have on carbon emissions reduction. I have little doubt that this will be an important part of Parliament&#8217;s scrutiny of the Government&#8217;s forthcoming procurement reform bill.</p><p>We hope that the Government will address the various concerns in our report and that these will be reflected in the final RPP2, setting out how Scotland will go about meeting its climate change targets up to 2027.

I am sure that you would rather be down here, contributing to the debate, than up there.</p><p>I add my congratulations to Angus MacDonald on lodging the motion to congratulate the SAYFC on reaching its 75th anniversary. It is very important to recognise this historic year and the contribution of young farmers clubs to public life in general.</p><p>I really enjoyed reading the brochure, &#8220;Developing the Youth of Rural Scotland&#8221;. Although I come from farming stock, I was never a member of a young farmers club. I attended a good few young farmers events, including memorable events such as dinner dances&#8212;and yes, I can remember them. I recall my friends travelling many miles to young farmers dances at Echt, which ran some of the best dances in the north-east. I notice from the brochure that Echt young farmers are having a great time to this day.</p><p>We note from the brochure that there are 77 clubs throughout Scotland, 18 of which are in Aberdeenshire and Moray, where agriculture is hugely important. It is no accident that there are so many clubs in those two counties. One of those set up in the early days was Keith young farmers club, in whose formation my father and his brother were involved. I know how pivotal those clubs were in giving my father and his brother the confidence to enter public life in other spheres. As many members know, my father went on to become a member of the Westminster Parliament and his brother is a past president of the NFUS.</p><p>Many people use the skills, confidence, networks and international contacts gained in young farmers clubs to go on to make a significant contribution to their communities and further afield. Many young farmers go on to become councillors, Burns club stalwarts and effective members of many organisations, including the NFUS. They become effective lobbyists on behalf of the agricultural industry and the rural life of Scotland. I am not sure that the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment always appreciates their doing that, but I am sure that on balance he agrees that those people have a pivotal role in ensuring that agriculture contributes to the economic wellbeing of Scotland.</p><p>As other members have said, they also play a pivotal role in agricultural shows throughout rural Scotland&#8212;and we know how important those are to the local economy and the tourism industry&#8212;not just by producing excellent tug-of-war teams, as my local club Durris tends to do, but in the whole organisation of the event.</p><p>One cannot underestimate the importance of the international arm of young farmers clubs. I know how many young farmers have spent time in dairy farms in New Zealand, in the vast agriculture and cereal plains of the United States or in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, and have come back with much more drive and determination than they left with.</p><p>As agriculture becomes more mechanised and less labour-intensive, the social networking side of young farmers clubs becomes ever more important, not just, as Angus MacDonald mentioned, for those directly involved in the industry but for rural communities in general. Isolation and loneliness in rural areas are a real threat and clubs can combat that. It is heartening to see more clubs coming into being. I am sure that the clubs will have another very successful 75 years.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687401", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs (75th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I wish Sarah Boyack and Alex Fergusson a safe and productive visit to Malawi next week as they take forward the work that we in this Parliament do through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to try to enrich and enhance the democratic capabilities of the members of the Malawi Parliament, and I hope that they will take our good wishes to them. I was privileged to visit Malawi for the same work in January 2011. I am now the convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Malawi, so I obviously keep a close eye on what is happening there.</p><p>David Livingstone was indeed a remarkable man, as James Kelly said, who worked as a child and into his early teens but continued to learn in order to better himself. He was deeply religious, too, but he was not the standard imperialist explorer. He worked to protect the interests of the tribes that he came across. Although he did evangelise as a missionary, he apparently did not manage to get that many conversions. He did not force his beliefs on those whom he came across and he was far more motivated by the prospect of exploration, scientific discovery and&#8212;most important&#8212;ending slavery.</p><p>David Livingstone believed that he needed to find an easy route into the centre of the continent in order to bring legitimate trade as an alternative to the slave trade. He campaigned tirelessly against slavery and worked to spread knowledge of its horrors back home in the UK. In particular, he reported on the Nyangwe massacre, when slave traders fired into a crowded market and 400 people were killed. It was British pressure that was in part due to Livingstone&#8217;s efforts that led the Sultan of Zanzibar to make the slave trade illegal on the east coast of Africa.</p><p>Unlike many other missionaries, Livingstone remained respected as a great humanitarian in the areas in which he travelled. As a doctor, he was able to provide medical aid to the people whom he met, which helped to win their trust. He was one of the first to administer quinine in doses that are now considered to be effective and he suggested early on that mosquitoes were associated with malaria. For those reasons, he is still deeply respected in Malawi and so well known that everyone you meet there can tell you something about him. I think that that is the basis for the deep relationship between our two countries. Through the CPG, we have learned so much about the projects that Scotland&#8217;s civil society undertakes in Malawi.</p><p>I point out, however, that behind every good man is a good woman. An often ignored element of Dr Livingstone&#8217;s story is his wife, Mary, who was often known by her maiden name of Moffat. She was born in Africa and her father was a missionary, too, who was famous for protecting the interests of natives. Moffat crossed the Kalahari&#8212;imagine this&#8212;while pregnant. She was, in fact, the first white woman to cross the Kalahari. She accompanied Livingstone on many of his other strenuous expeditions, often with her family in tow. She died from malaria after rejoining Livingstone in Africa following a period of living in Great Britain. We should recognise her sacrifices, too, which played a crucial role in enabling Livingstone to make his mark in history.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Bob Doris on securing this timely debate and look forward to a busy two weeks ahead as we celebrate the bicentenary of Livingstone&#8217;s birth.

The food and drink sector has grown since the SNP Government made it one of the key sectors that Scottish Enterprise should focus on in order to grow the Scottish economy. We should recognise both the success that has been had to date and the progress that can still be made.</p><p>The north-east makes a big contribution to that effort. According to Grampian food and drink forum, the region contributes 14 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s agriculture output, 26 per cent of its cereal value and 11 per cent of total Scottish food and drink employment. In particular, we should praise the contribution of the primary producers, such as the farmers who in all weathers&#8212;it has, let us face it, been pretty grim recently&#8212;produce high-quality beef cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, fruit and milk. Without them, none of this success story would occur.</p><p>There is still some work to do to convince hill farmers and crofters that it is worth their while&#8212;and their bank balances&#8212;to increase stocking levels. I know that in the beef sector, for example, McIntosh Donald in my constituency can process all the cattle that it can get, mainly for sale to Tesco. On that subject, I thank the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth for all their help in securing a new buyer for that and other parts of the Vion business.</p><p>However, I will focus my remarks on the contribution that fish and fish products make to this success story. Aberdeen city and shire remains the most important fishing region in Scotland and the UK, with more than &#163;100 million-worth of fish per annum landed at the port of Peterhead. Others may focus on the farmed fish market, but I will concentrate on the fish brought to our shores&#8212;again, in all weathers&#8212;by our fishermen. In recent years, the fishing sector has experienced a lot of pain, with quotas, cuts to days at sea and the decommissioning of vessels. Traditionally, the fishermen have landed fish and expected the merchants to buy their produce and find markets for it. Now at last, I think, we are beginning to see more collaboration and co-operation between the harvesters and sellers. However, as Tavish Scott mentioned, the prices at the quayside can still be very volatile.</p><p>Only last week, those of us who attend the North East Scotland Fisheries Development Partnership were informed by John Wallace of Peterhead harbour of the rock-bottom prices for white fish at the port. That is partly because of the large amount of cod and haddock in the traditional fishing grounds, which seems to herald a return to the stocking levels that we have known in the past. That is good news if we can deliver security of supply, given that the Norwegian fishing industry, backed by its Government, is making a concerted effort to grab much of the supermarket market in the UK and our markets abroad. Our merchants are fighting hard and successfully to retain those markets.</p><p>Today, much store is set by adding value, and I would like to highlight the success story of Joseph Robertson (Aberdeen) Ltd in my constituency. Joseph Robertson used mainly to bread fish, but now it does that and much more. It supplies Christmas party food, among other foods, to Morrisons and other supermarkets. This year, it has been selected as one of 35 businesses to take part in the Asda supplier development academy 2013, which is backed by Scotland Food &amp; Drink. Ten of the companies that participated in the programme in 2011 have seen their sales go up by up to 330 per cent, so the selection of Joseph Robertson to take part in the scheme is a great accolade, and I wish it every success.</p><p>Aberdeen&#8217;s contribution to the growing food and drink market includes the contribution of the Rowett institute of nutrition and health, which has been working with Marks and Spencer, among others, in creating nutritious, healthy ready meals.</p><p>As Elaine Murray said, following the horsemeat scandal, last week the focus turned to the dangers of eating too much processed meat. As I listened to &#8220;Any Questions?&#8221; at the weekend, I was horrified that the only alternatives to the full English breakfast that the panellists could come up with were muesli and porridge. There was no mention of kippers, Arbroath smokies, kedgeree made with smoked haddock or even scrambled egg with small pieces of smoked salmon. It is clear that we have a huge education task to undertake on the variety of breakfasts that we produce, never mind the other meals in the day. The good thing about fish is that there is very little waste.</p><p>As someone from Banffshire, I cannot fail to mention the contribution that whisky makes to the success of Scotland&#8217;s food and drink. Whisky exports reached a record high of &#163;4.23 billion in 2011, which represented an increase of 23 per cent from 2010 and 50 per cent from 2007. New distilleries are being opened and existing ones are working at full pelt. As a youngster, I was always made aware of the value of the whisky in the bonds around Keith, which, when taxed, was higher than the value of the gold in the Bank of England&#8212;that was before Gordon Brown sold off most of it.</p><p>We may moan about our weather, but the temperate climate and the abundance of rain for water for whisky and grass for our milk cows&#8212;milk being the raw ingredient for ice cream, in the production of which we in the north-east are so successful&#8212;mean that we are in an excellent position. Our excellent reputation for a clean environment and for producing high-quality foodstuffs can only be built on further.</p><p>I support the Government motion.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686116", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my condolences to those of the cabinet secretary on the deaths of the researchers from the James Hutton Institute, the Macaulay part of which is in my constituency.

In my role as convener of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, I thank the Finance Committee for the report, which will certainly help to inform our deliberations, especially on housing.</p><p>In defining old age, we need to completely change our thinking that everybody over 60, 65 or pensionable age is immediately a burden on the state. That is simply not the case. If I think back to how my grandparents were at 60 and then compare that with my parents and now their children, I see vast differences in people&#8217;s health and abilities. The saying that 60 is the new 40 is perhaps not far off the mark.</p><p>Like Mike MacKenzie, I look forward to the day when we can devise our own pensions policy that could reduce wealth inequalities. Why should someone who leaves school at 16 have to work until they are 65 and beyond while someone who continues in education into their early 20s and thereby lands a less physically demanding job retires at the same age? As I have said before in the chamber, surely it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to devise a more equitable pensions system.</p><p>Many over-60s will lead active, healthy and fulfilling lives for many years to come and Government policies must be designed to enhance those lives for longer. The Government&#8217;s vision is that</p><p>&#8220;everyone is able to live longer healthier lives at home, or in a homely setting&#8221;.</p><p>Central to helping that to happen is undoubtedly free personal care&#8212;a policy that is under threat from Labour&#8217;s cuts commission. According to Age UK, it costs &#163;5,000 to provide personal care for someone and at least &#163;25,000 for a person to be looked after in a care home. That is an excellent example of preventative spending but, as we have heard from James Kelly, the Labour Party would rather spend money on totally unproductive bureaucrats working out means testing than on helping older people and treating them all equally.</p><p>One of the things that leapt out at me from the report was the fact that many rural authorities will have a larger proportion of older people than urban areas will, and I wonder whether that will be taken into account in decision making on local government settlements in the future, as, in a rural setting, social isolation might be a much greater threat.</p><p>The Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee is about to embark on an inquiry into community transport, both urban and rural. Hopefully, that report will be able to contribute to the issue of what is required in the future in that area.</p><p>There is no doubt that the concessionary travel scheme is helping older people to stay healthier longer, as people are able to get out to go to clubs and societies, the shops and entertainment and, crucially, to visit family. Social interaction is key to longer life, and the lack of it has been proven to curtail longevity and have an impact on health, as conditions such as dementia are more likely if a person lives alone and in isolation.</p><p>Fiona McLeod highlighted the fact that about 75 per cent of older people are homeowners. I agree with her about the need for suitable private accommodation. I have been to several exhibitions of such assisted-living sites in my constituency and now see them in construction in Cults and Mannofield. It is important that those developments are near amenities or are on bus routes to amenities.</p><p>Hanzala Malik raised the issue of the bedroom tax. I agree that it is relevant, as it will add to pressure on the one-bedroom or smaller-unit houses. As the Finance Committee convener pointed out, household sizes are diminishing and there is more of a need for one-bed or two-bed accommodation. We know that house builders seem to prefer to build larger houses and planning policy might need to change to make it easier for those companies that concentrate on building assisted-living houses to build the kind of houses that are needed.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm briefly mentioned some of the barriers to making adaptations, but I cannot stress enough the importance of spending money on adaptations. The issue is something about which I get my ear bent every time I visit or telephone my father. He insists that he would be in a care home now, rather than at home, if he had not converted a large cupboard into a shower and toilet. I have to agree with him, so I am now bending the cabinet secretary&#8217;s ear on the matter. I think that any money&#8212;if there is any spare&#8212;that was sent in the direction of local authorities and housing associations for adaptations would be money well spent. Every time that older residents move into accommodation, there should be discussions about the adaptations that are required. The briefing from the Bield, Hanover Scotland and Trust housing associations points out that for every &#163;1 that is spent on adaptation, the Scottish Government recoups up to &#163;4. That is also a good example of preventative spend. Of course, any additional money that the cabinet secretary could put into housing would be welcome.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a useful debate on a useful report.

If I were leaving university today, I would consider the water industries in Scotland as offering very exciting career opportunities.</p><p>I add my thanks to all those who have been involved in the passage of the bill, including the committee clerks, the bill team and the stakeholders who helped us in our deliberations. Early on, the committee visited Scottish Water&#8217;s sampling offices at the Heriot-Watt science park, where we learned a great deal about Scottish Water&#8217;s activities. The water supply and waste water sub-sector in Scotland is estimated to have a market value of &#163;709 million and to employ around 6,000 people. I am referring not to Scottish Water itself, but to the more than 300 companies in the sector in Scotland.</p><p>Scottish Water&#8217;s record since its formation has been impressive. Since 2002, Scottish Water has stripped out 40 per cent of its costs, and it now provides water to Scottish customers at a lower cost than any of the private companies in the rest of the UK. Drinking water quality is at its highest level, leakage has been reduced by 70 million litres per day, and it has recorded the highest-ever customer satisfaction level. Even this week, Scottish Water announced that it is to invest around &#163;250 million in improving water projects in the Clyde area.</p><p>To me and to SNP colleagues, it is inconceivable that the Tories and their Lib Dem colleagues can still be hell bent on privatising this valuable Scottish resource. Let us face it: mutualisation is the first step on that road. When I challenged Alex Johnstone on that on the way back from Heriot-Watt, he admitted&#8212;as he did today&#8212;that indeed Scottish Water was impressive, but he trotted out the old broken record of the Tories: public bad, private good.</p><p>There we have it: dogma rules okay.

The Government has commissioned a virtual centre of expertise on water, which can pull together advice and information on water management. As the cabinet secretary mentioned, the James Hutton Institute, which is based in my constituency, is leading on that, as is the University of Dundee&#8217;s United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization centre for water law, policy and science, and Scottish Water itself. All those organisations provide a strong basis for Scotland to be known as a hydro nation.</p><p>The Government wants Scotland to be</p><p>&#8220;the helpdesk to the world on water governance&#8221;</p><p>and those three institutions also provide a strong basis for that. The fact that Scottish Water already works in countries such as Qatar, India and Canada demonstrates the potential to meet that aim. Scottish Water International works with Governments at national and state level on methods of governance, openness, transparency and accountability and we have already seen the benefit of that, when John Swinney was able to find &#163;50 million to use elsewhere in the Scottish budget rather than on Scottish Water. WaterAid is supported financially and with expertise by many who work in the industry and it is a good example of how Scotland works worldwide.</p><p>Although Scottish Water is a high-performing public company, it is not resting on its laurels. I was interested to hear from Peter Peacock, and the body he now chairs, Customer Forum, on how willing Scottish Water is to engage with it and others to have other perspectives on the industry. Scottish Water would tend to admit that it comes to the area from a rather geeky engineering background, so it is interesting to hear from customers and others on how the industry is perceived.</p><p>Business Stream still has a lot to do to assure business customers that it deserves their business, as competitors from other parts of the UK enter the market. I wish Scottish Water&#8217;s new chief executive, Douglas Millican, all the best in his new role and I hope that the message of the passing of the bill is that Scotland appreciates this fantastic resource and is about how we manage it and use our experience to help other countries benefit from Scottish expertise.</p><p>Part of my constituency is rural&#8212;as is part of Elaine Murray&#8217;s&#8212;and I recognise totally the importance of septic tanks to a lot of our constituents.

I hope that, through partnership with landowners and farmers, we will be able to drive down those costs, by ensuring that the water that comes off our hills needs less treatment before it reaches customers.</p><p>I say to the cabinet secretary that I hope that an information campaign will be run in several languages on the disposal of fats and oils before there are any charges or convictions. Some business premises are perhaps still not aware of their duties and responsibilities on such disposal.</p><p>The bill offers huge opportunities for all who are involved in the water sector in Scotland.

More recently, only five Labour members signed Mark McDonald&#8217;s motion on bringing forward the January pay date. The SNP did that when it was in power in Aberdeen City Council. It would be nice to see some consistency and continuity from the Labour benches. I wonder whether Labour&#8217;s cuts commission would take away from families the much-needed support that is so helpful in this area.</p><p>I am grateful to CAS for its briefing, which shows the reasons for the rise in the number of people who are struggling to make it to pay day. Those reasons are the stagnant economy, public sector cuts, mainstream credit being more difficult to access, and the number of people who hold and use an overdraft facility or credit card having fallen by around 1 million in the UK. The other factor, which Kezia Dugdale mentioned, is the speed at which customers can access credit without adequate scrutiny of their current commitments and their ability to pay back the loan. That has, of course, resulted in many people regretting taking out payday loans. They find that they are unable to pay them back and find themselves in a downward spiral of debt. Evidence suggests that lenders are unsympathetic to customers who find themselves in financial difficulties, and it is not clear that even lenders who have signed up to the new customer charter are adhering to the good practice that is advised therein.</p><p>I wish that citizens advice bureaux and credit unions had the ability to advertise their services as much as those who offer payday loans. People need to know that their first port of call should be their local credit union office, their citizens advice bureau, or even their MSP, who can direct them to the proper agency for their needs. Many organisations offer financial health checks and people may find out that they are entitled to benefits that they have not accessed or that an organisation can help them to reconfigure their debt. I have noticed that some churches now offer that service, too.</p><p>I am a member of a credit union, a supporter of credit unions, and I support their work in schools, but I get the feeling that that is not the position of successive Westminster Governments. Some credit unions in Scotland are increasingly frustrated by the lack of progress and support from south of the border and are asking themselves why they bother belonging to cross-border organisations in the field.</p><p>The credit union sector is stronger in Scotland.

According to ACSEF, the oil and gas industry contributes &#163;7 billion in exports, &#163;13 billion or one quarter of all corporation tax collected in the UK, and &#163;6 billion in corporate and payroll taxes. Oil and gas activity from Aberdeen city and shire accounts for 15 to 16 per cent of gross domestic product, and it is vital that the right conditions are in place for Aberdeen and the north-east of Scotland to continue to be the hub for oil and gas in future, and that, with independence, the whole of Scotland begins to reap the benefit of this resource.</p><p>The oil and gas industry supports approximately 450,000 jobs in the UK, half of which are in Scotland. It is therefore important that the expertise that has been developed in the north-east is retained in the north-east and in Scotland. It should be used in the North Sea and overseas, and in other fields such as renewables. Many oil and gas firms are already involved in those other fields.</p><p>As Rhoda Grant said, a recent PWC report suggested that the oil and gas industry might have to find another 120,000 workers during the next 10 years. Many oil and gas companies are currently recruiting large numbers of people. I am heartened that our learning institutions in Aberdeen and beyond have embraced the concept of the oil and gas academy and I hope that the whole industry will get involved with that. It is quite unsustainable for companies within the industry to carry on poaching employees from one another, thereby driving up salary costs, rather than taking on apprentices and giving opportunities to highly trained graduates from our universities.</p><p>I pay tribute to all the men and women who work in the industry&#8212;although there are not nearly enough of the latter&#8212;onshore and especially offshore. We should make no mistake about it: those people work in a very risky industry. I know from experience what it is like to travel offshore in a helicopter, and I have seen at first hand the work that is done on the drill floor and derrick. It can be scary. That is why safety is always at the forefront. Although the current helicopter situation is costing the industry millions, it is vital that all the safety issues surrounding helicopters are resolved so that workers can confidently use that method of transport offshore.</p><p>The perception that high salaries and wages are paid in the industry is correct&#8212;it is a risky industry. Nonetheless, I highlight one of the unique challenges faced by the industry. Everyone agrees with the introduction of automatic enrolment into pension schemes. It was only in the late 1980s that the company that I worked for introduced a pension scheme. However, the law firm Pinsent Masons recently warned that the nature of the oil and gas industry, which extensively employs contractors, and rotators, which is when employees are sent overseas, while people are brought into the UK on short-term assignments&#8212;the UK Border Agency does not comprehend the damage that it is doing in that area&#8212;presents particular challenges with pensions. I have written to the Minister for Pensions at Westminster on the issue and I hope that Fergus Ewing might raise it with his UK counterparts when he next meets them.

The committee received evidence from a wide range of water interests, including domestic and commercial water users, environmental and energy bodies, industry specialist engineers and academics plus, of course, Scottish Water. I thank all those who gave written and oral evidence, those who hosted our visits to their premises and the clerking team, for their sterling support.</p><p>The evidence supported the basic premise of the bill that, although we are fortunate to have such an abundant water resource in Scotland, we must recognise more fully the value of that resource and learn to make more efficient use of it. As the committee heard in evidence, the bill, together with the Scottish Government&#8217;s hydro nation agenda, will put Scotland at the forefront of water policy making in the developed world. The benefits for Scotland could be substantial. In the global context, growing stress is being placed on the world&#8217;s water supply, due to an ever-increasing global population. As a result, many countries are becoming more and more interested in finding ways to make better use of what water they have.</p><p>The committee has heard about the work that Scottish Water is already doing through its international operations. It has won consultancy and training contracts in Canada, Ireland and, more recently, Qatar. To respond to Neil Findlay&#8217;s point, I say that he will find that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization centre for water law, policy and science at the University of Dundee is, for example, working with countries along the River Euphrates to get some agreement on water abstraction. Scotland&#8217;s expertise in water matters is clearly in demand, and the bill recognises that.

That is part of what Scottish Water is doing.</p><p>Given the abundance of our resources, it is probably fair to say that Scotland is the envy of the world. After all, we tend to be good at managing our liquid resources. Other countries just seem to bottle it, but we bottle it and export it, and we do lots of other things with our water.</p><p>The committee agrees that the bill will go some way towards establishing a framework that will allow us to make the most of our water resources. The message that we received from witnesses is that there is strong support for that direction.</p><p>In addition to the positive comments that we heard, I will talk about some of the concerns that were raised with the committee. Although the committee&#8217;s view is that the negative comments do not call into question the general principles of the bill, our report makes recommendations that are aimed at improving it.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, the almost unanimous view of witnesses was that the bill places too much emphasis on developing the economic value of water and does not say enough about environmental and social considerations. From the evidence that the committee received, it seems to be widely accepted that the three pillars of sustainability&#8212;economic, environmental and social&#8212;need to be given equal weight when we are seeking to develop the value of our water resources. The committee agreed that, if the bill is to specify economic value, there is no reason why it should not also include environmental and social considerations. I welcome the commitment that the cabinet secretary has given today to lodge an amendment on that point.</p><p>Part 2 deals with water abstraction. Alex Johnstone took a lead in questioning on that part of the bill, so I will not steal his thunder and will leave him to cover that in detail. That said, I draw the Parliament&#8217;s attention to the evidence that the committee received that reflected a general lack of understanding on the part of witnesses about the intended purpose of the new abstraction regime. It appeared to the committee that that was due, in large part, to a lack of consultation on that element of the bill because it was added just prior to the introduction of the bill. It is also fair to say, however, that some witnesses were confused about whether the new regime would add anything, given that the current CAR system already includes some abstraction control. As our report says, we felt that it was necessary for the cabinet secretary to engage directly with organisations to discuss the intended purpose and effect of the proposed abstraction regime. We called for a programme of engagement to be carried out prior to stage 2, and I welcome the cabinet secretary saying that such a programme is already being undertaken.</p><p>Other concerns were raised with the committee about the proposal that would actively encourage Scottish Water to develop its commercial activities in, for example, the renewable energy market. Serious concerns were raised with the committee by businesses that operate in the renewable energy and waste management sectors. They feared that the bill would give Scottish Water an unfair commercial advantage, based on its status as a Government-funded public body. The committee examined the issue in detail and questioned the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, the water industry regulator, as well as the cabinet secretary, about the proposals in the bill. We are content with the assurances that we received. It seems clear to us that the intention is that Scottish Water&#8217;s non-core activities will be entirely separate from the core services for which it receives public funding. Thus, there is no question of public funding being used to support Scottish Water&#8217;s commercial activities. Of course, it is the WICS&#8217;s responsibility to regulate Scottish Water&#8217;s activities, and the Parliament will have a continuing scrutiny role in ensuring that the regulator continues to do its job properly.</p><p>Finally, I will touch on the bill&#8217;s wider context and the hydro nation agenda. In considering the bill, particularly the expansion of Scottish Water into commercial and international markets, we must have regard for the interests of water customers in Scotland. We must ensure that water customers are protected. There is also scope to go further by, for example, enabling benefits that are derived from the development of Scotland&#8217;s water resources to be passed on to customers in the form of lower bills. The cabinet secretary has indicated that the bill and the hydro nation agenda should bring positive benefits for customers directly and indirectly. The committee will wish to focus on the interests of customers, and we have an ideal opportunity to do so as we move towards the next water regulatory period, which will run from 2015.</p><p>The objectives that are set out in the early part of the bill and in the hydro nation agenda are ambitious and require substantial co-ordinated action by the Government and other public bodies in order to achieve them. If the bill is passed, my committee will take a close interest in these activities. The committee&#8217;s wish is that the new prominence given to water environment issues must have substantial gains for the Scottish people.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate coincides with moves at European Union level to encourage greater efficiency in water use. The European Commission&#8217;s water blueprint has just been announced amid disappointing results for the implementation of river basin management plans, which have been implemented by only 53 per cent of member states. Europe needs to do more to use its water resources sustainably and efficiently, and if Scotland plays its cards right, it can show the way for the rest of Europe.</p><p>When the bill was published under the previous cabinet secretary, there was great media interest in the idea of exporting water by pumping it south or tanking it abroad. That issue did not greatly exercise us but, as the Presiding Officer knows, our food and drink exports such as beef and lamb require rich grassland, and salmon, whisky, beer and other such products require a lot of water. As a result, we actually export a great deal of virtual water&#8212;it is amazing what one can learn in this place.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I recommend that the bill&#8217;s general principles be agreed to.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680425", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Resources (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scottish Water is helping overseas countries with precisely that, although it is not so much about infrastructure and more about how countries determine the governance of their water supply.

People with Asperger&#8217;s are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech, but they might have difficulties with understanding and processing language, and they have difficulties with social interaction, as Mark McDonald mentioned. They may appear insensitive because they have not recognised how someone else is feeling, and they may appear to behave strangely or inappropriately precisely because they do not have the mechanisms that others have in terms of social interaction. As has been mentioned, they cannot process facial expressions, tone of voice, jokes or sarcasm&#8212;things that the rest of us take for granted.</p><p>Even though not everyone who should perhaps be armed with the autism alert card has it, it is important to raise awareness of the card and of autism in general.</p><p>Mark McDonald mentioned the criminal justice system. As a former prison visiting committee member, I know that too many people who are caught up in the criminal justice system may have autism. However, even outwith prisons, when there are boyhood pranks, the person with autism is often disarmingly honest and has not got into the habit of running away as his mates might have done, so such people get caught up in the system.</p><p>It is vital that security guards in shopping centres are made aware of the card and are trained to recognise autism.

It has special stickers that people can put on that say &#8220;Please wait for me to sit down&#8221;, &#8220;Please talk slowly and clearly&#8221; and so on.

They cover the range of Camphill&#8217;s activities. For children and young people, there is Camphill school. For young adults, there is Beannachar on South Deeside Road. For adults, there is Newton Dee and Tigh a&#8217;Chomainn&#8212;I apologise for the pronunciation&#8212;and for elderly people there is the Simeon Care facility.</p><p>I first got to know about the Camphill communities many years ago when a cousin of my mum&#8217;s with Down&#8217;s syndrome stayed at Newton Dee for a short time and we visited her. I think that her elderly parents thought that she might want to stay there, but she was too much of a Cockney to stay for long out of London.</p><p>Since then, I have visited most of the facilities in my constituency. I visited Beannachar on a doors-open day and saw growing there the biggest raspberries that I have ever seen. I do not know whether the plants are talked to, but the community there has a wonderful way with growing crops. The facility is close to my heart, as many Germans come across to do voluntary work there. The rules of compulsory service in Germany mean that conscientious objectors do voluntary work, and a lot of them come to Beannachar. They can often be seen walking to Aberdeen along South Deeside Road.</p><p>Newton Dee, as Alison McInnes pointed out, is a wonderful facility. It is nice to go there and have a cup of coffee, buy some bread and just chill out a bit. It is little wonder that it has the highest eco-flag status, because it not only has a wind turbine but the people there are all very much into eco-friendly activities&#8212;the woodcrafts are something to behold.</p><p>The Simeon Care for the Elderly facility, which Alison McInnes also mentioned, is engaging very much with the community to raise the funds to rebuild that community.</p><p>Many years ago, the Camphill philosophy was thought of as being a kind of non-mainstream, hippy philosophy. It is based on self-determination and equality and is focused on providing for each individual&#8217;s needs through a supportive community and the creation of a safe and supportive environment for individuals, who are encouraged to develop their own independence through an engagement in community life. Of course, that philosophy has become very much mainstream.</p><p>As Alison McInnes said, there are opportunities for councils to make more use of the facilities that are on their doorstep and are provided by the Camphill movement. It is silly that local authorities will set about creating new facilities when Camphill, in and around Aberdeen, already has the facilities to provide for the vulnerable in society.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Camphill movement, its organisers and its users, whose professionalism, care and hard work have made a world of difference to the lives of individuals and families across Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679632", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Camphill Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Alison McInnes for bringing this debate to the Parliament to highlight the importance and value of the Camphill movement.

It is because&#8212;astonishingly&#8212;that universality is under threat from Labour.</p><p>Universal benefits such as concessionary travel for the elderly, housing benefit, jobseekers allowance and, of course, health care exist to ensure the maximum opportunities and the maximum quality of life for all, regardless of a person&#8217;s background or circumstance. It is our responsibility to ensure that people in Scotland continue to have access to the highest-quality public services possible without stigma being attached to those who rely on them.</p><p>Access to high-quality public services is part of our identity and a large part of what binds us as a society. It is therefore no surprise that the people of Scotland overwhelmingly oppose the UK&#8217;s ruthless cuts to public services, which threaten to tear our social fabric and impact on the poorest in our society. The unstinting protection of public services is at the heart of Scottish Government and SNP policy. That protection goes well beyond front-line services, and the importance of various aspects of universal benefits to ensuring our health, wellbeing and quality of life should not be underestimated.</p><p>Concessionary travel is a perfect example of that. The benefit to the 1.2 million elderly or disabled people or the veterans who are entitled to concessionary travel does not stop at their saving money on their bus fares. People who use concessionary travel&#8212;especially those on low incomes&#8212;also benefit from improved access to other services in their communities and beyond. That in turn facilitates social networking and promotes inclusion for those who might otherwise be isolated, as well as supporting those who are in work or in voluntary positions.</p><p>Evidence suggests that concessionary travel also improves the health, wellbeing and safety of elderly and disabled people by encouraging a more active lifestyle and by keeping people engaged in their communities. Ultimately, by contributing towards the broader quality of life of older and disabled people, concessionary travel helps to reduce demand for social and health care down the line and therefore supports savings in other parts of the public sector. For example, raising the age of eligibility for concessionary travel to 66 would affect around 40,000 people and save &#163;8 million in the short term. However, that would most likely result in NHS bodies having to meet increased costs for transport to and from medical services, which might otherwise have been provided under concessionary travel.</p><p>The same is true of stringent means testing. The current approach is relatively cheap and simple to administer because it depends on either proof of age or disability. The fact is that the administration costs associated with any further eligibility checks would be prohibitive and would largely cancel out any potential savings. To me, that underlines the short-sightedness of UK Government cuts, which are aimed at cutting back on services that are not only vital but represent good value for the taxpayer.</p><p>Johann Lamont asks that we consider the issue in open and transparent debate, but that is exactly what we are doing.

I am sure that Malawi will be safe in his hands. I look forward to hearing the cabinet secretary&#8217;s summing up and his impressions from his first visit to Malawi last week. I hope that the country captivated him as much as it did me.</p><p>The debate is timely, given that we are in the run-up to the bicentenary of David Livingstone&#8217;s birth next year and that preparations for that are under way. I will leave my colleagues to say more about that, as they are much more involved geographically. Suffice it to say that Malawian children are much more aware of David Livingstone than children here are. Perhaps we can improve on that in Scotland next year, not only because it is part of our rich heritage, but because it is the reason why there are such strong bonds between our two countries.</p><p>Indeed, an analysis by the University of Edinburgh in 2010 highlighted the value of inputs by members of the Scotland Malawi Partnership, stating that Scotland&#8217;s civic society links with Malawi were worth at least &#163;30&#160;million over the previous 12-month period. The study also indicated that at least 1.3&#160;million Malawians and 280,000 Scots have benefited from participating in those activities over the same period.</p><p>However, Malawi remains a desperately poor country. As Patricia Ferguson said, it ranks 171st out of 180 countries in the most recent UN human development index report. Some 10 per cent of school-age children do not attend primary school, and according to UNICEF only 26 per cent of school-age children complete their primary school cycle, of whom&#8212;perhaps not surprising&#8212;only 16 per cent are female.</p><p>AIDS remains the leading cause of death among adults, and water-borne diseases cause many more deaths among children. It is little wonder that much of the aid from other countries is spent on health and education. Like Jamie McGrigor, I am grateful for Oxfam&#8217;s briefing, which highlights, among other things that the charity does, awareness raising on the treatment and support that people can expect&#8212;and how they can get it&#8212;if they are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.</p><p>There have been many improvements. As Patricia Ferguson said, the rate of HIV deaths has reduced. When I went to Malawi in 2010, I was struck by Ted Brocklebank&#8217;s observation that there were far fewer coffin makers on the roadside than there had been when he visited the country in 2006. We saw hardly any coffin makers in 2010.</p><p>A privilege of chairing the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Malawi is that I hear about many projects in the country that have benefited from Scottish Government funding as well as other funding, including many donations. Projects are not just in health and education. I am increasingly struck by the huge variety of work that is done in Malawi through partnership working by Scottish institutions.</p><p>For example, Scottish higher education institutions, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Malawi Government and Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources are working together to establish a veterinary school in Malawi, in an effort to combat epidemic transboundary zoonotic diseases and to improve food quality, food security and animal welfare. We heard that apps are being given to farmers, to alert them to when they should feed and milk their animals and dose them for mastitis. Advice on breeding matters, for example, is also offered. It might seem strange to hear about the use of apps in rural Malawi, but that is happening. It is vital that we use the most up-to-date technology to drive forward sustainable development in the country.</p><p>Organisations are helping Malawi to use its abundant solar energy to power homes, hospitals and schools. The minister talked about the University of Strathclyde&#8217;s energy programme.</p><p>The minister is a lawyer and has been a member of the Justice Committee, so I implore him to look sympathetically on funding bids for advocacy in Malawi. I will never forget my visit to Chichiri prison in Blantyre, and in particular the women&#8217;s unit there. I saw women with children and women who had been on remand for as long as seven years without coming to trial. I commend the work that Sister Anna Tommasi does, but she needs a great deal of funding.</p><p>On the change of Government, Malawi must be congratulated on the smooth transition of power following President Mutharika&#8217;s death. It is much to Malawi&#8217;s credit that the transition to Vice-president Joyce Banda was smooth, but she has inherited a much-maligned regime. She does not have her problems to seek, as members have said. It is to her credit that she has sold the controversial presidential jet that the previous president purchased, which had annual running costs of &#163;220,000. She has also sold the Government&#8217;s fleet of 60 Mercedes-Benz limousines. She is doing great work but she has a high disapproval rating. I hope that when she comes here she sits down with our First Minister, to improve that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Relationship with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome this debate and I welcome the minister to his new post.

I contacted Alex Hill of the Met Office yesterday to see whether the long-range weather forecast would give us some cheer. In summary, he said that for October, November and December a whole range of forecasts favour lower than average rainfall for the period but slightly colder temperatures. There is no real cheer there and we must be prepared, although weather forecasters have become a lot more canny in recent years about what they say.</p><p>As someone who lives in a rural area where the roads are not maintained by the council, I know the importance of having shovels and salt-and-sand mix ready at the door and in the car. I am also aware that rural roads are not a priority if they are not bus routes. I understand that, as it is important that our councils make the best use of their equipment on arterial routes. Therefore, I welcome the fact that farmers are being involved in clearing rural roads. I am not sure that Jim Hume can claim the credit for that, as&#8212;I am sure that Alex Johnstone will back me up on this&#8212;Aberdeenshire Council has been involving farmers in clearing the roads for a number of winters.</p><p>It is vital that we keep our roads not only clear of snow, but gritted. As Graeme Dey said, companies such as LPG providers and heating oil suppliers must be able to access their customers in remote and rural locations. I therefore welcome the information that we have received from Calor Gas that it is working with local authorities and Transport Scotland to ensure that off-grid consumers can be accessed during severe weather.</p><p>Mention has been made of the railways, and I welcome the &#163;2.2&#160;million that ScotRail invested last year to ensure that it is better prepared for severe weather. Those preparations include providing pioneering de-icing equipment for our trains and real-time travel updates for customers. Updates are important because, for travellers, there is nothing worse than getting absolutely no information at all&#8212;people can take the bad information, but waiting around without any information is most distressing to customers.</p><p>During the debate, we have tended to focus on the preparedness for snow but, with climate change, we are as likely to experience high winds and extremely heavy rainfall. That is why it is vital that landowners clear&#8212;and keep clear&#8212;water courses and that councils keep drains clear. I am not sure that all councils have the best strategies and plans for clearing drains and water courses, especially in areas that are prone to flooding.</p><p>People who dump garden rubbish in burns and streams are totally irresponsible. I think that Keep Scotland Beautiful may be doing work in that area, but perhaps the minister will confirm that.</p><p>Similarly, preventative action may be useful, with landowners, councils and ScotRail removing weakened trees before they fall and cause disruption.</p><p>I put on record my thanks to all those public sector workers, including snow clearers, police, fire and ambulance personnel, social and care workers, and health and school staff, who go that extra mile to help our most vulnerable. I also want to thank the many volunteers who step up to the plate to help in adverse times&#8212;that even includes four-by-four drivers.

As others have mentioned, Aberdeen city and shire is driving economic growth in Scotland and the United Kingdom through our energy sector. It is the only truly global economy in the UK outside London. The area is a supply chain hub for the oil and gas industry and for jobs throughout the UK and beyond. It used to be said that if someone wanted to see the world, they joined the merchant navy&#8212;now, they join the oil and gas industry.</p><p>The energy sector in Aberdeen is booming. In fact, the whole of Aberdeen is booming on the back of the energy sector. Aberdeen has long been recognised as the oil capital of Europe and it is one of the most robust and resilient economies on the continent. The region has the second highest gross value added per head of population in the UK and the cities outlook 2012 survey mentioned Aberdeen as one of only a handful of cities with the strongest signs of economic growth. Indeed, at the ACSEF meeting on Friday that Nanette Milne mentioned, we heard of one company&#8212;General Electric&#8212;that has an immediate 200 vacancies and over the next three years it will have 3,000 vacancies.</p><p>Does the centre of Aberdeen reflect that status? No, it does not. I stood for election in Aberdeen North in 1979 saying that Aberdeen should not be the oil capital of Europe but end up with nothing to show for it. Now we have a local boy who has made exceptionally good who wants to reinvest some of his wealth back into the city, together with seven others who are prepared to put their hands in their pockets to kick-start the regeneration of the city of Aberdeen.</p><p>There has been a lot of focus on the gardens&#8212;I believe that the project would have been transformational, but it also included a revamp of the art gallery and many other parts of the city centre that desperately need work done on them.

Labour speakers tried to convince themselves that the SNP Government has done nothing and will do nothing but concentrate on the referendum and securing independence. I politely suggest that it is the Opposition parties who are obsessed with independence, given that they raise the issue in the Parliament more often than SNP members do.</p><p>Let me remind members of a few of the SNP Government&#8217;s achievements. In relation to justice, most adults rate their neighbourhood as a very good place in which to live. That continues a rising trend, and the success is due in no small part to the fact that we have maintained the presence of 1,000 extra police officers, which has led to the lowest crime levels since 1975.</p><p>In health, the majority of people&#8212;there has been a rise of 16 per cent since 2005&#8212;are either very satisfied or quite satisfied with the way that the NHS runs, and a record 4 million people are registered with NHS dentists, including 99 per cent of six to 12-year-olds. That is a real achievement that is very welcome, especially in the north-east given the shambles that we inherited in the area from the previous Labour-Lib Dem coalition Government.</p><p>In housing, the Government has exceeded its target to deliver 6,000 affordable houses. In 2011-12, the figure was 6,882.</p><p>In education, a record number of school leavers qualified to at least standard grade level, and a record number of school leavers are in positive destinations. A record 22,292 young Scots will go to university in Scotland this year, and Scotland is one of only three European countries to increase investment in higher education.</p><p>On the environment, there has been continued investment to make Scotland greener and in our agricultural sector to provide food and drink. Those exports are at an all-time high.</p><p>The concentration on early intervention and preventative spend is making a real difference to many families, and the programme that the First Minister announced yesterday will continue to make Scotland safer, healthier, smarter and greener.</p><p>Perhaps the Labour Party does not like to hear about that progress, but the public do. Let me remind the Labour Party of its most recent poll ratings. The SNP is on 47 per cent, which is up 2 per cent, while Labour is on 32 per cent&#8212;that figure has not changed. Some 71 per cent trust the Scottish Government to act in Scotland&#8217;s best interests.</p><p>Even in the current economic climate, business confidence in Scotland is the highest in the UK. It used to be the case that, if England caught a cold in recessionary times, Scotland would get the flu. John Swinney&#8217;s shift of money to capital spend has made a real difference. That is why it is so important that money is released from the UK Government for shovel-ready projects.</p><p>That business confidence and other confidence among Scots do not automatically happen. The Scottish Government is creating the conditions for business in Scotland. The confidence comes from the Government but also from other organisations, such as the Aberdeen city and shire economic future, which drives the economy of the north-east. We are all judged by our actions rather than our words. Labour politicians in Aberdeen threaten to pull the funding from that body precisely because it is driving economic growth. Perhaps Richard Baker&#8212;who is not in the chamber at the moment&#8212;might have a word with Ms Eagle and stop her decrying an Aberdeen-based business for winning a contract in the rail industry. Just what is it that the Labour Party has against Aberdeen? Aberdeen is the economic driver for Scotland and the UK. There are jobs aplenty in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>I am not saying that there is not much more to do&#8212;of course there is&#8212;but we are making progress with one hand tied behind our backs. As Kevin Stewart has said, it would be great if we had both hands on the levers of power.</p><p>What does the Opposition want to do? It wants simply to continue chugging along with mediocrity, while the SNP Government wants drive and ambition for our country.</p><p>The status quo is not an option. Yesterday, we were told on the radio that</p><p>&#8220;three quarters of the pain still lies ahead with widespread cuts to spending and benefits likely to have a bigger impact on voters&#8217; wallets than the tax rises and reduced investment to date.&#8221;</p><p>Britain&#8217;s recovery from the financial crisis is slower than that of other countries. Apart from the Italian economy, the British economy is the only one of the world&#8217;s 20 biggest economies back in recession and, to our shame, the UK is the fourth most unequal country in the world. Instead of supporting hope and ambition for Scots, Labour members are in bed with the Tories to maintain the status quo and support worsening conditions for our citizens.

I believe that all MSPs and their staff should know about it.</p><p>It is important that dependants of current and previous forces personnel know about the project and the wide and varied number of organisations that are available to provide help. Knowledge of this one-stop shop would have been helpful to one of my constituents, whose husband, who had formerly been in the Army, tragically committed suicide as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately, because of unemployment, the family had cancelled insurance plans and, as a result, lost the house that they owned and found themselves in temporary accommodation and then council accommodation, a situation that the widow and her family found traumatic. Sadly, my constituent contacted me only 18 months or so after that had happened.</p><p>I make the minister aware of the case because I have concerns that dependants and former personnel who are perhaps not near the voluntary organisations&#8217; centres face greater challenges in accessing help.

I stress that ex-service personnel and their dependants might need help at any time after service&#8212;there is no limit. My constituent&#8217;s husband had been out of the Army for many decades.

It is an opportunity for us to discuss and consider how we can best support the organisations in our communities that are on the front line of supporting people who have addictions, and their families.</p><p>In her motion, Nanette Milne cites the Grampian Family Support Forum and in her speech she mentioned Sheila McKay. I first met Sheila McKay when I was a regional member. For Sheila, one meeting was not, as a woman from Banffshire, enough, of course. As the minister knows, we Banffshire women can be thrawn and persistent. We had several meetings in Aberdeen and&#8212;as Nanette Milne mentioned&#8212;in Parliament, not just with the Grampian forum but with other groups in the north-east that are involved in such work. Sheila McKay is still working&#8212;as Dr Simpson mentioned&#8212;on extending the pool of people who are allowed to administer naloxone.</p><p>Although levels of illegal drug use are at their lowest for several years and are still in decline, we cannot underestimate the devastating effects that drugs still have on individuals, families and communities. Virtually every family in the country is now affected in some way or another by drug misuse; my family has certainly not escaped it.</p><p>The Grampian Family Support Forum has benefited from administrative and communications assistance from the alcohol and drugs partnership that covers Moray, Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire. The Scottish Government&#8217;s recovery-focused approach to tackling drug use has helped thousands, and that progress is supported by the funding that is provided by many organisations that facilitate recovery, such as the Scottish Drugs Forum, the Scottish Recovery Consortium and the Grampian Family Support Forum. All those organisations deserve praise for their efforts, not only in helping and advising those who have addiction problems and their families, but in assisting in community action, education programmes and&#8212;as other members have mentioned&#8212;combating the stigma that attaches to addiction issues. Those organisations have been feeding back to Government and parliamentarians their information and experiences, and their opinions on the effectiveness of the current strategy and how progress can be continued. That highlights the invaluable work that they do, which is carried out as much in private as it is in public.</p><p>Worryingly, several of those organisations have heavily criticised the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s welfare cuts which, they tell us, threaten the support systems that exist and the delicate balance in many families and communities that are in sensitive situations regarding addiction and drugs.</p><p>The Scottish Drugs Forum and Scottish Families Affected by Drugs have spoken out against the UK Government&#8217;s proposed changes to how claimants with drug or alcohol problems can receive benefits, which threaten to undermine the progress that has been made. Both organisations have highlighted how Westminster&#8217;s proposals to hold claimants hostage over their benefits, pending their drug and alcohol addiction treatment, threaten to have serious knock-on effects on families and children.</p><p>The recovery happens event was a great example of how the expertise that such groups provide is fed back into the development of national and Government strategy. Neil Bibby mentioned kinship carers. I am assisting a number of grannies who are, as a result of the drug abuse of their child or their child&#8217;s partner, caring for their small grandchildren. One of the main messages that came from the recovery happens event was on the importance of a family-focused approach to recovery and addiction support. Families from across Scotland are keen to support one another and to share their experiences and knowledge.

I hope that the difference between ourselves and our Scandinavian neighbours does not elude most members. We know that girls tend to outperform boys at school, yet women are generally less well represented when it comes to senior management positions and to climbing the career ladder, especially in certain fields.</p><p>As others have mentioned, we know that the recession and the UK Government&#8217;s welfare cuts will have a disproportionate impact on women and will have a knock-on effect on their children and families. Although the Scottish Government is trying to do all that it can to mitigate those impacts, it is equally important that we know why the imbalance exists.</p><p>Annabel Goldie gave a list of reasons that she thought contribute to the imbalance. I would say to her that it is about all of the above. We know that low pay among women contributes to the high level of child poverty in Scotland. That is why, for example, the SNP included in its local government election manifesto a progressive pledge to introduce a living wage of &#163;7.20 an hour in all councils to help to tackle the issue. That measure is necessary because almost two thirds of the thousands of people who will benefit from the introduction of the living wage are women. Although that modern, progressive policy is to be commended, as a society we should ask ourselves why the majority of our lowest-paid jobs are done by women and why men continue to dominate the boardrooms.</p><p>We remember that, in a number of our council areas, the process of implementing single status has been a long and tortuous process. Those who we would think would most benefit from it and welcome it have often been the most obstructive.</p><p>Just as concerning is women&#8217;s traditional exclusion from other fields. Although progress is being made in attracting women into STEM subjects and areas of work, gender stereotypes continue to prevail. Last night, at the British Veterinary Association dinner, we heard that 80 per cent of veterinary medicine students are women. However, when it comes to being in line for a partnership, how many of those women will be overlooked? There is probably the same issue in the legal profession.</p><p>White, able-bodied males still make up the largest group in Scotland&#8217;s workforce, but they no longer represent the majority, so continuing dependence on that demographic in science and technology is unsustainable and represents a lost opportunity for female scientists and engineers as well as for the sector as a whole. A modern, scientific, energy-rich nation such as Scotland must address the issue.</p><p>In the north-east, there are loads of employment opportunities in STEM subjects, but colleges do not have enough flexibility to decide where MAs go.

Those numbers remain unclear, but we can be sure that, for those who are affected, it is a very serious matter indeed; they are going through a time of great anxiety.</p><p>Although we can be somewhat relieved that no link has been established between the implants and an increased risk of cancer, it is a cause for concern that PIP implants appear to be more prone to rupturing and can be toxic. As my colleague Fiona McLeod pointed out, the rupture rates are estimated to be between 1 per cent and 5 per cent, but the women concerned do not know whether they will fall into that category.</p><p>It is welcome news that the NHS and the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy have reassured the people of Scotland that there is only one known case of PIP implants being used by the NHS. However, I am a little puzzled by that. Does that mean that single purchases of implants are made, or does the patient bring the implants with them? Perhaps the minister could enlighten us.</p><p>The NHS is to be commended for offering to remove PIP implants from anyone who has been affected following either NHS or private surgery. We can only hope that the private clinics will choose to offer the same treatment. I echo the call from the Scottish Government and from various members during this morning&#8217;s debate that private practices provide the care that their patients expect, and offer surgery to rectify the problem.</p><p>Like Margaret Burgess, I agree that we should look again at resurrecting the register of implants. Clinics and hospitals must know the source of their implants and there must be batch numbers, so we should be able to do that. Some women might not even know whether they have PIP implants, and although NHS and private clinics are making efforts to contact those who do, the advice for anyone who is still concerned is to contact their GP or clinic in the first instance.</p><p>Reassuringly, it appears that the rigorous MHRA processes were not at fault. The manufacturers fraudulently, and with callous disregard for their customers, altered the make-up of their products. I reiterate my hope that the continuing UK-wide inquiries into the issue will provide both answers and peace of mind for those who have been affected.</p><p>It should be borne in mind, however, that no breast implant surgery or cosmetic procedure is entirely without risk. I know that there are often good medical reasons for having breast implants, but I am not alone in being concerned by the ever-increasing numbers of women who feel that they have to put their bodies through this ordeal for cosmetic reasons. The PIP case highlights the real dangers that are involved in cosmetic surgery. The unrealistic image of women that pervades much of our society, most worryingly among our young people, continues to drive women to measures such as cosmetic surgery at great expense and danger to themselves, all in the name of someone else&#8217;s idea of beauty.</p><p>Carol Craig of the Centre for Confidence and Well-Being is extremely concerned about the amount of money that is spent&#8212;by people who can ill afford it&#8212;on such treatments. The health impact of the practices is well documented and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the situation threatens to undermine the equality and emancipation of women in our society.

Currently, 45 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s international exports are to euro zone countries and they are worth almost &#163;10 billion to the Scottish economy. We should be extremely concerned about anything that jeopardises that trade. As others have said, Greece is Scotland&#8217;s 28th largest market by export value, with exports of &#163;175 million in 2012, which is 0.8 per cent of all exports. That figure is down from a peak of 12.5 per cent in 2009.</p><p>We should also be worried about contagion, especially in Spain, which is our seventh-largest market. A number of Scottish seafood companies, including companies in my constituency, are reliant on the Spanish market.</p><p>In addition, fears over the future of the European currency act as a deterrent to companies investing around the world, which has direct consequences on the number of jobs that are being created in this country. That reluctance to invest can also make it significantly more challenging to raise private capital for infrastructure projects. There is, in that, a certain irony, given that infrastructure investment is one of the most effective ways of stimulating economic growth and is certainly the most powerful measure available to Scotland under the current limits of devolution.</p><p>In both the euro zone and the UK, a short-sighted fixation on austerity is causing significant and lasting damage that threatens us all. Greek debt as a percentage of GDP has rocketed from an already eye-watering 113 per cent in 2008, at the start of the crisis, to 165 per cent in 2011. Severe austerity measures, with no credible effort to stimulate growth, mean that no matter how much public spending is cut by in Greece, the deficit continues to rise and, with that, the debt-to-GDP ratio goes up. Could there be a clearer example of why austerity without growth is no way to revive an ailing economy?</p><p>Listening to David Stewart, we would think that all Greece&#8217;s problems are someone else&#8217;s, but there is no doubt that in many respects Greece was living beyond its means. Whether it is within the UK or among the economies of the euro zone, stimulating growth has to be a priority if we are to avoid the current horrendous situation getting worse.</p><p>In recent weeks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has faced the humiliation of having both the IMF and the Confederation of British Industry point out the critical flaws in his approach and the urgent need to stimulate growth in the economy. Following the recent announcement of the chancellor&#8217;s U-turn on his ill-advised pasty tax, the UK Government&#8217;s perverse obsession with austerity is perhaps the only policy that it has yet to reverse its course on, but it is the policy that it should have given its greatest priority to abandoning. To continue down the coalition&#8217;s current path out of a stubborn refusal to face reality is the worst kind of foolishness. George Osborne should be big enough to admit that he has misjudged his priorities and to accept that growth needs to be stimulated as a matter of urgency. The potential consequences, should he fail to do so, can only be described as catastrophic, and mean that we will stay in recession for longer than necessary.</p><p>Germany&#8217;s insistence on Greek austerity is wrong. I found it rather worrying that when a cross-party group of parliamentarians from the Bundestag visited the Scottish Parliament recently, all parties were behind Chancellor Merkel&#8217;s strategy. Perhaps there will be some softening of that stance, especially since elections beckon in that country.</p><p>Many people are now asking for investment in infrastructure&#8212;a stance that has been taken by this Government but ridiculed by the other parties in this chamber. Every &#163;100 million of capital spending is estimated to support 1,400 jobs throughout the Scottish economy and would make a big dent in unemployment figures.</p><p>Gavin Brown wants to know what the Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry have been doing. If he had had his eyes and ears open yesterday, he would have heard about the oil and gas strategy that was launched by the First Minister at Hydrasun in my constituency&#8212;a company that is growing across the world with the help of Scottish Enterprise and the SCDI. It is taking on apprentices and new graduates, who are driving forward growth in the company. It is a strategy that will be at the heart of the reindustrialisation of Scotland.</p><p>If the European Union is to mean just that, all countries in Europe must have a say in what steps are to be taken to get us all out of this recession. Obama&#8217;s strategy was to invest in infrastructure in the United States, and unemployment there is gradually falling.</p><p>There is money for investment around the world, in finance houses and in private hands, but those who might invest are not doing so because they are not seeing the stability that is required for that. Investment in infrastructure will create jobs and greater demand, and will get the economy moving. That needs to be happening worldwide. As Aileen McLeod said, the euro zone needs to develop euro bonds, so that we share the burden of debt, and so that austerity is coupled with investment.</p><p>I had hoped that Neil Findlay&#8212;an avid reader of the Morning Star&#8212;would be reeling off ideas from that newspaper about what should be done internationally, but I see that he has been busy distributing a pamphlet in this country, saying that</p><p>&#8220;to break the power of big business and neoliberal policies and promote social and economic justice&#8221;</p><p>we need to stay in the United Kingdom.

Many members in the chamber already know of my passion for language learning and how knowledge of languages certainly helped my career development. Strange as it may seem, I would not have been able to enter the oil and gas industry if I had not been able to speak German.</p><p>Members may expect me to concentrate on Scottish languages, as I have taken my oath three times in Doric and am a strong supporter of Gaelic-medium education. However, I do not intend to focus on those languages this morning, although they form a strong basis for learning other languages. The reading bus in Aberdeen does wonderful work in promoting the Doric language, and Gaelic-medium schools such as Gilcomstoun school in Aberdeen do sterling work in promoting multilingualism.</p><p>I do not know how we have come to be so dismissive in recent decades of the need to speak and understand other languages, but that is totally unacceptable in a globalised society, and I welcome the initiative from the minister. As an article that appeared in The Observer some time ago said,</p><p>&#8220;Entre nous, the idea we need only English is totally pass&#233;. Without a commitment to language teaching we condemn our children to a tongue-tied future.&#8221;</p><p>The charity Children in Scotland reminds us that around 137 languages in addition to English are spoken in this country, and that we have around 10,000 bilingual or multilingual children. We must build on that. Research shows that learning a second language builds on the first language and consolidates it, and children do not become confused when they are exposed in their early years to two or more languages.</p><p>Marco Biagi mentioned the recent pilot project in my constituency at Walker Road primary school, which showed the benefits of total immersion learning in maths, geography, environmental studies and other subjects in French. That resulted in those children presenting early for standard grade when they went to secondary school, and it increased their ability to learn a second language at secondary level.</p><p>My plea is that it is not only French that should be children&#8217;s first encounter with another language. My own local authority, Aberdeenshire, went from offering a choice of French or German to offering just French. I am sure that that put a lot of children off learning a language, especially when there are so many affinities between Doric and German that could be built on.</p><p>We must use the skills of teachers and parents, and others in our communities, to introduce children to the diversity of languages, and we must use this opportunity to review the way in which we teach languages. Curriculum for excellence offers exciting opportunities in that field. It is not&#8212;as Liz Smith believes&#8212;about finding more time but about combining language learning with other subjects.</p><p>When I, as we all do, visit schools and speak to children, I always promote language learning as much as I can. The minister posed the question of its use to working-class kids; I always ask the boys who want to be footballers what they would do about languages if they were good enough to play in Spain or Italy&#8212;and I always see a light going on in their heads.</p><p>Teachers seem to face unnecessary barriers when they organise school exchange trips. A friend of mine who teaches languages at Alford academy told me that there had been a suggestion that German families be disclosure checked, which I think is going over the score somewhat. Although the Confucius hubs have been introduced, I am not sure whether they have been kept up across the whole of Scotland, and I ask the minister to ensure that they are all operating as intended.</p><p>Many companies are also interested in helping with language promotion. Every year, my old company, KCA Deutag, sponsors two secondary school children on a work experience trip to its headquarters in the German town of Bad Bentheim, and I know that rotary clubs used to help with student exchanges to various countries.</p><p>We must make it easier for language assistants to be used in our schools. Those assistants might already be living in our communities, but they might also be students in, for example, the Erasmus programme. Traditionally, there have tended to be more students coming to Scotland than Scottish students going in the other direction, but there has been much progress in that area in recent years. For example, the number of Robert Gordon University students going to other countries is now the same as the number who come here to go to that university.</p><p>Actually, the Scottish figures for the Erasmus programme make exciting reading. Scotland now accounts for 12.6 per cent of the total number of UK students in the programme, with 1,507 taking part in 2009-10 and 1,273 the year before. However, although that represents a total increase of 26.8 per cent in two years, the percentage of the Scottish student population in the Erasmus programme is still very low, at 0.7 per cent. That is still slightly higher than the English figure of 0.5 per cent but nowhere near the figure for France, which is 1.4 per cent, or for Spain, which is 2 per cent.</p><p>All, though, is not doom and gloom. I know one young lady who, as a young child, was exposed to &#8220;Salut Serge&#8221; CDs on car journeys; who took French in primary and secondary school and in one year&#8212;her sixth year&#8212;got her higher Spanish; and who at the University of Glasgow furthered her French and Spanish with business studies. She took French and German in her second year and next year is going to Toulouse University, where she will take all her classes in French and where she hopes to deepen her knowledge of Spanish and start Mandarin. She was one of more than 200 at the Erasmus induction meeting at the University of Glasgow the other week&#8212;and I have to say that I am disappointed that, as my friend Sandra White will point out, Glasgow is reducing the breadth of the languages available at the university while Toulouse offers 13 choices.</p><p>Cue one proud mum of this young lady&#8212;I practise what I preach.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to take part in the debate.

There is no magic bullet in parenting; if there were, we would all be using it and would be having no problems in bringing up our children.</p><p>I recall impending parenthood, the plethora of bestselling parenting guides and arguments with previous generations about the best way of parenting. We always ask children what they want to be when they grow up and give them lots of careers advice, but do we emphasise enough the enormous and lifelong commitment involved in being a parent? Nothing is more important than giving our children the best start in life, and parents must come to realise that parenthood is not about material things but about caring, nurturing and developing their children.</p><p>As a result, I am pleased that a key part of the strategy is building parents&#8217; resilience, skills, capacity and confidence and raising the importance and value of parenting&#8212;and, in turn, children&#8212;in our society. We are certainly not helped in those efforts by certain media outlets that portray children as little more than fashion accessories.</p><p>Given my previous comments about the importance of antenatal classes as a vehicle for learning not only about the process of birth but about the wider context of bringing up children, I was dismayed to read last week about a recent National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children report that cited a survey suggesting that 65 per cent of new mothers from middle-class backgrounds but less than 39 per cent of disadvantaged mothers have attended antenatal classes. We need to do some work on that area, and it will probably fall to general practices and primary care to ensure that, through health visitors, midwives and others, parents receive the support in very early years that they need.</p><p>The NSPCC report also touched on the isolation felt by new mothers. I know that, as a new mother who had just moved into a new area, I would have felt pretty isolated had it not been for the support of the local mothers and toddlers group.</p><p>We must congratulate organisations such as Parenting Across Scotland that keep bringing the problems of families to our attention through their literature and the events that they frequently hold in Parliament. I always make the effort to attend those.</p><p>As the minister has said, we know about the importance of the time between pre-birth and school. Long gone are the days when, once the health visitor&#8217;s visits had finished, children did not come to the attention of the authorities again until they started school at the age of five.</p><p>We have seen the increase in childcare and nursery provision. The increase is on-going and exponential.</p><p>Family-nurse partnerships are a great concept that is currently being rolled out, although we would not think so if we listened to some Labour members.</p><p>I am glad that the minister mentioned the teenage years, and I commend the work of the Blue Horizon Youth Project in my constituency.</p><p>The pressures continue, but we are working on them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the minister on securing this debate on the national parenting strategy and the Government on taking the time to consult families from a wide variety of backgrounds and all the organisations involved in parenting in developing the strategy.

Her commitment to women&#8217;s issues in the justice system is well recognised. For example, we all remember her unstinting efforts to secure more convictions for rape and her commitment on that issue. The recommendations in the report are sound and far-reaching. I hope that, when the cabinet secretary gives the Scottish Government&#8217;s response in the summer, it will be positive.</p><p>I speak as a former member of the visiting committee at Craiginches prison for 12 years. For the majority of that time, Craiginches had a small women&#8217;s unit. We witnessed the increase in women prisoners over that time and the changes in the type of offences, which Dr Richard Simpson mentioned.</p><p>Members have mentioned that women need fairness in the justice system. By that, I think that they mean equality of treatment between men and women. No one says that women should not be sentenced if they have committed a crime, but the sentencing of men and women is not fair. Women are more likely to be sent to prison for lesser crimes. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is known for talking about locking up the bad and not the sad, but that definitely needs to be applied to female offenders as well as to male ones. Reoffending rates are higher not just because short sentences mean that little time is available for rehabilitation, but because, tragically, prison is the only safe place in many women&#8217;s lives.</p><p>I witnessed women who had come into prison malnourished, ill-kempt and distraught, but who, after just a few weeks, looked so much better, with their hair shiny and nails growing as a result of getting good food, regular sleep and order in their lives. As John Finnie mentioned, one can see the self-harm scars healing. Regrettably, the SPS in its wisdom decided to close the unit in Aberdeen and move women offenders from the north-east to Cornton Vale. The visiting committee vigorously opposed that move because we knew that it would increase problems for the families with visits and maintaining relationships. Of course, it has now been realised that the move was a mistake, and the unit has been reopened.</p><p>It is worth quoting some excerpts from the commission&#8217;s report that relate to Aberdeen. It states:</p><p>&#8220;We were ... impressed with the Community Integration Unit at Aberdeen HMP which provides support for women to be part of a local community at the end of their sentence.&#8221;</p><p>The report goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;The Commission visited Aberdeen Community Integration Unit and met with management, staff and prisoners, and former residents. We had lengthy discussions with prisoners away from staff and we were struck by the positive relationship which exists between the staff in the unit and the prisoners there. This seemed to us to be based upon a culture of mutual respect. We also noted the emphasis that was placed by management and staff on involving the residents in taking responsibility for practical decisions which affect their daily lives within the unit. It seemed to us that the women in the unit benefited from this approach and were encouraged by it to develop important life skills which may assist them as they prepare to return to their communities.&#8221;</p><p>The report continues:</p><p>&#8220;We recommend that the new national prison for women should include&#8221;</p><p>a</p><p>&#8220;Community Integration Unit based on the model in place at HMP Aberdeen to help women access community services and support networks prior to their release.&#8221;</p><p>We should all congratulate Governor Audrey Mooney and all the agencies, including the Wise Group, that work in the community integration unit.</p><p>I regret that I have not visited Cornton Vale. That is a gap in my knowledge, although I take on board John Finnie&#8217;s comments about the number of visitors. However, I know that the prison has links with prisons in Malawi, and I want to share my experience of visiting Chichiri prison in Malawi. In that prison, women can be held on remand for up to nine years; children are detained with their mothers; women do not have cooking facilities, but they have to do their own cooking, without a kitchen and just on bits of burning wood; and they have appalling shower and washing facilities.</p><p>I agree that Cornton Vale should be replaced but, as others have said, we need to find ways of gaining retribution for women&#8217;s crimes other than putting them in prison. My biggest plea is for a change of culture in judicial services.</p><p>Recently, Aberdeen prison visiting committee hosted a meeting that, as Lewis Macdonald knows, was well attended by a wide range of organisations, including police, social services and many third sector organisations. What struck me most was the heartfelt plea from a head of social work services about the huge burden that is placed on the public purse by the judiciary&#8217;s sentencing policy, whether that is in housing, fostering, kinship care, or mental health services. It is important that the judiciary recognises the wider consequences of sentencing policy. It is clear that David McLetchie did not read the briefing from Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, which calls for a distinct approach for women offenders.</p><p>My hope is that, as a result of the report, we will see a change of culture in the judicial services and that the effects of sentencing policy on offenders and their families will be recognised. I also hope that there is a change in the SPS, so that it considers the longer-term outcomes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the Cabinet Secretary for Justice&#8217;s wisdom in setting up the commission on women offenders and particularly in asking Dame Elish Angiolini to chair it.

It has certainly been a day of contrast in the Scottish Parliament. It has probably not escaped members&#8217; notice that, this morning, one of the world&#8217;s wealthiest and most high-profile businessmen gave evidence to one of our committees. This afternoon, we are in the chamber discussing how we ensure that we deliver on a commitment to improve the rights of one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.</p><p>The 2012 commitment, which was created under the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003, entitles all unintentionally homeless people to settled accommodation by the end of this year. Currently, local authorities have to secure settled accommodation only for those homeless applicants who have been assessed as being unintentionally homeless and in priority need. The act stipulates that the priority need distinction must be abolished by 31 December 2012. That means that, from the point of abolition, all unintentionally homeless households will be entitled to settled accommodation.</p><p>The 2003 act has been acknowledged as groundbreaking legislation by commentators elsewhere in the United Kingdom and around the world&#8212;we often beat ourselves up in this country, but many people have recognised that this is groundbreaking legislation. I do not consider it any exaggeration to say that it is one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Scottish Parliament has passed.</p><p>Given the importance of the homelessness legislation, I was delighted that the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee agreed to check on progress towards meeting the 2012 commitment and to identify any barriers to its delivery. I express the committee&#8217;s thanks to all the organisations and individuals that provided detailed and informative oral and written evidence to the committee during its inquiry. I also thank the clerks to the committee&#8212;especially Ruth McGill&#8212;and the Scottish Parliament information centre for all their help. The committee undertook a programme of informal visits to the Ayrshire and south housing options hub, Moray Council, Turning Point Scotland, Glasgow Housing Association, East Lothian Council and City of Edinburgh Council. We are grateful to all those who agreed to meet us and to provide an extremely valuable practical insight into the work that is being done on the ground to deliver the commitment.</p><p>I also thank those who attended a lunch-time event with the committee today, prior to the debate, some of whom have stayed and are in the public gallery. I offer particular thanks to Angela, a former user of Shelter Scotland services, who kindly agreed to speak to committee members about her experience of homelessness, the options that were available to her at the time and her experience of raising a family in temporary accommodation. We are very grateful to her for giving up her time to share her experience with us.</p><p>The committee acknowledges the varied progress among local authorities in Scotland towards meeting the 2012 commitment. However, we were encouraged by the fact that the majority either had already met the commitment or were close to doing so. The committee heard that the 2012 commitment has led to considerable improvements in the provision of services for homeless people in Scotland.</p><p>One of the most significant steps forward, which we highlighted in our report, has been the development of the housing options approach. That approach allows for better assessment of people&#8217;s individual circumstances and enables local authorities to pursue effective prevention work. Indeed, it may be responsible for the overall 20 per cent reduction in the number of homelessness applications shown in the Scottish Government statistics covering the period from April to September 2011. Although the housing options approach is at different stages of development across Scotland, there are good examples of positive results. It is encouraging that the minister has indicated that the Scottish Government and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities 2012 joint steering group remains supportive of the approach and the benefits that it brings through homelessness prevention and sustainable outcomes.</p><p>Another issue that the committee has highlighted is the importance of partnership working, which can result in early intervention to prevent homelessness. The committee heard how, in 2010, five housing options hubs were created to promote the housing options approach and to share best practice across all Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities. That initiative has met with considerable success, as the committee experienced when it visited the Ayrshire and south hub. The committee considers that that success should be built on and that, post 2012, the worthwhile work of the hubs should continue and be developed further. Therefore, we have recommended that the Scottish Government examine the potential for the provision of continued financial support to develop membership of the hubs. I welcome the minister&#8217;s indication, in his response to the report, that the Scottish Government is identifying additional resources to enable that work to continue and I look forward to hearing of the outcome of that exercise in due course.</p><p>We also heard that, although there have been considerable improvements in partnership working between, for example, housing, health and social services, further work could be done. Therefore, we have recommended that the 2012 Scottish Government-COSLA steering group investigate and report on methods of further developing and improving such partnership working.</p><p>The committee considers that it is not unreasonable to anticipate a link between achieving the commitment and an increased demand for temporary accommodation. We will continue to monitor the matter following the 2012 deadline to ensure that the commitment and other pressures that local authorities face do not lead to unacceptable levels of dependence on temporary accommodation.</p><p>The committee has also recommended that the Scottish Housing Regulator should report to the Government and Parliament on how it will ensure that temporary accommodation meets acceptable standards. The committee hopes to engage with the regulator over this parliamentary session to discuss that and similar matters.</p><p>Our report acknowledges that local authorities must juggle the requirements of building sustainable communities, serving people who are on waiting or transfer lists and ensuring that homeless people are allocated settled accommodation. We heard positive evidence about common housing registers, their importance to allocations policy and their importance to fostering partnership working in local authority areas.</p><p>In his response to the report, the minister has provided a helpful update on CHRs, which states that 16 are in operation, with a further four launching imminently and another three in 2013. I hope that the local authorities that do not yet have CHRs in place will be given every encouragement and support to introduce them.</p><p>Although progress towards achieving the 2012 commitment has been positive, the committee heard about potential barriers to progressing the homelessness agenda. One key issue is, of course, the supply of affordable housing. The committee will continue to monitor and assess the Scottish Government&#8217;s progress towards achieving its affordable housing targets and has made several recommendations on how supply might be improved across the tenure types. The role of housing in the private sector is particularly important to housing supply. I note that the Scottish Government, working in partnership with the Scottish private rented sector strategy group, published a consultative strategy for the private rented sector on 17 April, and I hope that the issues that the committee raised will be addressed as part of that consultation.</p><p>In response to evidence that disabled people are still reporting that insufficient accessible permanent and temporary accommodation is available, we asked the Scottish Government to provide information on the levels of available accessible accommodation and its plans to increase the supply of such accommodation. The committee welcomes the work that is being undertaken on an accessible housing register and the work by the Government&#8217;s adaptations working group. It will monitor those important developments.</p><p>Another potential barrier is, of course, the likely negative impact of the United Kingdom Welfare Reform Bill on the ability of local authorities to achieve the 2012 target. The main point of concern for the majority of the committee was the impact of the provisions that relate to underoccupancy, which could affect local authority applications policies&#8212;Alex Johnstone dissented on that, which was a surprise. Other points of concern were the general reduction in benefits, which could lead to increased arrears and evictions&#8212;again, Mr Johnstone dissented&#8212;and the change to providing universal credit, which will include a housing benefit component, to claimants monthly in arrears. The latter measure could cause problems for those who have difficulty with budgeting.</p><p>The committee has asked the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Welfare Reform Committee to examine the full details of the regulations on those provisions.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee&#8217;s 2nd Report, 2012 (Session 4): Homelessness in Scotland: the 2012 Commitment (SP Paper 97).</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665539", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to open on behalf of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee the debate on the committee&#8217;s report on progress towards the implementation of Scotland&#8217;s 2012 homelessness commitment.

Two years on, we have the recommendations that Ofgem is edging towards.</p><p>The alterations to the transmission charging regime will mean that generators are charged by output rather than capacity, which could reduce costs for some renewables generators by up to 60 per cent and could lead to lower bills for consumers, but there will be no fundamental overhaul of the locational principles that underpin the system. Any move to reduce costs for renewable energy companies in Scotland is positive, but the opportunity for positive reform is in danger of being missed.</p><p>In the debate two years ago, I pointed out that it cannot be right that Scottish generators produce about 12 per cent of the UK&#8217;s electricity but pay about 40 per cent of transmission costs. The system of charging&#8212;or subsidising&#8212;producers on the basis of their location to encourage them to locate as close to the south of England as possible is an anachronism. It was designed for an era in which a small number of big power stations provided the UK&#8217;s electricity, rather than an era of renewable energy, which by its nature is inevitably more geographically dispersed.</p><p>If the only factor that was in play in designing a system of transmission charges was the cost of grid infrastructure, locational pricing might make some kind of sense. However, that is not the reality of where we are today. Scotland and the wider UK have ambitious carbon emission reduction targets to meet that require significant growth in renewable energy. Economic opportunities from developing and installing renewables technologies can also provide a significant boost to local and national economies.</p><p>Taking those factors into account and designing arrangements that facilitate a move to a low-carbon energy sector is what project transmit is supposed to be about. Transmission charges should reflect those wider priorities and avoid becoming a barrier to renewable energy development, as is currently the case. A postage stamp approach, where all generators face flat rates to use the national grid regardless of their location, is portrayed by some as being radical and undesirable. Yet it is a fact that that is the norm across Europe, with the vast majority of countries charging by how much power companies generate, rather than by where they are located. I cannot believe that it is beyond the wit of man to come up with a fairer and more equitable regime that benefits all the country.</p><p>Although limited progress towards a fairer charging regime is better than no progress at all, Ofgem&#8217;s move towards ruling out a flat rate of charge is disappointing. The case for a flat charge has not diminished. I hope that the Scottish Government will continue to make the case for such an approach and that it will have the backing of the whole Parliament in doing so.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Project Transmit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Almost two years ago to the day, the Parliament backed a motion that highlighted the threat that locational transmission charging poses to developing greater low-carbon power supplies and called for a review of the charging regime to take place.

My colleague Mark McDonald mentioned that Aberdeen City Council is one of those authorities, following its recent decision to allocate the necessary funding during the budget process. That is particularly welcome and will benefit a significant number of my constituents. Mark McDonald mentioned Kevin Stewart and Councillor McCaig, but that move is testament to the hard work of all my SNP council colleagues in Aberdeen City Council in the past five years. They inherited a council that was nearly bankrupt, but it is now receiving many plaudits for its significant performance in all areas of local government. If Aberdeen City Council can do it, I am sure that the other councils that still need to come on board can do so.</p><p>Although the progress that has been made is welcome, there is still some way to go in the efforts to make the living wage the standard in Scottish society.

That challenge is even more pronounced in the current job market, as so many people compete for every job. The only way to ensure the roll-out of the living wage across Scotland&#8217;s private sector would be through raising the minimum wage. However, as other members have said, the power to do that is reserved to Westminster. Unfortunately, it seems less than likely that the UK Government will take any steps in that direction, particularly when it currently proposes attacks on employment law that would make the situation even worse than it is at present. Interestingly, Germany has the most stringent employment laws and the most negotiation with wage councils, but it still seems to be one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. This is another issue on which, if the Scottish Parliament had the powers to act, we could make Scotland a better place to live.</p><p>The proposal to use public sector procurement contracts to specify that companies that provide goods and services to the public sector should operate a living wage policy has the potential to result in progress in the private sector.

The industry still has a bright future. It is a major employer, particularly in the north-east of Scotland, and it will remain important for many years to come. The industry is important to the Scottish economy and the growth that it has achieved stands in stark contrast to the meagre levels of growth in the UK economy as a whole.</p><p>That lack of growth should be of huge concern to George Osborne, particularly given the indications that it could soon lead to the UK&#8217;s credit rating being downgraded.

With economic growth in the UK being as anaemic as it is, taking such action has become more urgent than ever.

With 28,600 employees in Scotland, they have also generated employment. They have helped Scotland to grow economically and have increased and improved community engagement throughout the country. Much of that success is owed to Co-operative Development Scotland. Last year, CDS exceeded its targets by supporting the creation of 30 new co-ops and increasing awareness of co-operatives in Scotland. As new co-ops are being created, there is a greater opportunity for Scots to become involved in one. Thanks to CDS, Scottish co-ops and their members have the support that they need to succeed.</p><p>As the UN has declared this the international year of co-operatives, it is appropriate that, like other members, I speak about the progress that they have made around the world. Co-ops have helped UN members and other states to come closer to achieving the development goals that they have set. In North America, co-operatives have been set up to provide day care for children, while in Japan they are used to care for the elderly. In parts of Europe, they have helped to find employment for their members during difficult times. Claudia Beamish mentioned Malawi. When Liam McArthur and I were there last year, we thought that there was a huge gap in the Malawi economy that could be filled by co-ops, especially in relation to the wastage of food. The latest edition of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited&#8217;s publication Credit Union News reports that,</p><p>&#8220;To coincide with the UN event,&#8221;</p><p>the Co-operative Bank, which has been very active in micro-finance, has</p><p>&#8220;announced the launch of a new type of international investment scheme that will provide much needed finance to third world co-operatives for capital and infrastructure projects.&#8221;</p><p>We are beginning to see a start in that area.</p><p>Co-operatives provide a fairer way of doing business through the application of democratic principles. Co-ops exist to meet the needs of their members and have helped to reduce poverty around the world. They show the importance of working together to achieve a common good by giving power to the people who might otherwise be powerless. They give their members a say in their own affairs and promote confidence in the partners as well as in the co-operatives. However, co-operatives are not just good for their members; they also have outstanding business performance across every sector. They are efficient and sustainable, and they have better customer services overall.</p><p>Co-ops are especially useful in tough economic times because they do not face the same dangers that many businesses face and they are less risky, as they tend to rely on financial support from their members instead of taking loans from banks. While other businesses rely on bailouts, co-operatives are capable of sustaining their trade and have shown that there is a safe alternative to risky business. That is extremely important, especially in the current economic climate. Businesses need to be safer and more accountable to their customers, and co-operatives encompass those values while spreading the risk and wealth more evenly throughout the co-op. As a result, when one member of a co-op benefits, all members benefit. That makes for a more even distribution of wealth, motivated employees and superior customer service.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661322", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Helen Eadie for securing this debate on an important matter.

He is becoming highly experienced at it. The fact that he has again given us a budget that delivers the most possible from diminishing resources should be welcomed across the chamber.</p><p>I will focus on capital investment, in part because of my role as the convener of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, but also because it is perhaps the most critical part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget when it comes to boosting Scotland&#8217;s economy. Ken Macintosh began to acknowledge that, but then said that it was not being delivered on the ground. I remind him of the M74, the M80, the Airdrie to Bathgate railway, the 250 new schools, the Southern general hospital, the dental school in Aberdeen, the Forth replacement crossing, the Borders rail project, the dualling of the A9 and the A96, and all the other projects that are outlined in the infrastructure investment plan. That pipeline of projects is welcomed by industry, and I am sure that Mr Park recognises that they are creating real jobs for apprentices in the future.</p><p>With the taxation powers of the Parliament limited, the capital spend that takes place in Scotland is the biggest lever that we have to stimulate our economy. The continuing need for such stimulus should be obvious, given that encouraging growth must be the current top priority for the economy. That is why the UK Government&#8217;s decision to impose a real-terms cut of 32 per cent to Scotland&#8217;s capital budget over the current spending review period is particularly short sighted and the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to reprofile &#163;750 million of revenue spending towards capital investment is critical. That policy was even endorsed by Nicola Horlick on &#8220;Newsnight Scotland&#8221; last night. Boosting capital spending results in increased employment in the short to medium term and stronger economic growth in the longer term.</p><p>As well as using traditional forms of capital spending, the Scottish Government has been innovative in using other means to up the level of capital spend that will take place in Scotland in the coming years. It is using Network Rail&#8217;s regulated asset base to draw in funding for strategic rail improvements; it is leveraging greater funding from the European Union&#8217;s joint European support for sustainable investment in city areas; it is implementing measures such as tax increment financing; and it is making greater use of the non-profit-distributing model of finance. Together with the excellent work of the Scottish Futures Trust, those are all ways in which the Scottish Government is squeezing out the highest possible level of capital investment despite the constraints that Westminster has imposed.</p><p>As a result of all that, capital investment in Scotland will be 25 per cent higher in 2014-15 than in the current financial year. Having said that, even more action could be taken if the Parliament had access to full borrowing powers and, with that, the ability to boost our economy more rapidly.</p><p>One key investment in north-east Scotland is the Aberdeen western peripheral route. I am delighted to note that a commitment to deliver that project through the non-profit-distributing financing model is an important part of the budget. I am sure that most members in the Parliament accept that, the sooner the infuriating legal delays can be resolved and work can begin, the better for the people of north-east Scotland. That position was reiterated by Alex Neil in Aberdeen on Monday and was widely welcomed by the business community, which he addressed.</p><p>The great advantage of NPD financing is the substantially better deal that it secures for the taxpayer in comparison with some of the disastrous private finance initiative projects that Administrations prior to 2007 signed off. The bill for that toxic PFI legacy in Scotland is set to increase substantially in coming years, which will drain from the Scottish Government money that could be better put to work on strengthening Scotland&#8217;s economy.</p><p>As well as having new capital projects, it is important to maintain existing infrastructure well and update it as needed. Making such investments is an important part of the preventative spend agenda, because a failure to maintain what we have will result only in increased costs for the Government further down the line. It is welcome that, despite the savage cuts that have been imposed on us, the transport infrastructure maintenance budget has been protected.</p><p>By focusing on stimulating economic growth and thereby creating jobs, the budget takes the right way forward in these difficult times. The Scottish Government has been given an extremely difficult task because savage cuts have been handed down as a result of UK Government decisions. We should all welcome the fact that the Scottish Government has pulled out all the stops to boost economic growth through capital spending. Opposition members&#8212;John Park excluded&#8212;have so far moaned about savings that the Government has had to make, but we have heard not a word about their choices. Perhaps they will surprise us at stages 2 and 3 with their alternatives.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659407", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth on, once again, delivering a budget that has, as far as possible, protected services and boosted investment against a backdrop of continuing savage cuts that have been handed to Scotland as a result of the UK Government&#8217;s spending decisions.

An extraordinary transformation has taken place in all the unionist parties, not just Labour, but it seems that it is not one that could be seen as remotely useful for Scotland and its people.</p><p>Just a year ago in the previous session of Parliament, the UK parties were adamant that there should be no referendum&#8212;no way, no how&#8212;yet today they are the ones who are demanding that we stampede towards an early referendum, thereby breaking our commitment and denying the people of Scotland a full opportunity to debate what they wish their future to be. The hypocrisy and cynicism of their position is plain for all to see, and I know that people across Scotland are far from impressed by it.</p><p>I say that that is the position of the unionist parties but, under the leadership of David Cameron, their approaches have been nothing if not fluid and constantly shifting. At the start of the week, we were told that Westminster would impose an 18-month time limit on when a referendum should take place. In the event, it was a policy that lasted barely 18 hours before a hasty retreat was made. Still, I am not complaining. As others have said, given that more than 300 new applications for SNP membership were made in the space of the 48 hours following Mr Cameron&#8217;s intervention, he is the perfect figurehead for the unionist campaign, and I hope that he will make many more similar interventions in the debate on Scottish independence.</p><p>A striking aspect of the UK Government&#8217;s insistence on a single question&#8212;a yes or no ballot&#8212;has been the lack of dissenting voices in the chamber among those who claim to want more powers for Holyrood, short of independence. That is not an option that we favour, but it is interesting, to say the least, that no party here is giving voice to aims that, as the Labour motion says, a substantial part of civic Scotland has begun to call for.

There is still far too much violence in Scotland, which is why it is important that the violence reduction unit, for example, works not only with gangs on knife crime, but on violence as a whole; that we have the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill; that we have anti-bullying measures; and&#8212;I say to Ms Baillie&#8212;that we have a bill to tackle alcohol abuse. It is important that the police, social workers and community and sports groups that work with cashback for communities money all take a holistic approach to reducing violence throughout our society.</p><p>Many aspects of our lives and our decision making are involved. In my view, we still have gender equality in name only. As Marco Biagi said, pay rates for women for some jobs are still well below what they should be, not least in the oil and gas industry in my area. The gender balance in boardrooms is still woefully inadequate, the gender balance in this chamber and council chambers remains a challenge to all of us, and women are more likely than men to be in part-time and low-paid employment. We must all accept that we have a long way to go to reach equality of the sexes.</p><p>As others have said, domestic violence is not confined to one section of society, and it is not only physical abuse that is involved; psychological abuse can be debilitating as well. I remember that my first knowledge of domestic abuse came from hearing about a university professor. Outwardly, he was a very respectable married man when he was out with his wife at social functions, but he kept her locked in the house at all other times. She escaped when he inadvertently left a window open one day.</p><p>As others have said, women have far too often had to fob off concerns about a black eye or other injury as resulting from falling down stairs or walking into a door. All of us who confront such situations must offer a listening ear and assistance, as we must do with women who have changed from confident and outgoing individuals to withdrawn and frightened individuals.</p><p>I was struck by an article in this month&#8217;s Red magazine, which I read in the hairdressers&#8212;about the only time we get to read magazines these days. The article was written by Ruth Elkins, who is a victim of domestic abuse. She wrote that attachment for the sake of attachment is bad; that behaviour that makes a person feel bad is bad; that if the relationship that a person is in makes them scared, sick and upset, it is time to get out; that the most important thing is that people rarely change, at least not without professional help; and that a person cannot change someone just because they love them. Let us not kid ourselves.</p><p>I went to Rhoda Grant&#8217;s event last night and was struck by the fact that virtually all the women said in their stories that they had had to leave. That has to change. Why do women and children have to flee their family homes? They have not only to live with violence, but have the further traumas of having to move house and perhaps school, and of leaving their friends and relatives. That is unacceptable.</p><p>At yesterday&#8217;s Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee meeting, we took evidence on the homelessness target and heard about how much homelessness is due to relationship breakdowns. I firmly believe that more effort needs to be made to redress the balance, so that women can know that their first action does not have to be to flee, and that they can instead access services in order that they can stay in their home and the perpetrator of the crime has to leave.</p><p>In conclusion, I believe that social work, medical staff, police, women&#8217;s aid organisations and locksmiths must work together to exclude the perpetrators of the crime, who desperately need professional help away from their families in order to address their issues.

However, at the end of this process the decision has been made that Aberdeen&#8217;s watch-keeping staff should be reduced to the one-size-fits-all 23 members of staff that each maritime rescue co-ordination centre will have. Meanwhile, the single back-up maritime operations centre will be an unmanned station in Dover, which in an emergency will need staff to move from the main MOC located at Fareham, near Portsmouth.</p><p>I will not argue that the original proposals were in any way acceptable, given how much damage they would have done to coastguard provision in other parts of Scotland, but taking plans at Aberdeen from one extreme to another is extremely poor behaviour towards the staff there.</p><p>Placing both the primary and back-up maritime operations centre on the south coast of England is no way to build any kind of redundancy or resilience into the network, especially as it will take time to move staff to the back-up centre in an emergency, if that is even possible. The UK Government knows that full well, which is why the coastguard&#8217;s two data centres are to be dispersed&#8212;one at the MOC on the south coast and one in Aberdeen. If there is an argument for dispersing the data centres&#8212;as there clearly is, to build resilience into the network&#8212;that should also apply to the maritime operations centres.</p><p>The valuable expertise that has been built up in Aberdeen as a result of the close work with the offshore industry cannot be overestimated. That expertise is a key component of safety in the offshore oil and gas industry.</p><p>Cutting staffing levels in Aberdeen will only reduce the effectiveness of the coastguard in co-ordinating offshore search and rescue and dealing with the unique challenges that it faces in relation to the oil and gas industry. A one-size-fits-all approach to staffing numbers is not appropriate when one MRCC faces additional responsibilities and challenges. Staff at Aberdeen have hard-won specialist knowledge that simply cannot be replicated by remote assistance from another station or the MOC. Oil and Gas UK has put its concerns about this move on record, and it is easy to see the major disruption to current incident plans that the proposals will cause.</p><p>The fact that Aberdeen&#8217;s unique position in relation to the oil and gas industry means that more members of staff are required has been acknowledged by the UK Government, which has indicated that HQ officers will be posted there to liaise with the industry, in addition to the 23 watch-keeping staff. That is instead of building on the relationships that have already been established. However, it is the additional watch-keeping staff, who allow MRCC Aberdeen to cope with the safety demands of the oil and gas industry, that are to be cut. I have heard directly from those staff just how concerned they are about the impact that that will have.</p><p>Having the additional staff needed to maintain effective oil and gas incident co-ordination in Aberdeen would allow the site to operate as a far more effective and resilient stand-by MOC, without the inherent delays and drawbacks involved in using the site at Dover. That is the course of action that should have been taken in relation to Aberdeen, and the UK Government&#8217;s failure to do that is truly baffling.</p><p>The entire process has been poorly handled, and it does nothing to put first the safety of people who use and work in the waters off our shores. With these changes coming so soon after the loss of the fleet of fixed-wing, long-range search and rescue aircraft, and with the future of the air rescue co-ordination centre at Kinloss still unclear, the UK Government seems determined to take extraordinary risks with people&#8217;s lives in order to slash costs. That is why it is important to debate the issue in this Parliament and, at 5 pm tonight, to send a clear message to the Tories and Lib Dems in Westminster that their decision is unacceptable to Scotland. It has been interesting to watch Alex Fergusson and Tavish Scott defending their colleagues&#8217; stance. It is not difficult to see that both of them would have been on the other side of the argument if Labour had had an opportunity to take some of its proposals forward. We need the devolution of this responsibility, so that we can design a safety system tailored to the needs of Scotland&#8217;s people, its industry and its coastline.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maritime Safety and Coastguards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have heard this morning about situations around the whole of Scotland&#8217;s coastline, including Mike MacKenzie&#8217;s gripping and compelling personal experiences.

In the previous session of Parliament, Jamie Stone and I were the only members who had experience of working in the industry. I am not sure whether any of the new intake of MSPs has worked in the industry.</p><p>I welcome both the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and the motion, particularly the recognition of just how important it is to maintain and improve Aberdeen&#8217;s position as an energy hub. The report is right to stress that Aberdeen will not secure that role for the future without concerted effort and it will require extensive vision, collaboration and real improvements to the infrastructure and skills development opportunities that are on offer in the area. Organisations such as Aberdeen city and shire economic future&#8212;ACSEF&#8212;the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce and the higher education institutions in the area all recognise that and are working collaboratively to ensure that it happens.</p><p>The north-east colleges are collaborating more than ever before, not least with the signing of a federation agreement between Aberdeen and Banff and Buchan colleges. However, as Mark McDonald mentioned, the report states that we must encourage the energy industry to collaborate more with Aberdeen&#8217;s academic institutions to ensure that Aberdeen is home to the skills that the energy industry needs for the future. Lewis Macdonald and other north-east MSPs have been to briefings from our colleges and our universities in the past few weeks and we know that they are working hard to make that happen. A seamless education from technician training and apprenticeships through to PhDs and management skills can be provided by the academic institutions in the north-east if they work together.</p><p>That makes the first half of Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s amendment very relevant. Health and safety pervades everything that the oil industry does. Indeed, if anyone goes to an event sponsored by BP or the oil and gas industry they are given a little card that says to ensure that they hold on to the rails and not to carry anything when they are going down the stairs, particularly blunt instruments or glasses. Health and safety pervades everything that is done, even onshore, and it comes from the importance of health and safety offshore.</p><p>Quality of life and good infrastructure in the city are hugely important in making Aberdeen a world-class energy capital for the future. That highlights the importance of projects such as the Aberdeen western peripheral route, which cannot be overstated. The report is right to highlight the need to ensure that the long legal delays it has endured are avoided in future infrastructure projects. Encouraging greater air links to strategically important locations should also be a priority and there is a strong argument for devolving air passenger duty for just such a purpose. It is important that we all do as much as possible to ensure the viability and continuity of the new route from Aberdeen to Frankfurt.</p><p>The economic opportunities that are offered by the energy sector&#8212;both in oil and gas and in renewables&#8212;to Aberdeen are enormous and it is essential to the Scottish economy that efforts to secure them are fully supported. That brings me to the last line of the Government&#8217;s motion, which is perhaps one of the most telling recommendations in the PWC report. The North Sea oil and gas industry needs</p><p>&#8220;fiscal certainty and targeted incentives ... from the UK Government.&#8221;</p><p>Fiscal certainty and targeted incentives are, unfortunately, the direct opposite of what we got from Danny Alexander and the UK Government.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s tax raid on the oil and gas industry came without warning or consultation and, if anything, was the absolute antithesis of the fiscal certainty that the industry requires. The Scottish Government has called for a statutory consultation period before changes to oil and gas taxation take place in the future. Surely we should all agree that such a measure would go a long way towards giving the industry confidence that it will not unexpectedly be raided again in the future.</p><p>The tax increase made no recognition of the effort required, the costs of exploration and development or the variation in how profitable different fields are. Some months ago, the Scottish Government submitted proposals to mitigate the worst effects of the tax grab by calling for a rate of return allowance before a field is liable for the supplementary charge, an investment uplift allowance or an extension of the field allowance for small or technically challenging new fields.</p><p>Those measures would encourage the industry to continue investing in exploration and the development of new opportunities. The lack of response to those much-needed proposals has been deeply disappointing to many in the industry, particularly as around a quarter of the previously planned projects have been sufficiently affected by the UK Government&#8217;s actions to reduce the probability of them proceeding.</p><p>Significant investments in the North Sea have been announced since the increased tax bombshell was dropped, but they are in projects with the highest yields or the most investment already committed to them. The marginal fields are the most heavily affected. Oil &amp; Gas UK has warned of a two-speed industry emerging on the UK continental shelf. Projects involving more than &#163;12 billion of investment that could have led to &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion of tax revenues have been put in doubt as a result of the UK Government&#8217;s ill-considered actions.</p><p>A few years ago, a politician spoke out to condemn the then UK Government&#8217;s focus on squeezing out short-term revenue from the oil and gas industry at the expense of investment that was needed to get the most out of the North Sea. That politician was George Osborne. The contrast between his comments in 2007 and his actions as chancellor can only be considered as representing hypocrisy of the worst kind. I hope that he has invested &#163;150-plus in buying Alex Kemp&#8217;s two volumes on the history of the oil and gas industry in the UK, and that he learns from them.</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655279", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oil and Gas Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate, because oil and gas is a subject that is very close to my heart; I worked in the industry and went offshore as part of my job for some 15 years.

Even with the recent changes to staffing levels, there are still significantly more whole-time equivalent staff than there were when the SNP first entered government.</p><p>Unlike what happened in the dark days of Labour control, the NHS is meeting its targets and improving the incredible service that it provides to the people of Scotland. Before the 2007 election, there were 32,000 out-patients waiting for more than 12 weeks. Last year, there were just 150.

We now have a UK court with the power to overturn and overrule the judgments of the High Court and radically reshape the Scottish legal system as a result. Make no mistake about it: this threat to the independent legal system that Scotland has held on to since the act of union has caused significant disquiet in the Scottish legal profession. What makes the situation more intolerable is that it has developed through a quirk of legislation, or a loophole in the system that has, at a stroke, jeopardised centuries of Scottish legal tradition and, indeed, given the UK Supreme Court more power over Scottish criminal law than it holds over equivalent courts in the rest of the UK.</p><p>I do not believe that the situation that has been allowed to develop is an underhanded power grab or a premeditated effort to undermine the independence of the Scottish legal system. No: it is quite simply a result of a lack of consideration for Scotland and the failure of the then UK Government to think through the consequences that the legislation would have north of the border. As has often been the case at Westminster, Scotland was an afterthought&#8212;if it was considered at all&#8212;and, just a few years later, we are left to pick up the pieces.</p><p>It was never intended that the Supreme Court would act as an appellate court in Scottish criminal cases and supplant the role that the High Court has held for centuries as the highest court of appeal in such matters. Restoring the High Court to the apex of the Scottish legal system is a matter of correcting something that was not at any time intended to be a part of the devolution arrangements.</p><p>The report of the review group chaired by Lord McCluskey recommends that the Supreme Court be limited to interpreting and defining when and where breaches of the ECHR have taken place before remitting such cases back to the High Court to determine the appropriate disposal of the case. The Supreme Court should not have the powers of disposal over Scottish cases that it currently has. It is essential that that recommendation is acted on.</p><p>It is difficult to see any justification for the Supreme Court continuing to hold the power to grant a leave to appeal where certification has been refused by the High Court in Scotland when it does not hold the power to do so in cases that come from courts in the rest of the UK. I hope that the need to alter that situation is universally accepted in the chamber and beyond.</p><p>As others have said, it is somewhat perverse that devolution has resulted in the Scottish courts having less autonomy while Scotland has gained more autonomy over other aspects of Scottish life. Introducing a certification requirement would at least bring equality for the Scottish criminal justice system with its counterparts in the rest of the UK.</p><p>It is worth noting that the review group&#8217;s report condemns the Scotland Bill, which is progressing through Westminster, as being &#8220;seriously flawed&#8221;. That description of the bill seems to be coming from more and more quarters these days. Will the report finally be the one that leads to a substantial reworking of the flawed legislation that is being proposed? I am not holding my breath. Far from limiting the inappropriate role that the Supreme Court has taken on in the Scots legal system, the current provisions of the Scotland Bill would entrench that role. Such a move is far from desirable and would be completely out of step with the review group&#8217;s recommendations. I understand that Lord Wallace is reflecting on that matter. The time has come for him to accept the need to change course and limit rather than enhance the role of the Supreme Court in hearing Scottish criminal cases.</p><p>I welcome the review group&#8217;s conclusions and the case that it has made for restoring the High Court to its rightful place as the final court of appeal in Scotland for criminal cases. I hope that the UK Government can see the clear need to adopt its recommendations and alter the necessary legislation to address the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "All of us in the chamber are only too aware of the impact that Supreme Court decisions have had on Scots criminal law, not least with such high-profile judgments as that on the Cadder case.

People should not build up reserves when we are short of capital spending.</p><p>Within the incredibly tight budget constraints that have been passed on to us from Westminster, there is little doubt that the target of 30,000 homes over five years is ambitious. To achieve it, Scotland will need to make the most of more innovative ways of funding house building and maximise the return that is received on every penny of public investment. As the minister said, the national housing trust is one such innovation. It has been extremely positive in delivering more housing and providing work to the construction industry on projects that would otherwise have completely stalled. Labour is stuck in the previous century in considering ways of financing house building while the SNP is forging forward and finding new and innovative ways to build houses.</p><p>Keeping the construction industry building is a critical part of economic recovery. That is why it was important that the Scottish Government diverted resources into capital spending in the spending review. Whether we are talking about the demand for new property from the public sector or the private sector or greater efforts to renovate and refurbish buildings, the importance to the Scottish economy of ensuring that there is work for the construction sector is not to be underestimated.</p><p>With just over 200,000 applicants currently on local authority housing lists, the need for more affordable housing in Scotland is unquestionable. At least two thirds of the affordable homes that the Scottish Government will support will be for social rent, which will go at least some way towards driving down housing waiting lists. The actions of the Scottish Government are positive, despite the extraordinarily tough financial conditions that have been imposed on it, and the Parliament should welcome them.</p><p>The need to make housing more affordable also extends to the need to support first-time buyers seeking to make their first step on to the housing ladder. With schemes such as the new supply shared equity scheme, the open market shared equity scheme and the rural home ownership grants scheme, the Scottish Government supported 5,287 households into home ownership in the first three years of the previous session of Parliament alone. That is compared with the 3,371 that Labour and the Lib Dems managed over the seven years leading up to that.</p><p>It remains the case that the biggest hurdle for first-time buyers is getting a mortgage. Shared equity schemes certainly help to lower that barrier, but housing developers need to ensure that there is a good supply of property that is aimed at first-time buyers rather than those further up the housing ladder. If suitable property for first-time buyers is scarce, it is inevitable that the demand will drive up the price and force buyers out of the market and on to housing waiting lists.</p><p>Although the short-term interests of developers might dictate that building for the upper end of the market is the best way to maximise their profit, the long-term sustainability of the sector rests on first-time buyers being able to make it on to the housing ladder.</p><p>The Scottish Government built an impressive record on housing during the previous session of Parliament and I am sure that it will do its utmost to meet its commitments this time.

Scotland&#8217;s economy needs to be sustainable not only in the sense of being environmentally responsible but in terms of creating a sector that will be with us for the very long term. Renewable energy offers Scotland the opportunity to achieve both those goals.</p><p>The SNP has set an ambitious but achievable target of generating the equivalent of 100 per cent of electricity demand from renewable sources by 2020. We are well on the way to achieving that and I am sure that the minister was as pleased as I was yesterday evening when we heard from Ray Hunter of Renewable Energy Systems that our targets are totally achievable. It is unfortunate that Jackson Carlaw is not in the chamber to hear that. About 58 per cent of current consumption will be met from renewable sources once the projects that have received consent or are under construction are added to those already completed. That plan for such a major role for the renewables sector is not only essential if we are to meet our world-leading carbon emissions reduction targets; it is essential for the future of Scotland&#8217;s economy.</p><p>To answer Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s point about nuclear energy, I cannot remember a time when this Government has not said that existing nuclear power plants have a role to play in the medium term until we can move to more renewables.</p><p>Scotland enjoys 25 per cent of Europe&#8217;s offshore wind and tidal energy potential and 10 per cent of its wave energy potential. In the years and decades ahead we have the opportunity to generate and export substantial amounts of renewable energy, providing jobs and opportunities for thousands of people in Scotland.</p><p>The national renewables infrastructure plan has already identified the key role that the north-east will play in the offshore renewables industry, building on the hard-won offshore skills and experiences that have been built up in the region by the oil industry over several decades. The national renewables infrastructure plan will be backed up by &#163;70 million and there will be a significant return on investment for the Scottish economy. Neil Findlay cannot stand up and say that there is a budget line for only &#163;5 million and then mention the &#163;70 million in his speech. He needs to go back and study the budget document a bit more closely.</p><p>The return on investment for the Scottish economy will help to establish Scotland as the international centre of excellence in renewable energy. My colleagues from Aberdeen have already mentioned the combined heat and power plants and the significant amount of energy that the Aberdeen renewable energy group test bed for wind turbines will generate for the people of Aberdeen.</p><p>However, despite several years of work by the Scottish Government and others, there remain significant and unnecessary obstacles to Scotland fully seizing the opportunity that the renewable energy industry offers us. Most significant of those is the continuing ludicrous system of transmission charging, which would see energy developments in and around Aberdeen facing charges of almost &#163;20 per kilowatt while an identical development in the south of England would be heavily subsidised for every kilowatt. That system of pricing is archaic and long overdue for reform. It takes no account of the need to reduce carbon emissions and to move to a low-carbon economy. Until it is finally replaced, it will fundamentally undermine the UK Government&#8217;s claim that it is serious about tackling climate change.</p><p>As one of my colleagues said, as long as the fossil fuel levy, which, legally, can only be spent in Scotland on renewables projects, remains locked away in the Treasury bank account instead of being put to work in Scotland, the UK Government&#8217;s warm words on climate change will always ring just slightly hollow in the chamber and in the rest of Scotland. That &#163;200 million would make a significant difference to the Scottish Government&#8217;s efforts to encourage the development of a low-carbon economy, and the Treasury&#8217;s continued intransigence is disappointing to say the least.</p><p>Ultimately, Scotland will also need action at a European level. The construction of a North Sea supergrid will open up electricity markets for energy companies in Scotland to provide clean, renewable electricity. That project is critical to Scotland&#8217;s low-carbon future and is another reason why Scotland needs a strong, independent voice arguing for our interests in Europe.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government&#8217;s determination to move to a low-carbon economy will be taken as a positive sign by the many people in Scotland and beyond who welcomed the leadership that we showed in setting our climate change targets. Measures such as the carbon accounting that now accompanies the Scottish budget are vital to ensuring that progress continues to be made in reducing carbon emissions.</p><p>We have come a significant distance in our efforts to address climate change, and I am confident that, under the leadership of this Administration, we will continue to go further. On such an important issue, there is simply no other option.

Those challenges are much the same today, with the Scottish budget again falling in real terms. At least we can see how the decisions that John Swinney made in previous budgets have played out. Scotland has experienced a shorter and shallower recession than the UK as a whole, and the latest set of figures shows that Scotland is the only part of the UK where unemployment is falling and employment is rising.</p><p>The Scottish Government put protecting jobs and returning to growth at the heart of its economic recovery plan, and it is no coincidence that the statistics are now painting a starkly different picture from that in the rest of the UK, where the focus has been on making cuts too swiftly and too steeply for the economy to handle. The Scottish Government has consistently put growing the Scottish economy at the heart of its activity, particularly during these difficult times. The spending plans only underline that fact.</p><p>Danny Alexander claimed that the SNP is the enemy of growth in his bizarre conference speech earlier this week, but all he did was show how out of touch with reality he and his colleagues in the UK Government really are.</p><p>This is the same Danny Alexander who seemed to take a perverse pride in launching a punitive tax raid on the North Sea oil industry, undermining plans for future investment in an industry that has yet again poured billions of pounds of revenue into the Treasury&#8217;s coffers.

Rather than change course, as is so clearly needed, George Osborne seems incapable of saying that he was wrong and of doing what is clearly necessary to boost economic growth. We have heard that many people south of the border would like Alex Salmond to be their leader&#8212;perhaps they would like to have John Swinney instead of George Osborne.</p><p>Capital investment is always at the heart of any successful attempt to grow an economy, yet Westminster is cutting the Scottish capital budget by 36 per cent between 2011 and 2015. When the Scottish Government accelerated capital funding into housing, the result was an 11.6 per cent increase in construction jobs compared with a 0.2 per cent fall across the UK. The chancellor may have tried to blame lower than expected construction figures for the need to downgrade growth forecasts but the Scottish Government has already demonstrated to him how to address that problem.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s leadership in prioritising spending to drive economic recovery and growth should be commended as an example that the Treasury would do well to heed.

This afternoon&#8217;s debate is in stark contrast to such wide-ranging discussion of Scotland&#8217;s priorities, as it is about our insufficient opportunity to participate in the most important decision-making bodies of Europe, which means that Scotland&#8217;s priorities can be bypassed or ignored.</p><p>James Kelly says that we have conduits of influence but, if we are not at the top table, we are not where decisions are made. The stories of Scottish ministers being excluded from discussions in Europe and even at times being refused a presence on a delegation are not new, but they remain utterly scandalous. The fact is that things do not have to be that way. It is not as if we are asking for something that does not already exist. A look at some of our European neighbours illustrates that ensuring European representation from devolved Governments is perfectly possible and effective.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, Belgium has had clear and agreed divisions of subjects between levels of government since 1994. On some topics, the federal Government takes the lead role, while on others, a minister from a region takes the lead role. In most discussions, a minister is automatically backed by a representative from a different tier of government. For example, when the federal Government takes the lead role for Belgium in Europe, a regional representative is present to ensure that the regional Government&#8217;s needs are fully taken into account and represented, and vice versa. Far from having to write a begging letter for permission to attend, as is the situation for this country, the Scottish ministers should have that accepted assumption of representation on UK delegations.</p><p>On subjects that fall almost entirely within one region&#8217;s competence, such as fishing, that region acts as the sole representative for Belgium. If only the Scottish Government had sole responsibility for representing Scotland&#8217;s fishing industry in Europe. Fishermen have far greater faith in Richard Lochhead&#8217;s abilities than they do in members of the Conservative Party, which&#8212;let us not forget&#8212;once described the fishing industry as expendable.</p><p>Scotland is home to more than 70 per cent of the UK&#8217;s fishing industry, so of course the issue is far more important to Scotland than it is to the rest of the UK. Despite that, as has been mentioned, the Scottish Government&#8217;s fisheries secretary was denied permission last April to attend an agriculture and fisheries council meeting, so that his place could be taken by an unelected member of the House of Lords who knew nothing about fishing and who was responsible for bee health. That situation was not just utterly farcical but an insult to everyone who is involved in Scotland&#8217;s fishing industries and whose livelihoods depend on the discussions and decisions in Europe.</p><p>As the common fisheries policy is up for reform in the next year, it is more important than ever that Scotland is given the voice that it needs in European discussions. Similarly, the common agricultural policy is to be reformed. As Scottish farming is a very different beast from farming south of the border, Scotland has a clear need to play a full and active part in every UK delegation that deals with devolved policy.</p><p>On justice matters, can a UK representative really be expected to take into account Scotland&#8217;s unique legal system without a Scottish Government presence on the delegation? It is clear that we are expected to hope so, given that Kenny MacAskill has been refused permission to attend justice and home affairs council meetings three times in the past two years.</p><p>The way in which the UK Government approaches European discussions is a relic from a pre-devolution era and is long overdue for reform. Given that many decisions are made in Europe, Scotland simply cannot afford to continue to run the risk that UK delegations might ignore devolved Governments&#8217; needs.</p><p>Along with my colleagues in the SNP, I firmly believe that, as Christina McKelvie said, Scotland would be best served through independence and having its own representation in the EU. However, until Scotland reaches that point, we cannot continue with the status quo. Scottish Government participation in every UK delegation to the EU on issues that affect Scotland should be the norm, as happens in other countries.

Aberdeen is Europe&#8217;s oil capital. It is an important hub for service companies that have located themselves there, and it is important to keep those companies there as their markets expand globally and they focus less on North Sea oil and gas opportunities, although much potential is still there and people are switching from using their expertise in oil and gas to using it in renewables.</p><p>Infrastructure is key to keeping such companies in the north-east. The infrastructure debate has been dominated by the Aberdeen western peripheral route. The cabinet secretary said that the M74 project was first mooted 50 years ago; the Aberdeen western peripheral route was first mooted in the 1950s. The route was all ready for the off in 1996 under Grampian Regional Council, of which I had the privilege of being a member, but subsequent local authorities and transport ministers messed about with it. As Lewis Macdonald said, the project is now mired in legal challenge by a very few local protesters, who are backed by environmentalists who are mostly from outwith the AB postcode area. That frustrates the vast majority of people in the north-east and was a major issue on doorsteps during the election campaign. Does the cabinet secretary have any idea when the inquiry reporter will let us know the findings of his inquiry? It is completely unacceptable that it has gone on for months. Should a time limit or deadline for concluding such inquiries apply?</p><p>The cabinet secretary will know that I wrote to him about the possibility of including in the tender for the Aberdeen western peripheral route a community benefit clause. Given the project&#8217;s scale, it presents an opportunity for the Scottish Government and its partners to secure additional economic benefits. The inclusion of a community benefit clause that would require the successful contractor and its subcontractors to undertake targeted recruitment and training to help to reduce unemployment&#8212;and youth unemployment&#8212;in target areas is one additional benefit that could be secured.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649605", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Infrastructure and Capital Investment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

I declare an interest as I used to work in the oil industry, as so many constituents of the north-east and other MSPs in the chamber currently do. As Mark McDonald said, the health of the industry has a knock-on effect on every part of the economy in the region, so I welcome this chance to debate this critical issue.</p><p>As other members have said, George Osborne&#8217;s tax grab came like a bolt from the blue and sent shockwaves through Aberdeen and the wider region. Like Kevin Stewart, I was surprised by how many people it affected and by how many people articulated that to us on their doorsteps during the election. It has put investment in the industry and, consequently, jobs at risk. As Ian Bell of Optimus said at the time,</p><p>&#8220;The chancellor has just brought the recession to Aberdeen. Thanks for nothing, George.&#8221;</p><p>As someone who worked in the oil industry in the 1980s, when it experienced a severe downturn, I know how traumatic that can be.</p><p>The tax rise has a fundamental problem at its core, which is that it was clearly drawn up by someone who has no understanding of how the industry works. I suspect that Danny Alexander is rather regretting claiming full credit for it. Obviously, like Alex Johnstone, he did not recognise that those who are operating the forecourts now are not the ones who are at the cutting edge of the technology that is required in the North Sea nowadays.</p><p>The blanket approach to the increase in the supplementary charge takes no account of whether a field is new or well established; of whether it is profitable; or of whether investment in it is planned. It has already caused investments in the North Sea to be suspended, with Statoil's development of the new Mariner and Bressay fields put on hold, and that will only continue while the tax remains unchanged. Modelling by Professor Alex Kemp of the University of Aberdeen estimates that 79 fewer fields will be developed over the next 30 years than there would otherwise have been. That could have a huge effect on the economy of the north-east.</p><p>I am glad that the Scottish Government has put forward constructive proposals for how the supplementary charge can be altered to mitigate its most harmful effects, and I welcome the engagement that it is having with the Treasury. It is seeking to make the system of taxation more progressive, so that investment in new developments is encouraged to the long-term benefit of everyone. It seems unbelievable that the Government is cutting off its nose to spite its face by cutting off a huge amount of future revenues just to meet a budget deficit in the short term.</p><p>Mitigation of the effects could be achieved by introducing a rate of return allowance on field investment before a field pays the supplementary charge; by introducing an investment uplift allowance for the supplementary charge; or by extending field allowances. Any of those suggestions would go some way to mitigating the actions of the UK Government, and I hope that members across the chamber will agree that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should pay heed to them.</p><p>There is also a major issue in current policy when it comes to decommissioning oil infrastructure. Previously, at the end of a field's life, companies could apply for tax relief up to the level of tax being imposed on a field to mitigate that cost. With the increase in the supplementary charge, that is no longer the case, as the amount of tax relief that can be claimed has not risen in line with the tax rise. Let us hope that, in the coming weeks and months, the UK Government decides to implement the Scottish Government&#8217;s eminently sensible proposal and the Treasury changes its mind.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: North Sea Taxation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate my colleague Mark McDonald on securing this members&#8217; business debate, particularly as it is his first one.

The whole point of being able to borrow for capital projects is surely to provide the Scottish Government with an additional financing tool. However, with a cap of just &#163;2 billion, the entire amount could be tied up in a single project such as the Forth replacement crossing. Hitting that limit so easily removes borrowing as an option for other public sector infrastructure projects and limits its value. Rather than have artificial Treasury-imposed caps, surely what matters most when looking at how much the Scottish Government should be able to borrow is whether sufficient resources are available to cover repayments. That is even more the case when no expert or UK Government minister was able to explain to the Scotland Bill Committee how those caps were selected.</p><p>Michael Moore has been performing some impressive political gymnastics recently, as his positions on more powers for Scotland seem to have altered on a daily basis.

Little did I think when I worked in the oil and gas industry that I would later come to champion it in this Scots Parliament. Scotland&#8217;s oil and gas industry has driven economic activity in Aberdeen and across Scotland for many years, and it has been a cash cow for Westminster. It is a resource that, as documents that have been released show, Westminster mandarins thought was too much for Scots to manage on their own. Can anyone truly believe that the resource has been well managed by successive Governments at Westminster? Where has been the union dividend for Scotland?</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s oil and gas will play a critical part in taking Scotland forward in years to come, but only if the UK Treasury stops its short-sighted approach to the industry. It is shameful that a politician from the north of Scotland&#8212;Danny Alexander&#8212;claimed the credit for the tax raid on the industry earlier this year. Following the tax raid, the UK Treasury will this year rake in &#163;12 billion from the North Sea oil and gas industry. The way that the additional &#163;2 billion is being applied will strangle investment in new fields and the jobs that they bring with them. It treats the small companies&#8212;which are making the bulk of the investments in new development&#8212;as if they are the large players in established fields, and it is squeezing them all equally hard. That approach is short-sighted in the extreme and will stymie growth in the industry for many years to come if it is not addressed. That is why I know that those in the oil industry will be heartened that the First Minister made the issue a key priority during his meeting with George Osborne. I only hope that George Osborne will listen to reason.</p><p>In his report, the renowned oil economist Alex Kemp said that the number of new developments in the North Sea could be cut by more than 35 per cent in the next three decades as a result of the tax. Nearly 350 undeveloped fields in the UK continental shelf could fall at the first hurdle as companies assess whether they are now economically viable. Alex Kemp also estimated that the UK&#8217;s oil and gas production could fall by 2.25 billion barrels because of George Osborne&#8217;s new tax regime. It is estimated that the oil and gas industry accounts for around 120,000 direct and indirect jobs in Scotland, while a further 75,000 are supported through induced and export activity as a result of the industry in the north-east of Scotland.</p><p>If the approach to the recent tax hike on the North Sea industry indicated that the UK Government does not understand the oil and gas industry, the debacle over the air passenger duty surely confirmed it. The proposed changes would have meant an additional &#163;165 million tax penalty for the sector, on top of the taxes that have already been levied. However, the swiftness with which the UK Government has backed down on the issue suggests that it should be given the benefit of the doubt&#8212;in all probability, it merely forgot about the importance of helicopter flights to the oil and gas industry. Surely one cannot say that our oil and gas industry is better run from Westminster when Westminster clearly does not understand the nuts and bolts of the industry.</p><p>Scotland needs to control its own resources, rather than the Treasury being allowed to continue with its narrow, short-term focus. Annabel Goldie talked about sharing our assets within the UK, and of course we are prepared to share our wealth, but we are not prepared to have it raided and have nothing to show for it. While Norway built up an oil fund worth many billions, which has allowed it to stave off recession and invest in the country, the UK Government has squandered the wealth of the North Sea for decades. We would not be so short-sighted; we would both nurture the industry by supporting the development of new fields and use the tax that it generates.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Mason on his first speech in this Parliament.

Against the background of a shrinking budget, the overriding priority is to maintain police numbers. Wild claims of massive reductions in police numbers from a single force are ludicrous and scaremongering. The Liberal Democrats at Westminster are taking 12,000 police officers off the streets in England, while the SNP is keeping police on the streets in Scotland. The wild claims of massive reductions do those who make them no credit at all. The chance of police numbers falling will be far greater if no structural reform is made as the Westminster cuts continue to bite.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats talk about local accountability, but true local accountability is at present patchy. Many chief constables hide behind the tag of operational matters instead of being open and accountable to their joint police boards. In times of financial stringency, should chief constables receive thousands of pounds in performance-related bonuses? Where was the local accountability recently when Grampian joint police board&#8217;s convener&#8212;a Liberal Democrat&#8212;wanted to discuss the board&#8217;s response to the consultation behind closed doors? The discussion was delayed and was not in public. When the cabinet secretary discusses the future with that board shortly, he will discuss board members&#8217; individual views and not the view of the board as a whole.</p><p>We can ask the people of Parkhead in Glasgow whether they feel that local accountability exists. Glasgow&#8217;s east end is prone to a high rate of house fires and fire deaths, but Parkhead&#8217;s local fire station was closed as a result of decisions that were taken by councillors from Ayrshire and Argyll and Bute. Is it sensible that retained fire personnel in Stornoway are told which streets to cover for fire prevention by people in Inverness rather than by personnel on the ground who know the streets and households that have more fire risk? Is it sensible that, if Tayside fire personnel are called to help at an incident outside their area, they need to return to Dundee to refill their breathing apparatus, because fire boards have different BA sets? Fire services even use different sizes of fire hose.</p><p>As the Liberal Democrats in Westminster impose massive cuts on Scotland, it is only right that we should consider how to deliver services in the most efficient way possible. As James Kelly said, do 32 local authorities, eight police boards, eight fire boards and 14 health boards all need their own procurement, human resources, IT and other back-office departments? In the face of the cuts, funding that type of duplication is simply not sustainable.</p><p>Given the tenor of the debate so far, every party in the chamber bar the Liberal Democrats recognises the severity of the budget cuts and supports the Government in consulting on the shape of local service delivery, which will be influenced by the priorities of the ordinary people, one of which is safer streets.</p><p>Unsustainable bureaucracies have blossomed under current structures. The shape of bureaucracy in the police force is an equilateral triangle and in the fire service it is cylindrical. I understand that a recent shift in Dumfries and Galloway comprised five front-line firefighters and 43 back-office staff. Is that the right balance? I do not think so.</p><p>There is an opportunity to reduce duplication of effort, deliver services efficiently and increase local accountability and flexibility.

The passage of the WANE bill was long and tortuous and it had many major controversial amendments right to the end. The Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill, in contrast, has been a bit of a breeze, although, as with many bills that look fairly straightforward at first glance, the devil ends up being in the detail&#8212;and the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill is very detailed.</p><p>My committee member colleagues and I have valued the engineering expertise of John Scott, who used his background knowledge to good effect in teasing out many aspects of the bill. While I am in thanking mode, I also thank the clerks, SPICe staff and everyone who gave evidence and who was otherwise involved with the bill.</p><p>Like Karen Gillon and Liam McArthur, I apologise for not being present for the stage 1 debate, which took place during the visit to Malawi, but I know that Bill Wilson and Sandra White spoke ably on behalf of Scottish National Party committee members.</p><p>There is no doubt that if a reservoir were to fail there could be catastrophic results and it is right and proper for the Government to take preventive measures in that regard. Ten thousand cubic metres is equivalent to four Olympic-size swimming pools&#8212;that is the size of reservoir that comes under the bill. We can all imagine that a burst of that amount of water could inflict substantial damage and even loss of life, so it is important that the bill provides for reservoirs to be allocated different levels of risk and supervision at an appropriate level. The costs involved should also be appropriate and I will come back to that point.</p><p>The committee had a worry about the availability of qualified engineers capable of undertaking the necessary work. It is good to note, as the bill is passed, that there must be significant employment opportunities for engineering graduates and technicians in this area. Concerns were also raised about conflicts of interest, with the same engineers working for different people and parties, but I am satisfied with the measures that are in place to deal with that. Chapter 8 of the bill deals specifically with dispute resolution and is an important part of the bill.</p><p>Owners of reservoirs, especially those of small reservoirs that will now be regulated, are unsurprisingly nervous about the additional burdens, costs and paperwork involved. As with many regulations from various Government departments, full cost recovery of inspections is now the norm. That becomes more true as budgets decrease. It is important that costs are transparent. It is to be hoped that SEPA and other regulatory agencies become more open about how costs are arrived at and that all efforts are taken to keep costs under control&#8212;and not to shift unrelated costs on to the owners of reservoirs. It is also important that grants are available for owners who want to decommission their reservoirs, as Elaine Murray said.</p><p>Reservoirs play an important part in our natural environment. They provide drinking water, of course, and smaller reservoirs are often used for angling and other pursuits. I often think that reservoirs are underutilised as a resource for leisure pursuits.</p><p>As Elaine Murray and other members said, there was little in the bill that was contentious, and all parties agreed to the amendments.

Perhaps it is because of a lack of vision and not having anything to say&#8212;that is the inevitable conclusion.</p><p>Coalfield regeneration is just one of many sorts of regeneration scheme. Like many members, I have seen the positive impact that the Scottish Government&#8217;s town centre regeneration fund has had in areas that I represent and the benefits that communities have enjoyed as a result. There are further successful regeneration projects that we can look forward to. The retail rocks project in Torry in Aberdeen, which is funded from the town centre regeneration fund, will help to create new businesses in the area. The project underlines the importance of successful small businesses in regenerating an area and makes Labour&#8217;s consistent failure to support the small business bonus scheme even more ill judged.</p><p>Also in Torry, it was announced earlier this year that the disused Bon Accord drinks factory could be in line for residential redevelopment, bringing much needed construction jobs to the city and creating commercial space and a more pleasant environment. Those steps to regenerate part of Aberdeen are important in their own right, but they are also a signal of intent to make real improvements in the city.</p><p>Aberdeen is examining the tax incremental funding model for providing finance for improvements through a number of projects in the city, funding growth through growth. The system has worked well in the United States and it certainly has potential in Scotland. Aside from the much publicised Union Terrace gardens, this funding mechanism is also being considered for extending the Aberdeen art gallery, regenerating Upper Denburn, preparing for the destruction and redevelopment of St Nicholas house and creating high-quality pedestrian routes through key city centre locations. It is a mechanism that can do a lot of good if it is successfully used to fund the right projects, and I know that people in various areas across Scotland will be watching what Aberdeen, and indeed Edinburgh, do with that funding model.</p><p>Housing is a key area that needs to be at the heart of a successful regeneration strategy. Abandoned properties can suck the life out of areas and accelerate the decline of a previously successful community. When an area is full of empty homes, it is little wonder that some residents take little pride in their community, do not feel safe in the area and actively seek to relocate. That is why the SNP&#8217;s desire to give councils the power to increase council tax on empty properties to fund the construction of new house building is so important. That measure would discourage properties going unused and help to create more modern homes in areas that badly need them.</p><p>The construction of new homes can have a real transformative effect on a community, returning it to a place where residents want to live. That is what makes the Scottish Government&#8217;s record of council house construction so important. More council houses were constructed last year than in the previous 20 years.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644826", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is not the first regeneration debate in which I have taken part, but it is an issue to which we will inevitably and rightly return as long as parts of Scotland remain in need of improvement.

Study after study has demonstrated that the first few years of a child&#8217;s life are critical to their development and the opportunities that they are likely to have.</p><p>The presentation that ministers were given by Harry Burns when we were developing the equally well strategy, in which he talked about the holes that can develop in children&#8217;s brains as a result of neglect, such as not being fed, changed or put to bed at the right time, will stay with me forever. Although a direct cause-and-effect relationship cannot always be proven, a positive nurturing environment is likely to help a child to develop, whereas all too often a negative environment can make it difficult for a child to succeed in education and can lead to health problems or to crime and antisocial behaviour.</p><p>As much as we might wish there to be, there is no single silver bullet that we can use to ensure that every child in Scotland grows up in the kind of environment that we would want. Problems do occur, particularly when families are trapped in poverty, and when there is a risk of that happening, it is critical that any interventions to improve a child&#8217;s situation are as effective as possible and are taken as early on as possible. Communities and people who work in them know where those families are. At the same seminar, John Carnochan from the violence reduction unit said that it was possible to identify where in a particular postcode area the problem families were likely to be and where there were likely to be continuing problems.</p><p>In my view, early intervention begins at the antenatal stage. Every woman who finds herself pregnant will pitch up at the doctor&#8217;s, go for a scan and be offered antenatal classes. Those classes should be not just about the process of childbirth and how to bring up a child in the very early months; they should be an opportunity for social workers and health workers to engage with the mother&#8212;at that stage, every mother wants the best for their child&#8212;to help them to break the cycle of poverty or drug or alcohol addiction so that they can begin to provide a better life for their child.</p><p>Whether it is to address a child&#8217;s health, their educational attainment or their behaviour, the earlier that intervention is made to change a child&#8217;s circumstances, the more effective it is likely to be in the long term. Although speed is certainly no substitute for quality in such cases, the earlier a positive change can be made when a child&#8217;s opportunities are at risk, the better.</p><p>As others have said, the alternative is crisis management. Waiting for problems to develop before trying to patch them up is more costly and more damaging to children and the people around them. I know that the Scottish Government has been determined to move away from that approach through measures such as its early years framework and the equally well strategy. Prevention and effective early intervention&#8212;addressing issues before things reach crisis point and irreparable harm is done to a child&#8217;s potential&#8212;are the only sensible approach to improving children&#8217;s start in life.</p><p>Two years on from publication of the early years framework, demonstrable progress is being made in achieving the shift in attitude and philosophy that is necessary if we are to put prevention and early intervention at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s early years strategy. That was highlighted in a recently published report, which also identified further progress that can be made.</p><p>It is estimated that if early interventions for children from pre-birth to eight years old were 100 per cent effective, up to &#163;131 million of Scottish taxpayers&#8217; money could be saved in the medium term. Not only is early intervention effective but it represents a more cost-effective option. As is the case for so many issues, it is far more expensive to deal with a crisis than it is to take preventive action.</p><p>Against the background of the cuts to Scotland&#8217;s budget, which we debated yesterday, such efficiency is more important than ever. The undoubted challenges of recession, unemployment and reduced money for services make the successful refocusing of our strategy on prevention and early intervention even more essential. I welcome the progress that has been made so far. I firmly believe that the approach will stand us in good stead in the coming years.</p><p>If professionals co-operate, rather than work in silos, no child should fall through the net, as Ross Finnie said. If all professions work together and enmesh their services, perhaps the mesh in the net will become tighter and fewer children will be likely to fall through it.</p><p>Mary Scanlon and Jackson Carlaw should not get hung up on titles. The Royal College of Nursing Scotland said in its briefing for the debate:</p><p>&#8220;Health visiting services are critically important to the present and future health of families, however, they must not be seen in isolation from the rest of the community nursing team. Healthcare and other professionals must be able to work together to support the development of children.&#8221;</p><p>It is about all agencies working together. Identification of the most vulnerable families is crucial, and the policies that the Government has identified and is pursuing will bear fruit, if they are allowed to continue during a second term of office.

I welcome the fact that at Holyrood, at least, there is clearly cross-party support for the retention of RAF Leuchars&#8212;although I note that although Iain Smith has urged us to support his motion, as of yesterday he had not added his name to Mary Scanlon's motion on RAF Lossiemouth.</p><p>Just a few short weeks ago, I spoke in the members' business debate on RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth, and I was among the many people who marched to try to convince the UK Government of the need to retain RAF Lossiemouth because of the vital military functions it provides to the UK and the overwhelming role it plays at the heart of the local community in Moray. The large number of people who turned out to campaign for the retention of RAF Lossiemouth clearly demonstrated how strongly people feel about the need to keep the base, but I know that no one on the march would want the saving of RAF Lossiemouth to come about as the result of another base being ripped out of the heart of another Scottish community. Playing one community off against another, as seems to be happening, is frankly deplorable and it is not a trap that anyone who wishes to see the retention of RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Leuchars should fall into. Both bases have strong cases for their retention, and the message from the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Government and everyone who is campaigning on the issue must be that both bases should continue to play their vital roles.</p><p>One of the most damaging aspects of the current discussions is the uncertainty they are causing for service personnel, their families and <place-holder colnum=\"31623\"/> the communities that rely on the bases for their survival. Whatever the outcome of the decisions that are made on the future of the bases, they need to be made in a far more timely manner than the current glacial speed of the UK Government. The Tory and Lib Dem Government says that it is undertaking a strategic defence review, but it does not say much about the efficacy of the review if decisions on the closure of air bases are already being made.</p><p>No one has mentioned the role that the two bases play in mountain and sea rescue, which is a strong part of their training, never mind the vital role that they play for Scots in that work.</p><p>Contradictory statements have been made about the criteria that will be used to make the final decision. That is also far from helpful. Given the scale of the impact that any closure would have, the process needs to be clear and transparent. The UK Government needs to make a clear and unambiguous declaration of how and when the decision will be made, to allow people throughout Scotland to make a loud and resounding argument for the retention of RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Leuchars.</p><p>The people of Lossiemouth and the north-east have made clear their feeling about the air bases in the north-east.

The bill contains a number of different subjects as part of its package of provisions, covering game management, wildlife crime, species licensing, invasive non-native species, protection of badgers, management of deer and the administration of designated protected areas, such as areas of special protection and sites of special scientific interest.</p><p>On the surface, the bill is largely practical and seeks to update and strengthen existing law to make it fit for the Scottish countryside of the 21st century. However, it also raised some fundamental questions that galvanised people across Scotland to make their views known to the committee. What should our priorities be in the countryside? What is the ideal balance between different management objectives, such as grouse moor management, protection of species, forestry targets and environmental concerns, and how can we achieve that balance?</p><p>When the committee visited the Langholm moor demonstration project, which is an experiment that is attempting to manage a grouse moor with a sustainable hen harrier population, it became clear that what could appear on first sight to be a vast natural wild moor, is actually a piece of land that is extensively managed. Foxes are being controlled, birds are being fed and heather is being burnt. As much as the bill is about the natural environment, it is also about how land is managed.</p><p>All committee members engaged with the bill from the outset, and I thank them for their dedication. I also thank all those who gave evidence to the committee, and those who <place-holder colnum=\"31223\"/> assisted the committee with our external meeting in Langholm, Dumfriesshire, and with our informative visits to the Langholm moor demonstration project, Alvie estate near Aviemore, and the RSPB Scotland-managed Loch Garten and Abernethy reserves in the Cairngorms national park.</p><p>I also take this opportunity to thank the committee clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre for their support during stage 1.</p><p>As I am sure that members will appreciate, there was no shortage of strongly held views on issues such as snaring, species licensing, game and deer management, and wildlife crime. I will come to each of those shortly. I should also say that, although the committee was not in complete agreement on how to take forward some of the issues, we were unanimous in agreeing that the bill is necessary and important and that the Parliament should support it at stage 1.</p><p>On a general issue, it was made clear to the committee that wildlife law has become increasingly complex and difficult to follow. How can we expect everybody to understand the law when there is such confusion and lack of clarity? When the committee heard that respected legal experts struggle to make sense of it, it realised that consolidation of the law was overdue. The committee believes that that should be a priority for any future Administration.</p><p>Let me now turn to the various issues in the bill, starting with the provision on game law. The committee supported the Government's intention to modernise archaic game laws and to bring game birds under the auspices of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The committee also supported the creation of a single poaching offence, which should prove to be more transparent and effective. On the topic of ground game&#8212;brown and mountain hares, specifically&#8212;the committee welcomed the proposed introduction of close seasons to protect dependent young at important times for their welfare.</p><p>Wildlife crime and single-witness evidence became a central issue in the committee's considerations, and a very lively session was held on the subject. The bill restates the current position that poaching offences and egg stealing can be prosecuted on the evidence of a single witness, but other wildlife crimes require corroboration. A majority of members thought that that position is not sustainable and that the law must be made consistent, either by extending single-witness evidence to all wildlife crimes or by abolishing it altogether. Members had different views on which route to recommend&#8212;I am sure that others will clarify their positions during the debate.<place-holder colnum=\"31224\"/></p><p>There was a great deal of discussion about the on-going problem of raptor persecution&#8212;a situation which seems, as the minister stated, to be getting worse, rather than improving. The committee agreed that the law is not working. We should be seeing more prosecutions for persecution of raptors and fewer reported cases, but sadly we are not. A majority of the committee therefore welcomed the minister's announcement that she intends to lodge an amendment at stage 2 to introduce a vicarious liability offence, which will target not just individuals who directly poison a bird of prey but landowners who direct them to do so. It is important that our laws can deal with the few who are tarnishing the reputation of the vast majority of estates, which do a great deal for Scotland both culturally and economically.</p><p>The committee unanimously welcomed the recent wildlife estates Scotland initiative, a voluntary initiative that is managed by the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association and the Scottish Estates Business Group, supported by the Scottish Government. It seeks to set and maintain the highest standards for our sporting estates.</p><p>Some committee members supported enabling powers being put in the bill so that future Administrations could introduce an estate licensing scheme if the vicarious liability offence and voluntary scheme were shown not to be making an impact on the problem. I note that I did not agree with that recommendation, but I am sure that other members will give their views on it, in due course.</p><p>Deer management is another important issue that the bill deals with. It proposes a series of amendments to the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996 in order to realise fully the intentions of that legislation. There can be few finer sights in Scotland than a red deer stag standing majestically on a hill, and many tourists come to Scotland to see deer in their natural environment. However, as Scotland has somewhere in the region of 750,000 deer and they have no natural predator, deer numbers need to be managed to prevent significant damage to habitat and to ensure that any threat to public health and safety is kept to a minimum.</p><p>The committee agreed with the Government that the most effective method of managing deer across the country is to encourage co-operation and collaboration among all those who manage deer for a variety of objectives. However, the committee also heard persuasive evidence that the system is simply not working as well as it should be, and it therefore calls on the Government to re-examine the operation of deer management groups, which gather local landowners together to agree how to manage deer <place-holder colnum=\"31225\"/> numbers in a particular area, and to ensure that all those who are responsible abide by the proposed code of practice.</p><p>The committee supported the Government's proposed presumption against the release of invasive non-native species. In this country, we have seen many examples of non-native species becoming invasive and damaging natural wildlife and habitat, from the non-native grey squirrel, which the minister mentioned, and the rhododendron to the signal crayfish, which was discovered only last week in the River Kelvin. The best way of preventing future generations from having to deal with problems that are caused by non-native species is to have a presumption against the release of such species.</p><p>There were less contentious measures in the bill that the committee supported, such as bringing consistency to the laws protecting badgers; making changes to when and how muirburn should be practised; and the proposed streamlining of designations of protected sites, such as areas of special protection and sites of special scientific interest. The committee welcomes all those provisions, with some minor suggestions and recommendations.</p><p>As I said at the beginning of my speech, in many ways the fundamental question behind the bill is what our priorities should be in the countryside. How do we achieve a balance between public and private interests, between landowners and environmentalists, and between animal welfare organisations and those who shoot for sport? The bill has begun to answer that question and to better address the balance. I look forward to its being strengthened further at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21121957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Consideration of the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill at stage 1 was a challenging and fascinating task for the committee.

That is not a good basis on which to start negotiations.</p><p>How much we as a nation admire the bravery of our fishermen in undertaking such a hazardous job to bring fresh fish to our tables and to export high-quality products overseas can never be overstated. That is why the general public cannot understand why fishermen who catch good, edible fish have to discard them overboard because they cannot be landed as a result of quotas. The horrendous situation in which tonnes of good fish are discarded by fishing vessels is a direct result of the EU's common fisheries policy being based on landing quotas rather than catch quotas.</p><p>The land more, catch less approach is a relatively new approach that is being pioneered in Scotland. With the right monitoring, it is possible to know exactly how much of a fish stock, including in mixed fisheries, is being removed from the sea. The need for effort restrictions can therefore be reduced. It is a win-win situation: fish mortality is reduced and fishermen are able to raise the value of the stock that they land by being awarded increased quotas for their compliance with the scheme. The technology is available to create a fully monitored fishery that not only gives fishermen a chance to demonstrate their compliance with regulations but creates a significant wealth of evidence on the health of fish stocks that can be pointed to in negotiations. It will also give a wealth of evidence to those in marine research. Given the cuts in budgets, it is obvious that there will have to be work with the industry in the future.</p><p>Scotland has demonstrated that a catch quota system of management can be successful. The EU now needs to back that system and take action to significantly expand its availability. The industry here has rightly received international plaudits for its ground-breaking conservation measures. It is <place-holder colnum=\"31024\"/> imperative that the rest of the EU acknowledges those efforts and the need for change in practice, but the EU steadfastly refuses to see that as a basis for negotiation. It is right that the Scottish Government is putting catch quotas at the heart of our negotiating priorities, but without our own voice in negotiations, it can only be hoped that the UK Government fully understands just how important a priority they are. Given the way in which the Lib Dem-Tory Government at Westminster attempted to drop the annual fisheries debate, it is difficult to have much confidence in it.</p><p>There is no better document for the cabinet secretary to have in his luggage than \"The Future of Fisheries Management in Scotland: Report of an Independent Panel\".

As Nanette Milne said, it is a key part of \"Better Health, Better Care\".</p><p>Clear quality-of-life issues are involved when the self-management of conditions might allow patients to enjoy greater freedom in their day-to-day lives. Requiring patients to attend clinics regularly for their treatment also has implications for time and cost. That is a particular concern for people in rural areas, who may face longer journey times and, therefore, may see more of their day-to-day life sacrificed to managing their condition. Even if such visits are relatively infrequent, there is still inevitable inconvenience to the patients involved. Therefore, I believe that, where possible, it is right to consider alternatives.</p><p>It seems strange that youngsters are encouraged to self-monitor and self-manage their anticoagulation therapy but that, when they reach adulthood, they are considered unable to do it. Given yesterday's budget and the severe cuts that have been passed down from Westminster for this year and the coming years, members will require no convincing of the need for treatments to be cost effective. A shrinking pot of resources is available to the Scottish Government, so the cost of change must, of course, be weighed against the benefit to those with long-term conditions.

Keeping up with the pace of change can be a challenge, but when treatments are developed that can provide people with long-term conditions greater freedom from their conditions, I believe that it is right to look long and hard at adopting them if they are cost effective. Encouraging greater independence among people with long-term conditions is always desirable when it can be achieved.

Both those sectors rely on science and engineering; they rely on strong research and development in the companies in the sectors and they require our universities and colleges to come up with innovative solutions and to work together with industry to ensure that the sectors grow in our economy.</p><p>Bill Wilson mentions in his motion the good work of the higher and further education institutions in the West of Scotland. I would not stand here and not commend to the chamber the immensely innovative work of the University of Aberdeen and its institute of medical science, the Robert Gordon University, the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, the Scottish Agricultural College, the <place-holder colnum=\"30273\"/> University of Dundee's college of life sciences and the University of Abertay Dundee's computing science departments. In medical research, science and engineering and the environment, all those institutions play vital roles.</p><p>So, too, do our colleges, which provide us with many higher national certificate and higher national diploma students who might go on to further study. They also provide the practical and technical support in our higher education and research establishments. Many colleges also produce apprentices for our industries, such as for Score Energy Ltd in Peterhead, which has contracts all over the world.</p><p>That leads me to schools. I believe passionately that curriculum for excellence provides a marvellous opportunity for teachers to ignite in many more pupils the excitement of STEM&#8212;science, technology, engineering and mathematics&#8212;subjects. In some quarters, such subjects are seen as being dry and perhaps too difficult, but I believe that that view is based on ignorance and is not justifiable. Curriculum for excellence gives us an opportunity to instil in all our young people from an early age the relevance of, and a fascination for, science, which can be related to so many other subjects and can be taught in a collaborative way.</p><p>If we combine learning that Scotland has produced so many renowned scientists and innovators with delving in some depth into what they studied, produced and invented, I am positive that many more youngsters, including females, would choose STEM subjects. If my teachers had explained that angles in geometry related to the aerodynamics and design of sports cars, a spark might have been lit in me and I might have chosen a completely different career path. That work must be done in primary schools. In my view, it is too late to do it when youngsters are making subject choices in secondary school.</p><p>That is why the work of the Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology is so important, as are the facilities that are offered by places such as the Satrosphere science centre in Aberdeen and Dundee Science Centre for visiting school groups and family days out. Techfest, which is supported by so many of our businesses located in the north-east, is eagerly awaited each year by our schools.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21067751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Science"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Bill Wilson on securing this debate to coincide with the science and the Parliament event at Our Dynamic Earth today.

This is a time when people in Moray are understandably shocked and angry over the coming devastation of their local economy. It is more important than ever that the issues are discussed in the Scottish Parliament, and I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.</p><p>In previous years, we have seen only too clearly the economic and social devastation that the loss of a local base can cause to communities in Scotland. There can be few examples of past closures, however, where two bases that are so tightly woven into the fabric of a local community and that are so integral to the local economy have been under threat at the same time. As a Keith quine, I know how far from Lossie and Kinloss&#8212;through Forres and Elgin&#8212;the influences of the bases stretch in the north-east of Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"29958\"/></p><p>As the motion makes clear, and as David Stewart made clear in his speech, 16 per cent of all full-time equivalent employment in Moray is directly linked to the bases, and their loss would be a devastating blow to the area. As Rob Gibson and other members have mentioned, that loss would have a significant knock-on effect on local services, including education and health, and on the economic wellbeing of people throughout the area. I know that the Scottish Government and its agencies will work tirelessly to mitigate the impact of the SDSR's decisions as far as they possibly can, but there can be little doubt that there will be really tough times ahead for people in Moray.</p><p>As this is a Westminster decision, it is vitally important that Westminster resources are also deployed if one or both of the bases close. Scottish Government resources must not exclusively be left to pick up the pieces after a Westminster decision. Perhaps the minister will tell us what Westminster resources he thinks can be made available.</p><p>The importance of the Moray bases extends well beyond the communities that they are part of. As has been mentioned, the Nimrod fleet has played an incredibly important role in rescue operations in many parts of the world, perhaps nowhere as important as the waters off our coast. During tragic events such as last year's North Sea helicopter crashes, or the Piper Alpha disaster in the 1980s, Nimrods from RAF Kinloss have been on hand, often arriving first on the scene, to assist and co-ordinate rescue efforts. They have provided a vital function in saving the lives of people who work in the hazardous conditions of the North Sea, and the cancellation of their replacements will be of concern to many people.

Disabled people are no different from anyone else in their desire to have meaningful work and to receive a fair wage for their efforts. However, supported places are valuable not only for the social good that they provide, but for the long-term benefits that they offer to the public purse. The cost of supporting a person with disabilities is roughly halved if they are in employment. In 2009, the Scottish Government helped 23 supported workplaces with funding to the tune of &#163;26.4 million, precisely because it recognises their value.</p><p>As we have heard, the economic downturn has not left supported workplaces unscathed. Local authorities are trying to make resources stretch further than ever, while demand in many business sectors has fallen. That has created massive challenges for supported workplaces&#8212;not least for Glencraft in Aberdeen.

Given that the Scottish low carbon investment conference took place this week, I believe that it is a timely moment to discuss the offshore valuation study and the challenges and opportunities that it sets out for Scotland's renewables industry.</p><p>The subject is often discussed by members of all parties, and I believe that all members want Scotland to lead the way in harnessing the renewable energy off our shores to drive forward our economy. To get there, however, it is imperative that grand vision is matched by robust calculation and strategy.</p><p>The offshore valuation study is an important document that goes a long way towards quantifying what must be done in the coming years and what the potential rewards will be. It is a solid basis for the long-term planning that will be the bedrock of making the most of the renewable energy resources off our coasts.</p><p>Last year, the Parliament passed its world-leading Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, which is one of the most important actions that members have taken since devolution began. The challenges of meeting the target of a 42 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 are significant, and the nature of our energy supply will play a key role.</p><p>It is estimated that, across the United Kingdom, electricity supply will need to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 per cent before 2030 if we are to stay on track to meet the 2050 carbon emissions reduction targets. In Scotland, we have the opportunity to be well ahead of that curve. The First Minister announced just days ago that Scotland should aim to produce 80 per cent of the electricity that we need from renewable sources by <place-holder colnum=\"29229\"/> 2020, and that there is the real prospect that 100 per cent of our electricity demands will be met by renewable means by 2025. Those are challenging goals, but they are made possible by the rate of progress in recent years.</p><p>As important as it is for us to support the development of renewable energy for climate change reasons, there is an unprecedented economic opportunity for our nation, too. The offshore valuation study estimates that the UK's offshore renewable energy resources would, if developed to full capacity, produce six times the current UK electricity demand, or 2,131TWh. While any conventional resource will inevitably diminish with time, renewable energy by its very nature will always be there for us to take advantage of with the right infrastructure and equipment.</p><p>The offshore valuation study outlines three scenarios that could be delivered with appropriate levels of investment. The first is that the UK would develop offshore renewables to the point at which any further development would require electricity to be exported. The second is that we would push past that to the point at which electricity exports would be equivalent to the electricity that is produced by all means other than offshore renewables. The third is that enough electricity would be produced to match the energy that is generated by electricity, gas, oil-based fuels and other sources. The aspiration to produce clean, renewable energy that provides for heat and transport needs across the UK in that way is hugely ambitious, but it is conceivable if enough was to be invested.</p><p>Each scenario is progressively more ambitious, with greater initial investment demands and greater rewards in the longer term. The scenarios provide highly illustrative demonstrations of the level of investment that is required, but also the level of energy and wealth that can be produced.</p><p>It is clear from the scenarios that if we have the ambition to export renewable electricity to other parts of Europe, the creation of a European Union supergrid is fundamental. The access to a European energy market that a supergrid would bring is essential if the potential revenues from offshore renewables are to be secured. The EU has identified the development of a European supergrid as a key infrastructure priority, but we cannot rest on our laurels and assume that that infrastructure will automatically be built without Scotland's continued input.</p><p>As long as Scotland does not enjoy its own voice in Europe, I hope that all parties in the Parliament would push the UK Government at every opportunity to lead the progress that must be made on delivering a supergrid. That is a <place-holder colnum=\"29230\"/> development of critical national importance for Scotland's economic future.</p><p>Of course, a supergrid is not the only infrastructure that will be needed to make a success of offshore renewables. Sites around Scotland that, with the right investment, can become hubs for the offshore renewables industry are identified in the national renewables infrastructure plan. In the north-east, Aberdeen is already the energy capital of Europe, thanks to the oil industry. It has rightly been identified as integral to the future of offshore renewables, too.</p><p>Getting the right investment in place is critical if Scotland is to fully develop its own centres for manufacturing, maintaining and operating offshore renewables technology. We have a wealth of offshore expertise, thanks to the oil industry, and we can develop that expertise further to provide real jobs and economic opportunities to thousands of people throughout Scotland in the offshore renewables industry. Fully developing our supply chain is a key part of the progress that we must make if we are to ensure that the cost of offshore renewables is not to be prohibitive and that the Scottish economy enjoys maximum benefit from the industry's growth.</p><p>The European Commission's North Sea grid co-ordinator, Georg Adamowitsch, recently said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Taking into account the wind, wave and tidal resources of Scotland, you are in a position to help the rest of Europe to achieve its climate goals.\"</p><p>A real leadership role is available for Scotland to grasp in moving towards offshore renewables to help to tackle climate change. The findings in the offshore valuation study are an invaluable outline of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We must ensure that we build on them to help Scotland to achieve our potential in the area.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21015261", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offshore Renewables"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the members who have stayed for the debate and those who signed the associated motion.

The oil industry in my part of the world should have a key part to play in Scotland's recovery, with significant new finds over the summer and an estimated &#163;45.1 billion in revenue expected to be generated between now and 2015.</p><p>Instead of flowing to the Treasury, that wealth should be creating a long-term platform for investment in Scotland. Norway has avoided entering recession in the current downturn thanks to its &#163;186 billion oil fund, and it is instructive how Nobel prize-winning economist Professor Joseph Stiglitz recently forcefully described the need for Scotland to follow suit with its own oil fund as \"imperative\". Can we rely on any of the Westminster parties to save rather than squander our national resources? Not a bit of it.</p><p>As the renewables industry in Scotland develops, it too has the potential to provide real growth, but we need the power to ensure that it is Scotland that benefits. We have paid a heavy price for the lost opportunity that Scotland's oil previously represented, and we cannot allow the same thing to happen again. That is why the First Minister's announcement on Scottish Water yesterday was so exciting. With full financial control, and encouraging growth in new and existing sectors, we can negate the need for some of the coming cuts in the long term.</p><p>In the short term, however, and as long as we do not have the financial powers that we need, those cuts are unavoidable. The independent budget review does not make for comfortable reading, but it has laid out some of the options that are available and it will be down to MSPs of all parties to find a way to make the savings that are required.</p><p>I can only hope that as the budget approaches we will see a greater willingness to accept that <place-holder colnum=\"28445\"/> reality than we have seen so far today.

The problem not only makes a night out in our town and city centres a frightening experience, creating no-go areas for decent folk who want a good night out, but denies people access to health services that they require. I cannot be the only member who has spent night shifts with the police or the Scottish Ambulance Service and witnessed alcohol-related incidents. Are we serving the public to the best of our abilities if ambulances are being diverted to incidents that are the result of binge drinking at home or on nights out, instead of meeting the needs of elderly people, who might have less dramatic symptoms but more serious long-term illnesses?</p><p>Aberdeen royal infirmary is not the only hospital in which, on any night of the week, beds and trolleys are blocked by people who are sleeping off the effects of too much drink. I recently obtained figures that show that alcohol-related hospital discharges in Aberdeen have increased by 30 per cent since 2004-05&#8212;that is the second highest percentage increase in Scotland. At any time, never mind in a period of public spending austerity, do taxpayers think that that is a good use of taxpayers' money and health professionals' time? I do not think so.</p><p>Scots have the eighth highest consumption of alcohol in the world. Half of all prisoners in Scotland's jails were drunk when they committed their offence. As others have mentioned, 14 of the 18 murders in Strathclyde since 1 April were drink related. An estimated one in 20 deaths in Scotland is attributable to alcohol. Our relationship with booze is killing our country. The total cost of alcohol misuse to the Scottish economy is &#163;3.56 billion annually. Harmful drinkers spend far <place-holder colnum=\"27179\"/> less per unit than moderate drinkers do, so minimum pricing would clearly have a greater impact on them, as it is intended to do. Harmful drinkers represent an estimated 6 per cent of all drinkers but represent 41 per cent of the anticipated reduction in hospital admissions.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned the Scotch Whisky Association's opposition to minimum pricing. I have worked in the whisky industry, and I remember the days when employees were given a dram at lunch time and in the evening. That practice was replaced with the provision of a bottle a month. I do not think that that happens now. Perhaps the industry has recognised the problems of harmful drinking. Murdo Fraser was selective about the information in his speech. For example, was Whyte &amp; Mackay not forced to concede that a 40p minimum price in Scotland would mean that job losses were unlikely? Murdo Fraser's call to wait for the outcome of one budget decision on alcohol from Westminster is, frankly, derisory.</p><p>Both Richard Simpson's and Richard Baker's opposition to minimum pricing at all costs&#8212;the costs to our nation's health and wellbeing&#8212;without proposing any alternatives and kicking the proposal into the long grass by setting up a commission cannot lead to any conclusion other than that they are playing party politics with the nation's health.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20828760", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have not been a member of the Health and Sport Committee, but I congratulate its members on their detailed work and I welcome the debate.

I make it clear at the outset that the stage 1 scrutiny of the bill was <place-holder colnum=\"26140\"/> nevertheless an enjoyable and rewarding experience for the committee and there is much on which we have been able to agree. The single most important thing on which committee members agree is that the bill should proceed to stage 2. I hope that the Parliament will approve that at 5 o'clock.</p><p>For committee members, the most rewarding aspect was our visits to many parts of the crofting counties, including Benbecula, North Uist, South Uist, Caithness, Sutherland and Shetland, where we met local people in their living and working environments. We met crofters, aspiring crofters, landlords and factors. Croft boundaries were walked over, livestock and crops were examined, polytunnels were inspected, antique maps were pored over and plenty of home-made scones and mugs of tea were consumed. I pass on the sincere thanks of all committee members for the hospitality and kindness of the people whom we met, and I offer particular thanks to those individuals who were our guides, took us round their local area, pointed out things that we would otherwise have missed and passed on their local knowledge.</p><p>I also express our thanks to Derek Flyn, who has been our knowledgeable and experienced adviser on the complexities of crofting law.</p><p>A December introduction of the bill meant that those visits took place in the depths of winter rather than at a more clement time of year, but that had its own rewards. Winter visits, with the snow often thick on the ground, helped to disabuse committee members of any romantic notions about the realities of crofting life, albeit that, as I come from a farming family in the north-east, I was perhaps less in need of that reality check than were others. Either way, as many crofters reminded us, crofting is not easy and probably never has been. Crofting is a vocation that requires mental and physical toughness, flexibility, entrepreneurship and patience.</p><p>As the committee report points out, crofters also need other things, which do not lie within their control. Crofters need strong and diversified local economies, because few crofts are self-sufficient and crofting households need other income to help to make ends meet. They also need a decent price for livestock, a fair system of agricultural subsidy and affordable local housing. I make those points now before turning to the detail of the bill to underline the point that the regulatory aspect is just one small part of crofting. To put it differently, it would be unfair to judge the success or failure of the bill against whether we think that it alone will deliver a secure future for crofting. As the Minister for Environment said, we should be realistic in our appraisal of what legislation can achieve on its own.<place-holder colnum=\"26141\"/></p><p>In turning to the four main parts of the bill, as convener of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee I will focus on those issues on which the committee was largely agreed; others will have their chance to express their views on other points. Part 1 deals with the Crofters Commission, which is to be renamed the crofting commission. The bill proposes that the commission be part-elected, with six constituencies electing six commissioners and the Government appointing three more.</p><p>Like most witnesses from whom we took evidence, we support that proposal as a welcome injection of democracy into the commission's operation, but our support comes with a few minor reservations or uncertainties. One of our concerns relates to the proposed electoral franchise. A central feature of crofting law is that, per tenanted croft, there can never be more than one crofter. Two or more adults might live in the croft house and help to work or support the croft, but only one of them is legally the crofter. The Government currently proposes that only that crofter should get the vote. My committee colleague Karen Gillon has been very exercised about that point, which I think Elaine Murray will develop later.</p><p>Part 2, which deals with the main issue on which the committee was split, provides for a new comprehensive map-based register that is to be held by Registers of Scotland. As convener, I will highlight those areas on which we found agreement. All members support the proposal for community mapping exercises, which I am pleased to note is also supported by the minister. We believe that it would be a good thing if people in crofting townships were encouraged to sit down together to draw up croft boundaries so as to pool all the available information and to make use of local knowledge&#8212;the folklore, as some witnesses called it. Drawing up maps in that way would help to deliver greater local certainty and capture that folklore, some of which is at risk of being forgotten. There might also be further benefits, in that the process might help to identify the development potential of underused community assets or simply get some communities into the habit of working together more on local projects.</p><p>Members also suggested that the minister might wish to consider delaying for a time the introduction of compulsory trigger points for entry in the register. That would provide a window of opportunity for those voluntary mapping exercises to take place before registration becomes mandatory. We note the minister's views on that, and no doubt the discussion will continue as the bill progresses.</p><p>Part 3 mainly concerns new measures to tackle neglect and misuse of croft land, and to deal with crofters who are absent from their crofts. In <place-holder colnum=\"26142\"/> particular, it imposes on tenant crofters and owners of crofts the duty to be ordinarily resident on the croft and not to neglect or misuse it. Again, that was a difficult and contentious issue, but for the most part committee members were able to forge consensus on key issues.</p><p>There is much to discuss, but I will focus on croft occupancy. Many witnesses, mainly crofters themselves, argued forcefully that it would be misguided to give the crofting commission increased powers to address crofter absenteeism, and that neglect is a more serious issue. They warned the committee against too dogged a pursuit of absentee crofters, arguing that many people are technically absentees but they have strong links with the community, work the croft regularly and are frequently there. The committee fully accepts that point.</p><p>We are also reassured by what we heard from the Crofters Commission and others that such absentees are unlikely to have anything to fear once the bill is passed. To that end, our report proposes that the commission should make publicly available the criteria that it will apply to judge when to pursue an absenteeism case. We are pleased to note that the Government has accepted that.</p><p>In the end, however, we were persuaded by the simple argument that, if crofting means anything, it means a critical mass of people living on the land year round in sustainable communities. Only then will schools, shops, lifeline services, farming co-operatives and local businesses have a reason to be there. The committee has seen and heard enough on its visits and in the evidence sessions to recognise that in parts of the Highlands and Islands levels of absenteeism are a threat to the crofting way of life. In those, thankfully extreme, cases, it might regrettably be necessary for the commission to take action, and committee members are satisfied that the bill takes a step in the right direction. Our report stresses the need to proceed with sensitivity in such cases.</p><p>Part 4 mainly concerns speculation in croft land and how it can be addressed. The committee welcomes the provision in the bill to increase the discretion of the crofting commission and the Land Court to refuse an application to decroft land, even though planning permission has been granted. The committee considers that that will offer further protection against the speculative activity that is contrary to the interests of local communities.</p><p>I should also take time to highlight the committee's recommendation on how planning law and policy could be made to serve better the interests of crofting, such as the establishment of a rebuttable presumption against zoning croft inby land for development.<place-holder colnum=\"26143\"/></p><p>Sadly, time prevents me from explaining to members other matters that arise under part 4, such as the point of law that was established in the celebrated Whitbread v Macdonald case, or the controversy around how landlord clawback is correctly calculated under section 14 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. I am sure that other committee members will be delighted to take up that challenge during this debate.</p><p>Committee members fully recognise that crofters are an independently-minded bunch, and that not every aspect of the bill finds favour with them. However, there is much in the bill that is worth taking forward. I ask members to support the general principles of the bill and I and the rest of the committee look forward with interest to stage 2. I thank the minister for accepting many of the committee's recommendations.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766264", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The process of considering the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill and agreeing a stage 1 report on it was not straightforward.

As Ken Macintosh said, some of our work as politicians and representatives seems like social work sometimes, but it is not a job that I could do full-time.</p><p>As Irene Oldfather said, when social work services are at their most successful, we do not hear about the work that is done. By its nature, it is a sector that receives publicity almost exclusively when it fails, and we do not hear about the incredibly difficult task that thousands of social workers throughout Scotland perform or about the many successes that they achieve.</p><p>No one can overestimate how stressful and thankless the job of social worker is. The nature of the job is often a cause of high staff turnover. I have huge admiration for new social work recruits who are catapulted into the difficult area of children and families services. It is sad that too many social workers&#8212;even the most dedicated social workers&#8212;suffer burnout. They need all the support that is on offer to encourage them to stay in the job.</p><p>The strength of leadership is fundamentally linked to the recruitment and retention of people in social work services. Good leadership is likely to <place-holder colnum=\"25928\"/> improve staff morale and confidence and increases the likelihood that people will remain in their jobs, whereas poor leadership has the inverse effect. It is also the case that high turnover of staff has an impact on the quality of leadership. As people leave social work, the number of experienced staff who could take up leadership roles is reduced.</p><p>That cycle needs to be broken. I welcome the greater focus that the Scottish Social Services Council and the four Scottish social services learning networks are putting on the development of leadership abilities among people in the sector. I am sure that all members hope that there will be improvements in social services as a result of that focus. Leadership is not confined to senior management in council social work departments and the private and voluntary sectors; leadership and drive are required throughout the workforce.</p><p>Of course, it is important that the focus on leadership does not distract from the need to put new ideas into practice and improve other aspects of social work services. As Hugh O'Donnell said, it is about putting in place a care package that places the user at centre stage and shows what choices are available to the individual and their family. It is about seeing the implementation of the package&#8212;refined, if necessary&#8212;right through to an end game in which the individual is resilient and able to live as independently as possible.</p><p>There are many excellent examples of good practice. At Craiginches prison in Aberdeen, a scheme will soon be a piloted in which a support team will mentor and advise offenders while they are in prison and after they have been released into their communities. The aim is to break the cycle of crime whereby all too often the same people are locked up in prison time and again. The provision of continuous support to get offenders' lives back on track after they leave prison is vital. I am sure that prisons throughout Scotland will closely monitor the scheme's impact on reoffending rates.</p><p>A joined-up approach to all aspects of social work services, such as the approach that will be piloted at Craiginches prison, is fundamental to the provision of effective care to everyone who needs it. Often, multiple organisations are responsible for services that fall under the broad umbrella of social work, so the need for clear and unambiguous leadership is vital if a joined-up approach is to be achieved.

It is a disgrace that they have to pay almost &#163;20 per kilowatt when producers in some parts of the south of England receive a subsidy of more than &#163;6.50 per kilowatt. Even energy producers in the area of Scotland that has the lowest transmission charges still face paying more than those in the highest-charging parts of England and Wales.</p><p>There is no doubt that Scotland can and should become the renewables powerhouse of Europe by taking advantage of the abundance of renewable energy potential that exists across the country and, more significantly, in the waters off our coast, but, however laudable that aim, it will not be achieved automatically. Achieving it will require the right policies to be in place to encourage investment in the renewables industry and a level playing field for electricity producers. I welcome the briefing note from Scottish Power, which is extremely helpful in setting out the arguments in that regard.</p><p>The UK Government may talk about its climate change targets, but if it were serious about achieving them, it would not perpetuate a system of transmission charges that is based on proximity to London, where there is very little in the way of renewable energy potential. That bias makes no sense and puts current and future jobs in Scotland at risk.</p><p>As other members have said, it is not just renewable energy producers that pay the price of UK policy. As the minister mentioned, Peterhead power station in the north-east recently announced that the soaring transmission charges that it faces will force it to shut unit 2 of its power plant in 2011, unless those charges are changed. Up to 70 jobs at the plant have been put at risk as a direct result of the manifestly unfair transmission charging system. How can it possibly be right that Peterhead power station is charged &#163;29 million a year for the privilege of sending electricity to people across the UK when an identical power station in the London area would be paid &#163;3 million to do the same? Fortunately, following discussions with the chief executive of Scottish and Southern Energy, the MP for Banff and Buchan has received some assurances about the future of the Peterhead plant, but the urgency of the need for change cannot be overstated.</p><p>Yesterday, the combined voice of Scottish energy producers, business groups and trade unions called loudly and unequivocally for an end to locational transmission charging.

As other members have said, this is the third time that we are debating the topic in 18 months, which is a sign of how highly the Government regards the sector. It is keen for all members and for the wider Scottish public to know that.</p><p>Scotland has a key place in the global aquaculture market, as the minister said. Aquaculture is hugely important as an export industry&#8212;it is worth hundreds of millions of pounds to our economy. Scotland is now the second-largest producer of farmed salmon, largely because of the collapse of the Chilean market. As a result, it is obviously the largest producer of farmed salmon in the EU. That is perhaps another reason why Scottish ministers need to lead on fisheries at the top table in the EU.<place-holder colnum=\"24392\"/></p><p>However, the Norwegians still enjoy the vast share of the global market. Unrelated to the debate and not knowing that it was coming up, I read an article on how important aquaculture and sea fisheries are regarded in Norway. The importance of fish is embedded in the psyche of the Norwegians&#8212;not only their politicians but the public at large. I am sure that as long as Scotland is thirled to Westminster, fish will not enjoy the same importance in the UK. As long as Scotland is peripheral, fisheries will be peripheral, but it is important to recognise that fish are highly important to Scotland and the rest of the UK.</p><p>In 1992, Scottish farmed salmon was the first product outside France to be awarded the prestigious label rouge mark&#8212;a testament to its quality and status as a premium product. Indeed, despite the harsh economic conditions, sales of label rouge Scottish salmon grew by 19 per cent in 2009 to reach a record level of 7,251 tonnes. Such expansion is important and welcome, but it must go hand in hand with maintaining quality because a reputation for quality will be a key part of our aquaculture sector's future success if it is to continue to grow.</p><p>Like Robin Harper, I have had people raise with me issues about protected geographical indication status. PGI status is an important designation that protects Scottish salmon in the same way as, for example, champagne is protected by the requirement that the product comes from a particular region of France. Does the minister agree that it is important that salmon eggs and smolts originate in Scotland in order to ensure that our PGI status is protected? For example, cattle must be born, bred, slaughtered and dressed in Scotland in order to qualify for labelling as Scotch beef. That issue warrants further consideration if we are to maintain Scotland's reputation for high-quality salmon, so I would welcome the minister's thoughts on that in her closing remarks.</p><p>A key part of the reputation for quality that Scottish salmon enjoys is due to the efforts that have been made to keep our farmed salmon sector as free as possible from infectious salmon anaemia. The ISA virus has recently had a severe impact on the industry in Chile, as has happened in other countries in previous years. The renewed strategic framework that was published in 2009 clearly recognises the need for continuing efforts to maintain high standards of biosecurity. Although last year's outbreaks of ISA in Shetland were cause for concern, I welcome the fact that they were effectively contained. The severe outbreak of ISA in Chile is a tragedy for the industry in that country&#8212;production is not forecast to return to previous levels until 2015&#8212;but, nevertheless, the outbreak in that country has created an opportunity for Scottish aquaculture.<place-holder colnum=\"24393\"/></p><p>As members of all parties will surely agree, aquaculture is an industry that is ideally placed for expansion and for a larger share of the international market. In our previous debate on the topic, in May 2009, the obstacles to such growth were clearly identified as a perceived lack of sites available for expansion and difficulties in accessing finance. Although the continuing economic situation will have done little to help to increase access to sources of finance, yesterday's publication of proposals to streamline the planning process will indeed be welcome news for the sector.</p><p>Expansion in the aquaculture sector is very much welcome, and I am glad that the Scottish Government is making significant efforts to encourage it. Such expansion is not at odds with ambitions to ensure that aquaculture in Scotland is the cleanest and greenest in the world. The value of the product that is produced here lies in its quality, which can only be increased by ensuring that best practice is maintained and marketed.</p><p>As the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee went round our coastal and remote communities, taking evidence on the Marine (Scotland) Bill&#8212;which has now been passed&#8212;and, more recently, on the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill, we saw that aquaculture is one of the most important businesses for families living in our coastal communities. Aquaculture can also provide an additional source of income for crofters, so its importance to those areas cannot be underestimated.</p><p>I believe that Scottish aquaculture has a bright future ahead of it and, with the right encouragement, significant opportunities for expansion. Scottish aquaculture's reputation and the value of its brand lie in its quality, so I welcome the work that is being done to ensure that quality fundamentally remains at the core of this valuable industry.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20679574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister is obviously keen to impress on us how important aquaculture is to Scotland's lucrative food and drink sector.

He is getting a great feel for the life and work of a politician&#8212;I wonder whether he has caught the bug.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, as Sarah Boyack said, the review recognises that agriculture has a pivotal role in tackling the challenges of food security, water supply, energy supply, climate change and protecting biodiversity and that the beautiful countryside of Scotland is largely due to the sound land management of crofters, farmers, foresters and all the others who are involved in working the <place-holder colnum=\"24070\"/> land.

I am therefore pleased that the inquiry team regards the top-up fund as a sensible way forward. It will of course mean reduced area payments, so we must take account of the serious concerns of people such as cereal farmers. We must also ensure that reduced area payments do not mean inflated rents for tenant farmers.

Nobody could argue that Craiginches and Peterhead are fit for purpose, and they have not been so for many decades. I cannot put a figure on the number of times our visiting committee lobbied ministers on the urgent need for a new kitchen in Craiginches, to no avail. More important, we lobbied for a new visiting room and better facilities for partners and children, as the available facilities were and are woefully inadequate&#8212;indeed, I remember taking in toys for the amusement of the children who were visiting the prison. Apart from the fact that we were fobbed off with a few tables and chairs, nothing happened to the visitors room.</p><p>Obviously, the SPS, under successive Governments, was told that there should be no investment in Craiginches prison, because it would be window dressing and a waste of taxpayers' money in a prison that was well past its sell-by date. Richard Baker knows perfectly well why there has been no investment in Craiginches prison. I agree with others who have quoted Andrew McLellan's observation that good family contact is important for reducing reoffending. However, good family contact was not possible in Aberdeen prison.</p><p>As John Farquhar Munro said, there is no definition of a community prison. Aberdeen currently has a prison in its community, but in no way can it be described as a community prison. As far as I am aware, it has never housed convicted young offenders, and for the past few years it has not housed female offenders&#8212;I and others vigorously fought against that situation arising, but female prisoners were moved to Cornton Vale anyway.</p><p>As the minister indicated, the majority of prisoners from the north-east&#8212;56 per cent&#8212;are housed in the prison estate outside the Aberdeen postcode area. The decision to establish a new prison in Peterhead will create in the north-east a prison that can house long-term offenders, short-term offenders, sex offenders, women offenders and young offenders, and that can begin to reflect the north-east's community and become a north-east community prison that can begin to work on restorative justice&#8212;an issue that is dear to my heart and to Robin Harper's. Following the establishment of the prison, we can begin to work with families in the interests of reducing recidivism. Of course, we will never have a prison that can house 100 per cent of prisoners from the north-east, because of prisoner safety and gang culture issues.<place-holder colnum=\"22685\"/></p><p>Removing the uncertainty surrounding the prison estate in the north-east is welcomed by staff and their families. There is a high turnover of SPS staff in the north-east. Burn-out is a major issue, especially in the sex offender unit, but the fact that staff will have the opportunity to move within Peterhead prison and work with different groups will reduce the turnover.</p><p>Having had a prison in its midst, the community in Peterhead must be unique in accepting a replacement. Those who object to the siting of a prison for the north-east in Peterhead have not suggested in which other community a new prison might be sited.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Prisons"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Since we are discussing Craiginches and Peterhead prisons, I want to take this opportunity to express my regret at the recent untimely death of Bill Rattray, a former governor of both establishments.

Scrutinising it at stage 1 meant some hard work for the committee, but I think that I speak for all members when I say that it was also an enjoyable experience. It was particularly rewarding to make fact-finding visits earlier in the year, when the days were longer and the weather just a little warmer, to three beautiful stretches of the Scottish coastline: at Buchan, on the Firth of Lorne and on the Solway Firth. There, we heard first hand from people who live by the sea or make their living from it about the effect that they think the bill will have on them, and what changes they would propose to make it better.<place-holder colnum=\"20633\"/></p><p>On behalf of the committee, I express my thanks to the people who gave generously of their time on those visits, one of which also involved a full committee meeting in Kirkcudbright. I also pass on our thanks to the many people, including two petitioners, who provided evidence to us in writing or in person at our five stage 1 meetings. I thank the entire membership of the committee. I also thank its clerking team, past and present, and the staff of the Scottish Parliament information centre&#8212;Wendy Kenyon in particular&#8212;for their unstinting work. Finally, I thank the cabinet secretary and his officials for the hard work that they have put into getting the bill this far along the road&#8212;if that is the right metaphor for a marine bill. It is only fair to note at the outset that the bill builds on work that was undertaken by the previous Administration and on an important report that the former Environment and Rural Development Committee produced in 2007.</p><p>Scotland's inshore waters are among our most precious resources, as a source not only of food but, increasingly, of renewable energy. They are a resource for boat cruises, recreational angling, activity holidays and so on and they are also simply where we go to relax and enjoy the beauty and sea air. Our seas are also&#8212;or certainly should be&#8212;a haven for a diversity of animals, plants and birds. It is therefore vital that they enjoy adequate protection.</p><p>That said, anyone making a living from our seas might be forgiven for thinking, \"Oh, no, more laws about marine management are on their way!\" Fishermen, in particular, complain with some justification that, at times, they are practically drowning in a sea of rules and regulations. I want to make it clear that the committee would not have supported the bill at stage 1 if we had thought that it was likely to add to the administrative burden. On balance, we do not, which is why we recommend in our report that the general principles of the bill be approved.</p><p>Indeed, we are hopeful that the bill has the potential to make things less rather than more complicated and that it will improve channels of communication between the many diverse users of the sea. In particular, we are cautiously optimistic that the introduction of statutory marine planning will enable more rational and well-informed decisions about the use of the sea to be made and allow misunderstandings about controversial matters such as inshore dredging or the siting of fish farms to be sorted out sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, the creation of a national marine plan should provide an opportunity for the Scottish Government to demonstrate leadership in identifying national priorities, including in emerging industries such as offshore wind and tidal energy production.<place-holder colnum=\"20634\"/></p><p>Another key aim of the bill that we broadly welcome is the new rules on the marine protected areas, which will increase the opportunity to designate appropriate sites.</p><p>A further key area of the bill that the committee supports is the provision to modernise our laws on seal conservation. We agree that that is overdue and that the provisions that are set out in the bill are a step in the right direction.</p><p>Presiding Officer, you would not expect any lead committee convener to conclude a speech at stage 1 without expressing at least some reservations, and I do not propose to disappoint you. In the remainder of my speech, I will refer to some of the matters in our stage 1 report on which we said that we would welcome movement or clarification from the cabinet secretary. I expect other committee members may wish to focus on matters of particular concern to them.</p><p>First, as our evidence gathering made clear, there are serious concerns about the state of Scotland's seas and the loss of biodiversity within some marine ecosystems. There is on-going debate about the causes: are they the result of overfishing in some areas, natural or man-made environmental changes or some sort of complex interplay of factors? Whatever the causes, the evidence gives rise to concern. The committee is under no illusion that domestic legislation will, of itself, turn things round; we simply query whether the bill in its current form has grasped every opportunity to try to put things right. We make a number of recommendations, two of which I will highlight.</p><p>First, we suggest that the bill should set out an overarching duty on all public bodies in Scotland, including the Scottish ministers, to have regard to the need to safeguard the health of the sea when exercising any relevant function. Secondly, we propose that the bill should make it mandatory rather than discretionary for the Scottish ministers to create a coherent network of marine protected areas. The committee considers that the two proposals, if taken together, would help to strengthen the conservation element of the bill.</p><p>Another concern relates to the proposals for the regulation of fish farming. In the main, the bill proposes the retention of the status quo, with licensing decisions being made at local authority level rather than becoming subject to a centralised licensing system. It is important that, as convener, I make it clear that the committee was divided on whether the approach that is set out in the bill is the right one. This was the only matter on which we formally split.</p><p>I respect individual members' right to agree to disagree. Nonetheless, a clear majority of the committee is not satisfied that the approach that is <place-holder colnum=\"20635\"/> set out in the bill is the right one. We think that it goes against the entire philosophy that the bill seeks to champion of making the marine licensing system more streamlined and consistent. Our report tentatively suggests that there might be room for some compromise whereby Marine Scotland sets the licensing rules for aquaculture but they are administered at the local level.</p><p>Finally, I draw the Parliament's attention to the provisions on seals. The committee is satisfied that the overall direction of travel under the provisions is towards improved conservation and animal welfare, which we welcome. However, we make a number of suggestions about how the provisions could be strengthened. For example, we suggest that the licensing conditions relating to the skill or training of the marksman or the type of weapon that is used should be mandatory. On the basis that prevention is always better than cure, we think that implementation of the bill affords an opportunity to ensure that the aquaculture industry takes all reasonable steps to apply preventive measures against seal incursions, such as the installation of anti-predator netting, to ensure that shooting a seal is truly a last resort.</p><p>Those reservations aside, the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee is happy to support the general principles of the bill and to wish it a safe journey as it negotiates the remaining shoals and narrows of the parliamentary process.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20275168", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the debate on behalf of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee.

I put on record the fact that I lodged an amendment to the motion.</p><p>The delivery of a reopened Laurencekirk station under the SNP Government after years of talk has not gone unnoticed by the good people of Laurencekirk. The usage figures for Laurencekirk <place-holder colnum=\"20354\"/> station, which are 84 per cent higher than predicted, are outstanding and demonstrate that the station is making a real difference for people in Laurencekirk and further afield. The success of the reopened station underlines the damaging lack of progress and the failure to deliver the station under the previous Administration. I commend the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change for delivering the project. I cannot help but note the contrast between his record of delivery and the failings of previous transport ministers.</p><p>Mike Rumbles's motion also deals with the crossrail project and Kintore station. Frankly, his suggestion that movement on the project has stalled is ludicrous, considering that, in the eight years of the previous Administration and under two Lib Dem transport ministers, no tangible steps forward were made on delivering any aspect of the project. From that standing start&#8212;purely a vision, as Mike Rumbles said&#8212;activity is happening and progress is being made towards implementing the aims of crossrail on an incremental basis. That is manifestly the correct way to proceed, as Nestrans acknowledged after a feasibility and technical study into the project. Increasing services and the frequency of trains is an important part of improving rail links for communities between Inverurie and Stonehaven. The number of trains going to Inverurie has increased significantly since 2007, with many more services that previously terminated in Dyce continuing to Inverurie. Additionally, from December, there will once again be an evening link from Dyce to Portlethen and Stonehaven, thanks to coming scheduling changes.</p><p>Those changes are important improvements in their own right, but they will also provide an invaluable measure of the extent of the improvement in the number of people using the services. Establishing those numbers and the potential demand among rail users for a reopened Kintore station is vital to ensuring that the right decision is made on the station. Mike Rumbles might gleefully demand funding for projects before they are examined and scrutinised fully but, thankfully, the Scottish Government takes more responsibility when it comes to investing taxpayers' money. It is simple common sense to grow the number of potential users for Kintore station and to firmly establish evidence that there are enough users to make the service viable before committing investment to the project.</p><p>Plans for Kintore station will be examined as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness rail line improvements, which I believe are to be studied by Network Rail this year. The delivery of Kintore station through those improvements would avoid the duplication of effort and would help to keep the project costs down. I look forward to the outcome of that study and to the improvements in rail <place-holder colnum=\"20355\"/> services in the north-east that it will help to drive forward.

Of course, I note the huge contribution of my predecessor, Roseanna Cunningham, who steered the committee through the evidence-gathering stage and early consideration of the draft report. I must also thank the committee clerks for the outstanding work that they did throughout the whole process.</p><p>It was at the committee's first away day, in Aviemore in late 2007, that the unaffordability and unavailability of rural housing came on to the agenda. Contributors to our away day&#8212;people from all walks of life united by the fact that they lived and worked in rural Scotland&#8212;told us almost unanimously about the urgency of the issue.</p><p>Situations where young families are unable to afford a property that would let them live in and contribute to their community over the course of their lives are fundamentally unsustainable. Tight-knit rural communities cannot survive in the long term if young people are prevented from building their lives there and if key local jobs are left unfilled. More needs to be done to increase the availability of rural housing.</p><p>Shortly after our away day, we launched an inquiry with the following remit: to identify the obstacles preventing people in rural Scotland from gaining access to appropriate and affordable housing; to assess the effectiveness of existing mechanisms for overcoming those obstacles; and <place-holder colnum=\"20296\"/> to identify further measures that could be taken, locally or nationally, to help to address the problem.</p><p>The committee, by its very nature, has to get out and about. Over the course of the inquiry, members went to three rural housing hotspots: highland Perthshire, East Lothian and the Isle of Arran. We also held a full committee meeting in Melrose to hear about the situation in the Borders. Those visits helped members to build up a composite picture of the issue across Scotland.</p><p>We also gathered evidence in more conventional ways. We held meetings here in Edinburgh and gathered written evidence from a call for views. I thank the many people who provided that evidence and, crucially, pointed us towards some practical solutions.</p><p>So, what did we find? As I said, the inquiry was lengthy and it took place against the backdrop of a rapidly changing financial situation. When we began our inquiry, interest rates were at 5.5 per cent, Howard from the Halifax was still on our screens singing the praises of 100 per cent mortgages and the phrase \"credit crunch\" still had the ring of novelty about it. How things change.</p><p>However, some things have not changed. Recommendation 1 of our inquiry was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The committee is clear that many more houses need to be built in rural Scotland ...this assumption is fundamental to the overall approach taken in this report.\"</p><p>That was true when we launched our inquiry and it is just as true now. Yes, there are differences across the country, but the fundamental rural housing problem is that demand outstrips supply. However, as we say in the report, that does not mean that there is one \"magic bullet\". Instead, the various factors that contribute to the situation need to be teased out. Only then is it possible to identify bespoke solutions that can help to provide a way forward.</p><p>Our inquiry identified five main themes. I will use the time that I have left simply to introduce them; I will leave it to others to address them in more detail. The first theme is the planning system. It is not all bad news&#8212;there is good practice out there&#8212;but the balance of evidence that we considered made very clear that planning is considered to be part of the rural housing problem. The witnesses told us that the planning system is too slow and overbureaucratic, that plans can be outdated and that councils' planning policies sometimes contradict their housing or environmental policies.</p><p>As the chief planner himself acknowledged, the planning system has been \"niggardly\" in the allocation of rural housing and needs to refocus itself as an enabler of development. Leaving aside rules and policies, that requires a cultural shift as <place-holder colnum=\"20297\"/> much as anything. That applies particularly in relation to building in the countryside, rather than within the envelope of existing towns and villages. We need to overcome the false perception that the countryside is somehow meant to be empty because it has aye been that way. As Rob Gibson has always told us&#8212;and as anyone who knows anything about this country's history will tell us&#8212;it hasna aye been that wey.</p><p>It is entirely right that most planning decisions are taken at council level. However, the committee strongly believes that improving the affordability and availability of rural housing is an issue of national importance, which means that national leadership is needed on the planning issue. The implementation of the Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 affords a golden opportunity to set a different tone, as does the current revision and consolidation of national planning guidance.</p><p>Another key theme was land supply. It is perhaps a uniquely Scottish paradox that while so much of Scotland lies apparently empty, it is extremely hard to get hold of suitable land. There are various reasons for that, but the fundamental problem is that not enough suitable land is being offered for development at a realistic price. In other words, the problem is partly market-based. It has been said that you cannot buck the market, but the committee considers that there are some practical steps that planning authorities could take. We suggest that if owners of land that has been zoned for housing are holding out hopefully&#8212;the less charitable might say greedily&#8212;for the optimum offer, why not consider de-zoning the land? Might that not help to produce a sudden sense of urgency in some cases?</p><p>What about compulsory purchase? Of course, it should be only a last resort, but the evidence we heard was worrying, because the suggestion was that in much of Scotland compulsory purchase is never used at all. What is the point of having the power if it is never used&#8212;not even, for example, to stop a perfectly habitable building falling into disrepair in an area of high housing need?</p><p>Of course, many landowners want to be part of the solution. In particular, the committee heard that some landlords would welcome having a greater role in the private rented sector&#8212;which is proportionately much smaller in rural Scotland&#8212;but when it comes to building new private rented housing, they have difficulty making the figures stack up.</p><p>That brings me on to the third key theme of the inquiry: government funding of affordable rural housing. Government support comes at both the macro and the micro level, and our report touches on both. There are the big top-down spends, mainly via the housing association grant, then there are bespoke schemes that are available to <place-holder colnum=\"20298\"/> individual applicants, such as the rural empty properties grant and the rural homes for rent scheme. Those are potentially useful, and it is important that landowners and prospective householders know that they exist&#8212;the trouble is that many do not. We also heard concerns about bureaucratic overload in administering those schemes. I know that the Government has been reviewing the effectiveness of those schemes and I look forward to an update from the minister.</p><p>The fourth major theme in the inquiry was social rented housing and the right to buy. Whether or not members support the principle behind the right to buy, one thing became very clear: in some parts of rural Scotland, it has had a devastating effect on the availability of affordable housing. One of the key messages of the inquiry was the importance of, as one witness put it,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"holding on to what we have\".</p><p>There will shortly be a housing bill concerning the right to buy, and I look forward to the minister's comments on that in relation to rural housing.</p><p>Some way into our inquiry, the committee began to note recurring concerns about the impact of homelessness legislation on the availability of social housing. Clearly, that is a sensitive issue, and it would have been easy to sweep those concerns under the carpet&#8212;easy but irresponsible, especially since we encountered perhaps surprising evidence that, far from being comparatively insulated from the problem, many rural social landlords are at the front line in dealing with it. I know that homelessness legislation is a thorny issue, but I simply pass on the committee's observation that, whatever the good intentions behind it, it has created some practical difficulties and&#8212;at times&#8212;perverse incentives, which need to be looked at.</p><p>The final main theme identified by the committee was the sustainability and affordability of housing and infrastructure, in which we sought to get down to the literal nuts and bolts of rural housing. We picked up a few concerns but, in the little time that I have available, I will pass on just one: the Scottish Environment Protection Agency's regulatory role in relation to water and sewerage. Bluntly, there were concerns that SEPA was gilding the lily somewhat, and our report calls for its role to be rebalanced to ensure that it serves as much as an enabler of development in the countryside as a regulator. I am interested to hear the minister's thoughts on that.</p><p>In outlining those five key themes, I have stressed the need to consider a variety of approaches to rural housing. However, before concluding, I draw the Parliament's attention to one more cross-cutting suggestion in our report.<place-holder colnum=\"20299\"/></p><p>Earlier, I referred to rural housing pressure points&#8212;or so-called hot spots&#8212;where the strains on the community are most acute. What about giving councils a right to apply for some sort of enhanced pressured area status for hot spots? If such a status were granted, councils would have access to a toolkit of measures to reduce housing pressure, which might include not only suspending the right to buy but applying a special rate of council tax on second homes, the proceeds of which could be used for an affordable housing fund, or allowing for an expedited compulsory purchase procedure. I know that the minister's initial response to that proposal was lukewarm, and I do not dispute that the policy would need to be fine-tuned, but I simply point out that if we are serious about restoring balance, fairness and sustainability to rural housing, we might have to consider more radical approaches in some especially pressured parts of the country.</p><p>I hope that the Parliament appreciates that our report is comprehensive.

Debating the issue gives the Parliament the opportunity to highlight the reasons and set out what can be done to reverse the decline.</p><p>I well remember the first time I gave blood. I went with my father to the blood donor bus on one of its visits to Keith. It was Sunday 22 June 19&#8212;whatever, one day short of my 17<sup>th</sup> birthday. As the bus came to Keith only twice a year, I was keen to donate and not wait for another six <place-holder colnum=\"20057\"/> months. I was accepted despite not being 17 and the procedure was over in a short time. Meanwhile, my father's donation was turning into a bit of a struggle&#8212;they could not get the blood to run into the bag. I think he stopped donating from then on; another family member was doing their bit.</p><p>In the four years that I spent at university, I gave blood only once, when the blood transfusion service came to the university. I do not recollect giving blood while I worked in England, but I started to donate again when I worked in Aberdeen, during my lunch times. I was asked to give platelets&#8212;the hereditary clotting property that led to the painfully slow process of giving blood for my father came good in my blood donations&#8212;as part of the supply for haemophiliacs. At that time, one platelet donation was worth two normal blood donations. My donation count rose rapidly as a result: I got my bronze, silver and gold pins and silver quaich.</p><p>People have to take time out from donating following childbirth and, as Rhoda Grant said, after certain illnesses or periods on medication. I say that to highlight the everyday interruptions that can interrupt donation even for those who want to give regularly. I would like every 17-year-old to be as keen to give blood as they are to obtain a driving licence. Some sixth year pupils at Banchory Academy looked into getting together enough peers and staff to justify the donor bus visiting the school, as it does the offices of some large companies.</p><p>The donor bus is important in rural areas, where volunteers do not live near a donor centre. The rurality of Scotland is an issue. I am against payment for blood donation, but young people and students could be reimbursed the cost of the bus or train fare for attending a donor centre.</p><p>Getting people through the door for that first donation is key. If people are on the books, they can be reminded by text or phone call to make a repeat appointment in three or four months' time; once on the books, they can be cajoled into coming again or be persuaded to become platelet donors. Anyone who can give platelets should say yes. It takes longer, but donations can be made more frequently&#8212;every four to six weeks. In our busy lives, it can be a bit like time at the hairdresser; for me, it is a welcome opportunity to relax completely and read magazines that I would not normally buy or give the time of day to.</p><p>There could be more flexibility on the times of day and the days when donor centres are open or buses come to visit, and there could be more eye-catching and innovative ways of catching blood donors.

This is the first time that Scotland-specific casualty reduction targets have been set. Although they are ambitious, they are wholly necessary if the progress that has been made in reducing casualty rates is to continue. It will be no easy task to halve the number of serious injuries and achieve a 40 per cent reduction in fatalities over the next decade, but I am confident that the Scottish Government will work hard to achieve those targets.</p><p>In the north-east, we know only too well the importance of making improvements to road safety, given how many families have suffered the tragedy of seeing a loved one injured or killed on our roads. As I have said before, I, like many others in the north-east, dread opening the local papers after the weekend, when there are nearly <place-holder colnum=\"19786\"/> always reports about fatalities or serious injuries. The pain that family and friends feel can never be reduced to a mere statistic. That fatalities are at their lowest level in Scotland for more than 50 years is of little comfort to them so, for their sake, more must continue to be done to make our roads safer and to prevent other families from experiencing that pain. Every death on Scotland's roads is one too many.</p><p>Although the north-east has seen more than its share of tragedy on the roads, we are also seeing innovations to improve road safety. As the minister mentioned, Aberdeenshire Council is trialling SeeMe technology in the Banchory area. SeeMe has proved successful in improving the safety of children boarding or getting off school buses in Sweden. Children are given a transponder that is placed in their school bags and which causes warning signs to flash when a child is near a bus stop, warning motorists to take more care. I am sure that all members share my hope that the pilot scheme proves to be a demonstrable success and can be used to help to protect children throughout Scotland in coming years.</p><p>That the north-east was selected for the trials is testament to the tireless campaigning of people such as Ron Beaty, whose granddaughter was seriously injured after getting off a school bus, and the many other people who are involved in his campaign to make improvements to all aspects of school bus safety. I pay tribute to all their efforts and the changes that they have already achieved.</p><p>As the school bus safety group&#8212;and, no doubt, other campaigning organisations&#8212;has found, there are still significant powers over Scotland's roads reserved to the UK Department for Transport. I sincerely hope that the UK Government will play its part in striving to do more to improve safety on our roads where the responsibility rests with it. Like others, I call for those powers to be devolved. Inaction that puts people at risk is surely inexcusable, and I hope that members of all parties will play their part in pushing the UK Government to take action in those areas where the Scottish Government identifies changes to reserved policy that could help to save lives on Scotland's roads.</p><p>I hope that the new Scottish road safety framework will give a new impetus to build on the casualty reductions that have already been achieved, and that improvements in Scotland's road network and road safety technologies will help to bring down the figures still further. Highlighting the fact that road safety is everyone's responsibility, as the framework does&#8212;and as Charlie Gordon did&#8212;is important and will, I hope, encourage a fully joined-up approach to safety on Scotland's roads.<place-holder colnum=\"19787\"/></p><p>I welcome the progress that has been made to date in reducing casualties on our roads by such significant numbers, and I am confident that everyone who is involved in road safety, from Government to individual road users, will play their part in making Scotland's roads even safer in the decade to come.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20194125", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Safety Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish to highlight just how significant the publication of Scotland's first road safety framework is.

I offer my sincere congratulations to the girl guides at the start of their centenary celebrations. With such a remarkable anniversary, I know that this will be a wonderful year for all who take part in the events that will take place.</p><p>The north-east has been playing its part to the full in the centenary celebrations, which kicked off at the weekend. More than 1,500 current and former rainbows, brownies and guides took part in a parade in Inverurie to celebrate the event. Another large centenary event took place at Seaton park in Aberdeen at the weekend. Indeed, more than 550,000 past and present members are estimated to have joined in events across the <place-holder colnum=\"19572\"/> United Kingdom. The range and scope of the activities that have been planned between now and next October are truly remarkable, but that is reflective of the truly remarkable nature of the girl guides.</p><p>The fact that there are some 60,000 girl guides in Scotland means that Girlguiding Scotland is the country's largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women. As Jeremy Purvis said, it is part of an international organisation that has more than 10 million members in 144 countries. Half the women born in Scotland have belonged to Girlguiding Scotland at some point in their lives. The influence that guiding has had on the development of many Scottish women is incalculable.</p><p>Until I did my research for the debate, I had not known that the girl guides came about when some girls gatecrashed the scouts' first rally at the Crystal palace in 1909. Baden-Powell was confronted by a small group of determined girls&#8212;representing hundreds of others&#8212;who insisted that they wanted to be scouts, too. The girl guides' website describes the reaction of critics of the idea. Some called girls' involvement in camping, hiking and similar activities a \"mischievous new development\", a \"foolish and pernicious movement\" and an \"idiotic sport\". I say to the girl guides, \"Och well&#8212;girl power rules okay.\" Today, Girlguiding still retains the goal of empowering girls and giving them greater confidence for their future years, which is why it has chosen to remain a single-sex organisation. That is a big part of what makes it such a unique and positive organisation, and it lies behind the influence that it has had on many women's lives. With the curriculum for excellence looking to recognise the worth of extracurricular activities, and schools, universities, colleges and employers looking for that extra something, achievements that have been made in the girl guides can only enhance a CV.</p><p>Unlike Jeremy Purvis, I am a product of the brownies and the guides. The highlights of guide camps stick most in my memory&#8212;I loved them. I still retain a love of camping, but I am so glad that we no longer have to lash our own pot stands and tripods using knots that we have learned. The discipline of keeping the site tidy and camp inspections is an abiding memory. Today, guides are more likely to learn how to assemble flatpacks and other equally more useful and up-to-date skills.</p><p>I pay tribute to the 9,000 trained adult volunteers who help with guiding in Scotland. However, there are some 4,000 girls who still want to join, so we must encourage more adults to volunteer. I am sure that this year's highlighting of Girlguiding will help to make more adult volunteers a reality. In <place-holder colnum=\"19573\"/> addition, my aunt would not forgive me if I did not mention the work of guide commissioners.</p><p>The past 100 years have seen remarkable changes, but the guides go from strength to strength. I am sure that in 100 years from now, when the organisation celebrates its second centenary, it will still be thriving and playing a valuable role in the lives of Scottish girls.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190879", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Girlguiding"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jeremy Purvis on securing the debate and add my welcome to those in the public gallery.

My mother suffered from dementia for several years before she died, so I hope that I do not introduce too much emotion into my speech. It was ironic that she died suffering from dementia. When I was a child we did not have the awareness that we have now of Alzheimer's and dementia, and I recall elderly relatives who would be recognised as getting gey raivelled or being a bit dottled. At that time, they usually died of something else before dementia became the main issue. I remember their instructing us, because they were practical farmers, that we were just to take them out. As members can imagine, that was because they did not want to be seen in that state. Of course, doing what they suggested was totally out of the question, and I will not stray into the end-of-life debate today. However, that was their attitude.</p><p>We do not really know what goes on in the minds of dementia sufferers. Like other sufferers, my mother had moments of complete lucidity, but would then retreat into the dark world of dementia. That is why research is so important, as is early diagnosis, and making family members and others aware of the early signs of dementia. I know that the stroke leaflet has been well received. People have mentioned to us that it has come through their door and that, having read it, they can now recognise the signs of stroke. I ask the minister whether something similar can be done for dementia.</p><p>It is important, too, to recognise the different forms of dementia&#8212;vascular dementia is different from Alzheimer's disease&#8212;and that sufferers require different medical treatment and care strategies. In addition, elderly and not-so-elderly sufferers should be allowed, as far as possible, to stay in their own environment for as long as possible. That is not possible in many cases because their behaviour means that their dignity and safety is compromised, so the security of a care home environment is the only option.</p><p>Like others who have been directly affected, I know the huge burden that is put on carers of dementia sufferers. We owe a great deal of gratitude to all those who are involved in providing such care. It is absolutely vital that on-going training is made available for carers and others who are involved in the running of care homes and day care centres.</p><p>As more research into dementia is done, more guidance becomes available on how to enhance the quality of life of sufferers. As the minister and others have mentioned, that is not only about diet and physical activity but how to provide mental <place-holder colnum=\"19398\"/> stimulation. As others have said, it is not acceptable that any care home resident should be left sitting all day in the same chair watching television. Different and stimulating environments should be provided through, for example, outings and taking people for fresh air in the garden. In the care homes that I have visited, I have noticed how important it is to have many people who come in as, for example, a volunteer manicurist or hairdresser. Encouraging relatives to come in to give manicures or facials or to talk to the old people about old photographs is an important way of enhancing the quality of life of dementia sufferers.</p><p>Many members have mentioned the widespread and inappropriate prescription of medication, which is totally unacceptable. In some incidents, such as where the patient is distressed and wandering, it may be necessary and in the patient's own interests to prescribe antipsychotic drugs. However, as Robert Brown and others said, such prescriptions should be made only after consultation with the patient's GP.</p><p>I commend the work that is being done by the University of Aberdeen, which is at the forefront of research into Alzheimer's and dementia. A team that is headed by Professor Tibor Harkany is studying how nerve cells communicate with each other and is looking for biomarkers&#8212;biological clues&#8212;that might diagnose people who have the condition. Professor Harkany's team is trying to find out what causes brain cells to become damaged in Alzheimer's sufferers. In looking for new ways to diagnose the disease, the team is looking for new targets at which future drug treatments could be aimed.</p><p>I also want to mention groups such as Banchory's Forget Me Not Club, which allows carers and others to have some free time and lets dementia sufferers meet and be involved in different social interactions. Local schools raise funds for that club and encourage pupils to volunteer to help out there.

I think that I am right in saying that the consumption of salmon has grown annually by some 8 per cent in recent years, but I agree with the cabinet secretary that more needs to be done to promote the consumption of fish, not least for its health benefits. Consumers in Spain, Portugal and Norway eat twice as much fish as Scots eat. We need to grow the internal market for fish products and capture a greater share of the huge market for fish in Europe and further afield.</p><p>I attended the European seafood expo in Brussels and was captivated by the great optimism that Scottish exhibitors showed at their slick promotional stand, which had been co-ordinated by Scottish Enterprise and Seafood Scotland. I think that many people were drawn to the Scottish stand by the wonderful Cullen skink that was served throughout the day.</p><p>We need to do everything that we can do to help our successful exporters to expand existing markets and develop others. The salmon industry in Scotland is the third largest in the world, after the industries in Norway and Chile, and the opportunities for expansion are substantial, not least because of the unfortunate outbreaks of ISA in those two countries.</p><p>We must ensure that aquaculture in Scotland comes to be known as the greenest and cleanest in quality. I welcome the Government's strategic objectives of promoting</p><p class=\"indent\">\"high standards of husbandry and biosecurity\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Continual development of control strategies and making best use of available medicines as well as research and development into emerging diseases\".</p><p>There has been a reduction in escapes, but the number remains unacceptably high. The reduction of escapes is of economic benefit not only to the fish farms concerned but to businesses that rely on wild fish stocks, which can be threatened by parasites that are carried by the farmed variety.</p><p>The objective of improved systems for licensing aquaculture developments is also welcome but trickier, and it will obviously exercise the minds of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee members as we take evidence around coastal areas on the Marine (Scotland) Bill. We are already being made well aware of the competing demands on our coastal waters, but the opportunities for expansion in other shellfish and fish farm species, such as mussels, halibut, cod and haddock, must be encouraged. There are <place-holder colnum=\"17783\"/> opportunities for the taking not just in increased fish production but in developing and retaining a skilled and knowledgeable workforce, not to mention the opportunities for scientists, given the large number of scientists supporting and pioneering new efforts in this field, as we saw during our committee's visit to Marine Scotland earlier this week.</p><p>Like Peter Peacock, I want to raise with the minister the issue of finance, as well as the concerns on trade credit insurance that were raised by exhibitors at the Brussels seafood exhibition, given that companies in the middle east and elsewhere default on their payments for products that are sent to them. Our exporters simply cannot bear such non-payment.</p><p>The opportunities for the aquaculture industry are there to be harnessed.

The process began for the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee away back in September 2007, when the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into flooding and flood management. It was undertaken in the knowledge that the Government intended to introduce a bill. Such pre-legislative scrutiny proved very valuable, as it allowed the committee to feed its thinking on the best approach to flood risk management into the Government's work at a very early stage. As a result, the bill as introduced to Parliament reflected a number of the committee inquiry's recommendations.</p><p>In addition, the issues and associated inquiry recommendations that the Government did not <place-holder colnum=\"17386\"/> endorse served as a useful starting point for scrutiny of the bill.</p><p>In its stage 1 report, the committee highlighted concerns, for example about resources and the shortage of specialist staff to implement the bill's provisions. Given the skills that we require in this country, youngsters might consider becoming water engineers. The committee also noted that there is uncertainty about the funding that will be provided to local authorities and Scottish Water to implement the legislation, and expressed concern about the conflict between SEPA's role in implementation and its priorities as an environmental regulator.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government has responded positively to a large number of the committee's recommendations. I am also pleased that points to which the Government did not see fit to agree were doggedly pursued to the end of stage 3. I am glad that the committee has ensured that flood risk will be managed sustainably and that existing natural features, such as wetlands, will be used to manage flood risk, wherever that is possible.</p><p>The committee's recommendation that clear strategic priorities be derived from the risk assessment process and be made publicly available has also been adopted. We have also received assurances that local authority development and flood risk management planning processes should prevent developments in areas that are subject to significant flooding. The need for more detail on how local authorities can recover expenses or fine landowners who do not maintain watercourses has been addressed, as has the need for more detail on how landowners can be compensated for loss of earnings if their land is required for flood prevention work.</p><p>We have a good bill.

I cannot praise enough the positive behaviour team in the Scottish Government, who travel around the country offering advice and support. It is not just <place-holder colnum=\"17167\"/> public authorities that are working on the issue; I congratulate UNICEF UK and Bruce Wilkinson on introducing the rights respecting school initiative, through which children learn that they have rights but also responsibilities to ensure that those rights are respected. The majority of primary schools in Fife are adopting that initiative and are seeing real improvements in behaviour. Schools that have embraced positive behaviour, whether through the rights respecting school model, restorative practice, being cool in school or other methods, are experiencing a calmer, more positive atmosphere, which is more conducive to learning, and, crucially, teachers are reporting that they are much less stressed.</p><p>There is no denying that there is some way to go. It is much easier to introduce positive behaviour from day one of a child's school life, but the fact that it is being introduced in secondary schools shows that it can be introduced at a later stage.</p><p>If Inshes primary school in Inverness, which welcomes children with learning difficulties, can manage without any exclusions, other schools can do so, too.</p><p>We all acknowledge that there will be a very small number of disturbed children who might not respond. Prison governors tell us that as long as there are drugs in our communities, there are likely to be drugs in our prisons. In the same way, as Johann Lamont articulated thoughtfully, as long as children's family members are carrying knives on our streets, there remains the possibility that knives will enter our schools. In such cases, the child concerned must be assessed and treated individually by a number of agencies to determine the best way to deal with their offending behaviour.</p><p>Nothing should be ruled out. Headteachers can and should use exclusion, but they must consult local authorities, so that children are not just left to roam the streets and create further mayhem during their exclusion. Removal to a different setting might work in some cases, but, often, it leads to even more resentment and frustration when the individual is removed from their family and friends, and it does not lead to long-term behavioural change. Borstal regimes in modern buildings that are provided by private companies that charge the local authority huge sums are not necessarily the panacea for all ills in this area.</p><p>We must always focus on the child's needs and welfare.

I stress that I joined the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee just as it was finishing its report, so I will highlight the committee's work on certain sections of the bill. I am sure that other members of the committee and the Minister for Environment will go into much more detail than I will.</p><p>The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee specifically requested that it be appointed as a secondary committee to scrutinise the provisions that fall within its remit&#8212;the forestry, waste reduction and recycling, and muirburn provisions. On behalf of the committee, I thank all those who provided oral and written evidence and the clerks for their hard work.</p><p>I will start with muirburn, which was the least contentious issue. Muirburn is important in regenerating hill and moorland habitats, but the issue did not evoke a great number of responses, except on the dates and lengths of periods allowed for burning. I welcome the cabinet secretary's undertaking to consult stakeholders fully on the issue, and we will keep a close eye on the amendments that the Government lodges on the matter at stage 2 On waste, the committee is aware that the bill's provisions on waste reduction and recycling are enabling in nature because the Government does not propose to introduce secondary legislation to enforce them if the same ends can be achieved through voluntary measures. The committee appreciated the logic of that approach but, given the importance of the provisions, we think that any such secondary legislation should be subject to the super-affirmative procedure, which would allow additional time for scrutiny of its contents, including in draft form.</p><p>Other issues stemmed from the evidence that the committee heard and need to be addressed to progress the central aim of reducing, reusing and recycling waste. They include the urgent need to focus on reducing commercial and industrial waste that is sent to landfill; the need to address the lack of infrastructure that is currently available to implement the policy intentions in the bill; and the need to consider matters that the Environment and Rural Development Committee raised in session 2 to do with the impact, including the environmental impact, of sellers of goods charging for the supply of carrier bags.</p><p>The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee also considered the opportunities that the current international market conditions could present for Scotland to develop waste recycling industries; the need to ensure that measures are undertaken in accordance with both the Government's definition of recycling and the waste hierarchy that is set out <place-holder colnum=\"17107\"/> in the waste framework directive; and, in order to inform public decision making, the need for the Government to endorse one method of measuring carbon footprints and to establish criteria that are based on it that reflect which waste reuse and recycling practice is the most sustainable.</p><p>On the more contentious issue of forestry, we all know&#8212;the Minister for Environment in particular&#8212;that the submissions that were received on the proposal to lease a percentage of Forestry Commission land either opposed that proposal or raised substantial issues with it. On the basis of the weight of the opposition to the proposal and issues with the adequacy of the consultation process, the committee recommended that the Government should not progress the proposal. As members might appreciate, the committee therefore welcomes the Government's announcement that it will not progress the proposal. Assuming that this is still the Government's intention, the bill will be amended at stage 2 so that the provisions in section 47 are restricted to purely enabling joint ventures.</p><p>All the written submissions supported the idea of the Forestry Commission entering into joint ventures with private companies for the development of sustainable energy projects, such as wind farms and hydroelectric infrastructure projects. Evidence to the committee suggested that such joint ventures have the potential to generate considerable income, although members are aware that there are practical barriers to generating income quickly because of the time taken to receive planning permission and clearance from environmental regulators for proposals such as wind farm projects. Given the notable support for the joint venture proposal from stakeholders, the committee recommended that the Government should explore the full potential of joint ventures, including whether support should be provided for their establishment.</p><p>The committee's report notes that, in the response to the Government's consultation on the proposals, there was widespread support for the idea of community leasing. Although provisions on that would not sit easily in the bill, as community leasing would have social benefits that are unrelated to mitigating climate change, the committee recommended</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the Scottish Government incorporates provisions to allow for community leasing in future legislation.\"</p><p>That would meet the call from members that we must encourage members of the public to buy into the climate change debate.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Patrick Harvie is convener of the lead committee   on the bill; I speak as convener of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, which considered parts of the bill.

Three things spring to mind: seduction, self-indulgence and self-delusion. Those terms can be attributed to UK Government ministers as well as to City bankers. We see the unedifying spectacle of Gordon Brown gallivanting round the globe, trying to find out what other countries are doing to <place-holder colnum=\"16311\"/> help their economies. At home, the predictions just go from bad to worse.</p><p>No one knows how long the economic downturn will last, but it is certain that the pain from it will be felt for a very long time and that many things will never be the same again&#8212;nor indeed should they be. To say that this Government is not doing all that it can is just plain wrong, and the fact that some Opposition speakers have just had a moan, offering few constructive suggestions, is galling, to say the least, when the issue is so important. The public are suffering more and more. In a time of crisis, they expect their politicians to pull together rather than to be at one another's throats.</p><p>The Government is already doing much of what John Park asked for in his speech. The suggestion that we go back to past methods of finance, such as public-private partnerships and the private finance initiative, is breathtaking. Infrastructure investment is going ahead with capital spend and traditional borrowing. Just in the past few days, the UK Government had to spend &#163;2 billion of taxpayers' money to prop up PFI projects. That is a humiliating bailout.

The finances of Scotland are well protected and wisely spent by John Swinney. He never forgets that he is entrusted to spend people's hard-earned taxes wisely and for their benefit, rather than to squander the money because it is only taxpayers' money and there is more where it came from. We all know that it is not true any more that there is more where that money came from, because receipts from income tax and corporation tax are falling dramatically. We do not know whether quantitative easing will work, but early indications show that it is not that popular.</p><p>I press the cabinet secretary to do all he can to protect the hands that feed from the tax and grab of the Treasury. I am talking, of course, about the oil and gas sector. It is still relatively buoyant, but a long-term low oil price might lead some businesses to pull their operations from the North Sea. Successive Westminster Governments have looked on Scotland's oil as a cash cow rather than as a long-term security, as Norway has done. Norway's sovereign oil fund places its Government in a strong position to enact economic stimulus without increases in Government net debt.</p><p>I plead with the cabinet secretary not to let the vital infrastructure projects in the north-east slip. The oil and gas sector and the north-east agricultural base, which provides 14 per cent of the UK's food, need easier access to markets.</p><p>Our citizens will also want to know that part of the recovery will be about having a financial sector that is regulated so that the current situation never happens again.

As Jeremy Purvis helpfully highlighted, given the council's interest in the land, the application might require to be notified to the Scottish ministers, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this particular proposal. However, I am sure that local MSPs will use their good offices with Midlothian Council on behalf of their constituents. I should also say that I am looking forward to appearing with other ministers before the Health and Sport Committee to give evidence on health and physical activity.</p><p>Sportscotland, which is already a statutory consultee on developments that are proposed for playing fields, generally resists such proposals unless the playing fields in question are surplus to requirements or adequate replacement facilities are to be provided. As members have pointed out, Scottish planning policy 11, on open space and physical activity, which was issued by this Government in November 2007, extends sportscotland's role as consultee to a greater range of facilities.</p><p>SPP 11 also introduced a requirement for each local authority to prepare an open space audit and <place-holder colnum=\"14399\"/> strategy for its area to help safeguard existing open spaces and to identify priorities for future development. By involving sportscotland more closely and requiring the preparation of open space strategies, SPP 11 delivers better, not more watered down, planning for playing fields.</p><p>Local authorities should aim to protect and enhance open spaces in their ownership; indeed, SPP 11 applies to school playing fields and to all other publicly owned open spaces. If an open space strategy demonstrates that a playing field is required to meet a continuing need, whether for school or community use, it should be protected in the development plan. Such an approach should ensure that redevelopment does not take place unless open space is shown to be surplus to requirements or replacement facilities are to be provided.</p><p>Although there is no set list of statutory consultees for development plans, changes that we are making to the planning system mean that planning authorities must prepare participation statements that set out when, how and with whom consultation on their plans will take place. Ministers expect authorities to use participation statements carefully to consider the groups and organisations that need to be involved in their particular plan and the best way to engage with them.</p><p>Each council's open space audit will provide a valuable source of local information on playing fields and their use. We see no merit in establishing a national database; it is much more important that such information is maintained locally, to inform the local decision-making process, and is accessible to local individuals and community groups.</p><p>However, sportscotland produces an annual monitoring report on planning applications that affect playing fields. It is encouraging to note that, over the past four years, the number of planning applications that affect playing fields has consistently fallen&#8212;from 118 in 2005 to 50 in 2008. As Ken Macintosh most helpfully highlighted, the most recent report shows that, since 1996, there has across the whole of Scotland been a net loss of 126 pitches, mostly the mineral ones on which we used to scrape our knees and which are now considered unsuitable for modern use.</p><p>Although, since 1996, 267 mineral and 55 grass pitches have been lost, 196 modern synthetic grass pitches have been installed. That type of pitch gives a clean and attractive playing surface which, as it can be used all year round in all weather conditions&#8212;which is very important in Scotland&#8212;is ideal for both school and community use. To put that figure in context, I point out that the total number of pitches in Scotland is <place-holder colnum=\"14400\"/> estimated at 5,900. As Ken Macintosh made clear, the reduction has therefore been very small&#8212;and investment in the upgrading of existing pitches and in the provision of new pitches is improving the quality of sports facilities and increasing their playing capacity, particularly in schools.</p><p>We are working with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and local authorities on the development of a new school estate strategy, which will be published in the spring. I am confident that that strategy will reflect the commitment of the Government and authorities to creating a school estate that supports the needs of the whole community. As Jamie McGrigor said, it is important that communities take ownership&#8212;in its widest sense&#8212;of the open spaces in their communities.<place-holder time=\"17:35:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:35.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14622300", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cuiken Primary School Playing Field"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this evening's debate, which gives me an opportunity to emphasise the Government's commitment to prevent the loss or reduction of school playing fields and facilities where no equivalent or improved facilities are provided, and our commitment to protect green spaces for sport and informal activity, particularly in disadvantaged communities.

That supports the Government's thinking, as set out in our economic strategy, that tourism is a key sector for sustainable economic growth.</p><p>In holding its inquiry, the committee increased attention on the main tourism issues and on how the industry can work to achieve the shared <place-holder colnum=\"11021\"/> ambition of a 50 per cent growth in revenues. The Government was impressed by the inquiry's depth and by the professional way in which it was conducted. We welcome the input from representatives of the industry and the public sector, and the work of the committee, its clerks and its advisers in drawing that together.</p><p>As members know, the Government's response to the committee's report was published last week. I am sure that many members have studied it, but I will reaffirm its main points. It is pleasing that much of the committee's report was positive about tourism and that the Government agreed with the vast majority of recommendations. I am sure that that is a sign that tourism in Scotland is in generally good shape and that all parties are working well together. I contrast that with the recent equivalent committee report on tourism at Westminster, which contained significant criticism of the United Kingdom Government and its tourism policies.</p><p>We agreed that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee correctly identified the key issues in its report. We were pleased that the committee concluded that the 50 per cent growth ambition should be retained. That target, which was established after much discussion and was adopted by the industry, is a useful focus for partnership working throughout the industry and between the private and public sectors. However, it would be unrealistic to ignore the prevailing economic circumstances, which differ from those when the ambition was adopted. Many in the industry have questioned the wisdom of having the target when they feel that tourism must run hard to stand still or survive.</p><p>Achieving the ambition should be a longer-term plan, even though it is clear that short-term growth might be unfeasible in the current climate. It is worth noting that VisitScotland has already upweighted its marketing of Scotland in UK markets by bringing forward some &#163;1.5 million of marketing spend. Many members might recently have seen television adverts encouraging everyone to visit Scotland and its different parts.</p><p>The work on homecoming Scotland 2009 will help to boost tourism. There is no doubt that we can make 2009 a special year for Scots and for those who love Scotland. The programme of events is growing and the word is spreading. We expect to show the world that we can throw a great party, and we expect many visitors to come to join in. The year will also provide an opportunity to show the world what Scotland is made of.</p><p>We agree that it is important for the public sector agencies that support tourism to face in the same direction and work together closely. We will consider whether further alignment is necessary, <place-holder colnum=\"11022\"/> in the first instance through more effective joint working.</p><p>I will not repeat everything that the Government said in its response, but I will talk about the skills issues, which Iain Smith correctly identified are important. The committee expressed concern about the volume and relevance of the qualifications that are on offer to the hospitality industry in Scotland. Our skills strategy makes it clear that the skills that individuals learn must be the skills that employers want. Providers of qualifications need to engage employers properly in the development and design of qualifications at all levels, but some qualifications have not benefited from such engagement.</p><p>It is unfortunate that some evidence to the committee on qualifications was inaccurate. The committee was told that more than 4,000 qualifications are on offer to the tourism industry, but that figure was later revised to 400. That is still incorrect&#8212;the figure is likely to be closer to 100, if we are talking about Scottish Qualifications Authority qualifications and higher education courses.</p><p>People 1<sup>st</sup>'s sector qualifications strategy acknowledges that much more progress has been made in Scotland than in England on rationalising qualifications in the industry. It states that the completion rate for apprenticeships in the sector is considerably higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK and that it intends to learn from the Scottish system to improve the performance of apprenticeships in other countries.</p><p>Employers are in a strong position to influence SQA provision, given that the agency now involves sector skills councils in the design, development and validation of its qualifications.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14005179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I put on record again the Government's welcome for the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee's identification of tourism as an important industry for Scotland.

For example, they can offer successful work experience and industry placements, and treat school pupils who have weekend and evening jobs as potential long-term recruits to the industry.</p><p>There are good examples of schools, colleges and universities working closely with the hospitality industry. For example, not far from here, the HBOS museum on the Mound is working in partnership with the Royal high school on an excellence in education through business links programme. Such partnerships help young people to become more aware of the tourism industry. The Giuliano's on the Shore restaurant has worked with Pilrig Park school to help all first to third-year secondary students to design and make their own pizza&#8212;a fun challenge from a real employer and one that relates to the world of work. We need more such examples.</p><p>Young people in Scotland are positive about their country. Such experiences with employers build on that confidence and often translate into young people entering an industry that they had not previously considered. However, such examples are the exception rather than the norm. More employers need to engage with schools, colleges and universities to bring industry relevance into the education setting.</p><p>The committee concluded that Scotland should establish a small number of dedicated hotel schools along the lines of those in Switzerland. Leading figures in the industry are developing a proposal for such a centre of excellence. I welcome this excellent example of an employer-led and industry-funded initiative to tackle our skills needs.</p><p>North Highland College, in partnership with other colleges and the UHI Millennium Institute, is in the process of establishing a hotel training school in Dornoch to provide the half a million people in northern Scotland with access to university-level courses. The proposed centre for hospitality and tourism will be a training facility that will be run as a fully operational hotel, occupying the refurbished Burghfield house hotel. The college will lead a new degree programme in tourism and hospitality management and offer skills-based qualifications in areas such as front of house. Good work is being done in colleges.<place-holder colnum=\"11024\"/></p><p>I repeat that the Government places importance on supporting the tourism industry in achieving the shared ambition for growth. We welcome the committee's report and its general support for the policies that are already being followed. I look forward to hearing members' views on this important issue.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14005179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I must make progress.

A debate on Holocaust education in Scotland provides an opportunity for the Parliament to reflect on the horrors of that period in history and to consider our role in ensuring that, through education, it never happens again.</p><p>As Jackson Carlaw said, our Jewish communities have lived here for many years&#8212;they were one of Scotland's first immigrant communities. Their contribution to our national life has been significant; they are, indeed, one of the threads in the tartan of Scottish society.</p><p>Scotland's commitment to recognise all people as equals was demonstrated as long ago as 1320, when it was woven into the declaration of Arbroath, which said that, regardless of race or religion,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is neither weighing nor distinction of Jew and Greek, Scotsman or Englishman\".</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises the distinctive character and history of our Jewish community. We understand the paramount importance for all the people of Scotland of commemorating the Holocaust.</p><p>Of course it is important to remember the atrocities that Europe's Jewish communities experienced during the terrible period that we now refer to as the Holocaust but, as several members have mentioned, other communities also suffered, and it is important that that, too, is remembered. Disabled people, Gypsies, and members of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities lost their lives in large numbers, and our Holocaust memorial day commemorations in Scotland have always remembered them, too.</p><p>We also remember other holocausts and genocides of more recent times, such as those in Bosnia and Rwanda. Disturbingly, even the unbelievable horror of the Holocaust was not enough to stop people again trying to eliminate an entire community or ethnic group. There can be no stronger message about why we must remember and why we must educate young people on the need to ensure that such events never happen again.</p><p>The visits to Auschwitz-Birkenau that are organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust, to which I have been speaking, are one of a number of excellent opportunities that are provided for young people to learn about the Holocaust. I would like to make it clear that this Government has certainly not refused funding for such school visits. On the contrary, we have provided record funding and freed up local authority budgets for <place-holder colnum=\"9504\"/> education. As Jackson Carlaw and others have said, the United Kingdom announcement did not generate additional funding for Scotland at the time; the Treasury has confirmed that. Furthermore, the previous Scottish Administration did not provide schools with any funding for visits to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

It is schools' prerogative to decide the best way for their pupils to learn about the Holocaust. Many more children and young people visit concentration camps through other means that schools promote. Together with the Holocaust Educational Trust visits, those visits are valuable. As most members have said, such visits are life changing.</p><p>In addition to supporting Holocaust memorial day every year since 2001 and making a commitment to support a national commemoration day in January 2009, the Scottish Government has provided school resources for Holocaust education and has funded the production of \"Testimony\"&#8212;an exhibition about the Holocaust that provides a powerful and emotive experience and which includes personal testimonies of Scotland's survivors. \"Testimony\" can be used in schools or in other locations such as community centres and libraries to raise awareness about the Holocaust's reality.</p><p>The Scottish Government was happy to confirm the previous Administration's commitment to support a permanent Holocaust museum, to which the motion refers.

We will obviously wish to consider any new proposal carefully.</p><p>Our work on commemorating the Holocaust is part of our wider work to tackle racism, religious intolerance and all forms of discrimination, as John Park said.

We have announced changes to the modern apprenticeship programme: we increased the number of individuals undertaking engineering and construction-related MAs by 1,000 and introduced a new life science MA and the opportunity to develop level 2 MAs, which was welcomed by the food and drink industry, among others.</p><p>In order to provide Skills Development Scotland with the space that it needs to deliver the universally endorsed skills strategy, we are directing all new support for adult MAs to the engineering and construction-related sectors only. We did that to ensure that Skills Development Scotland was not tied into four-year contracts, which would reduce our ability to deliver real change now. Therefore, some MAs that we know did not deliver value for money will not be supported, and we have directed the sector skills councils and Skills Development Scotland to scope out over the next year a fuller and more relevant range of skills interventions that employers actually need. This is a real opportunity, and a first step towards a demand-led system.</p><p>Setting volume-based targets, enshrining entitlements in legislation and forcing employers and individuals into skills interventions such as modern apprenticeships is not the answer. We believe that we have struck the right balance between responding to the needs of employers and initiating substantial changes to our learning infrastructure to accommodate the dramatic change that has been universally welcomed.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-1951.3, to leave out from \"the Scottish Government's skills strategy\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"under the previous administration, Scotland's growth rate and productivity levels lagged behind the United Kingdom and believes that this indicates that a new approach to skills and the economy is necessary; notes the widespread business and industry support for the Scottish Government's skills strategy and believes that government's role is to respond to demand from employers, to improve skills utilisation and support individuals' skills development.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13706403", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I must continue.

In order to achieve that aim, our education system needs to provide them with knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland's place in it&#8212;which is a thread that runs through the curriculum for excellence for all young people at all stages of their learning.</p><p>We must ensure that our young people understand, and can respond to, the challenges that are presented by globalisation. If the curriculum is to be excellent, it must incorporate an international perspective; if it does not, our society and economy will be poorer. The Government is, therefore, committed to ensuring that an international education is part of the experience for young people in all our schools.</p><p>We are taking action on three main fronts. First, we are changing learning and teaching. International education is not an add-on, and the curriculum for excellence is the ideal vehicle to deliver international education in schools and to equip young people with a modern and enterprising Scottish world view. The experiences and outcomes that are currently the subject of engagement and trialling in schools have been written such that they will provide ample opportunity for learning and teaching from an international perspective.

It is not just about learning modern languages in a traditional sense although, as our commitment to the introduction of a Scottish baccalaureate in languages demonstrates, we want young Scottish people to be ambitious in that regard. If we do not prepare our young people to cope with linguistic diversity, they will be at a disadvantage if they want to make the positive transition to working in the international arena. I hope that the new curriculum will enthuse young people and teachers alike to explore the riches of languages and to use them as a tool to understand the world better.</p><p>On the reference in the Liberal Democrats' amendment to a national languages strategy, I hope that they see that language learning will be embedded as an outcome of the languages strategy. It will be up to schools to decide how best to develop teaching of languages. Last Friday, I attended the launch of the report on the effective provision of pre-school education project at Walker Road primary school in Torry. The lessons that have been learned from that project will be applied throughout Scotland.</p><p>Secondly, we are simplifying the institutional and policy landscape. We want to ensure that coherent and concise advice is provided to schools and teachers, instead of schools receiving myriad competing messages from different bodies, which causes confusion. We are making explicit the linkages between international education, education for sustainable development, citizenship and modern languages.</p><p>Thirdly, we want to see partnership working. Many bodies are involved in education: we want to ensure that they work together in partnership. The Government has charged Learning and Teaching Scotland with taking the lead on that.

He will know that the curriculum in Scotland is not prescribed, as it is down south. It is the responsibility of each and every local authority and school to consider how study opportunities such as a visit to Auschwitz concentration camp&#8212;to which the Labour amendment refers&#8212;might contribute to meeting the agreed national outcomes. A number of schools have visited Auschwitz; last year, I was invited to join one such trip, but was unfortunately asked too late in the day and had other commitments. However, I have committed to going on any further trip to Auschwitz with school pupils that might be arranged.</p><p>No one can doubt the importance of China in today's world and I am pleased to say that Learning and Teaching Scotland recently signed an agreement with Hanban, the Office of Chinese Language Council International, which includes the setting up of eight Confucius classrooms or hubs, serving 14 local authorities.

They have chosen to concentrate on music, art and English as those are subjects in which both schools have an interest, and it means that they do not rely too heavily on written communication.</p><p>Fintry primary school in Stirling has established a school link with the Gambia, and uses cross-curricular learning to enrich learning and teaching. When asked the difference between us and the African children, a primary 7 pupil responded that African children were</p><p class=\"indent\">\"rich in happiness but poor in money, whereas we are rich in money but poor in happiness.\"</p><p>I am sure that members are aware of many other inspiring examples of links and international education in schools in their constituencies. However, it is essential that that happens in all our schools; all young people deserve those opportunities, not just some of them. As Jack McConnell indicated, Scotland has prominent links with Malawi, and many Scottish schools&#8212;more than were expected&#8212;have taken up the challenge to link with schools in Malawi.</p><p>The world in which our young people are growing up is very different from the world when we were at school. It is essential that young people have opportunities to develop an international perspective in their education and to develop the cultural insight, confidence and linguistic skills that will help them to understand and respect other peoples, and to seize opportunities in a rapidly changing world.</p><p>We strongly believe that the curriculum for excellence is the ideal vehicle to enable teachers to use international education to enrich young people's learning. Pupils are inspired and interested in the issues: they are regarded as enjoyable, different, stimulating and cool. If they are engaged, they will be more likely to prosper and become the effective contributors, responsible citizens, confident individuals and successful learners that we want them to be.</p><p>We need that if we are to achieve a smarter Scotland.

That is how we <place-holder colnum=\"7101\"/> will succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, when the mark of a successful country is not just the productivity of its labour but the capacity of its people to use and build on their skills for learning, life and work.</p><p>As members said, we debated matters that are close to the heart of the curriculum for excellence in the Parliament when we discussed the OECD review of Scottish education and the teaching of history. The purpose of today's debate was not to repeat what was said in other debates or to rehearse the detail that was provided during discussions in the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee; it was to consider and discuss some of the challenges that are associated with bringing an aspirational programme of reform to fruition. I thank the members who highlighted some of those challenges. We reflected on our ambitions for Scottish education and for Scotland as a learning nation that is confident, productive and visibly successful. I am grateful to all members for their constructive contributions to the debate.</p><p>I agree with Ken Macintosh that the pace of implementation of the curriculum for excellence was slower in the run-up to the election. I assure him that Fiona Hyslop and I have picked up the baton and are running with it. We have a campaigning role in engaging as many stakeholders as possible in the curriculum for excellence. Teachers are best placed to engage pupils and parents and have an important role in that regard. As the cabinet secretary said, by involving stakeholders, politicians of all parties can have a campaigning role.</p><p>We will take on board Mary Mulligan's point about NGOs perhaps not feeling included in the process. However, the voluntary sector has been involved through the pupil inclusion network Scotland, so it has had a stake in the development of the framework for the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>It is a shame that David Whitton was not in the chamber for the whole debate. If he had been, he would have noted that we have certainly upped the pace in implementing the curriculum for excellence. Yesterday, I was at a conference at which Professor Katherine Weare said that it is important that change is not implemented too quickly because we must keep all the stakeholders on board&#8212;especially parents, who are perhaps not as up to speed as the rest of us.</p><p>I thank Elizabeth Smith for her positive speech.

By the time pupils reach S5 and S6, they are at the stage in their learning when they must be more aware of the need for personalised study and learning. With tools such as the glow project, videoconferencing and more innovative ways of studying, pupils should be able to access the range of subjects that they require for further education.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell and others mentioned parity of esteem.

I have said that I will meet Robin Harper, Elizabeth Smith and Jeremy Purvis to update them on progress.</p><p>I note that Hugh Henry is no longer in the chamber. It is unfortunate that he, as a former minister, did not take the opportunity to say where he saw the curriculum for excellence going and where he thinks that we have gone wrong. I note that he berated local authorities for taking decisions at a local level with regard to their education provision.</p><p>I assure Marlyn Glen that the cabinet secretary and I meet the unions regularly.

I, too, welcome those in the public gallery who have come to hear me emphasise the Government's support for rural schools and our commitment to safeguard them and the communities that they serve.</p><p>I should declare an interest. At one time, I was a school board chair. The neighbouring school was due to close, with the support of parents, who wanted their children to come to the school whose board I chaired. Although the other school was closed as a primary school, it was retained as a nursery school. Both schools are now outstanding successes. The case demonstrates that, when the local authority consults and engages with the community, as Jamie Stone described, lateral thinking can produce good solutions.</p><p>We whole-heartedly agree with the assertion in the motion that rural schools can provide educational and social benefits to pupils. We also believe that there is no reason why small schools cannot deliver the curriculum for excellence, which will help children and young people to develop as successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors. We want to provide a rich and full curriculum that draws on best practice from across the country and, indeed, across the world. The issue is not the size or location of a school or how it is organised.</p><p>We also recognise how important a rural school can be as a hub for community activities. There is no doubt that rural schools can play a key role in ensuring that small communities remain viable. Access to local services is vital for all, but for many small, fragile, rural communities the school may be the key to their thriving and being sustainable. I agree with John Farquhar Munro that the closure of schools is an emotional issue.</p><p>On the motion's reference to East Ayrshire Council's proposals, Ms Jamieson knows that it would be inappropriate for me to comment, given the potential for cases to be referred to ministers. The same applies to the case that Mr Gibson mentioned. However, I am aware that East Ayrshire Council's consultation is now closed and that the council will consider its decision on the future of the schools very soon. I understand that the council will make its decision on 9 March rather than on the earlier date that was proposed. The council has lengthened the time so that it can consider carefully the volume of responses that it has received.</p><p>As Willie Coffey reminded us, the closure proposals were initiated under the previous Labour council. In addition, the council is acting under <place-holder colnum=\"6569\"/> guidance that was introduced by the then Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock. As Mr Gibson said, that guidance has been reinforced by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p><p>On the general point, I welcome the support for rural schools that members have expressed but I find it surprising to hear such support coming from some quarters, given the previous Government's record. For example, in the course of the previous two parliamentary sessions, the number of primary schools in Scotland dropped by 125. More than 50 primary schools were closed in rural areas, and of the 19 cases that were referred to ministers, consent was granted in every case.</p><p>By contrast, in the short life of this Government, we have taken action to protect rural schools and to improve the process for all closures. As I said, when the cabinet secretary wrote to all authorities in October, she reminded them of good practice and stressed the importance of genuine consultation and of explaining the reasons for proposing a school's closure.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399698", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Schools (Closure)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Cathy Jamieson for initiating this important debate and thank all members who have spoken this evening.

It is worth pausing to note that those were the first-ever cases in which ministers had refused consent. That is not to say that there will not be cases in future in which closure is the correct decision.</p><p>In all the recent cases, a consideration that shaped our thinking was how to meet our commitment to introduce a presumption against the closure of rural schools and to tighten the regulations on all school closures. We intend to publish proposals for consultation at the end of March. Although I cannot comment on the specifics of the proposals, I can say that they will be detailed, comprehensive and the result of much deliberation and consideration.</p><p>I welcome the support that Cathy Jamieson is now expressing for safeguarding rural schools.

John Park also made points about taking forward the skills strategy, literacy and numeracy. I really do not think that the debate on this LCM is the time to debate such issues. However, I say to him that Scotland is not lagging behind in terms of the number of modern apprenticeships per population.</p><p>Liz Smith raised issues of data security. This Government takes data security extremely seriously. Although there is absolutely no guarantee that there will be no data security problems, various precautions are taken to minimise the risk of them. The data will not identify any individual and will be confined to people working in this area of data collection and statistical analysis.</p><p>Liz Smith and Jeremy Purvis mentioned loopholes. As I said in committee, civil servants are having discussions with officials in England about that. If a young person is resident in England but attends school in Scotland, the proposed duty will affect them, irrespective of where they go to school&#8212;it is all about the country of residence. If a young person is resident in Scotland but their parents live in England, the young person, as a resident of Scotland, will not be covered by the legislation. If they are employed in England but resident in Scotland, they will not be covered by the legislation, but their employer may be covered. Given that the legislation is not due to come into force until 2013 and 2015, the Government will continue to have discussions about such issues with our counterparts.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398485", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education and Skills Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will first address some of the comments from members, whom I thank for their contributions.

The LCM deals only with the data-sharing aspects of the bill.

This Government agrees that outdoor learning has an important role to play in the development of our children and young people. As a former teacher, I remember my time under canvas in the peak district. Like Jim Hume, I had the benefit of a rural, farming background.</p><p>As Elizabeth Smith knows, one of the outcomes in the concordat with local authorities is that our young people should be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. Achieving that outcome is important in its own right and it will make a major contribution to the other outcomes. We need every young person to have those qualities and to develop them to their full potential. As Robin Harper made plain, outdoor learning in its widest sense has a clear contribution to make to that national outcome in helping to engage young people at risk of negative outcomes and harnessing Scotland's natural resources to broaden their horizons.</p><p>As Elizabeth Smith said, there are examples of good work in Perth and Kinross. She mentioned Crieff high school and Roseanna Cunningham mentioned Perth high school, which has developed a successful programme of outdoor activities, on which it is to be congratulated.</p><p>As a parent, I too have seen at first hand the benefits of taking young people out of their normal environment for a residential experience. They come back walking that bit taller, having expanded their horizons, developed their confidence and formed more positive relationships with not only their fellow pupils but their teachers, which can only be a good thing when they get back into the classroom.</p><p>Outdoor learning in which pupils experience enjoyment, support and challenge, with clear links to the curriculum, is beneficial in helping young people to learn about the environment and promotes cross-curricular learning and physical activity. The vital element for pupils is to link the outdoor experience to their school work, so that they can take back the new skills they have discovered and apply them in their learning.</p><p>Outdoor learning is not just something that is done in five special days of schooling; it should be part of where and how children and young people <place-holder colnum=\"5830\"/> learn on a day-to-day basis. That view is supported by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, which has emphasised the value of well-planned outdoor education experiences. It has noted that the best examples are a combination of school-based and residential programmes that progressively develop pupils' experience.</p><p>The Scottish Government is providing leadership and direction. Our curriculum for excellence guidance makes it clear that the outdoor learning environment offers motivating, exciting, different and relevant activities from pre-school years, to which Mary Mulligan and Robert Brown referred, through to college.</p><p>Local authorities and teachers are best placed to decide how to deliver the benefits of outdoor learning in ways that meet their local circumstances and which contribute to our national outcomes. For example, in my constituency of North East Scotland, Banff and Buchan College works with local schools to develop a range of children's skills in the local wooded environment, which is much like what happens in Mr Hume's constituency. Primary 7s use band-saws, which shows that Health and Safety Executive concerns can be addressed. Teachers and headteachers have to be more focused on transitions, of which vocational and outdoor education forms a part.</p><p>We know that there is wide variety in the duration and type of outdoor learning opportunities that are provided by schools and that a number of barriers can contribute to the problem. Those include timetabling, staff competence and confidence and differing views on the benefits of outdoor learning.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence sends a clear signal about the value of outdoor learning, but there is work to be done to develop teachers' skills and encourage them to use the outdoors as an extension of the classroom. The flipside of that is that outdoor education specialists must understand the demands of our new curriculum, including the development of the four capacities and the focus on skills, and ensure that they tailor experiences to meet those demands.</p><p>As many members have said, Scotland has a wealth of outdoor education providers. We need to explore ways of supporting them to form better partnerships at national, local authority, community planning and school community level, for the benefit of our children and young people. Margo Macdonald made interesting points about how community planning and community partnerships could do much more in that area. Already, the money that is being made available as a result of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is being used to provide opportunities for young <place-holder colnum=\"5831\"/> people who are in need of more choices and chances.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Outdoor Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Elizabeth Smith for securing this important debate and I thank all the members who have taken part in it.

Just two weeks ago, the Parliament debated the expert analysis of Scottish education that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published recently. The OECD's report commended the on-going reform and modernisation of the Scottish curriculum, through the curriculum for excellence. That is the context of the motion that we have brought to the Parliament.</p><p>I will say a few words about the curriculum for excellence, because we are here not only to discuss the teaching of history&#8212;and social studies more broadly&#8212;in our schools, but to give some thought to what it is about education that can make this country and its people confident, skilled and successful. People are Scotland's powerhouse. For Scotland to be all that it can be, all our people need to develop skills in the widest sense, so that they can fulfil their potential. By increasing sustainable economic growth, we can create a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish. We need a smarter Scotland to support the Government's overarching purpose of achieving sustainable economic growth and its other strategic objectives: a wealthier and fairer, healthier, safer and stronger, and greener Scotland.</p><p>Our concordat with local government includes 15 outcomes that characterise the kind of country that we want to build. One of those outcomes is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.\"</p><p>That is the language of the curriculum for excellence. It is a mark of the Government's support and respect for the ambitions of that programme of reform that its key goals are incorporated within the concordat.</p><p>Achieving the outcome that I have mentioned is <place-holder colnum=\"5586\"/> important in its own right, but doing so will also be a major contributing factor to achieving the other outcomes. Through the national indicator relating to increasing the proportion of school leavers in sustained and positive destinations, we are sending a strong message about what we think is important. The focus is therefore rightly on the outcome and what happens to young people beyond school. To achieve what we want, we need every young person to develop the four capacities to their full potential.</p><p>There is, of course, much in Scottish education that we can be proud of, as the OECD found, but it is unacceptable that our well-resourced and well-regarded education system does not make the difference for all our children, particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. As a country, we must maximise the economic potential of all our citizens. As a caring society, we must ensure that we get things right for every child. As the OECD report noted, with our modern economy, we must recognise the importance of higher-order cognitive, organisational and communication skills in our young people.</p><p>Our aim is to ensure that young people have skills for learning, skills for work and skills for life. That means that there must be a coherent curriculum from three to 18; a focus on outcomes; more vocational opportunities; a focus on literacy and numeracy at every stage; appropriate stretching and pacing for every child; and teachers working together to make coherent sense of what each child is being taught.</p><p>The Government is fully committed to the curriculum for excellence programme as the means of achieving those aims; indeed, the Scottish National Party was the only party that made a specific commitment to the curriculum for excellence in its manifesto. The curriculum for excellence encourages and challenges teachers to think about and develop their teaching, so that it is as good as it can be. That is for teachers and schools to do; we are not talking about a centralised or top-down initiative.</p><p>To do such things effectively, teachers need support and challenges from everybody concerned, including parents, employers, people in further and higher education, local authorities, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education and the Scottish Government. We want every school and teacher to examine critically their teaching and planning, explicitly for the purpose of developing and improving.</p><p>The role of local and national Government is to create the conditions that will allow that to happen. The Scottish Government and local authorities can provide tools to help. We are revising the guidance on the framework within which the curriculum can be organised to allow space for innovation and a <place-holder colnum=\"5587\"/> focus on all four capacities. We are producing curriculum guidance to update content, focus on outcomes and emphasise the need for every teacher to contribute to the development of skills, particularly literacy and numeracy skills. We are providing guidance on and examples of interdisciplinary projects and studies so that teachers can work together on outcomes and make connections between different areas of young people's learning.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397050", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Curriculum (Scottish History)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to introduce this timely and important debate on ensuring that young people in Scotland develop a proper understanding of Scotland's and their own place in the world, in relation both to what is happening today and to what has happened historically.

We are talking about encouraging young people to reach personal conclusions on different aspects of social studies, such as human and ethical issues in the past, the land use and ecological dilemmas that face us, and political, economic and social issues.

However, we cannot be sure that pupils' engagement with history enables them to understand how Scotland has developed.</p><p>Our goal with the curriculum for excellence is to ensure that all our young people benefit from the best possible teaching across the whole spectrum of curriculum areas. Social studies, as described in the draft guidance issued by Learning and Teaching Scotland last week, offers excellent opportunities for children and young people to focus on the historical, social, geographic, economic and political changes that have shaped Scotland.

My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, referred to our support for the youth sector and I reiterate our commitment to supporting that work.</p><p>This year, through YouthLink Scotland, the Scottish Government has invested &#163;8 million in a year of action, made up of &#163;5 million for the youth work facilities improvement fund, &#163;2.5 million for the youth opportunities fund and &#163;0.5 million for the voluntary organisation support fund. Those funds have had a big impact on the youth work sector by increasing capacity, improving facilities and funding more activities. The youth work facilities improvement fund has provided a massive, one-off, &#163;5 million investment in <place-holder colnum=\"5402\"/> equipment and building repairs to youth work facilities across Scotland.</p><p>We will continue to support youth work directly through the voluntary organisation support fund. That will help national organisations to provide better training and strengthen their capacity. From 2008-09, we will transfer the &#163;2.5 million annual funding for the youth opportunities fund to local authorities so that they can decide how best to meet local needs.</p><p>That is not all. The Scottish Government will also provide approximately &#163;5 million to 34 national voluntary youth organisations through the unified voluntary sector fund for 2007-10, including funding for youth work provision.</p><p>We are also using funds recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to increase opportunities and support a three-year initiative in conjunction with the Scottish Football Association to deliver national networks of three, four and five-a-side football activity, involving up to 9,600 young people per year, and expansion of the soccer one programme to S2 and S3 pupils, which will create up to 1,300 new school-based football teams involving up to 19,500 girls and boys. There will be much more.</p><p>I assure Iain Gray that we will ensure that real emphasis and focus are placed on youth work in the consultation process and the distribution of the funds. As Minister for Schools and Skills, I know full well the needs of young people, and I believe, as Iain Gray does, that investment in positive activity for young people as early as possible, as detailed by Malcolm Chisholm, will reduce the numbers that subsequently require more choices and chances. I give the member that guarantee.</p><p>It is simply not right for the Liberal Democrats to say that we do not support and value youth work&#8212;we do. However, we also recognise, support and value the sector's work on the environment and on supporting vulnerable people, with older people and in countless other areas. I totally agree with Robert Brown that young people will certainly be helped by any early intervention projects that the Big Lottery Fund can support.</p><p>By agreeing to this motion, members will not only allow the UK Government to confer additional powers and responsibilities on Scottish ministers but give the Parliament a further opportunity to consider how such powers will be exercised and to influence expenditure priorities through the affirmative resolution procedure.</p><p>The Government is grateful to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for its unanimous support for the motion. I hope that members will agree that when the time comes to consider the amendments, giving the whole sector the chance <place-holder colnum=\"5403\"/> to influence our priorities will prove the best and fairest approach.</p><p>Today's motion represents a good opportunity.

As a measure of the importance that the Scottish Government places on this extremely insightful external analysis of our school education system, we alerted all members of the Scottish Parliament to the report prior to the Christmas recess&#8212;knowing that they would of course wish to read the review from cover to cover during their Christmas and new year holiday.</p><p>I say at the outset that we are grateful to the previous Executive, in particular to the former ministers Peter Peacock and Hugh Henry, for their involvement with the OECD review. Peter Peacock had the insight and good sense to commission the review in the first place, and I acknowledge that it takes some courage to commission such a review. It shows his confidence in the Scottish education system, but I am sure that the Danish experience lay at the back of his mind. The Danes commissioned an OECD review following disappointing results under the programme for international student assessment and that might have given Peter Peacock a bit of worry, but he need not have worried. I thank Hugh Henry for supporting the work and for meeting the OECD review team when they visited Scotland in March.</p><p>Such an expert analysis is consistent with our overall wish to challenge Scotland's education ambitions against the achievements of other countries as a basis for improving performance. I am sure that all of us here aim to uphold Scottish traditions of being open to outside opinion and constructive in our response, and of trying</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To see oursels as others see us!\"</p><p>The OECD's seminal report helps us to do just that.</p><p>The OECD team presented their report to ministers at a special session of the OECD education policy committee in Edinburgh on 11 December. It was a pity that the BBC broke the OECD's embargo and, as a result of not having <place-holder colnum=\"5055\"/> the full report, ran a rather unbalanced story&#8212;but there we go. The special session meeting was a unique event, in that senior education representatives from 14 countries discussed the report and its findings with ministers for the whole day. I am pleased to say that there is much in the review team's report that aligns with this Government's strategic priorities, such as our commitment to tackling education inequalities from the earliest stages, our new relationship with local government, the skills and vocational learning agenda and the reform and modernisation of the curriculum through the curriculum for excellence. I also welcome the positive things that the review says about some of the key strengths of our system. For example,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland is a well-schooled nation by international standards.\"</p><p>I attended a seminar in London last week with education ministers from 60 countries and 180 senior policy advisers. Seventy-two countries were represented, covering 67 per cent of the world's population. As well as coming away with a better understanding of the digital divide, which the seminar was about, I came away knowing that many countries wish to know more about our education system.</p><p>Many participants told me that we do not shout loudly enough about our good system here in Scotland. We should not be surprised, therefore, that the report commended our consistently high standard in the OECD's programme for international student assessment, or PISA; the quality of head teachers in Scotland; our impressive system of near universal, high-quality pre-school education; the 2001 teachers agreement, with its impact on morale and on interest in the profession through improved salary and working conditions and continuous professional development; the renovation of our schools; and our approach to teacher induction, which was described as \"world class\" in the review.</p><p>In Scotland, we are in the vanguard of leading education nations. We are a learning nation&#8212;and it is reassuring to be told by external, impartial examiners from such an august body as the OECD that that is indeed the case.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries: \"Reviews of National Policies for Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to introduce this important debate on the OECD report into Scottish education, \"Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\", which was published on 11 December 2007.

Greater school autonomy in a local government framework ... A comprehensive, structured and accessible curriculum ... Continuous review of curriculum and teaching\"</p><p>and monitoring of student destinations.</p><p>We will, of course, look carefully at the specific recommendations in all five areas and consider how they might help us to deliver our strategic objectives, particularly in relation to our smarter and our wealthier and fairer objectives, in partnership with local authorities and other key education community agencies and stakeholders.</p><p>We look forward to engaging with the Scottish education community, particularly within our new outcomes-focused landscape following the signing of our historic concordat with local government leaders on 14 November 2007, so that we can work together as partners in an atmosphere of mutual respect to consider what we can do to respond in a positive and constructive manner to the OECD's findings and recommendations.</p><p>The question is not so much, \"What is the Government going to do in response to the review?\" but rather, \"What does the review mean for everyone in the Scottish education community and what are our shared responsibilities to engage with its findings?\" I welcome this opportunity for a mature debate that forms part of a continuing reflection on what we are doing and why, within the context of the review and other sources of evidence, both national and international, which are at our disposal. I had hoped that we could focus the debate on the merits of the review itself and address the issues raised, rather than debate amendments. I am sure that that is what most members will want to do this afternoon, but we should be mindful that the review team and other countries are interested in what we say about their report, rather than in party political points that speakers might score.</p><p>We can all be proud of the success of Scottish education and what we have achieved. However, as the OECD points out, it is not a success for all children. That is the challenge that we need to face up to collectively if Scotland and its education system are to be the best that they can be in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>We need children and young people who are effective contributors, responsible citizens and confident individuals, as well as successful learners, if we are to achieve a smarter Scotland. More importantly, people deserve that for <place-holder colnum=\"5058\"/> themselves, to improve their own life chances and opportunities.</p><p>Our ambitions for Scotland are challenging&#8212;and rightly so. In our first eight months in Government, we have taken important first steps toward shaping tomorrow's Scotland and making Scotland smarter. The challenge is to ensure that Scotland's reputation as a smart, learning nation is maintained and enhanced and that Scotland becomes a country that can build on firm foundations, harness the talents of our people and create opportunities for all to flourish and excel.</p><p>We want Scotland to be everything that it can be. Good teaching and learning lie at the heart of that. A love of learning is a liberator for learners of all ages&#8212;which relates to what Margo MacDonald said&#8212;and that is what we want to see throughout the system.</p><p>We welcome the review and today's debate because we believe that Scotland should be in the vanguard of educational thinking on the international stage. Our ambitions are high. We should be engaged with, and leading, cutting-edge thinking in education across the world and we should be reflecting, on an on-going basis, on how the evidence that we have from both national and international sources, including this important external review, can help us to achieve a smarter, wealthier and fairer Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) <em>Reviews of Policies for National Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</em> and its findings; notes the many positive aspects of our school education system highlighted by the OECD, and agrees that this report is an invaluable international evidence base on which to debate and develop Scotland's educational policies for the future, recognising the significant challenges identified by the OECD.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries: \"Reviews of National Policies for Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The member makes an excellent point.

As a minister, it takes a bit of getting used to not being allowed to sign motions, but I and my colleagues would, I am sure, sign up to the motion that we are debating.</p><p>Not only is the Government committed to a fairer and more equal society in Scotland, but we richer nations of the world have an obligation to ensure that the world becomes a fairer and more equal place. That includes the fundamental right to an education that everyone has. It is clear that we have not managed to come anywhere near to achieving that goal. Debates such as this one will help to raise the profile of continuing inequalities and ensure that that agenda remains high in our conscience and priorities.</p><p>Children are crucial to the debate. All children deserve an equal chance to have a happy and safe childhood and to realise their full potential. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of <place-holder colnum=\"696\"/> the Child sets out the rights and protections that every child should enjoy, wherever they live. This Government fully supports the provisions of the convention and I welcome the fact that almost every country in the world has signed up to it.</p><p>The Scottish Government's strategy on international development helps to promote those rights in developing countries by supporting a range of projects that tackle infant and maternal mortality and ensure that children get the education that they have a right to, for example. We congratulate the former Executive on the Malawi exchange programme and on the work that has been done. We are committed to carrying on that work.</p><p>Nelson Mandela said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.\"</p><p>Leaving so many of them without an education is no way to treat children. As Robert Brown said, children may know poverty, hard labour, ill health and HIV-AIDS, but they may never know the inside of a classroom.</p><p>More and more Governments are responding to popular pressure by announcing an end to primary school fees. As a result, millions of children have flooded into schools. It is great to see the co-operation between our schools in Scotland and schools in, for example, Malawi. As far as we know, 80 schools in Scotland are involved with schools in Malawi&#8212;the initiative has taken off throughout the country. Karen Whitefield should be proud that, like schools throughout the country, Clarkston primary school, which is in her constituency, has joined the programme. However, without a consequent increase in teaching resources, most children drop out of school long before the end of their viable schooling. As Robert Brown said, some teachers who die of AIDS are not replaced.</p><p>Scotland has a long history of helping countries to develop their education systems. As I said, education plays a strong role in our Scotland-Malawi co-operation agreement. The education strand of our joint action plan stresses the importance of education for all children and aims to increase access to education and to improve retention levels, especially for girls. Christine Grahame highlighted how important it is to educate women and gave the striking example of the young woman from northern Nigeria. I think that it was last night that I witnessed on TV the beating in another part of the world of a young woman who had clearly gone against Sharia law. It is clear that we need more women like the woman whom Christine Grahame mentioned: women who stand up for equality, justice and human rights.<place-holder colnum=\"697\"/></p><p>I recall that three adults and three school-leavers from one of my own local churches went to Malawi two years ago to help. They found themselves teaching the children arts and crafts. The young girls were astonished by the enthusiasm and good behaviour of the children. As Karen Whitefield said, unfortunately some of our children take education for granted and treat it accordingly&#8212;no doubt, that is something that we will have to work on.</p><p>Another example of how Scotland is helping to get children in Malawi into education is the enterprising global citizen project, which is jointly funded by the Executive and the United Nations Children's Fund as part of the UN rights of the child programme.</p><p>As Karen Whitefield said, voluntary organisations such as Oxfam and Save the Children add value to such work. All Scottish local authorities have been offered the opportunity to participate in the enterprising global citizen course. Through the Scottish Executive's international development fund, the EGC course has also been introduced in Malawi. Working through the EGC course shows each child how to create and develop their own child-led enterprises&#8212;in other words, how to educate themselves out of poverty. Malawian children do not want handouts: they want an education that will lead them to make their own way in the world, give themselves a good standard of living and ensure that their own children receive the education that their parents&#8212;whom they will be better able to support&#8212;were denied.</p><p>We in Scotland cannot be complacent. Research indicates that 23 per cent of Scottish adults have low numeracy and literacy skills. We must strive to make that a statistic of the past.</p><p>I note that some of the participants at the event that Karen Whitefield mentioned were from the Gypsy Traveller community. Cathy Peattie is no longer in the chamber, but she and others will know of my commitment to that community when my party was in opposition. We must ensure that the Gypsy Traveller community has equal access to an education that takes into account their itinerant lifestyle.</p><p>We should also not forget children with special needs, both here and in the developing world. Every child has the right to full access to an education system that develops them to their full potential. All of us present today have a duty to ensure that we do not fail them in that goal.<place-holder colnum=\"698\"/></p><p>Through education, we can directly influence the thinking and approach of future generations in dealing with health issues and the prevention of disease. We can also provide a broader understanding of sustainable economic development and can help to establish sustainable, thriving and healthier communities.</p><p>What can we do in Scottish classrooms to raise the profile of global issues in general and the global campaign for education initiative in particular? We can raise awareness and, through awareness, understanding&#8212;so that the children involved, as the voters of tomorrow, can continue to put pressure on Governments to increase meaningful aid. None of us who took part in the make poverty history march can forget how meaningful the campaign was&#8212;not only to the participants but to all the G8 members who came to Scotland for the summit.</p><p>It is imperative that our education system ensures that all our young people acquire a knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland's place in it. Young people must learn about the increasingly interconnected world that they live in and about the major challenges that we face, including globalisation, climate change and world poverty. If we fail in that, not only do we fail our young people, but our society as a whole will be poorer. With that in mind, I confirm that this Government is committed to ensuring that an international education is taken seriously in all our schools. That will provide opportunities for all young people to become responsible and knowledgeable citizens as well as successful learners, confident individuals and effective contributors.</p><p>The schools involved in the global campaign for education event that Karen Whitefield mentioned should be congratulated by all of us on the fantastic work that they are doing in educating their children about the world and the challenges that we all face. I hope that many more schools will follow their lead. By raising the profile of the aims of the global campaign for education, we can assist those aims.

I look forward to the work ahead in developing the skills strategy for Scotland. We are committed to building on the existing strengths of the Scottish education system and to making changes only when they will enhance the learning experience of individuals, regardless of their stage of life. As members have said, to grow our economy we must strengthen our skills. Scotland is below the UK level in GDP per head and output per hour&#8212;that must be remedied. The conundrum is that although our workforce is better educated than that in many other countries, the strength of our economy does not reflect that. The Government is determined to remedy that situation, which is why we must develop a skills strategy to release the workforce's potential, for the benefit of all.</p><p>I agree with Elizabeth Smith that the job-for-life era is long gone. We need a workforce with a high level of general education that is capable and flexible and which can meet the demand for multiskilled workers, whether in the offshore industries or the medical profession. We must develop a culture in Scotland in which learning and continuous professional development are an integral part of a person's career. Training courses should result in universally recognised qualifications and develop transferable skills.</p><p>On my first visit to Germany as a 15-year-old, I was mightily impressed that a hairdresser whom I met had many qualifications that showed what she had done in her training. On later visits, I worked in hotels and restaurants and saw how everyone, from waiters to cleaning staff, had their skills recognised. In that context, I welcome the contribution that was made by Christopher Harvie <place-holder colnum=\"505\"/> in his maiden speech. We would all do well to remember its content.</p><p>People must be so equipped that they do not fear changing jobs, but accept that as a challenge with which they can cope. We must rekindle in people the excitement of learning, whether that means someone becoming competent in a new language as their company expands its markets overseas or a joiner adding wood-turning to his list of skills. We must ensure that those who re-enter the job market, full time or part time, after leaving their main employment feel that they have access to relevant training courses.</p><p>I come from the same constituency area as Mike Rumbles and I agree that we must be mindful of the needs of rural Scotland. Members will be aware that, in the previous parliamentary session, Stewart Stevenson and his Westminster colleague at the time, Alex Salmond, had to ensure that courses for the fishing industry were retained at Banff and Buchan College of Further Education in Fraserburgh. We must not get into a situation in which rural industries are at a disadvantage because local colleges do not run certain courses.</p><p>As Mike Rumbles knows, there are many educational opportunities in his constituency. For example, the secondary schools there access the skills of professionals from Aberdeen colleges, who go out to the schools. Such initiatives must be enhanced to ensure that education in urban and rural areas does not develop into a two-tier system.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384326", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills and Vocational Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Hugh Henry for bringing the debate to Parliament.

In the meantime, the pharmaceutical industry continues to make significant advances in the treatment of debilitating illnesses and <place-holder colnum=\"32764\"/> conditions such as MS, and Tysabri is a real addition in that respect.</p><p>As Tricia Marwick pointed out, almost 10,000 people in Scotland have MS. The UK Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that if the Association of British Neurologists' criteria for receiving treatment were properly implemented, somewhere between 28,000 and 40,000 people with MS&#8212;or 32 to 47 per cent of the UK's MS population&#8212;would be eligible for disease-modifying therapies. However, in the UK, only 9,000 to 10,000&#8212;or 11 per cent&#8212;of people with MS are on DMTs. That figure compares poorly with other countries in Europe and beyond. In the Netherlands, 24.7 per cent of the MS population is on DMTs; in France, 30.4 per cent; in Italy, 32.9 per cent; in Ireland, 36.1 per cent; in Germany, 37.1 per cent; in Spain, 40.6 per cent; in the United States, 47.1 per cent; and in Portugal, a massive 61 per cent.</p><p>As Eleanor Scott indicated, one important factor is the cost-effectiveness of MS treatments, and the figure for the relapses avoided by treatment is much better for Tysabri than for any of the other drugs that are available. Obviously, the number of relapses in a non-treated population will be much higher than that in a treated population; however, under a model developed in the US, the cost per relapse per year avoided was between $12,000 and $23,000 lower for Tysabri than for the other DMTs. As Nanette Milne made clear, Tysabri helps people to avoid relapses, which means that they avoid having to take days off work; it helps them to avoid treatments that worsen the condition and debilitate them further; and it helps them to avoid having to employ carers.</p><p>Surely, in deciding whether Tysabri should be available to MS sufferers, the Minister for Health and Community Care should weigh all those factors and costs against the cost of prescribing Tysabri.

The story was told as a result of said man being found murdered in his house.

Alex <place-holder colnum=\"32305\"/> Johnstone should be reminded that nuclear power meets only 3.6 per cent of our total energy demand. Under any nuclear new-build programme, the first reactor would not come online until 2018 at the earliest, with the main delivery of the programme not happening until around 2025 to 2030. That is not in this generation.</p><p>If there was no further delay on the Peterhead carbon capture project, that could be up and running by 2009, at a projected cost of $1 billion. If the minister wants to know, the money for that could come from stopping sending our troops to Iraq, and perhaps also from the nuclear weapons programme.</p><p>A 4 per cent saving could also be achieved by insisting on energy conservation measures on the part of housebuilders and businesses, which should make it a priority for their workplaces. It is a relief that the Executive has at last managed to decide to support the wave and tidal industries and to take Scotland another step on the way to becoming a renewable energy powerhouse, confirming the huge potential for carbon-free energy generation that exists around Scotland, rather than allowing projects to go to Portugal.</p><p>Perhaps Scottish ministers could now turn their attention to chivvying Gordon Brown into supporting carbon capture technology and to getting behind the Peterhead project. The project will convert natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen will be used as clean fuel for a 350MW power station, and the carbon dioxide will be pumped into the North sea oil reservoirs for the purposes of increased oil recovery and, ultimately, storage.</p><p>It is disingenuous for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say that he has to compare Peterhead with other projects, which are nowhere near as far down the road. Carbon capture and storage clearly have the potential to add to the growth strategy of Scotland and to reduce our CO<sub>2</sub> footprint.</p><p>Aberdeen, the north and the north-east are clearly ready and willing to be the global energy hub, with the development of the Aberdeen science and energy park, an energy academy and an energy technologies institute all in the pipeline or ready to go.

The fact that one in a hundred people have coeliac disease is alarming; the fact that four out of five people do not know that they have it is very worrying indeed.</p><p>On average, coeliacs will suffer the symptoms for 13 years before diagnosis. Coupled with the fact that they will have visited their doctors twice a year with the symptoms, that must be extremely distressing for those involved. It is that lack of awareness of the disease that the minister and Health Department officials must address with GPs, nurses and others. The number of days lost through misdiagnosis or non-diagnosis must be costing the country millions of pounds.

It is important that awareness of coeliac disease and the measures that need to be taken become common knowledge, just like schoolchildren and their parents being made aware of the problems of fellow pupils with nut allergies. Similarly, people must be made aware of the products that those with coeliac disease can and cannot eat.

Several pupils were injured in the crash but, thankfully, none of the injuries was serious.</p><p>Current legislation seems to have too many loopholes that allow councils the leeway not to insist on seat belts in every vehicle that transports children. That is particularly ironic in light of other, recently introduced legislation, which requires that children under a certain height must, regardless of their age, be restrained in a child's seat or booster <place-holder colnum=\"32016\"/> seat. The new requirement must cause great consternation to some parents whose children think that they are old enough to do without a booster seat.</p><p>The terms of the current legislation require all cars, minibuses and coaches to be fitted with seat belts, but the mandatory requirement for the fitting of seat belts does not apply to buses unless the bus was first used on or after 1 October 2001. Buses that are designed for urban use, with standing passengers, are exempt from the legislation.</p><p>An arbitrary distinction seems to have been drawn between coaches and buses. Since 1991, coaches and minibuses have been required to be fitted with seat belts and coaches have been required to have a speed limiter that must be set at 62mph. However, buses&#8212;defined as vehicles that weigh more than 7.5 tonnes&#8212;that are not capable of more than 60mph are not required to have a speed limiter and are not required to have seat belts unless they are new and came into service on or after 1 October 2001.</p><p>As I recall, when that legislation was introduced, many small rural bus operators feared that they would lose school contracts and be put out of business. Indeed, that happened to some operators. However, it is interesting to note that the bus involved in the Netherley crash was operated by one of Scotland's two main bus companies, which earns profits that run into millions and millions of pounds. In my view, the use of an older bus without seat belts was inexcusable.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13378749", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Transport Safety"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by thanking all members who have signed my motion.

Last week, Nanette Milne and I were in talks with Grampian NHS Board, which confirmed that there has been a decline in the take-up of cervical screening.

I also thank the many people who gave evidence in helping the committee to make its response to the bill as introduced. The debate has been a good one that has not been conducted along party lines. I welcome the changes that the minister announced.</p><p>The key purpose of the bill is to tackle the problems that street prostitution cause to communities. As Fergus Ewing said, the women from the Calton area of Glasgow gave the committee powerful evidence in that regard. The committee soon came to realise that the bill would not achieve its stated intention. Right up to our last meeting on it, there was a great chance that we would recommend that the bill be thrown out. I am delighted that we managed to extort the significant changes that the Executive has made to the bill.</p><p>In my speech, I want to highlight three key areas, all of which have come to the fore in the debate today. First, as so many members have stated clearly, any buying of sexual services is violence. As Elaine Smith so powerfully said, those who are involved&#8212;predominantly women&#8212;are the subject of violence, sexual exploitation and abuse. Parliament is out to change such attitudes. People who buy sexual services are the perpetrators of violence that will no longer be tolerated in Scotland. It is anathema that women who solicit on our streets are prosecuted and end up in overcrowded prisons for fine defaulting&#8212;and are subsequently stigmatised, as Pauline McNeill rightly said&#8212;while the buyers of sexual services are not even identified.</p><p>The bill's focus is narrow. I regret that the Scottish Executive chose to tackle prostitution in such a piecemeal way, so I have sympathy with Margo MacDonald, Mark Ballard and other members in that regard. We owe it to the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"31169\"/> public to make it clear that violence against women in so-called saunas and massage parlours and in other places is equally unacceptable. Of course, we need action to tackle the drug habits and sexual health of the women on our streets and to address the lack of ways out of prostitution, so that sex workers can secure alternative sources of income. We also need to tackle sex trafficking and we need to deal with people who procure the services of sex workers for others. However, like David Davidson, I have come to the conclusion that we should be thankful that the bill makes a start on the issue.</p><p>I am a member for North East Scotland, so I was particularly interested in the minister's views on the management zone in Aberdeen. I was recently out with the police in Aberdeen all night and paid particular attention to the policing of the zone. Our patrol visited the zone several times during the evening, as well as dealing with all the drunkenness and attacks that go on in Aberdeen of a Saturday night&#8212;I am sure that other patrols also visited the zone several times. The area is well covered by closed-circuit television cameras. The minister seemed to indicate that it is for local authorities and the police to work out how to deal with street prostitution. I welcome that approach, which in no way condones prostitution but offers a way of dealing with the problem. When the trial of the person who has been charged with the Ipswich murders takes place, we might well find that the fact that the town has an identifiable red-light district, in which the women look out for one another, helped to ensure that the perpetrator was quickly caught.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution (Public Places) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the committee clerks for their work in keeping track of the changes that the committee wanted to make.

I will deal with the question later in my speech.</p><p>As I said, the fishing industry has had to battle against the unfavourable terms that various Governments have set. The industry is asking for the right to life. Throughout all the turmoil of decommissioning, quotas and cuts in days at sea, it has complied with every regulation. For that, the industry was promised that things would get better, but they have not. The industry has complied with habitat directives, hygiene regulations and whatever other directive has been thrown at it. However, because of a lack of ability <place-holder colnum=\"30308\"/> to plan ahead&#8212;which every industry should expect to be able to do&#8212;it faces having to crisis manage, every single day.</p><p>On behalf of the Scottish fishing sector, I say to the minister that he needs to strike out on his own at the talks. The fish processors, some of whom are with us in the gallery, are trying to do exactly what the Executive wants of Scottish industry: they are growing their markets, going for niche markets, and promoting the quality and Scottishness of their products. However, EU regulation prevents them from doing that, even within the TAC.</p><p>As other members have said, this year, boats will be able to take only about 80 per cent of their quota. The remaining 20 per cent, which represents about &#163;30 million, has not yet been caught as a result of the tight regulations on days at sea. There is concern that no frozen fish is being stored to meet market demand over the winter. Other sectors have three-year budgeting arrangements and the fishing industry needs a similar ability to carry over days at sea and quotas. Doing so would ensure continuity of supply for markets.</p><p>The fish processors can find a market for the quota of fish that is caught. However, if the full quota cannot be caught, there will be a downward spiral that could lead to no market and no need for fishermen to go out to sea, the result of which would be crisis in the industry. The minister must press for multi-annual quotas, not only for the reason that I have set out but on the ground of safety. Skippers must never feel pressurised to go to sea, whatever the weather, because they have not met their quota.</p><p>There is no doubt that we are experiencing climate change and that the gales at this time of year are getting worse. In light of the changing circumstances, instead of going for days at sea, will the minister press Brussels to change the rules? I ask the minister to consider annualised trawling times. Given that skippers keep detailed log books, it should be possible to do that. The times could be calculated from the time of the pick-up of the dhan in the winches to the time that the nets&#8212;full or otherwise&#8212;are drawn on board. Why should fishermen's working time include travel to work, and time spent seeking work, when that is not the case for anyone else?</p><p>The minister must be more challenging of the scientific research. Science still does not seem to have shifted with the current. As fishermen have detected, the cod seem to be moving to colder waters. I also want the minister to ask about the availability of sand eels as food for other species.</p><p>It is interesting to know the percentage of cod that is caught by Scottish boats, because the fact <place-holder colnum=\"30309\"/> that cod is much more important in England is my final reason for asking the minister to go it alone. Cod&#8212;mainly imported&#8212;is the mainstay of the fishing industry in Grimsby and Hull and we all know why that is important to Ben Bradshaw and his colleagues.</p><p>The minister's forthcoming visit to the talks in Brussels might be his last.

The current system of council tax is now perceived as so unfair and such a huge burden on those least able to pay it that it will undoubtedly be high on voters' list of priorities when they decide how to cast their vote.</p><p>The SNP's view is that changing council tax bands, replacing council tax with a property tax or offering rebates here and there in the run-up to the election would only be tinkering at the edges of local government finance and that it would fail, like the Burt review, to address the real issues of local government finance and its relation to national taxation. Like George Lyon, I look forward to having a real and meaningful debate on the Burt review. I hope that he will not still be reading his ministerial brief with his tongue firmly in his cheek.</p><p>We must not forget that council tax is a small part of local government finance and that any <place-holder colnum=\"30045\"/> shortfall in the money provided by central Government to local government has to be made up through a much larger increase in council tax as a result of the so-called gearing effect.

Contrary to Mr Brownlee's remarks, we would not be inventing the wheel if we had a local income tax. Other countries have managed to implement it and raise funds quite well. Indeed, this morning Bruce Crawford and I had a meeting with the Nordic Green Left Alliance. Its representatives believe that raising taxation and spending the money raised at a local level increases people's level of interest in Government affairs and has made a significant contribution to much higher turnouts at their elections.</p><p>Many in this Parliament now realise that raising revenue in Scotland as well as spending it is important to the credibility and legitimacy of the Parliament.

However, having listened to the evidence that was presented to the Local Government and Transport Committee, and given that the bill is concerned only with projects of national significance, my views have mellowed somewhat, and I now see some merit in the proposals.

I take it that they thought that the surroundings in the Parliament and the television cameras were intimidating rather than colleagues such as my dear friend Tricia Marwick.

I will highlight the problems that are faced by Aberdeenshire Council and my colleague Brian Adam will concentrate on Aberdeen City Council.</p><p>First, I will address some remarks to the report. The reduction in EU funds to the UK, which is due <place-holder colnum=\"28698\"/> to EU enlargement, is recognised by all, but how the Scottish Executive deals with the transition will be crucial. The reduction in programme management executives from five to two must not result in centralisation and top-down management. We must not spend much-needed time and money on dismantling five bureaucracies to create new ones. We must use dispersed teams and identify the most effective leaders in structural funds teams to ensure that their skills continue to be used.</p><p>The ethos of subsidiarity must not be lost. There is a feeling in the country that the Labour-Liberal Democrat Executive has been sucking up powers from local councils. Although that situation will be reversed by the people on the SNP benches after next May, it is a problem that is exercising the minds of people out there.</p><p>I ask that the Scottish Executive be up front with councils and voluntary organisations on how they will be affected, so that they can plan for change. It is vital that the Executive engages with all the recipients of EU funds to discuss what changes they will have to make and plan for. Aberdeenshire Council regrets that although it has been able to meet officials from the EU and the Department of Trade and Industry, the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning has so far refused its requests to meet him. I hope that that will change.</p><p>Given that rural development and environmental sustainability are no longer priorities for Scottish Enterprise, which is now focused on city regions to obtain growth, structural funds could provide much needed additionality in rural areas. Aberdeenshire Council in particular is concerned to ensure that although Aberdeenshire does not meet the convergence criteria, it will still meet the competitiveness and co-operation criteria.</p><p>I know that many members from other parts of Scotland believe that the north-east is all wealthy, but it is not. The spatial targeting criteria hide pockets of deprivation and Aberdeenshire now has two data zones in the worst 5 per cent and six zones in the worst 20 per cent. That is largely due to the decline in the fishing quota for the Scottish fleet and the subsequent scrapping of boats, which has had a disastrous effect on the economy of Fraserburgh and Peterhead in particular. The recent report on small towns also highlights the problems that much of the rural north-east faces.</p><p>Aberdeenshire Council is concerned about the distribution of funds to urban and rural projects. It hopes that money will be targeted to obtain the maximum impact. I am not asking for special pleading, nor is Aberdeenshire Council. Indeed, the council should be congratulated on shifting the emphasis to take account of the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas.<place-holder colnum=\"28699\"/></p><p>All that we in north-east are asking for is a level playing field on which to compete for funding. That is why measuring outcomes is so important, as Linda Fabiani said. I do not think that there is ever enough scrutiny of the effectiveness of funds used.

Often, transporting freight by rail is hampered by antiquated rail infrastructure. The Executive must work more closely with Network Rail to improve the infrastructure of our railways. We are often told that such improvements cannot be made because the height of bridges, for example, means that the bridges would need to be replaced. However, as Network Rail has pointed out, such problems can often be resolved by lowering the rail track. Dualling track is hugely expensive, but a few strategically placed loops can make a huge difference to freight and passenger volumes on our railways. In evidence to the committee, Network Rail said that such work need not cost a huge amount of money.</p><p>I refer to the paragraphs on sea transport in the committee report. As Kenny MacAskill said, people are increasingly recognising the natural transport highway that surrounds Scotland, which is a grossly underutilised resource. In an age when our whole planet is threatened by climate change, not to use ships to transport goods is a nonsense. Why do electronic goods need to be flown between the far east and Europe? In cases in which that mode of freight transport is necessary, we should ensure the use of Scottish airports where they are closest to the export and import market destinations, which would avoid hauling goods to airports further south. We need a total shift in our current thinking that we need everything yesterday. Scotland is a natural strategic hub for transport between Europe, Scandinavia and North America. Scotland must be exploited as a break-bulk centre, with our smaller ports able to handle more freight.</p><p>Short-termism prevails, however, and in Aberdeen, which is a major port serving the oil industry, the former Labour administration made the ludicrous decision that the rail track to the harbour should be lifted to make way for a new shopping centre&#8212;a decision that has not been reversed by the current Lib Dem-Tory <place-holder colnum=\"28426\"/> administration. There has been no long-term strategic thinking there from any of the unionist parties.</p><p>Although the impact of canals on the movement of freight is limited overall, some of them can undoubtedly be used for short hauls of timber or quarry stone. Those goods can be taken to ports via the Caledonian canal, for example, and some limited use could be made of the Forth and Clyde canal.</p><p>Undoubtedly, as is evident from the debate so far, any discussion of freight transport is still heavily focused on road transport, on short-haul journeys and on our local Scottish hauliers. The debate has focused on whether our hauliers compete on a level playing field and whether the Scottish Executive is doing everything that is in its power to support them. I agree with the committee's convener: we must ensure that Westminster and Brussels confirm that directives such as the working time directive are adhered to fairly throughout Europe.</p><p>The Scottish Executive can do much more to relieve pinchpoints in our road infrastructure. We all know where they are&#8212;most notably in the north-east around Aberdeen, as David Davidson said, because of the lack of the western peripheral route. All the hauliers in agriculture, timber, agricultural engineering, oil, agricultural feedstuffs, food and drink&#8212;notably whisky&#8212;and more are totally frustrated and angry about the lack of progress on that.

At times, dialogue with NHS officials has been fraught&#8212;as he has just said. Their unwillingness even to listen to a reasoned argument has made his job very difficult. Therefore, I am pleased to be here to help to secure the future of the maternity units in rural Grampian.</p><p>I know that Mike Rumbles appreciates that the Scottish National Party is fighting alongside him on this issue. He cannot rely on his own party, whose local government representatives on the health board voted for closure. That was especially lamentable in the case of Councillor Bisset, whose council&#8212;Aberdeenshire Council&#8212;had voted to keep the units open.</p><p>I, too, welcome the presence of the save Aboyne maternity campaigners in the public gallery. I hope that the minister will be able to tell us that he has read their business plan for Aboyne maternity unit, which aims to develop and expand the unit along the lines of the Montrose unit. A few years ago, the Montrose unit also faced closure, but now 52 per cent of local babies are born there. It is unfortunate that NHS Grampian has not even thought fit to reply in writing to the proposals that the campaigners have made.</p><p>I am sure that other members will focus on the long distances, and I am sorry that Andy Kerr declined the invitation to visit the units to see for himself the distances involved. Last week, the Parliament debated the closure of accident and emergency services in Lanarkshire, which will <place-holder colnum=\"27703\"/> require people to travel distances of fewer than 30 miles. The people who will be affected by NHS Grampian's proposed closures will have to travel twice that distance or more, on much poorer roads. I recall helping to fight in a by-election in Fraserburgh one January, when I was eight months pregnant. As we drove back to Aberdeen and beyond in deteriorating weather, my fellow activist, Kevin Stewart, became increasingly agitated that I might deliver in the middle of nowhere on a stormy, snowy night. The distances that people must travel are a serious issue.</p><p>There are stark inconsistencies in NHS Grampian's recommendations, which fly in the face of many objectives. The Kerr report called for health services to be delivered locally and regionally. NHS Grampian says that a community health unit is needed for the north of the area, but proposes nothing similar for the centre and the south.</p><p>There is a clear economic case for keeping the maternity units open. Last Friday, members of the Scottish Parliament received a briefing from Scottish Enterprise Grampian on proposals to increase tourism on the east side of the Cairngorms national park, around Deeside and Donside. The ambition is to increase the value of tourism in the area by 66 per cent&#8212;to &#163;86 million&#8212;by 2015, which will generate an increase in jobs from 1,223 to 3,076. Many jobs have already been taken up by young migrant workers and many more jobs will be taken up as migrant workers bring their wives and families to the area.

As the minister said, older children, rather than babes in arms, are increasingly being considered for adoption. The wishes and views of those children must be heard and taken into account. The child's interests must be considered first and foremost and if the child can articulate their wishes, they must be listened to.</p><p>I am concerned about the provisions that will allow parental consent to be dispensed with if a parent or guardian is unlikely to be able to safeguard and promote their child's health, development and welfare during the child's early years. The parent's situation might not be permanent. Many young parents are afflicted by alcohol and drug addictions and many women, in particular, are desperate to beat their addictions so that they can develop parenting skills and become good parents.</p><p>Like Euan Robson, I welcome the introduction of permanence orders, which will give flexibility that has not hitherto been available. Adoption has a great finality about it&#8212;it is a separation from birth <place-holder colnum=\"27437\"/> parents, with no going back. That creates traumas. I know of young adults who, when they could, were desperate to find their birth parents but who at the same time did not want to offend their adoptive parents. One individual was left to lead a double life as a result of balancing their contact with both families. I therefore urge the minister to ensure that support services are not time limited. They must be holistic and available to adoptees and adoptive parents on a needs basis, regardless of time. Contact orders must be allowed, to minimise the traumatic experiences of some. I refer to the comments of Children 1<sup>st</sup>, which advocates wider family involvement, whether through arrangements for shared care or through future planning that may lead to adoption. In our deliberations, we must take into account the research that has been done in Ireland and elsewhere that shows the positive benefits of kinship care.</p><p>People whom I have met to discuss children in care have given me the impression that some social workers do not always give kinship placement due weight. I acknowledge that social workers are hugely overloaded and that adoption may be seen as an easy solution that brings finality to cases, but it is not always in the child's best interests. I know of cases in which parents and grandparents had no access to children while they were in care or going through the process of adoption&#8212;they were not allowed to forward birthday and Christmas presents or letters, which is extremely sad. Guidance on that is extremely important if we are to avoid those situations. In such cases, parents and grandparents often have to resort to legal proceedings, which cannot be good for anyone.</p><p>Like Adam Ingram, I am disappointed that the minister has not seen it as a necessity to produce the new fostering strategy to be discussed in tandem with the bill. I am not reassured by the minister's comments on that. Discussing the bill before having a fostering strategy is putting the cart before the horse. In 2001, the Executive promised to carry out a comprehensive review of fostering. If we adopted joined-up government, the bill would have been called the children (fostering and adoption) (Scotland) bill. That would have been a holistic approach to dealing with vulnerable children and would have sent out a message from the Parliament about joined-up thinking and government.</p><p>Fostering leaves doors open. On any one day, more than 3,400 children are living with about 2,200 foster carers in Scotland. The estimated shortage of foster carers is about 1,700. The funding shortfall of about &#163;5.5 million leaves local authorities struggling to cover costs and condemns foster carers to dig deeply into their pockets, thereby incurring financial hardship. That <place-holder colnum=\"27438\"/> is hardly a climate that will encourage families to take up fostering, which is often the first step to adopting. Most local authorities and agencies want clarity on how to deal with the excessive pressure on foster families, which often leads to instability and disruption in children's lives, when fostering falls through.</p><p>While the proposed power for the Scottish Executive to set rates for allowances, which addresses the long-term funding concerns, is broadly welcome, fostering involves a greater number of children and greater costs, and deals with complicated support needs. It is an important avenue for getting children out of local authority care and children's homes, which we know fail far too many children in relation to their educational, social and developmental needs. Getting fostering right is essential for many children in Scotland. To give due weight to what Barnado's, I and others believe to be the importance of fostering, it should have been part of the bill. However, I support the broad principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the bill.

At governmental level, there is still a patronising and paternalistic attitude to international aid. Conditions are often attached to aid money. For example, countries are told that they must buy our goods and services in return. In addition, the World Bank dictates too much to developing countries, some of which are told that they must implement water privatisation. Debates about the ownership of the water industry must seem a distant prospect to people who do not even have water.</p><p>The minister said that she was impressed by the number of ordinary Scots who want to help and that help is coming from all our communities. In my area of Deeside, over the past 18 months, Drumoak and Durris church has raised &#163;10,000 to help rebuild and refurbish the kitchen at Likhubula House, which is the outdoor centre at the foot of Mount Mulanje to which Mike Pringle referred. Ros, Liz, Claire and three sixth-year school leavers&#8212;Lyn, Amanda and Ellie&#8212;went out last summer to help with the work. While they were there, they did teaching, helped with after-school clubs and cleaned and painted school rooms. They took out a load of equipment, including medical supplies from Aberdeen hospital.<place-holder colnum=\"27113\"/></p><p>As Mike Pringle mentioned, Likhubula House is the only outdoor centre in Malawi. My friends and their church thought that supporting it would be a worthwhile, practical and long-term investment. It is hoped that tourism will enable the centre to become self-financing in a few years and, if possible, it will be managed solely by folk in Malawi. In the next few years, the church hopes to send out smaller amounts of money to pay for orphans' carers. The youngsters in the group were struck by how difficult it was for people to rise out of poverty because many families had to look after youngsters from extended families, whose parents had died of HIV/AIDS or hunger.</p><p>The visit was a life-changing experience for the group, as it was for the many groups from Scotland that have gone to Likhubula, including people from Dunblane and Paisley, some of whom we met the other week when the Malawi choir was at the Parliament. One of the church group, whose name is Amanda, e-mailed me when she found that I would be speaking in today's debate. She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Something we in Scotland could do is not necessarily help more just help in a more informed way. Sending 20 school bags out to school children in Malawi helps those children in the short-term, yes. Greater support would come from sending money into the country so a bag producer in the country can get the work from it hence helping the children and the economy. Also needless to say for the amount of the school bags and P+P you would spend you could get double the amount of bags (if not more) by just supporting local business in Malawi.\"</p><p>Group members were struck by the corruption that they found at all levels and throughout the country. When they donated money, they found that they had to do it in a very public way so that the money could not be siphoned off. They told me that the immense hardship in the country means that when builders are asked to build a house and are given the necessary funds, some of them siphon off the money that should have been used for the foundations. People find that their house has shaky foundations or that it was not constructed properly. There is still a get-rich-quick attitude in Malawi, although perhaps that cannot be helped if life expectancy in the country is 40. The only way of dealing with corruption is through education and by working effectively to stamp it out.</p><p>I say to the minister that the task is huge, but we must not give up. People in Malawi are so happy with so little; their optimism must be realised. We must do more, not less. Since 1970, SNP policy has been for 0.7 per cent of gross national product to be given as development aid. As yet, the United Kingdom Government has not reached that target; indeed, it does not expect to reach it until 2013. We believe that the target should now be 1 per cent and that it should be met by 2009. Again, I say to the minister: let us raise our level of <place-holder colnum=\"27114\"/> commitment. In that way, we will meet the desire of Scots to assist and of those in Malawi to help themselves.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13365823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Development and Co-operation with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The member should have listened to what I said; I said, \"the recommendations of Margaret and her group.\" I recognise that it was a cross-party delegation.

On a dual carriageway, or on a good day, it should take about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Yesterday, it took three hours and 45 minutes, even with detours to avoid the major hold-ups on either side of Elgin. Such delays cost employers and businesses a fortune. We are still waiting for the bypass at Fochabers and we will need one at Keith if there is to be a large supermarket in the middle of the town. That is not taking account of the fact that the blockage at the Haudagain roundabout in Aberdeen has been exacerbated by the delayed decision on the Aberdeen western peripheral route.

At a time when we are more used to having to deal with winter deaths and the problems of fuel poverty&#8212;on which neither Westminster nor the Executive has the right answers&#8212;it might seem unlikely that we will have to deal with the problems that France experienced. However, that is not beyond the bounds of possibility and we should put in place measures to prevent their occurrence. I say to Mr Morrison that architects must put in place heat regulation systems that can both keep heat in buildings and take it out of them.</p><p>Climate change is happening. Monitoring in Aberdeen has shown that the sea level has risen by 70mm over the past 100 years. We have seen the effects that that has had on the coastline&#8212;a vast amount of expensive work is now required to halt and reverse the erosion of the beach at Aberdeen. Other areas are subject to the same pressures. What review and long-term programme of action will the Executive put in place to protect the most vulnerable areas?</p><p>Rainfall patterns are changing. Although the amount of rainfall is likely to increase by between 10 per cent and 25 per cent in winter months, there could be a corresponding decrease in summer months. In that regard, I agree with John Scott and ask the Executive what review it has undertaken of water abstraction and storage schemes.</p><p>It is obviously easier to reduce Scotland's carbon footprint and its greenhouse gas emissions in some areas than in others. I do not suppose that even the minister or Alex Johnstone would claim to have the answer to the production of methane by cows, but I am sure that they will be aware that the Rowett Research Institute in the north-east is conducting research on the matter.</p><p>The Executive will need to help the energy supply industry with research and development on carbon capture. According to a representative of BP to whom I spoke at yesterday evening's Scottish Parliament and Business Exchange event, the company will know about the economic viability of its scheme and whether it can proceed with it by the end of the year. What talks are the Executive and the DTI having with the company to ensure that we create the conditions that will allow that scheme to succeed?</p><p>How can we persuade other businesses that taking steps to reduce their energy bills not only makes good financial sense but is increasingly important from a public relations point of view, given that it is the right thing to do both ethically and environmentally? I agree with Rosie Kane that the Government must engage with food manufacturers to reduce the amount of packaging around food and that retailers must stop shoving plastic bags at customers. It would take very little <place-holder colnum=\"26578\"/> to persuade shoppers to take their own bags to the shops and to get them used to less packaging. In many ways, vast numbers of the public are ahead of Government policy in that area and are waiting for action to be taken but, as other Scottish National Party members have said, Scotland is constrained by always having to refer to another place.</p><p>Education programmes are vital. For example, the \"Talking Scotland\" ads on drugs and alcohol that the Scottish Executive produces could be interspersed with advice on using energy-efficient light bulbs, not leaving appliances on stand-by and spending to save by buying more energy-efficient appliances in the first place. We could persuade people to buy food locally at farmers markets, which can be cheaper and can save on food miles. I thank all members who have supported my motion, with <em>Farmers Weekly</em>, to promote farmers markets and buying food locally.</p><p>As Richard Lochhead mentioned, we urgently need an energy efficiency strategy. In the private house-building sector, corners are still being cut. Pipes that are out of sight are not being lagged and the most energy-efficient boilers are not being installed. Aerial heat loss surveys show that new private house developments are some of the worst when it comes to energy efficiency. Planning and building departments must be signing off those developments. What quality control measures are in place to ensure that building control officers are doing their jobs properly? Given the breaches to which I have referred, are ministers confident that allowing buildings to self-certify is the right way to go?</p><p>Scotland must do as much as it can to reduce energy consumption. On a global scale, our contribution may be small, but it could be much larger if the Scottish Government were to put its heart and soul into supporting research and development in those Scottish companies that work in the renewables sector. The export potential is huge and would have a substantial impact on jobs and the balance of payments. As our political leaders travel the world, they must use their influence to persuade other Governments to address climate change. It is testament to Blair's weakness with Bush that he has not been able to persuade the Bush Administration to reduce its reliance on oil and to save the planet in more ways than one.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "All the members who have spoken agree that we have a problem and few people elsewhere would disagree, so it would be criminally negligent if society and government failed to take compensatory measures for the sake of present and future generations.

The coalition has only itself to blame for that state of affairs. It is unfortunate&#8212;actually, I would call it an act of downright incompetence&#8212;that an important part of the north-east integrated transport strategy has been so mishandled by successive Liberal Democrat transport ministers and that there has been no informed debate on the other strands of the work of NESTRANS. As a result, the general public do not really know about the plans for an Aberdeen crossrail project; for rail freight; for access to Aberdeen airport; for bus services; and for the provision of cycleways and walkways. The 13 strands of the proposal for a modern transport system in the north-east have largely been ignored.</p><p>We welcome the additional &#163;40 million investment. However, although that sounds like a lot of money, it does not amount to very much if we are talking about investment in transport infrastructure. In any case, much of the money seems to go on umpteen feasibility studies and work for consultants instead of on tangible change, and it is little wonder that the public get frustrated when they see no obvious signs of progress.</p><p>Much of the investment that will be required to make the Aberdeen crossrail project a success will be used to make right successive Governments' underinvestment in the Inverness to Aberdeen line, which has been neglected for years. Indeed, passing loops will have to be installed at many places on the line before the frequency of trains on the section of the Aberdeen crossrail between Inverurie and Stonehaven can be increased. Mike Rumbles is probably glad that the re-opening of Laurencekirk station has not been considered as part of the Aberdeen crossrail project, because much faster progress seems to have been made on that proposal.</p><p>There seems to be an overriding focus on opening up stations in areas where people live, rather than areas where people work. It is all right to take people into the centre of Aberdeen, but only a fraction of them work in the city centre and there are no good, fast links to the industrial estates. I know of many people who want to take the train into Aberdeen from various points on the Inverness line, but it is difficult for them then to go on to Tullos or Altens. As a result, they are put off using public transport.</p><p>I seriously believe that, in order to realise the true potential of Aberdeen crossrail, the opening <place-holder colnum=\"25735\"/> up of smaller stations along the line is vital. A station at Tullos, where lack of car parking is a serious issue for many businesses and their employees, is a necessity if the project is to take off. Opening stations at Woodside and/or Bucksburn on the other side of the city is also essential&#8212;not, as Richard Baker said, in the longer term, but in the initial stages of the project.</p><p>I would like the minister to tell us what importance he attaches to rail freight and what has happened to the proposed freight terminal at Raiths Farm. Little freight seems to be moving through Guild Street and Craiginches at the moment. Waterloo Quay is mentioned in the NESTRANS document, yet the link is to be ripped up to make way for a retail development at Guild Street railway station. That hardly makes for integrated transport.</p><p>I welcome the debate that Richard Baker has initiated.

In one University of Glasgow study, a third of the 10 to 12-year-olds in the sample had been exposed to drugs, a quarter had been exposed to cannabis and substantial numbers had been in situations in which harder drugs had been used. Although children may be able to avoid situations in which friends and peers use drugs, it is much more difficult for children to avoid situations in which family members are the drug users. As others have mentioned, that would seem to be borne out by the recent tragic cases of Michael McGarrity and Derek Doran, both of whom were identified as children of substance-misuse parents.</p><p>Such conclusions also highlight the need to ensure that education in schools on the danger of substance abuse not only adopts a broad-brush approach towards all pupils but targets supplementary help at specific groups of vulnerable children. If such targeting allows children, individually or in small groups, to open up to professionals about the specific dangers that they face in their home environment, meaningful intervention might be possible at an earlier stage.</p><p>That would obviously be relevant only to school-age children but, as Susan Deacon mentioned, those of us who met school nurses at lunch time today and those who have read the Association of Directors of Social Work's report will know that obtaining consent from the parents of primary school children is often a real difficulty, and that solution could allow the problem to be addressed at an early stage. I hope that the minister will agree that removing barriers to listening to children themselves must be an early priority.</p><p>One thing that I hope will result from the report and from today's debate is a recognition by all those working with children&#8212;midwives, practice nurses, doctors, nursery nurses, teachers, classroom assistants and anyone working in health, education, social work, the police and even the prison service, where prison officers see children on prison visits being used as drug mules with drugs hidden in their nappies and in other parts of their clothing&#8212;that they have a duty to share their concerns at an early stage. No one should say that it is not their place, and I agree with Trish Godman that everyone should see it as their duty to express their concerns and to have those concerns investigated&#8212;better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>The concerns of wider family members should also be taken seriously, as has been suggested. As soon as such concerns are brought to the <place-holder colnum=\"25606\"/> attention of the authorities, action should be taken. Far too often, family members are ignored and those who would be willing to help if support were given are left feeling powerless to intervene. We saw such a situation in the tragic case of Danielle Reid in Inverness.</p><p>That leads us on to the question whether at-risk children should be left with their parents or taken into the care of foster parents or local authority children's homes. Experience has shown that long-term stays in children's homes can often be detrimental to children's academic and life skills attainment, so it should not be a route that is taken lightly. Fostering is often a more positive experience, but if children who are at risk can be cared for safely by drug-free family members&#8212;grandparents, older siblings or members of the wider family&#8212;that should be considered.</p><p>I agree with Scotland's commissioner for children and young people that each case should be considered individually and that the best should be done for each child. I would also like to highlight the question that Pauline McNeill asked at First Minister's question time this morning, and I caution the Executive to think carefully before blindly following England in the numbers game and settling for a maximum of three children in one foster home. Such a limit takes no account of the persons already in the fostering family or of the need to keep larger numbers of children together.</p><p>The minister mentioned the implementation group.

As with any plan, the devil will be in the detail and in the funding that is available.</p><p>Much is said about the rural economy and the need to diversify so that the population in the countryside can be maintained and enhanced, but we must never lose sight of the primary aim of the land, which is to provide food for our people. In January of last year, I was horrified to hear a minister from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs say at a conference in Oxford that he no longer thought that it was important that food came from our own resources. We live in a time of global insecurity, which is mostly caused by Bush and Blair and by the UK Government's pursual of a disastrous foreign policy and failure in its duty to protect and defend the security of our citizens. Failure to recognise the importance in a hungry world of home-grown <place-holder colnum=\"25016\"/> food and to protect food sources leaves us, as an island, highly vulnerable.</p><p>Here in Scotland, where agriculture is a devolved issue, we have an opportunity to take a different tack from our southern neighbours. Food production is immensely important to the Scottish economy. The beef cattle industry, which produces 167,000 tonnes of beef, is worth &#163;450 million. Scotland has almost 30 per cent of the UK herd of breeding cattle and 4 per cent of the EU herd. The sheep flock is worth &#163;98 million and Scotland has more than 20 per cent of the UK breeding flock. The pig industry is worth another &#163;150 million; 63 per cent of the country's pigs come from my area in the north-east. Dairy is worth &#163;230 million, poultry and eggs are worth &#163;120 million, cereals&#8212;mainly wheat and barley&#8212;are worth &#163;260 million and we should not forget the seed potato industry and our exports of fruit and oil-seed rape, for example.</p><p>In spite of that, we witness daily pressure on agricultural land, not just from housebuilding, as our towns and cities expand, but from the use of prime agricultural land to plant trees, which is ridiculous. Sustainable forestry must be on moorland rather than on prime agricultural land.</p><p>We have yet to experience the full effects of the single farm payment scheme, but I am not optimistic that it will encourage food production. The minister mentioned the beauty of rural Scotland, but that is a result of good land management. Nothing can be more distressing to a farmer's daughter than to see good productive land being set aside. That is a travesty in a world in which there is still widespread famine.</p><p>As people become more aware of the need for fair trade at home and in developing countries and of the need to reduce food miles, we must encourage food production rather than stifle it. We must welcome local farmers markets, which offer excellent benefits to farmers and the public, and recognise the advantages of shopping at small local butchers, bakers and delicatessens, which stock local produce, often at cheaper prices than the supermarkets.</p><p>It is regrettable that the minister glossed over how the achievement of the rural development plan's aims will be financed. In my view, he seems to be relying far too heavily on EU funding. In that context, I want to discuss the LEADER programme. In an excellent speech, Sarah Boyack spoke about equipping people with the skills to meet future challenges. LEADER has been very good at developing bottom-up community initiatives. Community LEADER agents have given communities confidence to seek funding from a variety of sources to supplement LEADER start-up money. In upper Banffshire and upper Speyside, for example, LEADER initiatives have enabled <place-holder colnum=\"25017\"/> communities to start a children's drop-in centre, to refurbish a community hall, to open a visitor resource centre and to develop, with the Crown Estate, a footpath network, which stimulates tourism. Information on walking routes is the information most commonly requested by tourists in that area.

Over the years, I have seen the prison population at Craiginches change from being predominantly older men on theft and petty criminal charges to the majority of prisoners&#8212;some 70 to 80 per cent&#8212;being there as a result of drug misuse.</p><p>As many members have said, the scourge of drug abuse must not be seen as a party-political matter and speeches today have shown that our common goal is to rid Scotland of its drug culture. However, it is my firm belief that sentencing drug addicts to short sentences that are not long enough seriously to tackle their addictions is not the answer, because far too often we see those addicts back in prison again, sometimes within days. That must really frustrate the police.</p><p>Craiginches has the highest rate of prisoners who have tested positive for drugs, but it has the second-lowest rate of attendance for drug programmes. The provision of methadone substitute is not the answer because the addictive behaviour continues. On a prison visit just last Friday, I listened to one prisoner who had been forcibly removed from Craiginches to Barlinnie on a Wednesday, despite the fact that he told prison staff that his case was due in court in two days' time and that he was likely to be released on bail. He was released from Barlinnie on the Friday, at 7.30 pm, with a bus ticket to Aberdeen that was valid only for Friday, but by that time all the buses had left. He had to sleep rough in Glasgow and return to Aberdeen at his own expense the next day. Worse than that, he was released without his methadone prescription for the weekend, so as soon as he got back to Aberdeen he was immediately back on heroin and back in prison within a few days.<place-holder colnum=\"24779\"/></p><p>The benefits to the drug user and to society of becoming drug free greatly outweigh the benefits of controlled drug abuse. Residential rehabilitation has been shown to be the most effective way of facilitating recovery, but it is available only to a tiny proportion of addicts in Scotland. I agree with colleagues who have said that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The methadone programme alone costs &#163;12 million for an estimated 20,000 addicts. How much better it would be if that money were redirected to provide residential rehab services. Although there is some provision by the private sector, it is patchy and unregulated. I disagree with Miss Goldie's suggestion&#8212;if I heard her correctly&#8212;that there should be a central unit for rehabilitation, because it is important that addicts be treated in their own environments, so that they can have family support.</p><p>Grampian has the highest number of babies born with drug addictions. The national figure is 6.1 per 1,000 live births, but in the Grampian area it is 11.4 per 1,000 live births. Now that the women's unit in Craiginches has closed, we do not see those women and they have to go to Cornton Vale, where I am sure there are some human misery stories still to be told.</p><p>We need residential units throughout the country. In the north-east we desperately need a publicly funded rehabilitation centre. I am sure that the long-term benefits to drug users and to society as a whole would mean that money had been well spent because it would make us safer and save taxpayers money. That really would be joined-up Government.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359599", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer, for allowing me time in this debate to get my first speech over at an early stage.
