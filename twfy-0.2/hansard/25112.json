We have heard that we have many more questions and hurdles and that we might not fully realise yet the complexity of what we face.</p><p>I was interested to hear Mark McDonald&#8217;s speech. He offered the minister some advice, which perhaps had merit.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale made the point that the majority of legal highs&#8212;new psychoactive substances&#8212;that are out there are coming through the internet. Basically, that is what people want and it is how people access such substances. However, we are maybe in danger of stereotyping the users at the moment. I know that surveys have been conducted, but we tend to focus on the young people themselves.</p><p>I took part in the debate in November about opioid misuse, in which we looked at how far we had come. We looked at the pathways, the journey and &#8220;The Road to Recovery&#8221;, and we acknowledged that the numbers are decreasing. However, are they decreasing in that area because we are starting to see an increase in another area? That would be worrying. The worrying thing about the legislative framework is that it cannot work in isolation&#8212;it cannot cover just Scotland and the UK. Perhaps it cannot even cover just Europe, as new psychoactive substances are a global problem. Because our young people&#8212;I am not sure at what age someone stops being a young person&#8212;are mobile, they go on long weekend trips for either hen or stag parties and have holidays in places such as Turkey, where the substances are perhaps more readily available. We must try to ensure that the message gets out there that the substances can be dangerous.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale said that the majority of the people who take the substances suffer no ill effects. Regardless of the fact that they do not know what the substances are and the fact that there is nothing on the packet to say whether they should take one or two three times a day, as there is for prescribed drugs, to some extent people enjoy&#8212;I use that term very loosely&#8212;the fact that they are taking a substance that gives them a high. Personally, I do not understand that and have always found the taking of any drugs, unless they are prescribed drugs, difficult to understand. I have witnessed the impact of people taking drugs, which is death, and I have seen the impact on their families. When we talk about finding solutions, we should be talking about raising awareness.</p><p>Many years ago, I was involved in tackling drug, alcohol and solvent misuse among young people. Alex Johnstone made the point that we managed to get around the problem of solvent misuse, but that was because it had very physical signs. The problem that we have with the new substances cannot be resolved in the same way.</p><p>The minister said that she has been invited to be part of the Home Office&#8217;s review group. I pity the Home Office. I am sure that the minister will make a contribution and ensure that her voice is heard. When we are looking for solutions, we must not be insular but must acknowledge that the new psychoactive substances are a problem not just for Scotland, the UK and Europe, but globally.</p><p>How do people become aware of the availability of the substances through the internet and head shops? Kezia Dugdale is right that that happens partly through the social media network. Social media can be used in two ways: to raise awareness of the problems of new psychoactive substances but also to promote them. That is part of the problem that we have in the internet age, and we have seen it happen in other areas&#8212;I have spoken before about pro-anorexia websites. We need to get the balance right. Young people use social media, and if we are going to get our message across&#8212;as we do in our education system through the curriculum for excellence, which I applaud&#8212;we must use all the tools that are available to us, including the ones that our young people will focus on. We must get the message across through social media and through know the score so that people can access, understand and share the information. We can debate the problem here, but I am not sure how many young people listen to what goes on in this chamber.</p><p>We need to use the tools that are available to us. I hope that the minister will consider the social media factor in thinking about getting the information out to our young people. There is a huge global problem, and I think that it is beyond what we can measure at the moment. As Claire Baker touched on, we only hear about the people who land up in A and E or in the mortuary. The problem is much bigger and it is beyond the figures that the SDF has provided and perhaps beyond the knowledge of the alcohol and drug partnerships in our communities, but at least we are making a start and there are initiatives out there to try to resolve the problem.</p><p>I wish the minister well and I applaud the initiatives that have been taken so far. I sincerely hope that the minister will take on board some of the constructive comments that members have made.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would have been happy to stay seated and let Kezia Dugdale continue.

It seems to me that there is a lack of recognition of those posts in recruitment. There was maternity leave, but surely NHS Grampian would be able to put in place appropriate cover for things such as maternity leave.</p><p>NHS Grampian has had 33 patients receiving treatment outwith its area&#8212;in Glasgow and Edinburgh&#8212;based, it says, on clinical need and priority. That is 33 patients too many. As Tavish Scott and Lewis Macdonald rightly said, the anxiety of those patients and their families and carers has been compounded by the fact that they have had to move outwith the area. The logistics involved in patients having to go to Edinburgh or Glasgow may often not be supported by their friends or relatives.</p><p>The work and support that CLAN provides in Aberdeen are immeasurable. Obviously, the support that is given is welcomed, and what it does for patients is immeasurable. We need to acknowledge that. NHS Grampian is failing if it does not recognise the absolute importance of that on-going care.</p><p>I recognise that NHS Grampian took steps on recruitment in October and November, and that, just last week, it recruited a new oncology specialist. That is to be welcomed, but it still begs the question: why did that take so long? If there is a national problem in oncology recruitment in NHS boards in Scotland, the minister and the cabinet secretary should ask why.</p><p>To provide appropriate care for our cancer patients throughout the Grampian area, especially those who come from islands such as Shetland and Orkney, we need to ensure that they are given an even higher priority than perhaps those who live within city boundaries.</p><p>We need to ensure that NHS Grampian has a plan to ensure that we do not get into the position of, as the board has said, facing an unprecedented and very difficult problem, such as it has experienced recently. It is definitely down to a lack of planning. NHS Grampian needs to resolve that problem for the future.</p><p>We have to look at what else could be done to provide appropriate care for those who are having to travel from Shetland and Orkney, who Tavish Scott mentioned. He said that it is &#8220;no picnic&#8221; for them. Absolutely, but it is no picnic for those who travel from the far reaches of Aberdeenshire either. Patients have to travel into the city of Aberdeen from areas such as Braemar and Aboyne, and I assure Tavish Scott that it takes just as long to get to the Aberdeen royal from those areas as it takes to fly there from Shetland.</p><p>I believe that NHS Grampian needs to resolve this problem quickly.

That charity has gone from strength to strength and continues to support and rehabilitate not only veterans from recent wars such as those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland but veterans who have lost their sight due to age or infirmity. The charity has changed with the times, and the minister is sending a message that we must change with the times, too. There is a recognition that our veterans require additional support, which, for example, might take the form of their being placed at the top of the list for appropriate housing when they leave the forces, of general practitioner support being there when they need it or of hospital treatment being provided if it is needed.</p><p>I believe that the commissioner will be able to take up those issues and co-ordinate the many organisations that already exist and aid the partnership working that they do.

However, the issue is not just one of being able to use the limbs correctly, but one of coming to terms with the amputation and the psychological aspects of having lost a limb and why.</p><p>The minister has visited HorseBack UK, and there is an open invitation for him to return when the weather is slightly better so that he can enjoy getting into the saddle along with some of the veterans and experience some of the work that the charity does.</p><p>HorseBack UK is an integral part of the community in Aboyne and west Aberdeenshire. It tries to give something back to the community. It talks about its work being about repaying and embracing its community. Most of its work is done outdoors, and it has school visits. It also provides team-building training for oil and gas companies. It provides professional strands of training through the disciplines that have been learnt through the military. It has given to many veterans who have struggled and continue to struggle with mental health issues a real sense of purpose in the community.

I mention that because, many years ago, when I was with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, I used to speak at its conferences and spoke to colleagues in Northern Ireland when we held joint conferences. The idea that we discussed was that it was important to go beyond the eye and to understand that, behind the eye, there is a person&#8212;a person who has feelings and who is, quite often, anxious about and dismayed by what is happening with their sight.</p><p>I was also fortunate to have been invited to present lectures at Glasgow Caledonian University to optometry students in their final year. Again, I took the opportunity to emphasis the fact of the person behind the eye. I want optometrists to realise that, when they are explaining a condition to a patient, they must do so in terms that are understandable to the patient.</p><p>When we are talking about a cataract and, perhaps, its removal, that is fine. However, in the past, people often used to believe that, when they had their operation, they would get their sight back. I am not blaming optometrists and perhaps not even ophthalmologists for that, but they failed to tell patients that they would get only their remaining sight back. For example, if a patient had macular degeneration and a cataract, they would still have macular degeneration, so they would not get their full vision back. We need to encourage our optometrists to convey that sort of information to the patients when they see them.</p><p>I talked to one or two optometrists who were at the SNP conference. They understand and realise that they can do more as a signposting agency. I go back to the mid-1980s, when I worked with Sudi Patel. Some optometrists might cringe when they hear that name, but he was probably a forerunner of the low vision service in Glasgow. At that time, Glasgow was providing a one-stop shop and bringing the low vision service to the patient group through the social work service. That was a forerunner of the services that we have now. The RNIB has taken that forward through the years and continues to do so.</p><p>We continue to see the benefits of eye care health and the new strategy for vision in Scotland, because early intervention saves sight. If somebody has wet macular degeneration, we have only a small window of opportunity to save that person&#8217;s sight. If it goes undetected, the person will lose their sight. Various other conditions such as glaucoma or retinitis pigmentosa can be detected early, and optometrists can give advice and provide understanding to the patient group.</p><p>The fact that community optometrists are now doing much more than they have done in the past means that people do not have to go to their general practitioners. They can go and see their optometrist and not take up valuable time with a GP who, I am sorry to say, might not have the expertise to diagnose what is wrong with the person&#8217;s sight in the first place.</p><p>Over the years, the partnership working between optometry, ophthalmology and social services has shifted.

When we talk about a person-centred approach, we must ensure that we are being inclusive. People generally live their lives not in isolation but in a community, if not in a family, and if we do not involve the family or the community, these people might, as Gil Paterson suggested, question their sense of worth. Before they move on to the road to recovery, a person has to identify where they are at and where, perhaps, they would like to be. Sometimes that will require someone else&#8212;say, a professional&#8212;giving them appropriate guidance and the sense that they are being listened to and that they are very much important.</p><p>I accept Gil Paterson&#8217;s comments about poverty and health inequality&#8212;those issues create problems. However, I say to the chamber that I have seen drug addiction in the affluent areas of the north-east. I have seen it happen in situations in which money is no object. I have seen it affecting families who, to some extent, are unaware that it is happening, because it has not impacted on their family life, in so far as the mortgage and bills are still getting paid. However, the misuse is still going on.</p><p>We have moved on a great deal in the area of stigma around drug addiction. One of the areas in which we have moved on to a greater extent than people give us credit for is in the community pharmacy service. That service has been embraced by communities, and I commend the work that community pharmacists are doing across Scotland. In Grampian, there are 131 community pharmacy practices. I believe that 127 are engaged in the area that we are discussing. That is to be commended.</p><p>People in the community pharmacy can see the bigger picture. They see the individual coming in to get their prescription for methadone, but they can also see the wife, the father, the mother or the brother coming in to get a prescription for something that might perhaps help them to cope with the addiction of one of their loved ones.</p><p>We have a long way to go, but we have made significant progress.</p><p>I congratulate my friend and colleague Christian Allard for sharing a very personal story with the chamber. Many of us can look at our personal circumstances and reflect on where we and our families are. When I worked in social work, I came across many examples of despair and absolute tragedy&#8212;the parent asking, &#8220;Why? Why did my daughter die? Why did it happen? What did I do wrong?&#8221; They carry guilt for the rest of their lives, believing that they should have done something. However, in reality, they probably did all that they could. It is when we turn our back on people requiring our help&#8212;when we turn our back on people in our community and our society because we do not approve of them&#8212;that we should feel guilty.</p><p>I believe that, in this chamber, we have a consensus to move things forward. I appreciate what Mary Scanlon said. Perhaps the process is not moving quickly enough. However, I think that it is moving at a pace that we can evaluate and that will ensure that the evidence is there, because we need that evidence base if we are to move forward in a way that might prevent deaths in the future.</p><p>We will never get to the bottom of this. As ever, Stewart Stevenson brought history back to the chamber.

I welcome to the public gallery members of the public who have an interest in the debate, and I welcome those who are following the debate online.</p><p>It is fitting that this debate comes soon after Jackie Baillie&#8217;s debate last week on no more page 3. I mention that because it, too, was about body image. Sarah Boyack made a pertinent contribution to that debate. She mentioned body image and its impact on even our youngest people, and I think that she mentioned clothes that were fashioned for three-year-olds.</p><p>Mannequins in our high street shops do not reflect the people in our streets. They do not reflect the reality of the shapes and sizes of people in our society. They are there to extenuate the fashion that is draped over them. They are often size 10 or below, they often have extenuated limbs, and they tend to be on the slightly tall side.</p><p>I welcome the steps that Debenhams has taken. In September, Jo Swinson MP said that we should axe size 10 mannequins from all our high street stores because they do not reflect the people and the shapes and sizes that we come in. Debenhams has taken that seriously. It has decided to use mannequins up to size 16&#8212;it still has sizes 10, 12 and 14. It also reflects people of an older age group, people with disabilities and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. That is to be welcomed, but it is happening only in the Debenhams store in Oxford Street in London. If Debenhams really wants to make the impact that I hope it wants to make, it needs to roll that out into all its stores in the United Kingdom, and the retail industry needs to look at what it is doing and why it is doing it.</p><p>Members know that I have personal experience of the impact of the image that is portrayed in the fashion industry. I learned only today that Edinburgh college of art, which is now part of the University of Edinburgh, has taken a stance against the so-called size zero, thin or skinny&#8212;whatever the term may be&#8212;in portraying fashion. It has decided to embrace people&#8217;s different shapes and sizes. All the students who take the college&#8217;s fashion degree now look at society as a whole and embrace that image.</p><p>The impact is global; it is not just here in the UK. When I was doing the research for the debate, I came across an interesting fact. Israel has introduced legislation that says that models cannot walk on the catwalk unless their body mass index is 18.5 or over. I am not calling for legislation; I am calling for a sense of reality. If we are going to have mannequins in our high street shops that illustrate the fashion that is out there, they need to be life size, and they need to reflect the sizes and shapes of people in our communities.</p><p>The fashion industry is taking that seriously. Led by the editor of Vogue Italia, 19 other editors of the Vogue magazines globally have a health pact. They have decided that it is irresponsible of them to have the emaciated models who have been in their magazines for years. They, too, look at the BMI of models whom the magazines photograph and who portray the fashion industry.</p><p>If we are to make an impact to assist people who have low self-image about their shape and body size, it is imperative that the industry takes a lead on that. The industry can be part of a solution, not part of a problem. It can listen to the calls from me in the chamber this evening and from the wider community, and I believe that it is listening. People are no longer satisfied to see glorified images in high street shop windows that do not bear any resemblance at all to people&#8217;s shapes and sizes.</p><p>In conclusion, mannequins or photographs in fashion magazines do not cause eating disorders but they exacerbate the condition in people who are predisposed to or have an eating disorder. They hinder those people who are on the pathway to recovery by putting up barriers and obstacles. I urge the retail industry to get real and show us images that reflect the shape and size of people in the communities in which we live.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740400", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Size 10 Models and Mannequins"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to bring this debate to the chamber this evening.

First of all, however, I want to congratulate Alex Johnstone on the informative and educational journey that he is continuing to take through the committee&#8217;s evidence-taking sessions. I applaud him.</p><p>Just before recess, I had the privilege of attending the Scottish accessible transport alliance annual general meeting. I was asked to present awards at the meeting, one of which was for a community transport initiative that had been going for the past 27 years. Some of us will remember the Manpower Services Commission; this particular transport initiative, which covers Stirling, Falkirk and Clackmannan, started as a result of the commission with two minibuses. It now has 27 buses and more than 40 volunteers. Not only has it been successful in providing a community transport lifeline to many vulnerable and disabled people, but it has taken the initiative to step beyond community transport and compete with commercial transport, putting the profits from its commercial bus service back into the community transport initiative. I am sure that the minister is familiar with the service, given that he is the constituency MSP for the area.</p><p>Of course the initiative has been successful only because of the dedication of its volunteers, particularly Duncan Hearsum. He has been part of it from the very start, and I was privileged and proud to present an award to Mr Hearsum at the awards ceremony. I suggest that, if we are looking for a model of good practice and a way of dealing with the challenges, difficulties and hurdles that community transport faces, we consider the dial-a-journey service in that area.</p><p>As has been mentioned, community transport means different things in different areas of Scotland. In my Aberdeenshire West constituency, the A2B dial-a-bus service provides an essential lifeline for many, simply because there is often no commercial transport to get people from their homes to hospitals, shops or leisure pursuits.</p><p>Even when commercial transport is available, a person with a disability can quite often be denied access to it. For example, the vehicle might not be compatible with their needs; worse, constituents have informed me that they can be waiting at a bus stop in their wheelchair but when the bus comes along the driver tells them, &#8220;Sorry, but you can&#8217;t get on.&#8221; Either the space has been taken up by buggies or people have refused to move and the bus simply moves on.</p><p>That is totally unacceptable. People should never be able to pass a person in a wheelchair at a bus stop and say, &#8220;Sorry, you can&#8217;t come on this bus.&#8221; The drivers probably had training, and I am sure that Stagecoach has told me on more than one occasion that all its drivers go through disability awareness training. It is a pity that they sometimes do not put that training into practice.</p><p>That is the difference with community transport. The dedication of the volunteers who provide the community transport service means that they would never leave someone at the roadside. In fact, they go the extra mile. They do not just get the person from their home to the bus; they often wait for the person while they do their shopping, go to a hospital appointment, or perhaps meet a friend, even just for a cup of coffee.</p><p>Margaret McCulloch mentioned the preventative spend initiative. We need to take cognisance of that and the benefits for disabled and elderly people. Community transport is their only lifeline to get out and about somewhere different, to visit a friend or a relative in hospital, or to do something else that they could not otherwise do by themselves. A minibus is not always required; often, just a car with a dedicated driver is required. The Shopmobility service in my area in Aberdeen provides just such a service.</p><p>We have heard about community transport initiatives and the dedication of volunteers throughout Scotland. That is the real value of community transport. The issue is not to do with how much it actually costs; it is about how much is put in. That is the value of the volunteers. We probably cannot quantify the real, absolute cost. I do not know how to measure dedication, but I value it, and I know that everyone who uses the community transport services in my area and throughout Scotland values the commitment and dedication of the volunteers.</p><p>We need to try to ensure that community transport has a future but, to be perfectly frank, some organisations need to be smarter. There can sometimes be a similar service a few miles down the road. We need to be smarter in engaging the agencies and getting them to come together and work together. There is no point in a patient transport service picking up someone at one end of the street to go to hospital and a community transport car at the other end of the street going to the same hospital. That does not make sense. We need better co-ordination and planning, but most of all we probably need the commitment that the transport minister has already given this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For the first part of my speech, I will take the unusual step of not speaking about my constituency.

With regard to Sir Ian Wood&#8217;s interim report maybe I should say the local loon has done nae bad. That is quite a credit for a Doric loon. When I read the report&#8217;s recommendations, I wondered whether Sir Ian Wood was looking at some of the work that was going on in the north-east.</p><p>In my constituency of Aberdeenshire West&#8212;I know that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is very much aware of this&#8212;Westhill academy provides a module for our young secondary 2 students called your energy, your future, which is about providing information. Given that the north-east is obviously the European hub of excellence for oil and gas, and certainly for the subsea sector, we probably think that that is what the young students would be focused on. However, the module takes the curriculum for excellence to its intended pathways and looks at the infrastructure that is built around the whole energy sector. It tries to ensure that young men and women are looking to opportunities not just within the sector, in the North Sea, but in the infrastructure that supports the sector.</p><p>At one of the workshops that I was at, the young students made presentations to businesspeople looking at how they would engage across the whole sector. One young lad said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m deen this because I was asked to but I&#8217;m nae interested in oil&#8212;I want to be a chef.&#8221; Absolutely. When it was put to him, &#8220;Do you think the sector requires chefs offshore?&#8221; he indicated that he had not considered that. Now, although we require chefs in our hospitality sector in the north-east, we also require chefs offshore, to support the men and women who work offshore. The experience made me wonder how many young people in school in the north-east think only about drilling and the messy side of stuff when they think about oil and gas. Maybe that is one of the reasons why young people, and young women in particular, do not get involved in the engineering sector.</p><p>When I was a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee, we undertook an inquiry into women and work and heard evidence on the matter. Perhaps some young women do not get involved in engineering because they have the idea that it is all about hard hats, oil and mess.</p><p>The model that I am talking about can be applied throughout Scotland. We need to align our education system to the need for skills in Scotland&#8217;s areas and regions. The north-east is perhaps an easy example. Unemployment is certainly very low.</p><p>During the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s visit to Heriot-Watt University, to launch our report on underemployment in Scotland, I talked to careers advisers. One of them said to me, &#8220;Overseas students at the university are engaging with careers advice here, but our home-grown youngsters are not doing so.&#8221; I wondered why they had not resolved the problem. If they know that students are not engaging, have they tried to find out why? What are they doing to resolve the problem?</p><p>I take on board Jenny Marra&#8217;s point about the need for careers advice at a much earlier stage. That is why I am so excited about the S2 module in Aberdeenshire, which is being rolled out in parts of Aberdeen city and gives young people a bigger, broader idea about the world of work. They have probably grown up with stereotypical ideas of what a policeman, firefighter, doctor or person in education is. We need to get beyond that and consider the skills that are required.</p><p>In recommendation 10, the commission talks about young people who are at risk of disengaging from education. I do not think that young people become disengaged; I think that they are just not interested in what is being taught to them at a particular time. We need to find out what sparks their interest. When we do that, we can channel them down. That is what CFE is about: finding the right pathway for our youngsters in education, through to college or university.</p><p>I endorse John Mason&#8217;s comments. We should stop putting university education on a higher plateau than other sectors.

Some of our wealthier farmers can probably employ accountants and farm managers to look after that side of the business, but many farmers simply have to come to terms with its outcomes. Our farming community wants to know what will be there for it at the end of the day, to ensure that it can continue to farm and to help production by our food and drink industry.</p><p>I am fortunate to be in quite a diverse constituency, within which there is a great deal of farming. I have heard farmers ask whether it is right that decisions are made in Europe in the small hours of the morning when probably the last thing on negotiators&#8217; minds is how to achieve the best outcomes for farmers rather than when they can get out of the room and to their beds.

If so, perhaps we should unite behind the cabinet secretary at decision time, because the only way that I can see for us and our farmers to get a fairer deal is for Scotland to be at the top table in Europe, making the decisions there and working with the other member states&#8212;not sitting outside the office of the UK secretary of state, waiting for him to return so that we can be informed of how the negotiations are going.</p><p>Our food and drink industry is extremely important to Scotland, but we must ensure that production continues and does so for the good of the people&#8212;I take that term from Alison Johnstone&#8217;s comments earlier&#8212;not only in the farming industry but in the wider communities of Scotland.</p><p>It should also continue for the good of our countryside. We need to ensure that our farming is supported so that we can ensure that our countryside&#8212;our Scotland&#8212;is a better place to live in, that it has diversity and that we achieve our climate change targets. However, to do that, we must ensure that the appropriate supports are given to those who look after our land.</p><p>Mike MacKenzie gave a picture-postcard image of Scotland in its full ruggedness and scenic beauty. That is Scotland. We have what we have and our farmers make the best of what we have. Our sheep farmers ensure that we make the best of our rugged Scotland. We have our cattle, deer and crops. Our whisky industry thrives on the production of good crops in Scotland and our exports to the rest of the world bring money back into our economy.</p><p>We support a huge rural society. Our rural communities are dependent on good farming for the future, and the future of our farming is dependent on a good future for our nation.</p><p>I do not believe that we have a fair deal. The best has not been done with the CAP. I welcome Alex Fergusson&#8217;s comments that he will do what he can to ensure that we get the appropriate uplift in the coupling.

They were much more enthusiastic than I would be in taking up the game.</p><p>In widening the scope of the debate, I want to mention that 2014 is an important year for Scotland. As we all know, 2014 is the year of homecoming, the year of the Commonwealth games, the year of the world sheepdog trials&#8212;for the first time, they will be held in Scotland, in Tain&#8212;and the year of the referendum. Of course, it will also be the year of the Ryder cup. Just before the Ryder cup takes place, perhaps history will be written and, with the will of the people, the Ryder cup will be played in an independent Scotland for the first time.</p><p>The Ryder cup and the other events that will come to Scotland next year will bring massive opportunities. We should open the doors to the vast areas that we have in Scotland. My constituency has 12 castles and one palace&#8212;that being Balmoral. I am not quite sure whether Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth knows that I am the MSP for the area, but the palace is in my constituency.</p><p>There are many opportunities for people to come prior to the Ryder cup and stay on after it to enjoy Scotland at its best. I am sure that, even during the Ryder cup, there will be golf widows and, perhaps, golf widowers. Why do they not take up the opportunity of visiting not only Scotland&#8217;s cities but many of our towns and villages, which will be able to offer our finest food and drink? In my constituency, we also have three distilleries&#8212;three fine distilleries, in fact.</p><p>The opportunities of, and the legacy from, the Ryder cup will be immense. Our transport infrastructure is benefiting by being upgraded for the Ryder cup. Our railway stations are an example. Aberdeen station&#8212;the closest to my constituency&#8212;will have free wi-fi facilities for the first time. That is, basically, a legacy from the Ryder cup.</p><p>Perhaps not so closely attached to the Ryder cup itself but still a legacy from it are the four charities that will benefit from it. In particular, Barnardo&#8217;s has said that young people could take the aspiration, spirit and ethos behind the Ryder cup&#8212;the inspiration behind the sport&#8212;in order to achieve. The coaching for life programme is the backbone of Quarriers at the moment.</p><p>Basically, the charities are saying that we should give our less-fortunate young people an opportunity. Let us embrace the spirit that will be around in the Ryder cup and give our young children, some of whom are less fortunate than others, an opportunity to reach their goals and to achieve their aspirations. That might not be to play golf; it might be to have a roof over their head or just to belong to a family.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the benefits that the Ryder cup will bring to the wider areas of Scotland and to those charities.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement about the 50 volunteers who will be supported. Through Skills Development Scotland, perhaps they will achieve their goals. Volunteering will have no financial implications for them; they will be supported throughout and will gain a qualification. Who knows where that might lead them in the future? It might lead them into golf&#8212;perhaps working in a golf club&#8212;or just into tourism and hospitality, but at least they will be given the opportunity that comes with being part of the Ryder cup agenda and part of the spirit of the Ryder cup.</p><p>In 2012, it was said that the European team&#8217;s achievement was a miracle. It was not a miracle but was achieved through hard work, sheer effort and belief. We should take forward that spirit of sheer effort and belief for 2014. Regardless of who wins, Scotland will be a winner. We will have the legacy. We will have brought the Ryder cup, as well as other organisations and agencies, here. Most of all, we will have had people coming from 75 countries to enjoy Scotland&#8217;s hospitality. I say to them: the door is open&#8212;please come to visit Scotland and see what we can offer.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As well as attending the open earlier this year, I had the great fortune of attending the British blind golf tournament, where I met many a person&#8212;with a range of disabilities, actually&#8212;who I am sure enjoyed the game.

When you extended the time for speeches to seven minutes, I put my hand in my pocket and took out my throat lozenges. I certainly hope to be able to attain six minutes.</p><p>The debate is an important one, and it is about people&#8212;individuals. We refer in a generic way to &#8220;people with learning disabilities&#8221;, but the spectrum is vast. I want to touch on one or two aspects of individuals who have learning disabilities.</p><p>Recommendation 1 in &#8220;The keys to life&#8221;, which looks at equality impact assessments, refers to &#8220;dignity, equality and non-discrimination&#8221;. If I were writing that recommendation, I would include &#8220;respect&#8221;, because we need to ensure that we are respectful to those with learning disabilities. In drawing up a strategy, we should be respectful to them: it is not a question of creating a society for people with learning disabilities but a question of creating a society that they are an integral part of. They should be shaping their future.</p><p>It is all very well that we sometimes articulate on behalf of people with learning disabilities. Sometimes it is right and proper for us to do that, as people with learning disabilities may not always be able to articulate exactly what they want because of their communication difficulty, but&#8212;to put it simply&#8212;we should try to create a society for individuals. Mary Scanlon mentioned person-centred care. We should always ensure that, when a single shared assessment is carried out, there is an individual care plan for the person concerned that allows them to live in our community and to be part of our society.</p><p>Of course support will be needed, and there is a need for an infrastructure. We must ensure that there is a structure in place to provide quality assurance. Stuart Maxwell said that, when it comes to the collection of data, the person with a learning disability is often invisible. That cannot be right.</p><p>What I would say to the minister is that, when we are collecting the data, we need to ensure that we are not just saying, &#8220;Here we have a person with a learning disability&#8221; but that we are saying that it is a black or ethnic minority person with a learning disability, a person with sensory impairment with a learning disability, or a person with whatever condition with a learning disability. We need to ensure that we cross-reference and collect the information that will be important in ensuring that we develop the society that we need for our people with learning disabilities.</p><p>I remember working with a young lad many years ago in Inverclyde in my days as a very young social worker. That young lad used to lash out every time that he went out to his day centre. He was physically abusive, kicking, punching and biting. Do you know why? His shoes were too tight. He could not communicate that, when people put his shoes on, they were hurting him. He did not have the ability to communicate that through speech, but it was obvious for those who wanted to take the time to look carefully that, every time that he put on a certain pair of shoes, he had a reaction. It was simple.</p><p>I commend the work by Optometry Scotland and opticians throughout Scotland in conjunction with RNIB Scotland to ensure that people with learning disabilities have their sight checked. We have found out that over 11,000 people with learning disabilities have a sight impairment. Quite often&#8212;again, this is very simple&#8212;giving a person a corrective lens in spectacles can enable them to see clearly, which can have an immense impact on their lives. We have found out that a person has been able to recognise a member of their family, a carer, the food on their plate and their favourite jumper. Why? Because they have been given the corrective lens that they needed. No one had previously thought of taking the individual to get their eyes tested. They just accepted that the person was knocking things over, screwing their eyes up and unable to recognise a member of their family&#8212;that cannot be right.</p><p>Sometimes we look for the complicated when we should be looking at the simple and the most obvious. I welcome the strategies, but I am not sure that we need 52. When reading the strategy document, I kept asking myself, &#8220;Did I read that earlier?&#8221;, and kept saying to myself, &#8220;It&#8217;s not the quantity but the quality.&#8221; I am hopeful that the Government, with cross-party support, will deliver for people a strategy and a document, and that, at the end of the day, we will deliver for individuals with learning disabilities in Scotland. It is about the individual, and that is what we should always focus on: the individual, with their specific need.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

No, I mean not the landslide win by the Scottish National Party, but the fact that we elected our first blind person to the Parliament&#8212;it took four sessions of Parliament. Although I am immensely privileged and feel greatly honoured to serve the people of Aberdeenshire West, it was not an easy journey.</p><p>My journey into politics goes back a good number of years. It was when I was out campaigning with a certain, much younger John Swinney&#8212;who probably had a full head of hair at the time&#8212;that he suggested that perhaps I should put myself forward to be vetted. He explained what that meant and I was okay with the suggestion, so I went forward, but then my journey became complicated, because I needed to access information from my own political party. To be fair and honest, information from my branch and constituency was not particularly accessible. Before, I had just been going along to meetings, not particularly wanting to rock the boat, but then for some reason I became a convener and suddenly found that I had to up my game.</p><p>Being a blind person in the political world is not a particularly easy journey, and I am sure that David Blunkett found it difficult at times. I am sure that he remembers more than one occasion when he picked up his papers and suddenly realised that the transcript into Braille was not what he was looking for and he was standing up to give a presentation in Parliament.</p><p>I, too, went through a difficult journey, as Dame Anne Begg did. I remember Dame Anne Begg on the access panels in Angus, back in the early 1980s, when we were campaigning side by side, trying to get councils to realise the difficulty that people with disabilities had in even getting access to buildings.</p><p>I commend the Scottish Parliament because, when I was elected, it probably had everything that I needed to come forward and try to be an equal in the chamber. The staff had done their research. Goodness knows how they knew that I was going to be elected, but they had done their research just in case. They had software programs, but they did not assume that what they had researched was what I wanted or needed, or what would enable me to participate in the chamber; there was no presumption there. They asked the questions: how can we help, what can we provide, what support do you need? That is all that it takes, a simple, simple question: what support do you need?</p><p>Every political party needs to raise its game and get people with disabilities into the political arena. However, people with disabilities also have a part to play. It is not just up to the community or to wider society to open the door: people with disabilities need to knock on that door. People with disabilities need to say, &#8220;I want to engage in the political world,&#8221; &#8220;I want to become a councillor in a local authority,&#8221; or &#8220;I want to become an MSP at Holyrood.&#8221; If such people do not come forward, the door will remain firmly closed.</p><p>We have a challenge. I ask all political parties to look at what they are providing and ask whether it is enough. I would say that it is not. They should ask how they support their elected members when they are being elected and whether that support is enough. That might be a subject for another debate.</p><p>I hope that by being the first blind MSP, I will open the door for others to become MSPs. I sincerely hope that I will continue to have the support not just of Parliament but of the electorate of Aberdeenshire West, because it is those people who put me here. They elected me.</p><p>The selection process is, however, another story and perhaps we need to look at the selection process for our members and, if we want representation by people with disabilities in this chamber, ensure that the selection process is fit for purpose.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled People in Politics"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, commend James Dornan for bringing this important debate to the chamber, and I thank all the organisations representing people with disabilities that provided the briefings for this evening.

Over the years&#8212;perhaps over the centuries&#8212;Gypsy Travellers have not been understood. As an individual who came to the Parliament and met the Gypsy Travelling community for the first time when we had an awareness session that was organised by MECOPP, I found myself with perhaps some ignorance about the community&#8217;s culture. It became evident that some of the Gypsy Travelling people who came to give evidence in Parliament were reluctant. They said, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point? We did this before. We came before and nothing&#8217;s happened.&#8221; MECOPP persuaded and perhaps lent on them slightly to come and give evidence, and they thought that perhaps something else could happen.</p><p>Linda Fabiani asked what has changed since 2001. Is it not disappointing to Parliament that, 12 years on, we are debating a situation that should have been dealt with back in 2001?

We cannot afford to miss the opportunity for change this time.</p><p>I listened with interest to the minister&#8217;s comments, to hear something that was perhaps different, which we could grasp and say, &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve got it right this time. Yes, we&#8217;re going out there to do what we should have done back in 2001. Yes, we&#8217;re going to empower the Gypsy Travelling community. Yes, we&#8217;re going to empower the people who need direction and leadership not just from the Government and the Parliament, but from COSLA and our local authorities.&#8221; However, I was disappointed, because I did not hear the bugle call or the cavalry charge.</p><p>The Gypsy Travelling community is not asking a lot; it is asking for the basics. It is asking for the basic right to go into a health centre and be cared for; the basic right to housing that does not leak; and perhaps the basic right to have indoor facilities. It is asking for basic rights for which the legislation already exists but is never enforced.</p><p>Murdo Fraser said that we need mutual respect. I agree with him, but let us get it right. A very small percentage of the Gypsy Travelling community go to unauthorised sites and leave them in a mess. The majority of the Gypsy Travelling community are upstanding, law-abiding citizens who just want the basic right to live as Gypsy Travellers in a community that has no prejudice towards them.</p><p>Margo MacDonald asked whether there was a difference between the Romany people and the other Gypsy Traveller communities. Yes there is. When we went to Clinterty in Aberdeen, we were told, &#8220;You know what the problem is? It&#8217;s the Irish Travellers who are coming over here and causing the problems. We&#8217;re getting the bad name because of&#8212;&#8221;. It happens in every community. I do not know whether problems are being caused by the Irish community. I do not know whether problems are being caused by those coming from eastern Europe, but regardless of that, there should be no prejudice towards our Gypsy Travelling community. They wish to live their lives as law-abiding members of a community.</p><p>When we took evidence, we heard that the majority of Gypsy Travellers do not wish to be part of the settled community, living in the heart of it. They are quite happy to have a site on the periphery, providing that they have access to a bus stop, healthcare, a shop and schools for their children. Is that too much to ask? I do not think so.</p><p>This Government needs to put its head above the parapet and say, &#8220;We cannot let 2013 go by like we let 2001 dissipate.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to Mary Fee, who was convener of the Equal Opportunities Committee in my time on it.

I also thank the organisations, particularly the British Heart Foundation.</p><p>Last week, I congratulated NHS Grampian on its work with specialist Parkinson&#8217;s nurses, but the story this week is not so good for NHS Grampian. Nanette Milne referred to nursing numbers in Aberdeen. To put that figure into context, we have three specialist heart failure nurses in the Aberdeenshire Council area, two in Aberdeen City and 0.2 full-time equivalents in Moray&#8212;there is none at all in Orkney. That amounts to about six specialist nurses; in reality, there are 3.24 full-time equivalents, two short of what is needed in the Grampian area.</p><p>It is important to distinguish the difference between specialist nurses that deal with heart failure and those who deal with cardiac rehabilitation&#8212;I asked the minister about that the other week&#8212;because they are not the same. We need to identify the value of specialist nurses; their work for people with heart failure is undoubtedly immeasurable.</p><p>We have heard from Dave Thompson the testimony of people at the cross-party group on heart disease and stroke. An answer to a parliamentary question included a breakdown of the number of specialist nurses from NHS Grampian, which is why we have the numbers. The health board acknowledged that, were it to remove the heart failure nurses, it would see a rise in acute admissions. That would cause anxiety not only to patients but to their families. I urge NHS Grampian, which is carrying out a review of all its cardiac services that will report in August 2013, to consider the importance of those nurses.</p><p>Nanette Milne said that the funding is coming to an end. It comes to an end in March 2014 but, because of the nurses&#8217; contractual agreements, they may be redeployed as early as September or October. There is undoubtedly a crisis in NHS Grampian that needs acute remedy. We need more specialist nurses. We realise that funding is difficult across all health boards. Jackie Baillie and Dave Thompson mentioned the monetary aspect, which needs to be borne in mind, but, beyond that, the issue is about the service that is provided for the patients and their families.</p><p>Nanette Milne said that treatments are not always face to face or in hospitals or their satellites, but over the phone. We can use technology, including telecare services. For example, we could sometimes use telemedicine in Orkney, as we do in other areas. We must be cleverer in remote and rural areas. I suggest to all health boards that they use the available facilities and technology to provide a heart failure service to our patients and carers.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694546", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Specialist Heart Failure Nurse Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Dave Thompson on securing a debate on this important subject and bringing it to the chamber.

Like Malcolm Chisholm, I was fortunate enough to meet some of them in committee room 1 earlier.

That funding has created a two-year post for a specialist nurse in Moray, in the Grampian region, and that is to be welcomed because it is providing the necessary specialism that people need.</p><p>Education and awareness must be at the forefront of what we do. We ask a lot of our GPs. Many times, I have said in the chamber that GPs need to be more aware, but I have a great deal of sympathy for them sometimes. We must recognise that if they do not have the knowledge, they must know where to go to seek that knowledge. The matter should not be put to one side; the GP must recognise that the patient has an issue and maybe a problem. Early diagnosis is important in ensuring that patients get the best possible care.</p><p>When I was talking to the small group in the committee room, what came across was the importance of getting medication at the right time during treatment. I know Parkinson&#8217;s, because my father has had it for more than 20 years. He is an ex-trawlerman and when he came on shore, he worked at the council in the parks. He was a very active man. When he contracted Parkinson&#8217;s, there was a physical change and a mental change, but he then realised, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to adjust. I&#8217;ve got to live with this condition. I&#8217;m not going to sit down and say I&#8217;m nae able.&#8221; We started laughing in the committee room when we talked about that. It is not about sitting back and saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; People have to have a positive attitude. That is what the specialist nurses bring to the patient group and the carers. They have a can-do approach. It is about saying, &#8220;This is how we can live with the condition. This is how we can adjust our lives to the condition.&#8221; Patients might reach a plateau in that adjustment and then, all of a sudden, the condition deteriorates and they think, &#8220;We have to adjust again, because we owe it to ourselves as individuals and to our family and those who care for us.&#8221;</p><p>Once again, I thank James Kelly for lodging this important motion and I certainly congratulate all those who have managed to come to the chamber this afternoon, because a journey is not always easy for people with Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694006", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parkinson&#8217;s Nurses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank James Kelly for lodging this important motion and welcome those in the public gallery this evening.

Thank you. I would certainly welcome an indication that I have two minutes to finish, to ensure that I come to my concluding remarks.</p><p>The debate has been very interesting and informative, and a great deal has been said about many of the issues.</p><p>Before I speak about the constraints of underemployment, I should say that the definition of underemployment perhaps needs to be looked at again. Stewart Stevenson, I think, said that the committee went into great detail on the definition of underemployment. I was certainly not familiar with the term until we started our consideration and, having heard members, I am not sure that everyone has grasped the definition that was presented in the report.</p><p>Some people choose to work part time. I remember people coming to me as an employer and asking whether they could reduce their hours, for a variety of reasons, and I had to make a judgment in light of their particular needs and those of the organisation. That was their choice. However, that is not defined as underemployment. The definition includes those who wish to work longer hours&#8212;those who seek to work additional hours&#8212;and those who have skills and are perhaps overskilled for the jobs that they are doing. We must be very clear about the definition. I commend to members the definition in the report.</p><p>On the various areas of constraint around underemployment, in his opening remarks the convener of the committee mentioned young people and women. Of course, the third category is people with disabilities, who are probably overrepresented in the underemployment area. Capability Scotland said that they are overrepresented and that they have fewer opportunities of getting into the job market, as there is less choice for many of them given the nature of their disabilities. I take on board the minister&#8217;s remarks. A lot of work has been done to try to balance the inequality around people with disabilities and get them back into the workplace.</p><p>I commend the cabinet secretary&#8217;s opening remarks. He took on board many of the recommendations in the report. It was very welcome to hear him and the minister saying that the Government recognises that there is more to be done and that they are willing to look at ensuring that we get more appropriate data so that we can consider not just the evidence but perhaps appropriate solutions in the underemployment area. It is a matter of taking on the whole workforce and trying to ensure that we match up the work that is available with the skills that people have.</p><p>Underemployment does not occur in only one particular area of the country; rather, there are regional variations. We know that underemployment in regions varies. I have learned something this afternoon that I did not know: that Mary Scanlon is a Dundonian. The underemployment rate for Dundee is 13.6 per cent. In Aberdeenshire, part of which is my constituency, the figure is 9.1 per cent, so there are variations. I apologise to members from the central belt for not giving the figures for their areas.</p><p>We need to ask local authorities to collect appropriate data so that, when they look at their employability strategies for their areas, they have the most appropriate and up-to-date information. That will enable them to try to resolve some of the problems of underemployment. The Government has made a commitment to look at the data, but the committee has also asked for local authorities to try to collect appropriate data to ensure that we can find solutions to the problem.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Underemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You are very generous, Presiding Officer.

He probably deserves the accolade of being the swot on the EET Committee with reference to that.</p><p>The other area that I want to comment on is in-work poverty, which is a term that I am not comfortable with. I commend Duncan McNeil for his speech, which was delivered extremely well. He spoke with a great deal of emotion and passion, and he was absolutely right. Many people will take a job regardless because, in the main, people want to work. However, we are finding that people are working but the pay cheque at the end of the day is not rewarding enough. The problem with the benefits system and welfare reform is that people are finding themselves in even greater poverty than they were in before. Students can also be in in-work poverty.

As a non-car driver&#8212;which I am sure is a great relief to many here&#8212;I take the train from my home station of Stonehaven to Edinburgh on a weekly basis. On those journeys I am becoming more aware of the increasing number of passengers using their laptops on the train, just as I do. The inclusion of the wi-fi service is certainly making my job much easier, given the connectivity. However, we must acknowledge that there are black spots on the line, although that is no fault of First ScotRail or the Government.</p><p>I hear and accept the cry for better train journey times. However, we have to take cognisance of the fact that not everyone lives in the major cities. Some people rely on trains stopping at intermediate stations. I said that I use the station in my home town of Stonehaven. I certainly appreciate the fact that, with the new timetabling, more trains are stopping there. However, in looking beyond the peripheries of our cities, we sometimes need to be a bit more imaginative if we want more car drivers to leave their cars at home and take the last few miles, or even 20 miles, into the city centre by train. I urge First ScotRail to look at its timetabling to see whether more trains can stop at the likes of Stonehaven and, indeed, Inverurie.</p><p>Perhaps we could be more imaginative when it comes to the franchise. Perhaps the minister could discuss with First ScotRail or any other provider the possibility of having a shuttle service&#8212;I am not talking about the express train between Aberdeen and Edinburgh or Glasgow&#8212;for commuters going from Stonehaven to Inverurie. That would provide a fantastic opportunity for more people to leave their cars at their home station and would provide better connectivity for passengers in those areas.</p><p>The journey from Stonehaven to Edinburgh is just over two hours. It is not a long journey, but it is much more comfortable when I take the East Coast train or the CrossCountry train.

It is because, sometimes, young people are offered accommodation that most of us would not think was fit for habitation.

Since Rhoda Grant raised the question of the referendum, I point out that the fact that Scotland will, I believe, become an independent country is why the concordat is especially valuable to the UK. We are producing vast amounts of electricity through renewables.</p><p>The UK Energy Bill has three basic principles: one is to keep the lights on; the second is to have affordable electricity, not just for industry but for consumers; and the third is to deal with the decarbonisation of electricity production. Those are laudable and commendable principles in the objectives of the bill, but we probably all feel that progress is somewhat slow in some areas.</p><p>On keeping the lights on, we can probably reassure our fellow citizens in the rest of the UK that Scotland will do its bit to ensure that the lights do not go out in England after the referendum. We are on target to produce at least 50 per cent of our electricity from renewables by 2015 and 100 per cent by 2020. Renewables are the future for Scotland&#8212;there is no doubt about that. With offshore and onshore wind, tidal and wave generation, we have the ability, the capacity and the skilled workforce. At present, more than 11,000 people work in the renewables industry, with a projection of at least another 50,000 by 2020.</p><p>Scotland is known as the oil and gas capital of Europe, but it can also be known as the green energy capital of Europe. There is no doubt in my mind that that is possible. That should be our aspiration, and we should strive to do everything to ensure that it actually happens. The European Commissioner for Energy has said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland is an energy powerhouse in Europe.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with him&#8212;we certainly are. We are moving in the right direction, not just to ensure affordable electricity for consumers and industry, but to create jobs for our people and use our skilled workforce. I believe that that skilled workforce has the ability and technology to ensure that we have electricity and energy for the rest of the century.</p><p>We need to ensure that we have equity of affordability. That is where we come to transmission charges. We need to ensure that people on the islands are not penalised or discriminated against in their bills or in charges for access to the grid. That is unfair and, as I say, discriminatory.</p><p>The minister&#8217;s work with the UK Government is to be applauded. Perhaps things could move just a little quicker.

However, the more remote and rural areas of Scotland do not always provide the connectivity to enable people to apply online. Perhaps that is why the Westminster Government set the target at 80 per cent, but I must ask: did the DWP carry out a mapping exercise to establish which areas of Scotland do not have the necessary connectivity to enable people to make their applications online?</p><p>When I asked some searching questions at a DWP briefing just the other week, the answer to many of the questions was that the officials would need to come back with an answer later. Despite what Mr Johnstone said, I think that the Citizens Advice Scotland figures are an accurate representation of the customers that go through its doors&#8212;and the number of those customers is ever increasing due to the welfare reforms that we are now experiencing. My questions were fairly basic. For example, are people able to make an online application? If the answer to that is no, who will be there to support them?</p><p>Mr Johnstone said that the DWP will ensure that people have the face-to-face assistance that they require. How many staff will the DWP employ who have the appropriate skills to enable that assessment and completion of the forms? What provision will the DWP make for the mileage and time that are involved in visiting people in remote and rural areas? How long will it be before people can apply for the benefits to which they are entitled? Will they have to wait two weeks, four weeks or six months before the face-to-face contact happens? For how long will people have to be penalised because they have no access to the online facility?</p><p>There is an assumption that people could perhaps mobilise themselves and get into towns where they could use libraries or other places with internet facilities. However, many people with disabilities do not have the mobility or freedom to do that. Often, transport is not available to enable people in some of our remote and rural areas to get into town, complete an application and get back&#8212;it just does not happen. The DWP needs to take a hard look at the issue, map out the exercise and ask itself searching questions about why some people will be unable to complete the online application.</p><p>We have heard that, in places such as Glasgow, nearly half of people do not have internet access. Not all of them are in Citizens Advice Scotland&#8217;s customer group. It is just a fact that some people do not have internet access and that, even if they did, they might not have the ability to complete the application.</p><p>I support the advance of technology and I use technology every day. I think that I am a fairly competent user of the technology that is available to me. However, I have difficulty completing many online forms and I quite often have to ask for assistance. Some forms that are deemed to be accessible are not useable with the software that I use. The software that many people would have to install on their computers is extremely costly. People who are on a low income do not have the finances to install that software.</p><p>We need to congratulate Citizens Advice Scotland on all the work that it does to try to alleviate some of the hardships for many people in trying to come to terms with the welfare reform that the Westminster Government has imposed on us. It is incumbent on all members of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that we do what we can to try to alleviate some of the hardships for the people who come to us.

For the most part, I felt that we would get through the debate in a very consensual manner. It is perhaps unfortunate that the previous speaker decided to politicise it.</p><p>I worked in the third sector prior to being elected and I was very much aware of the importance of three-year funding. The organisation that I worked for was perhaps one of the rare ones that were referred to earlier, because we had three-year funding. I was very much aware of the fact that other third sector organisations were given only one-year funding. That precluded organisations from forward planning and staff from feeling confident about their future. That had an impact on how services were delivered to the wider community.</p><p>The issue is not all about funding and money; it is about confidence. Gavin Brown mentioned professionalism. There is professionalism&#8212;and trust&#8212;in the third sector that I know. The community at large trusts the third sector.</p><p>I keep talking about the third sector rather than the voluntary sector because I believe that the use of the term &#8220;third sector&#8221; confers kudos to it. We have the public sector, we have the private sector and we have the third sector. I sometimes think that talking about the voluntary sector creates a perception in people&#8217;s minds that everyone in the sector is a volunteer. The majority of people in the third sector are employed to provide a service. Of course, they are quite often complemented by many volunteers, to ensure that the service is delivered in the way that the customer group needs it to be.</p><p>Three-year funding is essential for organisations. There is probably historical evidence that organisations have been delivering using year-on-year contracts. However, it is essential that we ensure that we are getting best value for each pound. Councils are strapped for cash sometimes, and they need to ensure that whoever is providing a service on their behalf is doing so to the best of their ability and is meeting needs fully, to the full value of the money that is being spent. That is why it is important that agencies do not replicate the work of other agencies in the sector. Those that are doing so should consider merging. When organisations consider what they can provide and who they are providing for, they should take a look at their neighbouring organisations and ask whether they are doing the same job and, if so, whether they could come together, if only for one project. That can sometimes deliver the best value for the clients in the area.</p><p>I was a service manager in the first agency in Scotland to bring sensory impairment issues under one roof. That was the result of a merger of two organisations that came together to deliver the best possible service for a community.

The sector works to establish a mixed energy programme for the future, and it provides skills, jobs and opportunities for the future.</p><p>I was interested in the reference in Murdo Fraser&#8217;s motion to the tax incentives for the oil and gas industry. Of course those exist, but they do so because, in 2011, George Osborne introduced a tax hike on the oil and gas industry but, after pressure from Malcolm Webb, Sir Ian Wood and others in the industry, he felt that he had to make a U-turn. That was because he got it absolutely wrong.

In my Aberdeenshire West constituency, we have some of the best butchers in Scotland. To give some flavour of why I say that, I might point to A &amp; G Collie of Kemnay, which won this year&#8217;s Scottish Countryside Alliance butcher award. Collie won the award against all adversity: his shop was burned down, so he got a portakabin and continued trading, but was burgled just before Christmas. Despite all the tragedy that had befallen him, he ensured that every customer&#8217;s Christmas order was delivered on time. He is a worthy person for the Scottish Countryside Alliance award.</p><p>We also have Gary Raeburn of Huntly, who was young butcher of the year last year. Along with butcher Andrew Peter from Inverurie, he will represent Aberdeenshire at the meat skills Scotland competition in Perth in May. I wish them both well.</p><p>My constituency also has the privilege of having H M Sheridan Ltd as butcher in Ballater. For years, Sheridan has provided meats and produce for the royal family at Balmoral and continues to do so. As well as having the royal warrant for that, Sheridan also takes his meats and produce out to various farmers markets. He is certainly appreciated in Westhill, where there is no butcher for a population of more than 11,000. Mr Sheridan takes the meats from Ballater to Westhill, and they are enjoyed by the people there and from the surrounding area.</p><p>Not every town and village has a butcher, so we have become overreliant on our supermarkets. For months, since being returned to Parliament, I have been campaigning to ensure that local produce is available in our supermarkets. What is grown locally and produced locally should be sold locally. That would take into account the animal welfare aspects, given the fact that we would not need to transport our animals so far.</p><p>It is disappointing that Scottish produce is not the major product on our supermarket shelves. I recently wrote to Tesco to complain that only 28 per cent of its lamb was Scottish, with the rest coming from New Zealand. That is a scandal because we have some of the best meat products&#8212;lamb, poultry and fish&#8212;here in Scotland. As Alex Fergusson suggested, we should put more pressure on our supermarkets to ensure that they sell local produce to the people in our communities.</p><p>I congratulate Nigel Don on securing the debate on his motion.

However, it is about not just the early years but the early days and weeks. Health visitors go out to visit parents of newborns within 10 to 14 days, which is extremely important because that is quite often when problems arise, perhaps because parents are looking after their first child or because they have a large family and cannot manage with a newborn.

I congratulate the National Union of Students on the work that it does with students to bring them through difficult times during exams and through various other problems that many students have in their lives. However, it is perhaps a good thing that people turn to antidepressants to enable them to cope rather than try to hide the symptom and bury their head in shame, because it is not a shameful thing to be mentally ill.

It is extremely important that the appropriate services are there for those people.

In my Aberdeenshire West constituency and indeed in the north-east of Scotland, there seem to be far greater employment opportunities than in the rest of Scotland, perhaps because of our thriving energy sector. In saying that, I do not want to take away from tomorrow&#8217;s debate on oil and gas&#8212;I am merely pointing out that the oil and gas and renewables sectors provide opportunities for employment.</p><p>That said, the Finance Committee&#8217;s report contains the realisation that there is a great deal of complexity around the initiatives for our young people to get into employment. The issue has also been recognised in the north-east. I know that there is an &#163;18 million initiative that includes funding for setting up the energy skills academy, but there is a recognition that what young people need is the right choice at the right time.</p><p>Indeed, that brings me to Kezia Dugdale&#8217;s intervention on the cabinet secretary with regard to person-centred approaches. It is quite right that we have such approaches. Let me give the chamber an example.</p><p>Mr Swinney said that in the 1960s and 1970s career choices might not always have been geared to the individual. Like many other young people of my age, I signed on when I left school. At the unemployment centre, I was offered an opportunity to get into employment and&#8212;a bit like Norman the barking pig in this afternoon&#8217;s time for reflection&#8212;I felt up for the challenge. However, when I was offered a job as a night watchman or as a sign painter for boats in dry dock, I felt that I had to refuse. I felt that such opportunities were beyond even my expectation of the challenge to which I could assign myself. A person-centred approach is about ensuring that young people are informed about what is available to them that they can aspire to and that is within their ability. That is the essence of person-centred approaches.</p><p>In the north-east, we are fortunate that the energy skills centre provides opportunities for our young people, but there is a realisation that we need to get to our young people at a much earlier age. As part of its brief, ConstructionSkills Scotland is also looking at trying to ensure that young people are aware of the opportunities in various sectors. For instance, the energy sector is not all about hard hats and overalls; there is a need for project managers, caterers, office cleaners&#8212;people who can provide the skills that keep the energy sector afloat.</p><p>We also have problems in the north-east, especially in the rural areas. As is mentioned in the committee&#8217;s report, the cost of transport means that opportunities are not always available for people in rural communities. There can also be a lack of infrastructure, with people unable to connect to the internet so that they can access, for instance, the my world of work website. The infrastructure is not always available in our rural areas, and that is something that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Just before Christmas, I spoke to the youth minister&#8212;my apologies, the Minister for Youth Employment&#8212;about opportunities for all. I said to her that there is a perception&#8212;and it is a perception&#8212;that the opportunities for all commitment perhaps does not always do what it says on the tin, if I may use the phrase that David Cameron used in the news the other day. The perception among those in Remploy who lost their jobs, for instance, is that Governments sometimes put up barriers. The Scottish Government&#8217;s opportunities for all policy is sometimes not realised because of the UK Government.</p><p>I believe that we need to provide opportunities for all in the greatest sense possible, and I believe that the Scottish Government is trying to do exactly that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I wish everyone in the chamber the best for 2013 and congratulate the Finance Committee on bringing this debate to the chamber.

For example, I was not aware that people with autism perhaps had less sensitivity to heat or cold, that they would perhaps not make eye contact, or that they sometimes did not realise the consequences of taking certain actions.</p><p>Such awareness is a learning curve, which is why it is essential that we have the alert card for our emergency services, particularly the police, and for our emergency services in the health sector, when people have to present themselves at accident and emergency.

In February 2011, when my daughter died, the press were at my door by tea time. My daughter died just before lunch time and, at tea time, a reporter knocked on my door looking for a story. I was shocked. We were in emotional turmoil. My wife and family, especially my daughter Fiona, could not understand how the press could know and how the reporters could find us. Just a few hours after Caroline died, reporters were knocking at the door. Of course, we sent them away, because our grief was private. However, the following morning before 8, there were knocks at the door again.

In September, the minister stated to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8212;I ask him to forgive me for rounding up the figures&#8212;that investment of about &#163;322,000 was estimated to have a return of &#163;37 million. My maths is probably not as good as the minister&#8217;s and I stand to be corrected, but I think that that is a 56:1 return.</p><p>We have fantastic facilities and a wonderful culture&#8212;and, in truth, we have an open door for business. That business will bring growth, which in turn will engender more opportunities for the people of Scotland. However, when we take our message across the world, whether it be to China, India, Brazil, Africa or the middle east, we must ensure that the people who come to Scotland get the hospitality that they deserve.</p><p>The minister mentioned Stephen Leckie, who for many years now has been at the forefront of demands for a reduction in VAT for the hotel sector. The issue must be looked at urgently. Indeed, I sincerely hope that in the forthcoming budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consider reducing VAT for the hotel and restaurant sector.</p><p>APD, which was the subject of yesterday&#8217;s debate in the chamber and has been mentioned this afternoon, should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Of course, if we wait until 2014, all powers will be devolved and we will be able to address the problem ourselves.</p><p>Remaining, I hope, on a consensual note&#8212;</p><p>Members: Ha!

She was admitted on to a programme because, as a young mum, she wanted to try to ensure that she would be the right mum to bring up her child. When she came off the programme, she was absolutely fine for months, but then the addictive aspect of the alcohol and drugs became too great for her.</p><p>She approached the social work department, where I was her key worker at the time.

Members might recall that, in February this year, I related in the chamber the story of my daughter Caroline, who died 21 months ago. Her wish was to donate her organs so that other people would have the gift of life, or perhaps of recovering sight. As a youngster, Caroline had a firm belief that that would be her wish. Unfortunately, she did not realise that she would have that wish at such a young age.</p><p>Caroline&#8217;s condition meant that her organs could not be used. However, she had healthy eyes, and the tissues from her corneas were transplanted.</p><p>Many people are perhaps not aware that, when people agree for the organs or tissues of their loved one to be removed and transplanted, they undergo a process during which they have to complete an authorisation and patient assessment. That came as a surprise to me and my family.</p><p>Having just lost our daughter&#8212;for Fiona, it was her sister&#8212;we were presented with the assessment. We had the support of the chaplain at Aberdeen royal infirmary, James Falconer, to whom we are eternally grateful, and we also had a transplant co-ordinator who sat with us and explained the process.</p><p>The process is an administrative one that I suppose takes away the personal issues. There was a great deal of explanation and sensitivity. To an extent, there was an apology that we had to go through the process, but we had to go through it to ensure that everything was correct and that we could proceed with the donation of Caroline&#8217;s organs or corneas.

[Laughter.] However, I rely on other people to drive me, so I am always very conscious of whether they have been consuming alcohol if we have been to a function.</p><p>I am also the parent of a teenage daughter&#8212;a teenage daughter who loves her car. She loves her car because her father bought her the car. My daughter, I believe, is a responsible driver. She will go out and engage with other teenagers and go to parties and so on, but she is always willing to be the driver. It is probably just down to the excitement of her still being a young driver, but she is quite happy to drive other people who are consuming alcohol.</p><p>My fear is not about my daughter and whether she consumes alcohol when she drives&#8212;I believe that she would not&#8212;but for other drivers on the roads who may have consumed alcohol. My daughter cannot legislate for others who are driving. She does not know whether the driver of the approaching car has overindulged in alcohol and whether she needs to take evasive action. The cabinet secretary said that one death or one accident is too many; I agree with the cabinet secretary. Quite often, the accident affects not the driver who has consumed the alcohol but the innocent party who has taken action to avoid that driver.</p><p>Mark McDonald referred to an initiative in Grampian. In Grampian, there seems to be a macho culture in that 86 per cent of those who are convicted of drink-driving are male. We need to adjust that culture&#8212;we need to change that macho culture in which drink-driving is acceptable, because it is not.</p><p>The other disturbing statistic is that the 17 to 35 -year-old age group seems to believe that it is okay to drink and drive. That is not okay. We must ensure, if we are to make a real and effective difference, that we educate our young people much earlier about the consequences of drink-driving.</p><p>Like others in the chamber, when I grew up between the 1950s and 1970s the culture was that it was okay to drink and drive. It has never been okay to drink and drive, because drink impairs a driver&#8217;s ability. Perhaps the 50mg limit is still too high, although I accept that it is better than the 80mg limit. I sincerely hope that a person&#8217;s ability is not impaired at the 20mg level and that they can still drive responsibly at the 50mg level or I may to decide to take a ship, rather than fly, given the information that was provided by Stewart Stevenson.</p><p>I support the motion and I sincerely hope that we find consensus across the chamber and that we accept the 50mg limit proposal.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink-driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When Mark McDonald started talking about Grampian, I felt that I might just remain in my seat and give way to Siobhan McMahon.

In my constituency, an excellent model is being taught in schools. Called your future in energy, it gives young people the opportunity to take a broad view of entering the employment market. It moves away from the stereotype. In the project, young girls can think about wearing a hard hat and overalls and going into the offshore market.

We have to move that culture forward to ensure that our young people have the appropriate opportunities.</p><p>I am delighted to say that positive initiatives have been taken. Universities and colleges in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire have set up a centre for excellence to look at the broad energy market. They are looking at the feed-in from schools and what the skills sector requires, and applying the courses that young people need to get into employment. Employers in the energy sector say that there is a skills shortage, and indeed there is. However, that problem is being addressed because it is so important to our overall economy in Scotland and the UK and globally. It is unfortunate that much of the return from that energy sector does not come direct to Scotland. It goes to the coffers down at Westminster and our return is very small indeed.</p><p>We are providing opportunities for our young people.

I do not know whether access to work is available for young disabled people for apprenticeships or when they are trying to learn new skills, but I do not think that it is. Yet that is when support is most needed, during early training when people are learning new skills. It is there to help our young people achieve work. As has been mentioned, it is a challenge for our young disabled, and for all disabled people, in the employment market, so we must try to ensure that every opportunity is made available for them.</p><p>I am delighted that the cabinet secretary within his budget has managed to secure funding for social enterprises. That funding is there to enable and to give positive messages to the people of Scotland, not the negative rhetoric that we have heard from those on the Labour benches this afternoon. Bruce Crawford said that he may not be here in 20 years&#8217; time. I say to Bruce Crawford that he will be 76 and will probably be most welcome here because he would have a more positive message than we have heard today from Labour members.</p><p>Let me end by saying that the models within Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, led by Aberdeen city and shire economic future, are models that could be replicated throughout Scotland.

Patricia Ferguson is absolutely right&#8212;statistics are people, and it is a shock to people when they are diagnosed. There is fear and anxiety. Breakthrough Breast Cancer encourages TLC at an early age for those who may not think that they will be affected by breast cancer and who are certainly outwith the age range for screening. If we can get young people to check regularly and do TLC in their teens, it will not be a problem for them when they are in their 40s, 50s, 60s and so on. It will be natural.</p><p>Breakthrough Breast Cancer encourages a routine. That is the way forward. It can be done when one has a shower or gets ready for bed. We are not asking for checks every day, but we are asking people to get into a routine and to be aware of changes. We are asking people to be more aware of their bodies.</p><p>Very few men suffer from breast cancer. In fact, the number in Scotland is about 0.6 per cent. The symptoms for men are not so different from those for women. There could be a hardening around the breast area or changes around the nipple. Often, though, breast cancer is painless, and most men would probably disregard it. Scottish men in particular would probably disregard it because they are not particularly good at going to the doctor anyway, with any condition. Perhaps we need to get over those barriers. We need to encourage people to be aware of their body and changes in their body.</p><p>I support the work of Breakthrough Breast Cancer and encourage those who can to become champions for the charity throughout Scotland, to take forward the TLC initiative and to help and encourage people to become aware, because becoming aware saves lives.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674173", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Breast Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was privileged a few weeks ago to attend the Breakthrough Breast Cancer workshop.

As a former social worker, team leader and service manager, I think that there is a failure in process. That highlights an essential point about the bill&#8212;that it is not about process but about people.</p><p>The bill is about enabling people to make a choice, but they cannot make the right choice if they do not have the information. To enable choice, the information must be free of bias and it must reflect the needs of the individual, their family and their carers. In my 30-odd years in social care, I met many families with many different needs. However, the principle of doing the assessment to identify that need must not be and should never be resource driven; it must be outcome based. We must divorce what resources are available from that consideration in order to ensure that we provide an assessment that is free of that information. We must ensure that when we carry out an assessment we assess the need of the individual and their carers at that time. We must come up with an informed care package, not one that is decided for them. As Malcolm Chisholm eloquently pointed out, it is not what we do to people, but what we do with and for them.</p><p>The setting up of a care package and the establishment of what a person&#8217;s needs are is a partnership. It is about establishing what the person needs and when they need it. There are many good examples and we have been given many case studies in the briefing for the debate. I can take members back to a case of my own many years ago when I was practising in social work. In my early days in social work, I came across a young lad in Inverclyde who had very limited communication skills. He had no speech, but was able to smile and laugh. Unbeknown to me, when I walked into the room to come and see the family his eyes apparently lit up, because I sat beside him and he held my hand. He got immense pleasure from that very basic contact.</p><p>That is the principle behind the bill. It is about identifying basic needs. It is not complex; it is about identifying people&#8217;s basic needs, ensuring dignity and ensuring respect. We cannot lose sight of that.</p><p>I remember an occasion when I achieved independence as a result of being able to use a computer through screen-reading technology. That gave me the ability to do things for myself rather than be dependent on others. Fortunately for my wife, the screen reader does not read the bank statements, so I have no idea about those.</p><p>Independent living is not about the person living on their own, but about their living with the appropriate supports. None of us lives in isolation. We live with support from others, whether that is through partnership or marriage or the support of colleagues in our profession. We are interdependent, but at different levels. We must respect that and identify it. We must recognise that the person&#8217;s needs must be met. As I said, the process must be outcome led, not resource led. We must meet a person&#8217;s needs in the best way that we can.</p><p>We have heard much about carers. I welcome the fact that Parliament will hold its first carers parliament on 1 October. Carers will come together in the chamber so that we can hear their voice. That is a step forward for Parliament, for our communities and for our carers.</p><p>I endorse the work that the Government has done on the bill so far and I endorse the support that it has received from the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I thank all the various agencies that provided information for this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

I was fortunate to be at Balmoral&#8212;that is, the real Balmoral, and Balmoral castle&#8212;when the Olympic torch went through my constituency.

We went from Balmoral to Ballater, from Ballater to Aboyne, from Aboyne to Kincardine O&#8217;Neil, and from Kincardine O&#8217;Neil to Banchory. The streets were lined with people waving their saltires. There were a few union jacks, I must confess, but there you go. It was patriotic and well attended and it was a wonderful occasion.</p><p>Let me take members to my constituency and what it has for people to enjoy in the great outdoors. In and around my constituency, we have about 34 Munros. We have visitor centres throughout, including a wonderful one in Oyne, at the foot of Bennachie. We have the fantastic mountain bike trail at Pitfichie&#8212;that is another wonderful name in my constituency&#8212;near Monymusk. People who want to visit woodlands can go to Durris, where there are wonderful woods and forests and people can go mountain biking and rambling or even do some small-hill walking.</p><p>My constituency is awash with tourist attractions. We have royal Deeside, with fantastic salmon and sea trout fishing, which is very good this year. I tell anglers who might wish to visit the constituency of Aberdeenshire West that people are making fantastic catches on Deeside. We have Strathdon, which is not to be outshone by its royal Deeside neighbour. It has lots to offer, such as forest walks, hill walks and fantastic scenery. The area is awash with outdoor activity.</p><p>We have stone circles from Banchory to Tarland, Aboyne and Echt&#8212;people can go round my constituency to see them. We are famous for the battle in which Macbeth was fatally wounded in 1057, at Lumphanan. He bore no resemblance to Shakespeare&#8217;s Macbeth&#8212;it was the true Macbeth at the battle in 1057.</p><p>The Scotch Whisky Association is celebrating its centenary, and I was a guest at its centenary party in Edinburgh. To those who think that the whisky trade is just for the purist, I say that whisky cocktails have been introduced. My hand was shaking and the glass was full of ice and I am not a whisky drinker, but people told me that I would enjoy it: enjoy it, I did. I was advised at that event that, to celebrate the Queen&#8217;s jubilee, Royal Lochnagar distillery&#8212;in my constituency at Balmoral&#8212;has produced 60 bottles of whisky that are priced at &#163;100,000 each. I am sure that the Queen was gifted one to celebrate her royal jubilee.</p><p>My constituency has many attractions in the great outdoors. We have camping and caravan sites. I urge everyone in the chamber to think about getting in touch with their MPs and with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask that VAT be brought down to 5 per cent for the tourism industry. We in Scotland need that. We need to inject money into and to support our tourism sector.

I sincerely hope that the weather does not match the song and that the young farmers&#8217; intentions are achieved.

I was privileged to manage a team of social and rehabilitation workers who provided an invaluable service to both communities. In the initial stages, both sides showed some reluctance to come together but once they realised that they had a lot in common, many of the people, who were elderly, realised that they had dual sensory impairments.</p><p>One of the first tasks that I had in that post was to ensure that we were providing the services that both groups required. I will focus on those who are deaf and hard of hearing. It was a great privilege to be able to set up the services for lip-reading classes in Moray and Aberdeen. Again, it was a fantastic honour to set up the services for our staff, who all got involved in learning BSL. To that end, I commend Stephen Joyce of Deafblind Scotland, who tried in vain to teach me some BSL. I have some language skills for speaking with deafblind people, but I am probably not a great receiver because I always think that people speak far too quickly on my hand and their spelling is far better than mine. They must use abbreviations.</p><p>The work that all such organisations do is immense. I was talking to Delia Henry last night and I asked her what one thing she would like to see brought to the debate tonight. It was a difficult question, but she sought some advice and she said, &#8220;Stigma. We need to remove the stigma for our deaf and hard-of-hearing people.&#8221; We all have a big job to do in trying to remove the barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing people in our society and removing the stigma of having hearing loss.</p><p>I commend the work that happens in Grampian. The audiology service in Grampian Health Board is fantastic. A problem is that many people do not go in the early days when they begin to feel that they are losing their hearing. They might not go because of the stigma or because of the fear of being issued with a hearing aid. I went to Grampian&#8217;s audiology service and when I was issued with my hearing aid I suddenly realised that I was hearing things that I had not been able to hear for many years. My wife is delighted that she does not have to ask me twice to do something, but I can still turn a deaf ear to some of that occasionally. Having a hearing aid ensures my safety. I am now able to pick up the frequencies of the signal crossings that I could not hear appropriately before.</p><p>Neil Findlay mentioned acoustics, and they are incredibly important, whether it be in the classroom at school, college or university, in other public buildings, or in GP practices and hospitals.

We must find out what the causal links are. Yesterday, we discussed the national parenting strategy in the chamber, and that links to part of what I will say this afternoon. As parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and relatives who have young children, we have a responsibility. It is not so many weeks since Easter passed. How many of us indulged in the Easter festivities and went out and bought our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews chocolate? We had alternatives and choices. We could have taken them something healthy. Did we? We know that a healthy option is better for them but, as role models, did we take that step forward? If we are going to make a change, it is our responsibility to make it. We must not be a society of people who just tell others, &#8220;This is how you do it&#8221;; we must adopt the philosophy ourselves and lead by example.</p><p>In my constituency of Aberdeenshire West, we have some of the most wonderful opportunities to keep active. We have fantastic forestry walks, areas where people can ramble, hillwalking, rivers in which we can canoe, areas where we can take our mountain bikes and areas where we can just have leisurely pleasure walks. However, as Nigel Don said, sometimes it is an effort to get there. If the infrastructure is not there to enable people to get there, they might not go.</p><p>In Huntly in my constituency, the Deveron Arts organisation had what I think is a unique initiative: a slow marathon, which I took part in. I do not have the medal to prove it, but I did sign up. The marathon involved walking the distance from Huntly to Ethiopia and back. One of the participants in Deveron Arts is from Ethiopia and she came up with the idea that if our schools and people in our community all signed up, we would walk a distance equivalent to 225 marathons. With the number of people who took part, we covered the distance from Huntly to Ethiopia and back. That was a nice initiative for getting children, parents and older members of our community involved, all walking whatever number of miles they wished for the slow marathon. There are nice initiatives out there that people can do that do not take money or a Government to implement.</p><p>I congratulate Aberdeenshire Council on endorsing the community sport hubs, which are a way of getting our younger people back into sport&#8212;hopefully, at a cost that is affordable to them. Sport, physical activity and exercise alone are not the answer, however. We have heard the stark reality of the statistics, which cannot be addressed by exercise and physical activity alone. As Margaret Burgess concluded in her speech, we need a combination of exercise or activity and the right food in the right amounts. Often, we eat the right food but the quantity that we take is far beyond what we require.</p><p>I thank Patricia Ferguson for taking me back to all my yesterdays. She reminded me of when my mother tied the dusters round my feet and asked me to slide up and down the hall to polish the linoleum. I inform the younger members in the chamber that that was before fitted carpets.</p><p>I say to Alison Johnstone that in 1976 I was a fit, healthy 20-year-old. I was fit and healthy because I swam three times a week, I ran at Meadowbank stadium, I went abseiling and I canoed. Why did I stop all those activities? I started work and my lifestyle changed. I went into a completely different lifestyle and the time that I had available to do those things changed.</p><p>Currently, my lifestyle in the Parliament is different. I do not eat regular meals because the activities in the Parliament&#8212;the various events that I attend, and so on&#8212;mean that I cannot. However, that is no excuse. The problem is that we all try to find an excuse for why we are overweight, why we do not take exercise and why we are inactive. We need to find solutions and accept the fact that we must be role models for our young children. We should ask them not to do as we say, but to do as we do.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am guilty as charged, Presiding Officer.

I endorse that. I am a father of twins. This might be difficult to believe but, when my wife told me that she was expecting and that it was twins, I was speechless. However, being an Aberdonian, I thought that two for the price of one was perhaps not a bad deal. The challenge of being a parent soon came home to me. Because I am not a heavy sleeper, I decided with my wife&#8212;who was delighted at the time&#8212;that I would get up during the night to feed and change both my girls.

I was scolded many times by my wife because telling them a story before they went to bed was supposed to calm them down, and I was not very good at that&#8212;I probably excited them more with my storytelling than I would have if I had been reading from a book.</p><p>There are challenges for parents.

Members across the chamber acknowledge, I think, that there are far too many people in the criminal justice system and in prison who, because of the type of offence that they have committed, probably should not be there. Christine Grahame made a valid point about how often it is a cycle that needs to be broken. Too often families engage in the cycle because their parents did, and perhaps their parents before them&#8212;it is a life of crime. We need to look at the social impact of crime in our society and to afford people who enter into crime new opportunities to move away from it. That is about giving them self-belief, self-worth and self-respect.</p><p>People need to respect not only themselves and the wellbeing of their families, but their communities too. We are some way along that journey thanks to the community payback option, which has led to a reduction in reoffending. Communities are benefiting from that model because they engage with the community payback orders that local authorities implement.</p><p>Like others, I extend my gratitude to all the third sector parties involved in tackling reoffending. There are so many organisations that afford people various opportunities through their programmes. Turning Point, which has been mentioned, is a valuable organisation that works throughout Scotland.</p><p>If there was an easy fix, we would not have this problem, but there is not. We must consider every aspect of reoffending and look at why people get into the offending mode in the first place. As I have mentioned, that often relates to where people are in their lives, whether they are in employment, their family status and their place in society.</p><p>We can point the finger at drugs, alcohol and so many other social problems that occur in communities, but many people do not enter into crime, so we must look at the facts that are before us and ask what makes some people go into crime. The majority of crimes are low level, and prison is certainly not the place for those offenders.</p><p>With regard to rehabilitation and prisoners&#8217; visiting rights, Mary Fee made the exceptionally good point that prisoners should be in an environment that is conducive to the rehabilitation programme.

That&#8217;s the budget&#8212;no more.&#8221; However, we are not good at sticking to that budget, and I am probably the worst culprit, but my family can cope with that, although I know that, when it comes to the end of January, we are thinking, &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s in the freezer. Did we eat everything that we ordered for Christmas and new year?&#8221; I think that every family is exactly the same as that.</p><p>Mark McDonald is to be commended for bringing this important debate to the chamber. I think that society needs to think about how we can impact on pay.</p><p>When I worked for Strathclyde Regional Council in the late 1970s and early 1980s, we were on a 13-month pay cycle, which meant that we got paid every four weeks. That might be something that health boards and local authorities could consider as an alternative to what Mr McDonald is suggesting. However, I sincerely hope that our local authorities, health boards and organisations in the third sector can perhaps think about their moral obligation and support Mr McDonald&#8217;s suggestion on how to deal with this important issue.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: January Pay Date"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mark McDonald on bringing an important debate to Parliament.

However, it is disconcerting that we have heard only negative comments from Hugh Henry and Neil Bibby about the concerns and anxieties that exist among parents and teachers. It is not all parents and teachers, but some parents and teachers who share those anxieties and concerns, which I believe are being fuelled by Hugh Henry and the Labour Party. He said that he hopes that he is wrong; I believe that he is wrong. The majority of teachers and parents are comfortable with the programme that has been set out. The draft guidance was available in the autumn, and we are told that we will have the final guidance in April.

I hope that Labour takes cognisance of what was said at that meeting. I hope that Labour will also take some guidance from Labour member Hanzala Malik, whose approach is consensual. He seems to be more comfortable with what the cabinet secretary has said and with the answers that were given at the committee meeting.</p><p>My plea to Hugh Henry and the Labour Party is that they listen to Hanzala Malik, who has a good point.

Our lifestyle caused the problem, and the lifestyle that we continue to enjoy exacerbates it.</p><p>We welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s many initiatives to reduce Scotland&#8217;s carbon emissions. Jim Hume was right to mention the programmes for home insulation and so on.</p><p>We all have a responsibility in this area, and Patrick Harvie was right to say that we must show an example and do all that we can to reduce our emissions, which will have an impact on the global situation.</p><p>I will not repeat everything that has been said about tsunamis or other aspects of global warming and the impact that they have had on various countries, but I associate myself with my friend and colleague Annabelle Ewing&#8217;s congratulations to all the NGOs on the excellent briefings that they provided. They have highlighted to us the fact that this is a human rights issue. Just in case Mrs Hepburn is listening, Amnesty International&#8217;s briefing was excellent.</p><p>To be serious, however, I think that the crux of the matter is that we have a responsibility to those less fortunate and more vulnerable than ourselves. We cannot ignore their plight. In that respect, I associate myself with Elaine Murray&#8217;s comments about those who wonder why in these times of great hardship and austerity we continue to provide funding to countries overseas. We are quite right to do so; after all, we must take responsibility for our actions.</p><p>We have a bright future. Through the curriculum for excellence, our schoolchildren are learning about recycling and saving energy&#8212;and, indeed, saving the planet. Old Rayne primary school in my Aberdeenshire West constituency has just received its fourth green flag award; it is the first school in my constituency to achieve that distinction and I believe that it might well be the first school in Scotland to do so. Many positive things are happening and we must not only think about what we as individuals and responsible adults can do but learn from our children. I was quite impressed when a parent of one of the Old Rayne primary schoolchildren told me how they had been made aware of how often they leave the lights on in their home; their child told them that they had to go to bed because they were burning too much electricity. It was only about eight in the evening. Of course, children can sometimes go too far.</p><p>Like Claudia Beamish, I will certainly be switching the lights off on 31 March. My wife tells me that I sometimes need to switch them on, but there is always a good side to these things.</p><p>We are going in the right direction and I believe that Scotland can be an exemplar of good practice. I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement of the climate justice fund and would certainly like to hear more information about it. As someone who enjoys walking as a pastime&#8212;and as a way of getting from A to B&#8212;I think that more of us could probably reduce our carbon footprint by following the example of many of our children and taking up cycling and walking.

On election evening, I dedicated my speech to my daughter, Caroline. A couple of weeks ago, one of the eating disorder charities contacted me to see whether I would be prepared to help to raise the profile of eating disorders and awareness of them. Of course, I said yes and, subsequently, the subject has been accepted for a members&#8217; business debate.</p><p>I never expected to be talking about a subject that is so personal to me and my family in my first members&#8217; business debate. Although I feel privileged to do so, it is with an element of sadness, too. As members probably recall, my daughter died because of an eating disorder. In fact, the first anniversary of Caroline&#8217;s death will be this very week, on 25 February, during eating disorders awareness week.</p><p>There are three recognised eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, which is probably the least common but which has the most fatal consequences; bulimia nervosa; and binge eating. All of them have significant impacts on the lives of sufferers and on their families and carers. The impact extends even to sufferers&#8217; friends and to people whom they know at school, college and university and in the workplace.</p><p>The individual suffers with torment and torture, because such a disorder is a psychological illness and is not an eating fad. The person does not have the choice of overcoming it by sitting down and eating a healthy meal.</p><p>We must try as best we can to get rid of some of the myths about eating disorders. We must accept that an eating disorder is a psychiatric illness that requires early intervention. To achieve that, we must be aware of the signs&#8212;that is perhaps the crux of the motion, which is about raising awareness.</p><p>The early signs are not always clear. Especially with anorexia nervosa, the majority usually become victims&#8212;I do not use that word loosely&#8212;during the pubescent period. In that period, young girls&#8212;but not only girls, as boys are affected, too&#8212;have body changes that they sometimes cannot explain and do not like. Often, that is to do with their image.</p><p>Beyond that period, recognising differences in individuals&#8217; behaviour gives us the early signs of illnesses such as anorexia. Signs include people changing their diet or having smaller portions, significant weight loss or perhaps obsessive exercise patterns. Their whole behaviour, character and personality start to change. Those are the early signs, of which we need to be aware, not just as parents but as guidance teachers at school, as lecturers in colleges and universities and as family members.</p><p>From my point of view, the people who need to become more aware are those in the medical profession. Our general practitioners and other medical professionals need to recognise that, when a young person goes to their surgery with their parents or a friend, their condition is not to be dismissed as a teenage fad. They are not going through a phase; they could have a serious, life-threatening and debilitating illness.</p><p>I was shocked when I learned some of the statistics about anorexia. I was shocked that one in 250 women&#8212;generally young women&#8212;can be anorexia sufferers. I had not quite considered the illness to be so prevalent in our society. In a study at a high school in America, 12 per cent of the young girls who were surveyed had eating disorder tendencies.</p><p>We have support systems that cannot provide support. Beat, which is a United Kingdom organisation, proposed the debate to me. It provides support for carers and families, raises awareness and provides information. That is wonderful and great, but those who suffer from such illnesses do not want the help. They do not engage at the early stages. They do not want to tell people. In fact, they hide the information. As I mentioned earlier, there is a change in their behaviour. Quite often, they isolate themselves not only from their family but from their friends. One of the most disturbing things for me is that, when they start to engage with the internet by googling anorexia, pro-anorexic sites come up, telling them how to beat the system; how to become even more anorexic, if they can; how to exacerbate the disease to the point that they can cheat their psychiatrist, their psychologist and other medical professionals; how to string their family along; how to convince their friends that they are coming out the other end and are positive about their outcomes; how to make people think that they are beating the illness.</p><p>We need to engage with the issue of the pro-anorexic sites. I hope that we can police them and shut them down. They do not provide the help that family members and parents want or that those with the eating disorders require when they seek help.</p><p>Caroline, my daughter, was 13 when she contracted the illness. She fought the illness for five years. At times, she would say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like being anorexic. I want to be normal. I want to do the things that my twin sister does. I want to go out with boys. I want to have a job. I want to go to university. I want my life back.&#8221; But that was when it was my daughter, Caroline, speaking to me and to her mum. At other times, however, I had an anorexic child, who did not engage, who would keep her distance, who would isolate herself in her bedroom, who would not sit at the family table and dine with us.</p><p>Holidays are something that families look forward to. They are for pleasure. They let people get away from their stresses, strains and anxieties. But our holidays were always fraught with anxiety, with pain and with torture because Caroline would not and could not go out and enjoy a meal with us. If she came, she would have a drink&#8212;a drink from a bottle that came with a cap on or a can that had not been opened, because of her absolute fear that someone might have put something in her drink that would tip the balance for her. She would not enjoy food that had been prepared by anyone else because of her fear that someone had put something in her food that would tip the balance.</p><p>Towards the end of Caroline&#8217;s life, she was admitted to hospital because she was no longer able to keep food or liquids in her body, and she was at a critical stage. When my wife, Ann, and I were at the hospital with her, the consultant told us that he was shocked at the state that she was in. I am not casting blame or pointing fingers at any particular person, but I would say that earlier intervention would perhaps have saved Caroline&#8217;s life&#8212;I do not know. She was a chronic anorexic and, if she had survived, she was probably doomed to have anorexic tendencies for the rest of her life.</p><p>My wife and I discuss this from time to time. To some extent, we believe that Caroline is now free from anorexia. She no longer hurts. She no longer has the pain or torment that anorexia brings. But that does not mean that we can sit back and let anorexia win. We cannot do that.</p><p>By bringing the debate to the chamber, it is my sincere hope that we can engage with the medical profession at the level at which they tell us what they require in order to assist people with those conditions to overcome them. However, I say to the medical profession that a vehicle exists now through the Scottish eating disorder interest group and eating disorders education and training Scotland. GPs and other medical professionals can sign up to that. They become more aware, and they can have a toolkit so that they can recognise the early symptoms and know who to refer to. They can refer on. Sadly, not many people have taken up that opportunity and registered. I hope that members, the ministers and the cabinet secretary will encourage our medical profession to consider engaging with the accreditation programme and become more aware of what needs to happen. Members must do what we can to ensure that other families do not suffer in the way in which my family had to.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I thank you for your indulgence, and I thank every single member who has supported the motion. It is important to me and my family to know that people are with us and behind us and that they will be with us to try to overcome and change a dreadful disease for our young people.

However, as far as I understand the matter, the UK Government can&#8212;and should, if it sees sense as a result of the e-petition&#8212;reduce VAT to 5 per cent, which would be an interim measure that would save the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and other assistance dog charities a great deal of money.</p><p>When a person loses their vision&#8212;they are the only people for whom I can speak&#8212;and considers getting a guide dog, they think about the cost.

I have never heard Huntly mentioned so much in the chamber, and shortbread has not even been mentioned yet. It was a great privilege for me to be with the cabinet secretary at the fantastic creative places awards ceremony last week and for Huntly to receive a special award of &#163;40,000. I also felt quite special that day&#8212;although it was not quite as much of a privilege&#8212;to meet Dougie Vipond for the first time, which took me back to my Deacon Blue days. That is enough of him.</p><p>Huntly and Deveron Arts are a beacon of light&#8212;I am sure that we have heard that somewhere before&#8212;that is taking Scotland forward. Huntly is a small community and a market town. Deveron Arts is embracing that community, and the whole community is involved in that project. Aspects of its artwork and its creativity can be found throughout the village. Some artwork is even in the cleaner&#8217;s cupboard in the Deveron Arts building.</p><p>My colleague Mark McDonald mentioned the menu in Huntly. It is actually going to be a new signature menu. Again, that is something that is going to be extremely creative, and it will bring people back to Huntly to see what it is all about. I look forward to enjoying some of that cuisine. I sincerely hope that the cabinet secretary and the minister can find time to visit Huntly to take part in that as well. They might meet Dougie Vipond, who has said that he is going to be there, too. Enough of him, though.</p><p>My constituency, Aberdeenshire West, has a level of talent that is probably second to none in the whole of Scotland. We have even adopted Scotland&#8217;s most creative and talented comedian, Billy Connolly, who resides in Strathdon most summers. We are proud to have him there. He usually leads the Lonach games, which are a fantastic success. We have our own home-grown talent as well. In Huntly, we have Shona Donaldson, the Huntly quine. She is a fantastic singer&#8212;one of Scotland&#8217;s finest&#8212;and her husband, Paul Anderson, is one of Scotland&#8217;s most renowned fiddlers. We have an association with Shakespeare, through Macbeth and Lumphanan. We have royal Deeside, where the Queen resides at Balmoral. I know that there is some controversy about the extent of the castle&#8217;s architectural beauty. Not everyone thinks that it is beautiful, but I do. They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I agree with that, as far as Balmoral is concerned.</p><p>We have an opportunity, as we are the gateway to tourism within Scotland. In royal Deeside today, the first lines were cast. I sincerely hope that a salmon was caught on this extremely cold day. It is frustrating for an angler when they cast and contemplate and nothing happens. I sincerely hope that it was a successful day.</p><p>I would like to commend to the cabinet secretary and the minister the activities at Braemar. I hope that they will find time to visit the village and see the wonderful activities that are going on there. That community, which has fewer than 600 people, is bringing that wonderful castle back to life and back to its former glory. As part of the curriculum for excellence, schools are going to the castle to find out about the history and the culture of the area.</p><p>We are even keeping the language alive, with Alford primary school bringing out a book called &#8220;B is for Foggiebummer&#8221;&#8212;as we know, in the Doric, a foggiebummer is a bumble bee.</p><p>There you go&#8212;creativity, art and culture are all there in Aberdeenshire West.</p><p>I commend Hanzala Malik for saying that Scottish produce is the best in many ways.

The council has taken the view of the national guidance in relation to payments for kinship carers, which, it states, should be in accordance with the payments for foster carers. When I discussed the matter with the director of social work, he agreed and acknowledged that there was more to be done. He would welcome further debate on how we can move forward on the issue, and I am sure that the minister will take that on board by holding further discussions with the ADSW and COSLA with a view to securing what I believe was an agreement, through the concordat, to make progress on payments for kinship care and to achieve a degree of unanimity.</p><p>Let us put the child at the heart of the debate. Kinship carers provide care that is fundamental for the young children concerned. It is much better that children are with kinship carers rather than in foster or residential care, but it is disturbing to realise that more children will require such care. We should, however, look at what has been done, and I believe that the Government has made progress, as others have agreed.</p><p>We have the national advice and support centre, which supports our kinship carers and enables peer-group support as well.

That is a matter for our local authorities, through social work, for our health boards and for our third sector organisations.

We must move away from the excuses. We have heard in evidence and briefings from the ADSW and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland various reasons why we are failing our children and why they do not attain to the same level as other children in schools. Recognising that is only part of the problem; trying to blame different organisations for not working together is not the solution.</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach is the only way forward. We have to get over working in silos and we have to get it right for every child. The GIRFEC approach properly attempts to resolve the problem.

However, we must ensure that, when they require care, the facilities and resources are available to provide it.</p><p>I welcome the briefing from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the questions that it poses to the cabinet secretary. I am sure that she is listening to the questions that are being asked and to the other briefings that we have received. Macmillan Cancer Support provides an example of an existing joint approach to the provision of care between the health service, local authorities and the third sector. It provided some excellent examples in its briefing.</p><p>I commend the ADSW for the good work that it does. Being a former social worker and having spent 32 years in the social care sector, I am well aware of the complexity of the work in social work departments. However, the tone of the ADSW briefing was less than desirable for this debate.</p><p>I agree with Nanette Milne, Richard Lyle and Mary Scanlon that, if we are going to work in partnership, we need to be more positive. We cannot afford to remain in our silos and try to be autonomous.</p><p>I will give a good example of what I consider to be integration that works. It concerns the work that Optometry Scotland does with the Royal National Institute of Blind People and the third and independent sectors. The SNP Government provided money from the Scottish eye care fund to enable community optometrists to start to deliver much improved services in the community. They now have the facility in their community optometry practices to take electronic images to send direct to ophthalmic services, thereby obviating the need for the patient to go to an ophthalmology out-patient appointment. That approach is welcome. I commend that model, because it encourages patients, when they have a sensory problem, to go to their local optometry practice rather than to their GP or to opthalmic services in hospitals. That is definitely the right approach, as early intervention and prevention are the way forward in an integrated service.</p><p>The debate has been consensual and it has been welcome to hear everyone&#8217;s comments.

In my previous role, I witnessed that impact all too often. I heard the feeble and the inexcusable from men when I went to family homes to speak to women and to try to offer some degree of protection and understanding. All too often, men would say that the violence was out of character and had happened because they were fuelled or because they were driven to it. None of those excuses is acceptable. They were not acceptable then and they should not be acceptable now.</p><p>We have been congratulating Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid on its 35th birthday.

I am grateful to the NUS for its brief on the &#8220;Hidden Marks&#8221; report. Jackie Baillie rightly set out some of the statistics, which are of great concern, but there were one or two that she did not mention. For example, only 4 per cent of the women who are affected by violence at our colleges and universities report the violence. The reason that more than 50 per cent gave for not reporting the violence was that they felt ashamed. It is shameful that society has put women in such a position.</p><p>As members have said, the issue is about equality. Women have the right to equality. Equality is not something that they need to earn; it is a right. Men should not be and never should have been in a situation in which they are in control of women and what they do. Other members have probably articulated that better than I can do.</p><p>However, what I can say is that in Aberdeenshire there is education and there is partnership working. The Aberdeenshire gender-based abuse partnership, which is multidisciplinary, goes into schools and works with police liaison. We are taking education to the primary schools, the secondary schools and tertiary education.</p><p>There is support in hospitals for women and children who come to hospital, often with horrific injuries. The sad thing is that so many women feel that they need to go back. As Maureen Watt said, that should never be the case. If anyone needs to leave the family home because of abuse, it is the person who perpetrated the abuse&#8212;the man.

I am also grateful to him for pointing out that healthcare is a partnership and that, when it is psychologically appropriate, the patient should be informed of their condition and the issues that that condition can bring.</p><p>Mary Scanlon said that most of us probably know people with MS. I have a dear friend who has MS. She was a professional social worker who delivered care to others, but she now requires care herself. I want to focus on the fact that MS affects more than just the individual. As John Wilson said, we need to take a holistic approach, recognising that, when a person has MS, it affects not just their lives, but the lives of the people who live with them.</p><p>The husband of the person I am talking about was a non-driver at the time of her initial diagnosis, and he remained a non-driver for many years because my friend continued in the work that she trained for with great professionalism. She is to be commended for her energy and commitment to her work. Latterly, however, MS took over and she became unable to drive, partly because of restricted vision but mainly because of immobility. One positive aspect of her MS was that her husband learned to drive, although it was not really positive because she then became totally reliant on her carers.</p><p>One of the things that my friend found most difficult about living with MS was that she was no longer able to interact with her very young grandchildren. Before the MS, she was able to take them out to the park or the cinema, or just go out for walks and engage with them, as grandparents do. Not being able to do that has affected her and she said that it was probably the most difficult thing that she has had to cope with. She said that she had been robbed of her ability to interact as a grandparent with her grandchildren.</p><p>In my previous professional capacity in social work, I met many people who had MS. The main barrier for them was the uncertainty of tomorrow. They often did not know what their future held. They did not know whether they would have visual disturbance, or whether in a month, or a year, or five years, they would be able to do the things that they were doing on the day that I talked to them. The complexity of a condition such as MS is caused by having to live with the uncertainty.</p><p>We must ensure that people who have MS get the services that they require. That is where bringing together health and social care agendas is so important. I sincerely hope that the Scottish Government continues with the programme of integration of health and social care services. Until then, patients will continue to face a postcode lottery in the provision of services for people who have MS. Their carers will also have to face a postcode lottery when they have to cope with the condition.</p><p>I congratulate the MS Society on its work. I hope that it continues to influence the Government to ensure that a postcode lottery does not impact on people who have MS and their carers in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis (Better Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Rhoda Grant on securing the debate.

Indeed, I will probably want to share a couple of examples in a few moments, but first I want to raise the issue of carers in rural and remote areas of Scotland, who probably have a slightly different approach to their care. They do not have the same support or the infrastructure that many people in our towns and cities have. Staying at home often means a higher additional cost for them because of the type of housing that they are in. That is an added expense that many of them can ill afford. Their day out will often involve taking the person whom they care for to a medical appointment, and that can sometimes account for three or four hours. There is the time that they will take to get the person ready, the journey time, the time for the medical appointment, and the time for the return journey. I congratulate Grampian NHS Board on applying postcodes to ensure that people who are given hospital appointments are often not given them early in the morning. That at least gives the person who is looking after someone some time in the morning to get them ready to go out.</p><p>Our carers have compassion, they love the people whom they care for and they are to be respected, but they need to be listened to. Often, they are not asking for very much. We have already heard that the carers allowance is a pittance. That is a disgrace, and the UK Government needs to consider that seriously, but carers sometimes simply need someone to talk to and share a few precious moments with so that they can explain how they feel about their frustrations, which they often experience on a daily basis. Sometimes those frustrations move to feelings of guilt, but carers should not feel guilty. They are right to be frustrated and they are sometimes right to be angry, but they do what they do out of love and compassion, and they deserve our respect and to be listened to.</p><p>We have heard many personal tributes, and I would like to share one. This is not about a person in my constituency; rather, it is about a young man who is ages with me. I know him because I went to school with him. He went into hospital because of a stroke, and was put in a ward that was full of people who were much older than he was&#8212;some were 20 or 30 years older. His situation was not recognised. He was blind, had significant hearing loss, and with his stroke, he had no speech. The nursing staff did all that they could to communicate with him, but it was left to his wife and young daughter to engage and provide the additional care that he greatly needed.</p><p>The only thing that they wanted to do was to get my friend back to his own home, but it was inadequate for his needs. It had to be adjusted before he could return home. His family went through a period of about six months to try to get his home fit for purpose so that he could go home. That was six months out of a young man&#8217;s life during which his family had to visit him in hospital and care for him, not just to allow the nursing staff to do other things, but to give him the continuity and compassion that sometimes only families can provide. We must recognise that issue. We need to try to ensure that, when people are in need, we have the appropriate assessments and care plans.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s initiatives. As has been said many times, we must integrate health and social services. They must work together not just to benefit the patient or service user, but to ensure that our carers are cared for.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo many of the sentiments and comments that have come from all members.

It will come as no surprise to him and perhaps other members in the chamber that I, too, have a bias towards part of the rehabilitation sector. I worked in the social care and rehabilitation sector for more than 30 years. I would probably like to change some of the terminology and use words such as &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221;, &#8220;enabling&#8221;, &#8220;empowering&#8221; and &#8220;positive adjustment&#8221;.</p><p>Some weeks ago, we had a debate in the chamber about people&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing. Quite often, we need to look positively at the health and wellbeing of people who have an impairment or are suffering from some chronic condition.</p><p>I worked with people with dual sensory impairment, and I was proud and privileged to work in that field. The North East Sensory Services in Aberdeen was the first organisation in Scotland to have a dual approach to sensory impairment for those who are blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing or deafblind. That was supported by the Government, which was supporting various other projects in Scotland on the one-stop-shop approach to rehabilitation and empowerment.</p><p>Sometimes the simplest things make the biggest difference. Many speakers have mentioned that already&#8212;and I applaud Nanette Milne for being an ideal patient. The simplest approach in giving a person an appropriate aid can mean so much to them. I remember that during my first months working in the field I had a signature guide. It was a simple piece of plastic with a window that enabled people to put their signature on a form. To the person who had recently lost their sight, that meant a lot, and it gave them the independence that they required to write cheques&#8212;not to me, I hasten to say.</p><p>It is important to remain positive. When we work with people in the field of rehabilitation, we cannot accept&#8212;to go into the Doric&#8212;the &#8220;I&#8217;m nae able&#8221; attitude. The individuals concerned are sometimes happy to sit down and say &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to&#8221;, &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t&#8221; or &#8220;No, I&#8217;m too old and I can&#8217;t do this&#8221;. That is not the approach that we want to hear, and that is not the approach that the professionals and care staff take when they work with people.</p><p>We enable people to adjust to their new circumstances and we empower them to become independent in their community. We want to prevent people from going into hospital stays and from feeling isolated in their communities. That is why we have to look at a little investment through preventative spending. We should look at people&#8217;s own homes, sheltered homes and residential care and carry out the appropriate audits to ensure that there is appropriate lighting, colour and contrast.</p><p>We want to ensure that people do not have trips and falls. I believe that a paper is due to come out shortly, if it is not already out, about trips and falls strategies, and I look forward to seeing it. We want to prevent people from going into hospital for long stays. That is about saving money, but it is also about ensuring that people have a quality of life and can stay within their own community.</p><p>The simplest of aids and apparatus are sometimes cheap, but self-help is also important. That depends on carers and the individuals themselves having the best information. That is why I support the one-stop-shop hub approach to integrated care. Integrated care in the community involves not just changing the plaque over the door but ensuring that the teams in the building are fully integrated&#8212;that they are supervised, trained and brought together to provide an integrated approach to the service. A multidisciplinary approach will ensure that people in the community are prevented, as much as possible, from having trips and falls and requiring long-term hospital stays.</p><p>I support the approach that is taken by the Government and the great work that is done by our community optometrists in ensuring that many more people go for free eye tests. Giving people up-to-date eye tests will prevent them from having some of the trips and falls that cause them to go into hospital.</p><p>In my own case, I have learned to live with sight loss for many years. Having one&#8217;s own independence is invaluable to people, but they need support. I sincerely hope that my wife is not listening, as I admit that I could probably iron my own shirts&#8212;</p><p>Members: Ah!</p><p>But I prefer to put the kettle on to make the coffee while she is doing it.

However, I will look back then and remember the pointlessness of conflicts that our service personnel are asked to go into.</p><p>I want to focus on two particular organisations that help our veterans. I am glad that the minister and other members recognise that veterans are not just stereotypical old men who share stories with their families and comrades; we recognise with great emotion that many of our veterans are in their teens. HorseBack UK in my Aberdeenshire West constituency is for serving personnel and veterans. It considers the therapeutic aspect of rehabilitation for many of our youngsters who are trying to regain respect and dignity and to understand what has happened to them in their young lives. They went into the service to do the job that they wished to do in serving their country, and had to leave it at a very tender age because of their disability.</p><p>Coming to terms with disability is not easy for many of our service personnel, and we probably do not do quite enough to ensure that they get the respect that they deserve and that there are rehabilitation facilities for them to get back into the community and serve society. I am grateful to Dr Simpson for raising the issue of the impact on families. Many of our service personnel have had to endure post-traumatic stress. I ask the minister to visit HorseBack UK in my constituency to see the good work that it has done, as there is a personal invitation to him. I am grateful to Linda Fabiani for saying that perhaps more needs to be done to ensure that our service personnel are recognised in our communities. That is exactly what HorseBack UK does.</p><p>Churchill said:</p><p>&#8220;There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man.&#8221;</p><p>Basically, HorseBack UK takes a therapeutic approach to rehabilitation. The horses seem to have an absolute sense, which we perhaps cannot understand, that the men and women there have a disability or impairment or a situation that we cannot understand. They seem to acknowledge that, and the work that is being done needs to be applauded. People are introduced back into society and communities. There is work with gamekeepers, dry-stone dykers and ghillies in the organisation. It is a matter of working in the community. It is about putting servicemen and women back into society, giving them a sense of respect and purpose, and addressing stigma.</p><p>One of the huge drawbacks in the rehabilitative programme is the Department for Work and Pensions. Service personnel and veterans who attend such programmes are basically told that they can be there for a week, otherwise their benefits will be affected. It takes more than one week to rehabilitate. I ask that we make a representation to the UK Government and especially the Department for Work and Pensions that, for any veteran attending a rehabilitation programme who is on benefits, the benefits are continued and support is given.</p><p>The second organisation that I want to highlight is Scottish War Blinded, which is in West Lothian. A new state-of-the-art centre was opened in Linburn on 11 June this year by the Duke of Gloucester. If members could find time to visit the centre, they would see the absolutely fantastic work that goes on there. There is therapy, but it is also about introducing people back into society, addressing many of the problems that a lot of service personnel have.</p><p>I particularly congratulate Scottish War Blinded on focusing on those personnel who have acquired sight loss at a later age, rather than during conflict or when they served their country. They have perhaps acquired sight loss because of age, for instance. The organisation supports people in community and outreach projects and complements a lot of the work that the social care sector does in our communities. Scottish War Blinded provides grants, rehabilitation, expertise and, quite often, just companionship.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have heard about the debts of gratitude that we owe our serving personnel and all our veterans.

We should applaud ScotRail for holding its hands up and admitting that it did not get it right and for doing all that it can to make a huge improvement on what happened last year. We had a very positive meeting with ScotRail, during which Steve Montgomery told us that its biggest problem was not that the trains were delayed or cancelled. Its biggest problem, and the biggest complaint that it received, concerned the misinformation or lack of information given to passengers. Passengers require information to enable them to choose whether to undertake a journey. We must get better at ensuring that the information that we send out is the information that they require in order to make that choice.</p><p>I congratulate NFU Scotland on coming forward in partnership to ensure that rural Scotland can keep on the move, too. It is essential that we focus our attention not just on the trunk roads, so that supply vehicles and lorries can get groceries to our shops, and on the railways, so that commuters can get to work, but on keeping rural Scotland on the move, so that farmers can get their produce to market and people in rural communities can get to hospitals and so on.</p><p>It is a huge concern that many people in rural Scotland are not connected and will not be able to visit the Traveline website. They will be therefore more reliant on the media, so we must ensure that television and radio provide up-to-date and correct information. One of the problems that we endured through the whole of last winter was a lack of information or, sometimes, misinformation. There is no point in telling the travelling public that a road is closed when it is open for people to get to their work. That problem needs to be addressed not just by the Government but by the media, which should take a good, hard look at themselves and the information that they put out to the public.</p><p>We have heard about the many vulnerable people in our communities, towards whom we all have a responsibility. Anyone who is able to clear their own pathway and pavement should do so. It is, however, infuriating when one clears one&#8217;s pathway, as I did, only for the snowplough to come along and fill the gap. I rely on being able to tell the difference between a pavement, a road and someone&#8217;s garden but, during last winter, there was no hope for me&#8212;or, indeed, my trusted Mr Q&#8212;in finding the way from one place to another because it was a total white-out. We must be sensible in the journeys that we undertake. However, I make a plea to businesses in all our communities.

I welcome many of the minister&#8217;s comments, and Alison McInnes&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>There is a lot to be done, but a lot has already been achieved, not just by the current Government but by the previous Executives. We have to applaud the work that has been done by the Government and Parliament. However, we recognise that there is still a lot to do, which is why the new strategy and consultation document has come out.</p><p>I thank Barnardo&#8217;s, SAMH and the National Union of Students Scotland for their briefing for the debate. I also commend their websites, which help us to understand mental health issues.</p><p>We all have mental health. Many of us&#8212;the majority of the population&#8212;have good mental health. I liked the mental health sliding scale that SAMH used in its briefing. We will all have issues in our lives that will impact on us from day to day. Some will have a short-term impact, and some will make us very sad or happy. I remember my elation at being elected on May 6, but it was tinged with sadness because my daughter had died earlier this year. That brought home to me the issue of mental health and wellbeing.</p><p>I welcome many of Dr Richard Simpson&#8217;s comments, and I understand that many children, particularly looked-after children and certainly those who are going through the criminal justice system, need to be prioritised and need the support of the Government and Parliament.</p><p>When the minister considers preventative spending, I urge him to look at training. Training helps to ensure that those who work in the care home sector, local authorities, the criminal justice system and hospitals have the appropriate training so that we can identify mental health issues and intervene much earlier, as such intervention is extremely important.</p><p>Alison McInnes made an important point about integrated services and, in the social care debate last week, Dr Simpson asked about joint futures. That is the way to go. We need to work together to ensure that everyone in our society benefits from the knowledge we have even within the tight resources that are available.</p><p>I welcome many of the comments that have been about child and adolescent mental health services. We are moving forward and I welcome the Government&#8217;s spend of &#163;6.5 million for additional staff in that workforce. I also welcome the additional &#163;2.5 million to try to ensure that those services are taken out of a clinical or hospital base. After all, such locations are not the right or the most appropriate places for most of our children. I agree with Dr Simpson and, I think, Alison McInnes that we need to look at community-based locations where our young children can attend appointments and have the therapies that they require.</p><p>Much has been said about prescription drugs and prescribing by GPs. The fact is that that is their job; they make a clinical assessment and judge what their patient requires at that time. Nevertheless, the practice needs to be monitored and measured. I believe that we are moving in the right direction towards a more integrated approach with the psychological services that are available and I know that that will be welcomed.</p><p>I welcome NUS Scotland&#8217;s comments about its think positive campaign. University and college students feel a great deal of stress and anxiety; of course, some of that is to do with leaving home for the first time. Indeed, many parents experience the same emotions&#8212;although I have to say that they can also feel a sense of relief. However, I share the concern that, for LGBT groups in particular, there is still a lot of stigma attached to this issue and that we need to focus on moving away from that. Discrimination is neither warranted nor needed; young people must be able to live the lives that they wish to lead and I would welcome any move by the Government and the Parliament to ensure that resources are available to allow our young students to move positively through their education and beyond.</p><p>I also welcome the third sector&#8217;s initiatives. Many of those agencies have been working together to provide mental health first-aid training; indeed, I and many of my colleagues in the social care sector have benefited from it. I have already mentioned training&#8212;and will probably raise the issue in Parliament many times&#8212;but the fact is that if we are to move towards preventative spending, we have to examine the training base. People must have the appropriate training to provide the outcomes that are necessary and towards which we are all striving.</p><p>As I have said, we all have mental health. As Alison McInnes made clear, one in four of us will find ourselves in a situation that goes beyond our everyday mental health. As Dr Simpson pointed out, people are being prescribed drugs normally used to treat conditions beyond mild and moderate depression. We need to educate people about the fact that depression is not a singular thing but takes many forms. We do not know the root cause of it. We know why some people can feel depressed&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate and am positive about it.

Having sat round the table to look at procurement, I do not believe that quality is compromised. One of my duties as a service manager was to ensure that the quality of care was never compromised, regardless of the cost-cutting exercises that the local authority sometimes imposed.</p><p>It is right that every local authority tries to get the best value that it can from organisations with which it has contracts for care provision, because spending from the public purse must be held to account. However, we should never ever compromise on the quality of care.</p><p>There will always be examples of care that has been removed or of care that is inappropriate to the need. That comes down to basic assessment, which is essential to ensuring that we provide the care that an individual requires. That care is a moving thing. We cannot think that doing an assessment one week means that it is done for the next two, three or four years. Requirements constantly move and need to be monitored.</p><p>That is why it is important that all our people in social care have the appropriate training. It is disturbing to hear that many organisations in the public, private and third sectors are reducing their training budgets. However, many of them are starting to be innovative and to share training costs and are providing appropriate training, which is to be applauded.</p><p>We need minimum standards for qualifications. The work that is being done by the Government in collaboration with the Association of Directors of Social Work and the CCPS, and across the third sector, needs to ensure that the national standards and the guidelines that were set in September last year are being met. I note with concern the suggestion that the guidelines are not being adhered to in some authorities. If guidelines are not being adhered to, those authorities should be brought to account. We must ensure that we do not compromise social care in 2011. It should never be compromised at any time, because we are dealing with the most vulnerable in society.</p><p>The other day, we welcomed the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy to the Equal Opportunities Committee. She told us that outcomes and preventative care are extremely important and gave assurances about ensuring that we support our carers. The infrastructure has to be in place.

I might not do it too often, but in this instance I will congratulate him on bringing the issue of the AWPR to the attention of the chamber. It is an essential part of economic recovery in Scotland and will benefit the whole of Scotland, once it goes ahead. However, I take issue with Alex Johnstone on housing. Perhaps he has forgotten that &#163;1.7 billion was invested in the housing programme, which led to just over 27,000 houses being built over the past parliamentary period. In this session, there is a commitment to continue the housing build, with 6,000 affordable houses being built every year for the next five years, and 5,000 council houses being built. That is to be welcomed rather than scorned. It is one way of trying to tackle the homelessness problem that we face. Figures that were released in August showed that we have more than 23,000 empty homes. That is one of the reasons why the minister is introducing a bill that will give councils the ability to levy a charge on those empty homes. I look forward to councils taking advantage of that. It will certainly generate some income&#8212;a sum of &#163;30 million is being projected.</p><p>I welcome the fact that councils have stepped up to the mark with regard to identifying homelessness in their areas. At the moment, on average, 88 per cent of those who are homeless are given priority listing. In my area, Aberdeenshire, that figure is slightly above the average, at 89.5 per cent. We must achieve something beyond that, however, and that will involve the provision of housing for homeless people, which is something that I think this Government will take seriously. I hope that the chamber will endorse that and the progress that we make.</p><p>The issue of economic recovery is essential to the legislative programme. The north-east of Scotland is leading the way in that regard. I congratulate Alex Johnstone&#8212;after saying that I would not do it too often, I have just done it again&#8212;on raising the issue. The other day, I was at the Offshore Europe conference in Aberdeen. I spoke to representatives of the oil industry there and it was evident that they are aware that there is a skills shortage in Scotland at the moment. They are doing everything that they can to plug the gap: there are internships; there is the graduate programme; there are apprenticeships and so on. The north-east of Scotland is leading the way. I congratulate the oil sector, and Oil and Gas UK in particular, on moving ahead with that.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the renewable energy industry in the north-east of Scotland is leading the way. Offshore wind is certainly one of the ways in which we can move forward. I welcome the fact that Westhill in Aberdeen has become the renewables capital of Europe.</p><p>This morning, I heard Chief Constable Colin McKerracher referring to the proposal for a single police force, something that he does not advocate at all. I was surprised that the chief constable feels that the proposal would impact on local policing in the community. In my short term as an MSP, my contact with the police has been through the local constable, the local sergeant and the local inspector, all of whom, I believe, are at the heart of community policing&#8212;I do not think that the political and strategic role of the chief constable is. Perhaps Chief Constable McKerracher does not have his finger on the pulse with regard to what is going on politically. I received a letter from him just last month&#8212;addressed to the MSP for Aberdeenshire West, Mike Rumbles.</p><p>I congratulate the Government on taking forward initiatives for our young people.

My colleague Stewart Maxwell raised parents&#8217; concerns about the curriculum for excellence and I look forward to hearing the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response.</p><p>Mr Macintosh raised concerns about bullying in schools. The getting it right for every child approach is robust and the infrastructure is in place to try to ensure that children have a route to bring forward any concerns that they have about bullying. Physical bullying is very obvious, but the psychological bullying that sometimes takes place in schools is the most difficult, the most hurtful and the most harmful form of bullying. I am sure that every member of this Parliament agrees that we have to do everything that we can to ensure that it ceases. We have to pay tribute to guidance teachers in our schools who recognise it.</p><p>I look forward to engaging with our ministers to look at other ways of trying to ensure that our young people have a route to raise their concerns, so that, if they are being bullied and cannot turn to their guidance teachers or their peer groups, some advocacy and so on can be provided for them.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to the cabinet secretary that I am going to mention rural schools. I congratulate him on calling in the proposed closure of Clatt and Logie Coldstone schools in my constituency of Aberdeenshire West, but I hope that he can give me some assurance that a decision on the outcome will be taken in the very near future. We are coming towards the end of the school term and the children, parents, teachers and communities require a decision on what the outcome will be, so that they can plan for next term. Perhaps Aberdeenshire Council will look at the example of Argyll and Bute Council and shelve its closure proposals. That might prevent the cabinet secretary from having to make a decision.</p><p>I have concerns about children who have additional learning needs. Having had additional support myself through the education system, I sometimes fear that some educational needs are not being met on a needs-led basis and that provision is often driven by financial constraints. I endorse and support integrated education, but occasionally some children with multiple or complex needs may require special education, which may be in a special school within their community or in a residential school.

Prevention is by far the most important aspect for me. If we can prevent many of the things that happen to our older people&#8212;for example, trips and falls within their home and accidents immediately outside it&#8212;we can prevent them from going into hospital, which is indeed very expensive. However, the cause of such things is often neglected.</p><p>Many of our older people are supported by their carers, and we often leave it to the carers to provide that continual support. That is wrong and it should not continue, because our carers themselves require our support and care if they are not to become the ones who require care. Carers&#8217; health and wellbeing is extremely important to those whom they care for and we should ensure that we manage that appropriately.</p><p>Prevention is about basic things such as being aware, and that is where training is vital. We must ensure that every member of staff who works in the social care sector and cares for our older people in the community and residential and hospital settings has the appropriate training. That training can be very basic. It is about being aware. Has the person&#8217;s mood changed? Are they doing things that they do not normally do? Have they got stains on their clothes? Are they not hearing as well as they did? Are they getting disorientated in their home or out in the community? Those issues can flag up some basic problems. The older person might not be aware that they have picked up and are wearing the wrong spectacles and that that is causing them confusion. Someone who is not hearing particularly well might need to go to the district nurse and have their ears syringed. Those are the real problems that people can have, but they are often not picked up by the carers and the family and certainly not by our social care system. We need to focus on such elements in training, because they can prevent a great deal of harm from coming to our older people, and we can reduce the risks involved.</p><p>During the 30 years that I worked in social care, the bar was always being raised for the criteria for making interventions and putting in place the support that people need. Free personal care was a fantastic innovation in some respects and the concept was widely applauded. The cross-party consensus and support on that still exist and they are to be welcomed. However, it does not solve the whole problem. People face increased costs&#8212;for example, increased fuel costs&#8212;in staying in their own homes. For many people, it is heat or eat syndrome&#8212;we need to consider that and ensure that people are not left vulnerable.</p><p>Our social care system needs to reflect on that, too. If people need benefits to stay at home, we must ensure that they are given every opportunity to succeed in getting the benefits to which they are entitled. That is why we must support organisations such as the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, which was in Parliament for a reception the other night. I was delighted to hear the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth giving his endorsement to SCVO and expressing his hope to work with it in the future. That is incredibly important for the wellbeing of our older people.</p><p>We have heard today that one size does not fit all, and that is true. My Aberdeenshire West constituency is very rural in many aspects, and the approach to the rural sector needs to be a bit different from that which is taken in the cities. A lot of additional costs are incurred in rural areas. Getting to people can often mean a longer journey, and it can take a whole day for an older person to get to and from hospital. Often, people&#8217;s nutrition is not taken into cognisance when they are away from home for a whole day; that is especially important for people who have diabetes.</p><p>When we are looking at care for our older people, we need to ensure that we take a joined-up approach.

I congratulate you on your appointment.</p><p>As the constituency member for Aberdeenshire West, about 70 per cent of which is made up of the former West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine constituency, I pay tribute to Mike Rumbles, who served as the MSP for that constituency. Mike was a hard-working constituency MSP. He challenged the Government on many occasions, but I believe that he did that to the benefit of his constituents. I take the opportunity to thank all the people in Aberdeenshire West who voted for me. It is a great privilege to be in the Parliament and I sincerely hope that I will be able to serve them in the manner that they hope I shall in the next five years.</p><p>Much has been said in the debate about our natural resources. The natural resource on which I would like to focus has been mentioned, but just in the passing&#8212;it is the people of Scotland and the expertise and talent that we have here. In Aberdeenshire West, which probably has the second-largest number of people employed in the oil and gas industry, we have expertise, knowledge and talent that are easily transferable to the renewables sector. At a meeting that I had with Oil &amp; Gas UK not long after the bombshell of the announcement of the tax increase that has undermined the sector&#8217;s confidence for future development, its representatives told me that they are looking forward to the renewable energy sector coming on board. Companies in the oil and gas sector are starting to invest in renewable energy and are looking forward to transferring the skills from their sector into that area.</p><p>We have the ability in Scotland, and certainly in the north-east, to take advantage of the opportunity. I sincerely hope that companies in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire West and the north-east will consider promoting students in our universities and sponsoring graduates to enter the world of renewables. The sector is an important one that at present is worth about &#163;8.8 billion. By 2015, it should, we hope, be worth about &#163;15 billion.</p><p>Aberdeenshire West is a rural constituency. To refer again to the people, I would like to focus on the smaller industries and agencies that will probably support the infrastructure for renewable energy. I look forward to working with the Federation of Small Businesses in the north-east, because it has great ambitions for the area. The Government has pledged to continue with the small business bonus scheme. I look forward to working with small businesses in meeting the challenge of seeing where they fit in with the renewable sector.</p><p>I was interested in Sarah Boyack&#8217;s points about communities and community projects. I certainly became aware of those issues during the election campaign. I also became aware of the issues of wind farms. I might at some point hear from Mary Scanlon&#8217;s son, given that he is in my constituency. Some people like wind farms and some do not. Some people think that they are a blight on the landscape and some people do not. The issue is certainly contentious, but it can be addressed. We need to be a listening Government and take on board our communities&#8217; concerns about planning applications. The minister has said that his door is open on the issue. I look forward to engaging with him in reviewing and reforming planning. I hope that the planning process will take cognisance of communities, certainly when we consider future onshore wind farms.</p><p>It is a great privilege to be in the Parliament and to be speaking in the debate. I am conscious that we need to embrace the talent that we have.</p><p>Within our education structure, we need to look forward and educate our children about renewables for the future. The oil and gas industry still has a very important part to play and we should not underestimate it, but, as the minister said, oil and gas are finite resources that will be coming to an end. There are different projections on when they will come to an end, but at the moment the industry is a very important part of our economy and we should still support it as much as we can and encourage it to take its talents and resources to the renewables sector, too.</p><p>I have heard from the minister and various other ministers that their door will always be open for debates. My challenge is to find out where that open door is, but with Mr Q at my side, I am sure that I will do so.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
