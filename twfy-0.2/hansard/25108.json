I understand that 127 instances of self-immolation have been recorded in Tibet since 2009. In many cases, this form of protest is fatal, and it illustrates the increasing desperation of Tibetans, who have suffered extreme oppression at the hands of the Chinese Government.</p><p>Perhaps most concerning are the efforts of authorities in the region to conceal the true number of recorded self-immolations, so that the world cannot comprehend the scale of unrest in Tibet.</p><p>International observation tells us that restrictions on freedom of religion, degradation of water sources and a curtailment of media reporting are just some of the issues that the Tibetans face.</p><p>As Maureen Watt said, it has been reported that family members of those who have self-immolated face criminal charges through their association and that even witnesses to the events can face serious punishment from the Chinese authorities.</p><p>It is clear that there is an emerging international consensus to improve the lives of those living in Tibet and to hold China to account for its human rights record in the region. It is only through a greater understanding of the events that are taking place in Tibet that we will be able to build a coalition of resistance against oppression and state interference in the lives of those living there.</p><p>I acknowledge the excellent work that has been carried out by the Scottish centre for Himalayan research at the University of Aberdeen and the Tibet support group Grampian to highlight the extraordinary human rights abuses that often go unnoticed in the region. Work such as that will be instrumental in highlighting the daily struggles of Tibetans and can be part of the wider efforts to bring about a sustainable solution to the continuing abuses of the Tibetan population by the Chinese authorities.

It was important that we did not duplicate that work or overlap that activity but instead complemented and enhanced each investigation by setting clear terms, which we did. That enabled us to come up with 28 recommendations.</p><p>Having set the scene, I will turn my attention to the findings of the committee with regard to tackling child sexual exploitation in Scotland. In particular, I will focus on three areas in the report: the nature and extent of child sexual exploitation in Scotland, the vulnerabilities of young people, and the socialisation of young people with special regard to early intervention.</p><p>On the nature and extent of child sexual exploitation in Scotland, the committee found that, although the current definition of child sexual exploitation was deemed to be helpful by individuals and agencies and was seen as particularly important with regard to raising awareness and understanding of the issue, there were some reservations about it. The committee made a number of recommendations in that regard, which included the Scottish Government giving high priority to ensuring that high quality data collection tools that would supply vital information on the prevalence and nature of CSE in Scotland could be identified, standardised, and rolled out across Scotland. Such an approach will provide information that is necessary to inform a co-ordinated strategy for tackling and preventing child sexual exploitation and supporting victims. We would not need to start from scratch: the committee heard from Sheila Taylor MBE and Cheryl Stevens of the national working group for sexually exploited children and young people, and from the Forth valley child protection committee pilot study, both of which groups have existing data collection tools.</p><p>On the issue of the vulnerabilities of young people, it would be true to say that all children and young people are vulnerable to some extent, no matter how well they are nurtured and supported by their family and schools. However, within Scottish society, there is a group of children and young people who are particularly vulnerable: those who are in the care system. As a consequence, it is of particular importance that the committee&#8217;s recommendations with regard to children and young people in the care system are taken forward as a high priority.</p><p>On the issue of socialisation, as a mother of three children&#8212;two of whom are teenagers and the third of whom is in primary school&#8212;I cannot emphasise enough the vital role that education programmes can play in making children aware of the dangers and pitfalls that exist, especially in this era of instant global communication. As other members have noted, the use and misuse of social networking is a hugely worrying concern and is an issue that should be tackled. That is why there is a need for the Scottish Government to address the committee&#8217;s recommendations around the socialisation of young people and early intervention.</p><p>I wish to draw the chamber&#8217;s attention to the vital role that education in its broadest sense&#8212;I include training in this regard&#8212;can play in tackling and preventing child sexual exploitation and supporting the victims.</p><p>I cannot overstate the importance of the committee&#8217;s overarching recommendation, which is that the Scottish Government should develop a national strategy for tackling child sexual exploitation. Such a national strategy would provide a framework for a co-ordinated national approach, which would have a tripartite goal of tackling CSE, preventing CSE and supporting victims of CSE. Only by having such an approach can the issues that I highlighted be addressed, which would enable us to create a society that has at its core the wellbeing of its children and young people and the aim of protecting them from the scourge of child sexual exploitation.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am especially pleased to participate in the debate, as I am a member of the Public Petitions Committee that produced the report on tackling child sexual exploitation.

I thank Jackson Carlaw for stepping up to the plate and enabling the debate to go ahead, and I wish Annabel Goldie a speedy recovery.</p><p>As members will be aware, I have a professional interest and experience in youth and adult offender education. In my position in social work in Glasgow, I witnessed the vital role that education can and does play in assisting offenders to rehabilitate themselves in their local community and in providing them with a means to gain meaningful employment after release.</p><p>I want to focus on two things: the pilot throughcare support project in HMP Greenock and some of the comments that have been attributed to Lord Carloway.</p><p>Turning first to the throughcare project, it is plain that the figures speak for themselves. The Scottish Prison Service has invested some &#163;70,000 in taking forward the initiative. Those are moneys well spent, particularly when one considers that reoffending costs the Scottish economy &#163;3 billion per year. Given that in 2009-10 more than 47,000 Scots were convicted of a criminal offence; that 30 per cent of those individuals were reconvicted within a year; and that one in five offenders in Scotland has 10 or more previous convictions, we need the kind of initiatives that are promoted within HMP Greenock, with their strong emphasis on training and education. I understand that the scheme&#8217;s benefits are secured by the team of throughcare support officers to whom Jackson Carlaw referred, who assist offenders leaving custody in accessing services such as housing, benefits and addiction support. That approach, along with interagency working in communities, can provide both pre-release and post-release support to not just prisoners but their families and the wider community.</p><p>In recent days, Lord Carloway, the Lord Justice Clerk, has suggested that Scotland&#8217;s prison population is too high and that the wrong people are too often placed behind bars. He has also argued that prison sentencing should shift from a culture of retribution to one that takes greater account of the impact on inmates and wider society and stated that agencies should look at models in Scandinavia where prison populations have been significantly reduced. Last year, Sweden, which is known for its emphasis on rehabilitation and liberal approaches to sentencing, announced plans to close four of its prisons because of a significant fall in the prison population. In that country, reoffending is roughly half that of Scotland&#8217;s. Perhaps that example provides us with one more reason why it is important for initiatives such as HMP Greenock&#8217;s throughcare project to be undertaken and properly evaluated to assess their impact on offenders and rates of offending and reoffending.</p><p>Educational initiatives such as the throughcare project are vital as we strive to battle the problem of reoffending, and I look forward with interest to the publication of the evaluation of the project&#8217;s first operational year, which I believe is expected in the spring. I am especially interested in understanding more about how the project actually worked in practice and offenders&#8217; opinions about its success. In Scotland, we need a culture shift in our sentencing of offenders to ensure that rehabilitation and restorative justice are prioritised over the futile and counterproductive short sentences that we have become used to. I believe that such projects are the first step in realising that prison should be more than punishment and that they will provide compelling evidence to inform our future approaches to criminal justice.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843781", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Throughcare Support Project (HMP Greenock)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to participate in tonight&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate on the throughcare support project at HMP Greenock.

This commendable social enterprise offers young people in Angus opportunities to participate in a variety of activities. I understand that the formal aspects of the provision include training for employment, health guidance and citizenship education. I am happy to note that the Arbroath CAFE project has achieved national and international recognition for its endeavours and achievements in providing a comprehensive alternative to alcohol and drug misuse and the subsequent involvement in criminal activities that can so easily result from that for some young people.</p><p>The subject of developing programmes for alternatives to drug and alcohol misuse is close to my heart, as I have previously worked in that field in the voluntary and statutory sectors. I was fortunate enough to gain extremely valuable experience as an addiction counsellor in Glasgow. As a consequence, I am very aware of the challenges that workers in the field of alcohol and drug misuse face, especially when working with young people.</p><p>I am aware that all those involved in supporting the Arbroath CAFE project have worked hard to seek the funding required to maintain the services that it provides for young people. They achieved their goal through generating donations, hosting fundraising events and sourcing various grants for which they were eligible. They should be commended for that task in itself.</p><p>I take this opportunity to make a suggestion about utilising the experience of the Arbroath CAFE project. Again, I draw on my experience of working in community learning and development in both formal and informal settings. The Arbroath CAFE project brings together the two elements of community learning and development&#8212;youth work and adult education&#8212;in a supplementary and complementary fashion. In that way, it is an example of community development that would lend itself easily to a process of peer education, whereby the valuable experience and skills that have been gained through the Arbroath CAFE project could be disseminated to similar groups and organisations across Scotland.

I am confident that members across the chamber will agree that opioid replacements such as methadone can, in particular circumstances, help to stabilise drug users and direct them away from the most harmful of illegal drugs.</p><p>However, I am also confident that we could do much more to help addicts to dispose of their drug habit altogether through greater use of community recovery resources. I believe that, as a short-term solution, methadone can act as an effective intervention that removes the individual from dependency on other substances and the lifestyle associated with acquiring that. However, a longer-term strategy will need to address the social, economic and medical reasons behind the process of addiction to drugs such as ecstasy, cocaine and heroin.</p><p>The most effective strategy will not just be medical but will reflect on the reasons why people become addicted and provide individuals with a route out of their addiction altogether. Fundamentally, that will mean tackling effectively problems such as poverty, unemployment, homelessness and crime. The harsh reality is that there is no one solution that will comprehensively eradicate the harm caused by drug addiction. Serious investment is required in a number of areas if we are to have a greater impact on the lives of those most affected.</p><p>I welcome the findings of the review into opioid replacement therapies, which recommends that we attempt to prioritise recovery from addiction and aim to work more consistently with grass-roots agencies across the country. However, I would still like to see from the Scottish Government a timetable outlining the action being taken to provide clear and effective routes from addiction to recovery. Those who depend on the support of key agencies and services are not only the drug users themselves but their families and the wider community, all of whom are affected by the criminal behaviour that facilitates the traffic of drugs into Scotland.</p><p>Having worked within the field of addiction for the past 20 years in various roles and projects, including latterly as a social work professional for Glasgow City Council, I know that drug treatment and testing orders can play an important role in helping to deal with drug-related crime&#8212;a point that is also highlighted in the report. However, my experience has taught me that we need to use DTTOs better as part of a joined-up system that supports addicts to overcome their addiction. Very often, drug treatment and testing orders are too little, too late and are handed down to individuals who are already well acquainted with a life of hard drugs and the criminal behaviour required to pay for them.</p><p>We need to be smarter about when we intervene with drug users. In my view, intervention should be as early as possible. Our agencies should be working within local communities where drug dependency is known to be high, and they should be carrying out preventive work with young people in schools and youth centres. For established users, our systems need to be effective at helping those who combine a number of drugs as well as those who misuse alcohol on top of drugs. It is a mistake to oversimplify the problem by isolating substances and neglecting the pattern of abuse that, for too long, has ruined lives and families.</p><p>We know that the number of drug deaths in Scotland is too high. I will work with the Scottish Government to tackle that tragic reality, and I commend the basic principles of the report on ORT. I urge the Government to look more widely at the issues that we face and to place an emphasis on the kind of preventive work that will result in Scotland becoming a cleaner and safer place to live for future generations.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22768223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Expert Review of Opioid Replacement Therapies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am keen to contribute to this important debate on the review of opioid replacement therapies in Scotland.

That figure is a disgrace in modern Scotland. I truly believe that by eliminating some remaining differences, we can remove the stigma that affects so many of our young people.</p><p>As has been mentioned, access to civil partnerships was a huge, commendable step forward, but it ensured that a division between same-sex and mixed-sex couples carried on into the 21st century.

I recognise that equality does not mean that we all have to be the same, but in my view it means sharing the institution of marriage with those who have suffered discrimination, oppression and persecution for centuries.</p><p>I also believe that the principle of equality should be extended to heterosexual couples who would like their relationship to be recognised in a different way. I have argued that civil partnerships should be extended to mixed-sex couples who choose to celebrate their relationship in a civil or secular ceremony outside of traditional marriage. As a consequence of denying heterosexual people access to civil partnerships, we are, once again, segregating couples based on their sexual orientation.

In the report, the Government recognised that the diet and nutritional health of the mother before conception and during pregnancy are a key factor in the health of the foetus.</p><p>An individual&#8217;s socioeconomic status can be a determining factor in many issues to do with health. That is the case for pregnant mothers. The growing up in Scotland study survey found that 81 per cent of women who had a lower-level standard grade had taken folic acid when they were pregnant, compared with 96 per cent of the women who were educated to degree level. Some 81 per cent of women in the lowest income group had taken folic acid, compared with 97 per cent in the highest income group. The figures show that some children are already at a disadvantage when they are born into this world.</p><p>In the same study it was found that only 48 per cent of women took folic acid prior to their pregnancy but 90 per cent took folic acid during their pregnancy. However, we should note that not all pregnancies are planned and that that could affect those figures.</p><p>The Scottish Spina Bifida Association&#8217;s &#8220;Are you getting enough?&#8221; campaign highlights an issue that has been prevalent in Scotland for some time now. According to Eurocat&#8212;European surveillance of congenital anomalies&#8212;Scotland had a higher prevalence of neural tube defects in 2010 compared with other European nations. Although the national health service has produced guidelines to inform women about neural tube defects, over 50 per cent of sexually active women are not taking folic acid on a regular basis. However, it is thought that compliance with the NHS guidelines could see cases of neural tube defects reduced by up to 72 per cent. If we are to tackle this problem, we need to ensure that we give expectant mothers fair and equal treatment to ensure that each one&#8217;s child is born with the best possible chance in life.</p><p>Although the taking of folic acid before and during pregnancy does not totally remove the risk of a child contracting spina bifida, it reduces the risk significantly.

Children learn to play before they learn to walk or talk, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that their experiences are of good quality and are meaningful.</p><p>Encouragement of play among children depends not on any single factor but on genuine investment in every area of a child&#8217;s life. Play should be a focus in formal and informal environments. It should be a priority in schools and in the home.

First, as nearly all members said, the 1974 act is almost 40 years old and, although it has undergone review, a major review is long overdue, particularly in relation to the provision of genuine learning and skills development opportunities for offenders.</p><p>Secondly, in the years since the 1974 act was passed the world has changed, as have the rights of citizens, including those whom the courts have convicted of criminal offences. The 1974 act is no longer fit for purpose in 21st century society.</p><p>Last but not least, from my experience of working in addiction, education, social work and particularly youth justice, I know that it is vital that we take an inclusive approach to targeting and supporting young people who are deemed at risk of reoffending and that we support young and adult offenders who are serving custodial sentences.</p><p>I am sure that all members agree that early intervention is of paramount importance, especially for the identification and putting in place of measures to support those who are most at risk of developing offending behaviour. Key to that is improved learning and skills in later life. As has been shown in the Scottish Government&#8217;s document &#8220;Offender Learning: Options for Improvement&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;There is a growing recognition that investing resources to support vulnerable families is a key part of an effective anti-poverty strategy whose many benefits will include lower rates of youth offending.&#8221;</p><p>I will turn my attention to young people in Scotland. Young people are Scotland&#8217;s biggest asset. It is in all our interests to ensure that they have encouragement and support so that they can make the transition to adulthood. However, Glasgow, the area that I represent, has been top of the local authority league of those who have the highest number of 16 to 18-year-olds in the justice system. The Scottish Prisons Commission noted that Scotland locks up a disproportionately high number of young people and, in addition to the financial cost, that has a social and economic impact on the lives of those young people. It is essential that education, learning and skills opportunities have a central role in striving to transform the future lives of those young people.</p><p>I now turn my attention to the needs of adult offenders. Research has shown that the most pressing need is adult literacy and numeracy. A comprehensive approach must be adopted to overcome the literacy issue. If literacy is not a central goal it will prove to be a major barrier to an inclusive approach to offering education, learning and skills opportunities as part of the rehabilitation programme.</p><p>I have merely signposted the need for offering education, learning and skills opportunities as an inclusive and necessary part of rehabilitation. However, at this point, I should say that all that does not necessarily need to be delivered through the usual route of sitting at a desk reading for two hours. It can be an opportunity for prisons to use sport, the gym, art, drama, mentoring, pro-social modelling and computing. Many of those activities are being used, but it would be of benefit if more were happening.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is right to say that when people break the law, we are right to hold them to account for their offending behaviour through our justice system. However, if rehabilitation is to have any true meaning, it is vital that the modernisation and reform of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 incorporates provisions for genuine opportunities for offenders, so that they can develop their learning and skills acquisition and give them real tools that will help them to improve their lives after a custodial sentence, as well as the lives of their families and communities. Such approaches can offer people a route out of offending and give them a more productive and positive future, which I am sure we all seek.</p><p>It would not be inaccurate to say that the emphasis has been on punishing people. Enabling them to move on in their lives and be productive by offering them effective support has rarely been given the same priority. If the Scottish Government is genuine about taking a truly innovative approach to the rehabilitation of offenders, it will ensure that opportunities to gain education and skills are central to what is offered to an offender while they serve a custodial sentence. It is clear that learning, education and skills opportunities can have a positive impact on reducing reoffending as the vast majority of offenders share a common profile. They come from deprived backgrounds, fail to engage at school, and leave with low levels of attainment and poor skills. That reduces the number of opportunities that are available to them and all too often leads them into a confirmed pattern of repeat offending that can carry on throughout their lives.</p><p>Education, learning and skills opportunities can help to break that cycle by teaching new skills that can help offenders to change and develop a positive future for themselves and their families. I urge the Scottish Government to make education, learning and skills opportunities creative, meaningful, relevant and central to its modernisation and reform of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This feels rather like the graveyard shift.

Westerton garden suburb borders the Glasgow region that I represent, and it is adjacent to the Drumchapel and Anniesland ward that I represented as a Glasgow councillor for many years. On a personal note, Westerton garden suburb is only a few streets away from where I reside with my family, so I could say that I am a neighbour and that I know the area well.</p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note the historical background to the area that has become known as Westerton. I am especially pleased to note that it was the first garden suburb in Scotland. The aim in building it 100 years ago, in 1913, was to create high-quality and affordable housing for the working classes. I am sad to say that that is still every bit as necessary today as it was all those years ago.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to note that the approach was co-operative. Under the chairmanship of Sir John Stirling Maxwell, there was the vision and drive to build country cottage-style housing, surrounded by open countryside, and to make Westerton for Glasgow working people. The purpose of transforming land that had a few scattered farms was to establish a community setting with housing for the working classes of Glasgow, and to provide social and cultural amenities that are essential if a community is to survive and that support it as it strives to grow. Such amenities included shops, schools, recreational and social facilities within a community setting.</p><p>I am pleased to note today that Westerton has grown and expanded, with new estates, a purpose-built primary school and social amenities, such as its own bowling green, church and new hall, all of which support the increased population that now resides in the area. There is also outstanding nursery provision, and I feel obliged to say that I have an interest because one my friends works there.</p><p>All that development centres on 31 houses that were built with the aim of establishing a garden suburb. It is true that we can and should learn from history, particularly about the design and support that are required to allow communities to thrive and develop and be places where people wish to live.</p><p>I am pleased to wish my neighbours congratulations on becoming 100 years old and wish Westerton garden suburb every success for the next 100 years.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697969", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Westerton Garden Suburb"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to contribute to this discussion and thank Joan McAlpine for opening the debate.

I am pleased to hear that Dalbeattie high school will be involved in such an exciting challenge and wish them all the best with their endeavours. I, too, welcome our guests to the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>I take this opportunity to mention the different learning styles that are available to not only children and young people, but adults living in communities across Scotland. Given my background and my degree qualification in community education, I will highlight the roles that community learning and development play in complementing the formal education sector through a community development approach.</p><p>I set the scene by referring to the historical context and the origins and development of the formal education sector in Scotland. The formal school sector has long enjoyed an international reputation as part of one of the best educated societies in the world. That tradition is being advanced by Dalbeattie high school&#8217;s participation in the da Vinci challenge.</p><p>The Education Act 1696, which was an act of the Parliament of Scotland, saw the establishment and development of schools that were open to all boys and girls, regardless of their status. It was not until the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 that schooling was made compulsory for children aged five to 13 years of age, which laid the basis of the modern education system. Why the history lesson? The openness of the education system in Scotland and the quality of provision have been the subjects of much myth making.</p><p>Alex Fergusson&#8217;s motion shows what young people in Scotland can achieve if they are given the right support. In April, in my region, Glasgow City Council&#8217;s education service established the employability and skills partnership team, which helps young people in the city to access vocational education while they are at school.</p><p>The introduction of comprehensive education, in legislation in 1965, improved access to education. An attempt was made to provide an adequate standard for all children in Scotland.</p><p>Community learning and development can play a key role in not only complementing but supplementing the formal education sector. It is a way of working to support communities to increase the skills, confidence, networks and resources that they need if they are to tackle problems and grasp opportunities. In short, it is a distinct sector of education, alongside school and further and higher education.</p><p>The application of the community development approach to the creation of learning opportunities can support: the identification of the local population&#8217;s educational needs; the planning of provision to meet and support those needs; the promotion of alternative programmes; and the monitoring and evaluation of the planned programmes. Those four points are taken from a paper that Ted Milburn&#8212;a former lecturer of mine, who became a professor of community education&#8212;delivered some 26 years ago.</p><p>What Ted Milburn said more than a quarter of a century ago is more than relevant today. The community learning and development approach is important, not just in its ability to complement and supplement the formal education sector but as a way of taking forward social and economic initiatives, to tackle the poverty and social deprivation that are, unfortunately, still prevalent in too many communities in Scotland.</p><p>We therefore need to share examples of good practice, such as the vocational training programme that Glasgow City Council is running and the initiative at Dalbeattie high school. We wish the pupils of Dalbeattie high school well in their endeavours; I hope that they will come back and tell us that they are champions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dalbeattie High School (Da Vinci Challenge)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Alex Ferguson on securing today&#8217;s debate.

That is welcome news for families on low incomes right across the UK, who have for too long been subject to the exploitative business practices of payday lenders, who charge up to 6,000 per cent interest for short-term credit.

Amina visited Scottish secondary schools to discuss Islam with pupils and recognised a problem. A staggering 70 per cent of the pupils to whom it spoke associated incredibly false and negative ideas with Muslim women. Amina identified that problem and immediately went about fixing it. We can all be proud of its campaign to challenge misconceptions about Muslim women by actively getting out and speaking to Muslim women about their experiences, identity and personal beliefs.</p><p>Nil by Mouth is another excellent example of a charity that works hard to challenge negative religious stereotypes. On a budget of only &#163;60,000, it delivered workshops to more than 5,000 people last year in my region of Glasgow.

I am keen to contribute to discussions on what is a growing economic problem and to highlight the effects of underemployment on women and young people in particular.</p><p>Underemployment is a deeply concerning social problem that has the ability to mask the poverty that families across Scotland face. It lurks behind unemployment figures that fail to reflect the reality of individuals who face financial hardship.</p><p>I was grateful to read the submission that Professor David Bell of the University of Stirling made to the committee. I thank him and his colleagues for their continued research into the social and economic consequences of chronic underemployment in Scotland.</p><p>I accept that, for most people, part-time work is better than no work at all, but thousands of people in Scotland are looking for no more than a full-time position in the company that they currently work for, or simply a job that adequately reflects their training, experience and ability.</p><p>It has been suggested that the answer to the problem of underemployment is more training. Training may indeed be the answer for some young people who aspire to work in specific professions and sectors. It is often a natural solution to a problem that seems to have a disproportionate impact on those who have recently completed a course of full-time education. However, I do not believe that the negative effects of underemployment can be dealt with simply by upskilling workers to enable them to compete for higher-level positions.</p><p>As we have heard, underemployment is not only about seeking more hours; it is also about people working in roles for which they are overqualified. That might be the graduate who returns to the job that they did before going to university just to make ends meet, or the college leaver who does three part-time jobs while they look for a fourth. It might involve accepting a zero-hours contract, despite the fact that such a contract does not offer any security, a guaranteed income or longer-term benefits.</p><p>That is not to say that greater flexibility in working is not welcome. Part-time contracts can, in particular circumstances, offer some individuals a way of accommodating family and other commitments alongside their working life, but choosing to seek a part-time job is not the same as being compelled to take one in order to secure some work, however infrequent. That is why I join my Scottish Labour colleagues in calling on the Scottish Government to ensure that the upcoming procurement reform bill guards against the damaging use of zero-hours contracts by companies that bid for public sector contracts.</p><p>I am concerned by recent statistics regarding the profile of those who are experiencing underemployment. Alongside young people, women are disproportionately affected. If we are to continue to break down the barriers of gender inequality that we still face across the country, underemployment must be addressed. I am pleased that the committee believes that improved childcare provision is important in tackling the issue, and I would urge it to consider deeper analysis of the causes of gender imbalance in those suffering from underemployment.</p><p>The on-going economic challenges that we face in Scotland have had deep and damaging consequences for families across the country. We must work to ensure that surface improvements do not mask those who are struggling to make ends meet. Underemployment is a symptom of an economy that is failing to meet the needs of ordinary people. I urge the Scottish Government to do all that it can to address the damaging effects of these employment practices and to end the exploitation of workers on low incomes by large corporations for financial gain.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Underemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on its comprehensive report on the scale and effects of underemployment in Scotland.

They will be aware that private landlords throughout the country have benefited from the difficulties faced by first-time buyers, the unintended consequences of the bedroom tax and the devastating reality of high unemployment. That combination of factors means that the size of the private rented sector has doubled in the past 10 years and that it now accounts for 12 per cent of all housing stock.</p><p>I am aware of several tenants in my region, often young ones, whose deposits have been unfairly retained for a highly questionable justification and often with no explanation at all. That is why I welcome the introduction of the tenancy deposit schemes and the legal requirement to register deposits in one of three approved schemes. However, I am profoundly concerned that, since the introduction of the requirement, only half of all deposits have been registered.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland has considered that failure in some detail. It highlighted that 55 per cent of tenants are completely unaware that their landlords are legally required to register deposits, despite the fact that it is the tenants who are required to take action if the landlords have not registered their deposits in one of the compulsory schemes. Furthermore, Citizens Advice Scotland confirmed that nearly 30 per cent of all housing inquiries are concerned with the private rented sector and, specifically, the unfair retention of deposits by landlords.</p><p>The Scottish Government must recognise the scale of the challenge that it faces in achieving compliance with the deposit schemes, and it must provide the additional resource that will be necessary to achieve the principal aim of ensuring that tenants&#8217; deposits are not withheld by unscrupulous landlords.</p><p>In response to my recent question S4W-15152, the Scottish Government failed to commit to any changes in the way in which it enforces the deposit schemes or the support that it awards to charities such as Citizens Advice Scotland that are on the front line in the battle to protect vulnerable tenants from exploitation.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland, Shelter Scotland and the NUS Scotland have all recognised that the Scottish Government must do more to make tenants and landlords aware of the tenancy deposit schemes.

I commend Age Scotland for the excellent work that it has done to support Scotland&#8217;s older people. Members throughout the chamber will recognise the benefits brought by the advice, advocacy and assistance provided by Age Scotland to older people across the country. My experience of working directly with that exceptional charity&#8217;s volunteers has made me understand the difference that such support makes to older people in both urban and rural areas of the region that I represent.</p><p>It is clear to the volunteers and the staff at Age Scotland that the needs of older people living in different areas are rarely the same. That is particularly true when we talk about the provision of transport and the availability of local bus services. The still waiting campaign aims to challenge the differing levels of available public transport by extending the national concessionary travel scheme to include the community transport provisions that are often far more accessible for the 188,000 disabled people in Scotland who are entitled to concessionary travel.</p><p>As Age Scotland&#8217;s case studies show, extending the free travel pass scheme to include community transport providers would have profound benefits for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. It is easy to forget that a bus fare can mean the difference between a person feeling isolated and their being able to identify as part of a wider community. Including demand-responsive transport services, such as those that are provided by the South West Community Transport scheme in Glasgow, which I visited only last month, would help older and disabled people to feel part of their local communities when otherwise they would not.</p><p>More than 180 community transport providers in Scotland have provided, in the past year, more than 3.5&#160;million journeys. Therefore, the proposal to extend the scheme seeks not to help a handful of people, but to address the needs of communities.</p><p>Our rapidly ageing population means that demand for transport services among older people will increase substantially. That increase will inevitably require politicians to look again at how we provide concessionary travel to the growing population of vulnerable older and disabled people. We should take action now to ensure that tomorrow&#8217;s generation of retired and disabled people can enjoy the highest possible level of support and not be restricted from using the most accessible and beneficial transport services available to them in their communities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to contribute on the important subject of Age Scotland&#8217;s still waiting campaign, which promotes the extension of the existing national concessionary travel scheme.

However, homelessness among young people is often a result not of failure to pay rent or redundancy from employment, but of family breakdown and the absence of effective intervention.</p><p>The UK homelessness charity Crisis&#8212;which I thank for its detailed briefing for the debate&#8212;has identified that most young people who end up without accommodation do so because they have been told by parents or carers to leave the family home. However, it would be naive to assume that the current levels of youth unemployment across the country have played no role in family breakdowns, which can follow periods of mental ill health, deteriorating personal relationships and concerns about household finances. In truth, we can recognise that cuts to housing benefits, the welfare reforms and high unemployment affect youth homelessness just as much as they affect housing issues for people who are over the age of 25.</p><p>That illustrates the need for effective intervention services that offer support and good-quality accommodation for young people after they leave the family home, or exit care services, after the age of 18. Crisis has recognised that the overwhelming majority of young people who find themselves without accommodation have been considered to be vulnerable. More than 50 per cent have been excluded from school, and more than 40 per cent have been identified as survivors of some form of abuse. A third of homeless young people are known to self-harm. The work of charities such as Shelter Scotland and Quarriers has become invaluable in efforts to achieve the aims of the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003, and is central to identifying the young people who are at most risk of becoming homeless.</p><p>The most effective means of tackling the root causes of youth homelessness is third sector organisations working in partnership with well-resourced social work departments across local government. Having worked in Glasgow City Council&#8217;s social work services for children and young people, I know first hand that social work services engage with local and national voluntary organisations to share information and resources when that is necessary for the benefit of the most vulnerable young people.</p><p>However, I have also experienced the effects of cuts to local government budgets and staff, and the inevitable impact that cuts have had on the ability of social work to support the young people who are most affected by family breakdown. Ambitious targets such as those in the 2003 act are commendable, but they are utterly meaningless without proper resourcing and the financial assistance that allow staff to dedicate the appropriate time to individuals and families that have unique and complex needs.</p><p>The lack of affordable social housing in Scotland compounds that problem and means that, even when social work staff have addressed the needs of the young people with whom they work, the level of assistance that they can provide may be further restricted due to the limited supply of suitable accommodation.</p><p>We can all agree that the existence of youth homelessness is a devastating reality and that much more should be done to protect people under 25 who face the prospect of living on the streets. Ultimately, we must commit to the necessary increase in the resources that are awarded to local government so that our social work services are able to dedicate the necessary time to every young person who is at risk in our communities.</p><p>The excellent work of our voluntary sector must be complemented by an adequately funded public sector and a substantial increase in the construction of affordable social housing across the country. That collective approach is the only route to ensuring that Scotland&#8217;s young people are not casualties of Westminster&#8217;s welfare reform, the Scottish Government&#8217;s local government cuts, and rising levels of unemployment.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Having and Keeping a Home"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to today&#8217;s debate and I thank the members of the Equal Opportunities Committee for their time on, and commitment to, the important subject of homelessness among Scotland&#8217;s young people.

Too many of us are unaware of the changes that she brought about for people across Glasgow. I hope that members will acknowledge some of those changes in their speeches.</p><p>Mary Rough was born into a working-class family in Kilbarchan in 1875. Later, she moved with her family to the village of Elderslie. That was before she married David Barbour and settled in the Govan area of Glasgow, where she worked as a thread twister and carpet printer. As a working-class mother of two children in Govan, she was well aware of the poverty and deprivation faced by ordinary people, particularly women. Those experiences led her to take an active part in Scotland&#8217;s first co-operative women&#8217;s guild at the Kinning Park Co-operative Society. That guild later became known for producing a generation of leading female politicians and activists, many of whom played a crucial role in the establishment of women&#8217;s housing associations throughout Glasgow and in the 1915 rent strike.</p><p>It was during that rent strike that Mary became known for her effective local activism and for encouraging the political radicalisation of ordinary working people in Glasgow. Mary recognised the need to organise women into a united resistance that would fight against underhand rent increases being applied by unscrupulous landlords. In her efforts to challenge that injustice, she went on to form the South Govan Housing Association, which would later become known as Mary Barbour&#8217;s army.</p><p>The housing associations later brought about an end to the protests when, on 17 November 1915, they initiated one of Glasgow&#8217;s biggest demonstrations. That mass demonstration, which included shipyard workers who downed tools, was in response to eviction notices being served on 47 local campaigners. The protestors&#8217; march on the courts shocked the establishment so much that rents were frozen at pre-war levels, and eventually led to the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;amp;c Act 1919.</p><p>Mary became Glasgow&#8217;s first woman councillor in 1920. Throughout her 11 years as a councillor for the Fairfield ward in Govan, she championed the needs of working-class women and children. She was instrumental in the establishment of public washhouses, laundries and baths. She is perhaps most famous as the campaigner who brought about an initiative that supplied fresh milk to schoolchildren free of charge. She also promoted the development of child welfare centres, brought about the establishment of home help for vulnerable people living alone and championed the introduction of a pension scheme for mothers.</p><p>Mary broke new ground in 1924 when she became the first woman baillie in the Glasgow Corporation. She used her time as baillie to support calls for birth control for women and chaired the women&#8217;s welfare and advisory clinic, Glasgow&#8217;s first family planning centre. She retired from politics in 1931, having played a pivotal role in improving the lives of working people, championing in particular the rights of women and children across Glasgow.</p><p>The case for a permanent monument to commemorate Mary Barbour&#8217;s achievements is compelling. As we move towards sourcing funding for our monument, we must remember the campaign&#8217;s significance not only for Govan, Glasgow and Mary Barbour&#8217;s legacy but in highlighting the wider absence of memorials to historically significant women. The excellent work of the mapping memorials to women in Scotland project addresses that issue. Developed by women&#8217;s history Scotland, the Glasgow Women&#8217;s Library and Girlguiding Scotland, the project has helped map out the locations of memorials to women throughout Scotland. The project, which received a message of support from the First Minister last year, is vital in ensuring that the contributions of women throughout history are not overlooked.</p><p>Our campaign has relied on the hard work of many people, but some deserve a special mention. I take the opportunity to thank Maria Fyfe, who chairs the remember Mary Barbour committee and has worked tirelessly to raise the campaign&#8217;s profile&#8212;she sends her sincere apologies for her unavoidable absence today; Cathy Jamieson MP; Mary Lockhart, who has worked incredibly hard within the Co-operative movement on the issue; Caroline Wilson of the Glasgow Evening Times, who has shown huge commitment to and passion for the campaign; Sharon Thomas, an artist, who was commissioned to produce a unique portrait of Mary Barbour; Elaine Dougall of Unite the Union; the women&#8217;s committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress; Glasgow Labour women&#8217;s forum; and Glasgow city councillors. I thank all of them and the countless others who have joined us along the way.</p><p>I hope that the debate will encourage greater awareness of the life and achievements of Mary Barbour. Again, I thank all those who have worked so hard to bring about a permanent and lasting reminder of a true Glasgow heroine.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mary Barbour Commemoration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am genuinely delighted to bring the campaign to recognise Mary Barbour&#8217;s achievements and legacy before the Scottish Parliament, and I thank members across the chamber for their cross-party support and for joining me in calling for a statue to be dedicated to the memory of Mrs Barbour.

Thousands of people across Scotland are suffering from decisions by the Association of British Insurers not to renew the statement of principles on flood insurance when the agreement expires in June. As a result of that decision, policy holders in high-risk areas have been left with no assurance that they will be able to secure affordable insurance policies to cover their assets against natural disasters. Failure to reach an agreement will mean that the cost of household insurance for ordinary home owners is likely to rise substantially. That will result in many families being priced out of an insurance policy that would provide protection for the biggest investment in their lives&#8212;their home.</p><p>This is not an insignificant or isolated issue that affects only a small number of properties that are located around the coast or near large rivers. This is a huge issue for thousands of households throughout Scotland. Four of the five wettest years on record have been since 2000&#8212;we have all got the umbrellas and frizzy hair to prove it. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has recognised that flooding is the greatest natural threat facing the UK and has estimated that approximately 112,000 homes and 14,000 businesses across Scotland are at serious risk of flooding.</p><p>One out of every 22 homes and one out of every 14 businesses in Scotland are considered to be at risk from coastal, river or surface flooding. That means that a huge number of homes and businesses throughout the country face dramatic increases in the cost of insurance if a workable solution is not found in the near future, through negotiation between the insurance industry and Government.</p><p>I understand that positive steps have been made towards reconciling some of the issues that have been highlighted by the Association of British Insurers and the working procedures of the statutory bodies that are charged with oversight of flooding concerns. Such an agreement has been reached with 29 of the 32 local authorities, meaning that relevant information can be shared through the Scottish flood defence asset database with stakeholders, including insurance bodies, for the task of price setting.</p><p>I welcome that development and recognise that much more collaboration is necessary between local authorities, Government and the insurance industry to bring about a resolution that benefits home owners in areas that are most at risk of flooding. I am concerned that the date of extinction of the previous agreement is fast approaching, and I am aware that families and businesses in Scotland would appreciate the certainty that a renewed statement of principles would bring. I urge stakeholders to work together, with urgency, so that we can provide affordable, comprehensive insurance policies for those individuals who are at risk of being unable to afford the most basic cover for their property against the threat of natural disaster.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Public Petitions Committee, I welcome this debate on Professor David Crichton&#8217;s petition, in which he calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to represent Scottish interests in the current discussions between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the United Kingdom insurance industry.

Those 582 workers were profoundly disadvantaged, and not because they were underperforming in their jobs or failing to meet the industry standards expected of them. Their employment was terminated due to their membership of a trade union, for holding political views not shared by their employers, or for raising real concerns about health and safety practices. They were illegally penalised for that in a manner that reflects neither the society in which we live nor the way that we believe that business should be conducted in Scotland.</p><p>The revelations are shocking.

Five years earlier at Orgreave, 8,000 picketing miners and 4,500 police clashed at a British Steel plant.

However, I also know, through my work experience in the voluntary sector and with statutory organisations that work with young people, that it can be much better.</p><p>It is a tragic reality that 22,000 children grow up in poverty in Scotland and that these children are likely to have significantly reduced life expectancies, poorer qualifications and poorer health compared with their peers. The impact of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms will not help the situation of struggling families in Scotland; instead, it will compound the disadvantage and inequality that already exists. That is why it is so important that this Scottish Government does all that it can to tackle child poverty.</p><p>I welcomed this Government&#8217;s commitment to provide 600 hours of free nursery education to children in Scotland every year, but I am concerned that that has still not been delivered.

According to Save the Children, children brought up in poverty are three times more likely to suffer mental health issues and children from deprived areas are twice as likely as their peers to be unemployed after they leave school.</p><p>Poverty is clearly the biggest issue that our children can face and it falls upon us to tackle its root causes.

The Finance Committee&#8217;s report on the issue highlights some key issues and concerns with regard to the implications of such change for the public finances. Since the 2001 census, Scotland&#8217;s population has increased by 5 per cent to 5,295,000&#8212;its highest ever. The population has also become older. The National Records of Scotland&#8217;s projections indicate that although the working-age population is set to increase by 7 per cent between 2010 and 2035, the number of those of pensionable age will increase by 26 per cent over the same period.</p><p>Healthy life expectancy is at the core of much of the discussion about the demand for local services from an ageing population. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has shown the importance of healthy life expectancy by stating that</p><p>&#8220;age alone is not a sufficient indicator of likely need or demand for services.&#8221;</p><p>In addition, it highlights the</p><p>&#8220;profound impacts on health needs and people living in deprived areas&#8221;</p><p>that disadvantage and poverty can have.</p><p>One of the key recommendations in Audit Scotland&#8217;s report on health inequalities is that national indicators specifically to monitor progress in reducing health inequalities should be introduced. In its projections on the impacts of demographic change on adult health and social care expenditure, the Association of Directors of Social Work has highlighted the importance of planning and reliable data on healthy life expectancy by showing that the difference between the best and worst-case scenarios will be more than &#163;1&#160;billion by 2030. It is of deep concern not only that Scotland has one of the lowest life expectancies in western Europe, but that the gap between healthy life expectancy and life expectancy for men has been widening.</p><p>With regard to the plans that different levels of Government have in place to tackle the impact of demographic change, COSLA has revealed that the gap between the demand for services and the available resources will rise to almost &#163;3&#160;billion by 2016-17. While half of that can be attributed to the amount of available funding, the other half, more alarmingly, can be attributed to the rising demand for services that is driven in large part by demographics and the rising number of older people who will need services. While long-term strategies to combat that problem may be successful, the Christie commission pointed out that there is a serious short to long-term problem of income and demand.</p><p>An ageing society will also impact on health and social care. NHS Ayrshire and Arran has highlighted the fact that funding has not increased in line with demographic change, leading to the eligibility criteria for social care becoming tighter and tighter. More and more needs to be done to increase resilience at community level, so that we avoid unnecessary hospitalisation and speed up the return home from hospital.</p><p>The report highlighted the need for a shift towards preventative spending, including through the integration of health and social services. It is worrying that Audit Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;in reality services have been slow to adapt and we have found it hard to see evidence of meaningful shifts in the way resources are used over time&#8221;.</p><p>Demographic change and an ageing population will create big pressures on housing stock. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has pointed out that our society is more marked by solo living, which reflects relationship breakdown and emerging social trends. More and more people will live alone in their old age, which has implications for the supply of housing stock. The Government published a national strategy for housing for Scotland&#8217;s older people, which sets out a national framework for the delivery of housing stock that is suitable for older people, but concern has been expressed about how effective the strategy is likely to be.</p><p>The Finance Committee highlighted the key challenges for Scotland that are presented by our ageing population and other demographic changes. The Scottish Government must make the decisions that are necessary if we are to safeguard high-quality public services for future generations to enjoy. I look forward to the Scottish Government&#8217;s formal response to the report, which I am sure will give examples of good practice and talk about how they are shared throughout Scotland through strong leadership.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I congratulate the members of the Finance Committee and their support team on their informative report and thank them for it.

I agree fully with his views that fathers play an important role in the upbringing of their children, and that the rights and responsibilities of fathers should not be underestimated. I acknowledge that the national parenting strategy seeks to pursue more father-friendly services and policies, so that dads play an active role in the lives of their children and benefit from the same support services traditionally available only to mothers.</p><p>I caution against any implication that families without fathers are deficient or lack the necessary support structures to raise children in a safe and loving environment. Many children and young people have been brought up in single-parent families, and the absence of a father does not necessarily lead to less well-adjusted, healthy or successful young people as a result. Good parenting is about the commitment of the parent, or parents, to securing the welfare of their children, and it is enhanced by access to well-funded support structures that enable mothers and fathers to provide financially for their families.</p><p>An increasing number of young people are raised by same-sex parents. Those families are no less successful in providing the same stable and loving environment for their children than households with married heterosexual parents. Families come in all shapes and sizes. Every parent&#8212;and not just fathers&#8212;deserves the full support of the Government and local authorities in raising healthy and happy children.</p><p>I often talk about Parent Network Scotland when I speak in a debate on parenting. That voluntary organisation, which is based in Glasgow, provides training courses and support to parents in a non-judgmental and safe environment. All its programmes, which are evidence based, home grown and bottom-up led, have been evaluated by the University of Strathclyde.</p><p>I have seen at first hand the positive effect that Parent Network Scotland&#8217;s service can have on families and the increased confidence that parents enjoy as a result of the support that its staff offer.

I believe that it is an outstanding network, because it is about parent power&#8212;it is about parents empowering and supporting other parents in their community.

Although that may be an unavoidable reality for local authorities across Scotland, pursuing reform on the basis of cost savings alone is not a route to the delivery of high-quality services and will only lead to compromised decision making that fails to put communities and service users at the heart of the process.</p><p>Community involvement in the delivery of communities&#8217; own public services is vital, and I believe that it represents a co-operative model of decision making that should be replicated across Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities.

That approach will lead to a better informed model of decision making that has the priorities of service users at its heart.</p><p>Community planning partnerships can prove to be an invaluable resource for local authorities in the development of public services and they often highlight the key challenges that are likely to be faced in periods of restructuring and re-evaluation of working practices.

It is crucial that we open up the policy-making process to include a broader representation of our communities&#8212;particularly those that rely on services.</p><p>Of course, reform to achieve savings and reform to increase the quality of service are not always mutually exclusive. Evidence gathered from a number of local authorities, including North Lanarkshire Council and Orkney Islands Council, cites the emerging emphasis on partnership and shared working practices. In many cases, partnership working enables local authorities to provide services more efficiently while increasing collaboration and the avoidance of duplication.

I know that my colleague has a wealth of experience in advocating on road safety issues and is well placed to illustrate the key issues that surround the important proposal.</p><p>The UK Government has welcomed the proposition to increase the speed limit for HGVs on single carriageways from 40mph to 50mph, and the proposition is the subject of a Government consultation document at Westminster. It has also gained the approval of the Automobile Association and the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which has welcomed it as a &#8220;common sense move&#8221; that would be welcomed by all drivers, not only HGV drivers. However, other groups have expressed concerns about the proposal.</p><p>The consultation document highlighted some of the advantages that such a move could bring. One such advantage would be the reduction of congestion and frustration on our roads, as members have already said. A common problem on many long-distance rural roads is the large number of cars that can potentially drive faster but are often stuck behind HGVs that stick to the speed limit. That leads to frustration for drivers, who often attempt extremely dangerous overtaking manoeuvres, which can often lead to fatalities. It has been argued that the proposals will mean that those platoons of traffic will be less likely to attempt such manoeuvres, which will, in turn, lead to fewer accidents.</p><p>In addition, it is believed that the proposals will lead to a more level playing field for freight operators. Government figures suggest that 70 per cent of UK lorry traffic exceeds the current speed limit. In such a time-sensitive industry, that gives the drivers concerned an unfair advantage over those who follow the law.</p><p>The proposal, which would affect around 280,000 vehicles, would also have obvious economic benefits. For example, it is estimated that companies would save up to 2.4 million driving hours per year and between &#163;31 million and &#163;36 million, making them more profitable, allowing them to take on more workers, increasing tax revenues and providing a much-needed boost to related industries such as fuel and tyre suppliers.</p><p>That said, we must acknowledge the proposal&#8217;s potential disadvantages. Increased wear and tear on the road network would mean increased repair costs for local authorities, and there is also a potential for more serious accidents. The road safety charity Brake has expressed concern, citing the direct link between traffic speed and the number of devastating crashes and casualties on our roads.</p><p>It is of utmost importance that, in considering this proposal, we carefully consider and reflect on the evidence of all its effects on road safety, the environment and the economy before we make any decision.

As a result, it is in the interests of public authorities to have the power to intervene and to offer remedies in cases in which disputes between neighbours cannot be resolved through independent negotiation.</p><p>However, we must ensure that the provisions that are contained within the High Hedges (Scotland) Bill are fit for purpose and can deliver the outcomes that organisations such as Scothedge have been campaigning for.

The Scottish Government should reflect on the application of the 2003 act and perhaps seek to amend the bill provisions to make the legislation as effective and comprehensive as possible.</p><p>We must acknowledge that high hedges that result in neighbour disputes are a real and serious problem that too many Scottish families face. High hedges do not just act as a barrier to light; they can restrict views, lower property values, obstruct boiler flues and block television cables. It is right that the Scottish Government is taking positive action to tackle those problems, but in order to achieve that, the legislation must fully address the complex and difficult nature of the issue.</p><p>We know that a number of campaigners are already concerned that the definition of &#8220;high hedges&#8221; is too narrow and I anticipate the bill as it currently stands being satisfactory in only a proportion of problem cases, failing to improve the situation of many who are affected by these issues.

They now represent a significant presence on our high streets in towns and cities throughout Scotland. It is easy to understand the temptation of a cash advance on a monthly wage, particularly for those in low-paid employment, with household bills that consume the majority of their earnings. However, the interest rates on payday loans are nothing short of exploitative, with a loan of &#163;300 over a period of 30 days costing around &#163;100 in interest and fees alone.</p><p>Payday loans do not offer Scottish families a sustainable solution to what are often very serious financial problems, and more needs to be done to offer viable alternatives to such questionable business practices. Families who need access to affordable credit within a short timeframe have limited options, and they are often unaware of the provisions that are made by local authorities, organisations and charities in their communities, which are specifically designed to offer support to people in those circumstances.</p><p>I believe that credit unions hold the answer. As a Glasgow MSP who is active in the cross-party group on credit unions, I am delighted that one in five Glaswegians is a member of a credit union. In my region of Glasgow, Drumchapel Community Credit Union provides short-term loans to more than 3,000 registered customers in the local area, with an APR of between 15 and 26 per cent. Drumchapel Community Credit Union was the very first to be established in Scotland. For more than 40 years, it has provided families in Drumchapel with affordable credit to meet unexpected financial demands, such as the huge rise in the cost of energy for households over the past few years. Customers are encouraged by the team of staff and volunteers to repay loans over a longer period in order to spread the burden, and to develop a financial plan that details how their monthly income meets expected outgoings, so as to ensure that short-term loans do not need to be relied on as a source of income in the future. I call on the Scottish Government to support an increase in investment in Scottish credit unions so that they can offer products equivalent to payday loans on a fair and affordable rate of interest.</p><p>It is clear that the standard of living for Scottish families has been squeezed considerably. I understand the increased financial pressure that thousands of Scots endure as a result of low wages and high unemployment, and it is vital that the Scottish Government and local authorities recognise and support the invaluable work of local organisations such as credit unions and the key role that they play in tackling disadvantage and poverty throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683026", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cost of Living (Payday Loans)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I begin, I declare an interest, in that I am a member of Scotwest Credit Union, Glasgow Credit Union and the cross-party group on credit unions.

I accept that rapidly increasing energy costs have had a significant impact on the achievability of the target. However, the Government has yet to show how it intends to abolish fuel poverty, given that fuel poverty rose last year and the situation shows no sign of improving in the immediate future.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s decision to slash a budget that was specifically intended to address fuel poverty in Scotland has meant that thousands of the most vulnerable people in our communities are unable to heat their homes throughout winter. The Government chose to reduce the financial allocation for fuel poverty initiatives by more than &#163;14 million last year. That had a direct impact on, for example, citizens advice bureaux, which have been inundated with requests for assistance with rising energy costs, mostly from young single women who live in rented housing.</p><p>The Government needs to deliver on the promises that it makes to the people of Scotland. It should come clean on why it chose to diminish the support that is offered to individuals who, tragically, are all too often forced to make a choice between heating and eating. The resources that are provided to the vulnerable people in our communities who suffer fuel poverty should come in a variety of forms, including advice on how to save money on their energy bills throughout the year.</p><p>A few months ago, I arranged an event to bring together a number of energy advice services and communities in Glasgow. The event was arranged with the Glasgow home energy advice team&#8212;G-HEAT&#8212;which was established to provide independent advice on energy-related issues to home owners and tenants, with the aim of reducing consumption and costs.</p><p>Such positive action is necessary in the campaign against fuel poverty and empowers people to take action against the multinational energy companies that have exploited our communities for too long. However, such an approach will be effective only with continuing and genuine support from the Government, which has yet to explain its decision to cut the fund that was intended to tackle the growing and serious issue of fuel poverty.</p><p>I hope that we can achieve the target to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016, but it is increasingly clear that the action that is required if we are to do so has not yet been taken.

That anti-cyber-bullying business has been so successful that it has won an award for its workshops. I believe that that example shows that the issue must be tackled by adults and children working together.

For example, the Scottish Coal Industry Special Welfare Fund is an independent charity that provides financial assistance to vulnerable people who have connections to the mining industry. The scheme awards grants to former miners or their family members in times of hardship, and it dispenses funds that are reserved for community groups that provide services to those who have mining connections or associations with the coal industry. That is just one example of the many schemes that were established to support Scotland&#8217;s coal industry, and it serves to illustrate the importance that the mining industry continues to command within villages, towns and cities across Scotland.</p><p>It is clear that Scotland&#8217;s coal industry deserves continued support and recognition from the Scottish Government, given its relevance and value to our nation in a number of different ways.

It is the only such service in Scotland that operates 24-7 and it currently provides crucial support to more than 40 families every year. That resource, with the support of volunteers and community activists, provides women and children with a safe place in which to secure long-term accommodation, receive medical treatment, and build better lives away from abusive partners and destructive relationships.</p><p>Every woman in Scotland should have access to the standard of services and the quality of resources that are provided by Women&#8217;s Aid in Drumchapel, and after 20 years of zero tolerance campaigning it is not acceptable for abuse victims to be subject to a postcode lottery of crisis services that are dependent only on the resourcing of domestic abuse services in their area.</p><p>The work of the domestic abuse court in Glasgow has also improved the circumstances of many women who are in the process of exiting abusive relationships by speeding up the process of bringing justice to the perpetrators of abuse. The specialised process results in a conviction rate of about 85 per cent, compared to only 50 per cent for cases that are dealt with through the ordinary procedure of the sheriff court. That is due in part to the work of the ASSIST&#8212;advocacy, support, safety, information services together&#8212;project, which works with abused women across Scotland to ensure that they are informed and supported through the criminal justice process.

At that time, organisers had begun advertising for thousands of volunteers to assist during the games, in a variety of roles. More than 40,000 people from all over the United Kingdom registered an interest in taking part in that way. Throughout Glasgow and further afield there is huge enthusiasm for becoming a 2014 volunteer and part of the legacy of Glasgow&#8217;s Commonwealth games.</p><p>If we further promote the opportunities that the games bring to Scotland, we can ensure not just that we have more volunteers to staff our venues and arenas but that there is a far greater impact on families throughout the country, because so many people will have a son, daughter, friend or cousin who took part in the summer of 2014. Such awareness brings clear benefits to Scotland.

I know that, in my region of Glasgow, a huge number of individuals have a family history that extends far beyond the boundaries of Scotland or even the UK, and they are proud of their truly international roots.</p><p>Historically, Glasgow has been home to many Irish immigrants, who sought refuge in times of hardship at home and have regarded Glasgow, along with many other parts of our nation, as their home ever since. Today we can draw parallels between Irish immigration in previous generations and the more recent arrival of those from eastern Europe, from nations such as Poland, who have already made a profound and lasting impact on Scottish culture and identity.</p><p>Scottish people are no strangers to welcoming those from other parts of the world to our country.

Glasgow regularly hosts national and international conferences and has gained a strong reputation as a city that means business. As I am sure that all members will be aware, Glasgow has secured the position of number 1 destination for business tourism in the UK outside London. That is due in no small part to the council&#8217;s support for the tourism sector in Glasgow and the vision and foresight of the Labour administration in attracting and sustaining investment.</p><p>In particular, our hospitality sector has enjoyed expansion as a result of a high level of support from the council. New hotels and guest houses have been well supported in attracting business and leisure tourists to Scotland&#8217;s largest city. Those new businesses have been instrumental in delivering new jobs for Glasgow&#8217;s young people and have proved to be resilient in an otherwise struggling economic reality.</p><p>Glasgow benefits hugely from the business tourism sector in Scotland, but we know that other major cities such as Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen can attribute a significant proportion of inward investment to the facilitation of conferences, international meetings, conventions and exhibitions. Part of the reason for that is the broad range of facilities that our major Scottish cities can offer business tourists, in the form of conference centres, well-equipped meeting spaces, theatres and galleries.</p><p>Equally, international visitors require a well-developed transport network that links city centres, train stations, business centres and airports efficiently and without unnecessary delays, and which does not result in them incurring unnecessary costs. That is why l believe that investment in transport infrastructure is the key factor in achieving further growth in the important business tourism sector and must be a central focus of efforts to sustain the current benefit to Scotland of more than &#163;809 million annually.

I am proud of the changes that were made by the Labour administration in Glasgow City Council, which was the first local authority to introduce the living wage of &#163;7.20 per hour&#8212;to be increased to &#163;7.50 per hour&#8212;for its lowest-paid employees. That wage increase directly affected 5,000 families and more than 160 businesses in the local area. The impact of that salary increase for households on basic incomes will be immeasurable. Too many families are suffering from in-work poverty; increasing basic wages to about &#163;7.20 per hour can be the difference between meeting the monthly bills and putting food on the table, and falling deeper and deeper into debt.</p><p>Despite that reality, there are some people who still argue that now is not the time to introduce this change in the basic wages of our lowest-paid staff. They argue that the economy is too fragile and too weak to sustain the added pressure on the public purse, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that low wages for workers mean that families have less to spend, and that lower spending too often results in slow growth in the economy. Therefore, I believe that the living wage is a compelling proposition, not just because of the social benefits or because of the impact that it has on the families who are the hardest hit by the recession, but because it makes economic sense. It is right to support our most vulnerable working people through these tough economic times and it is right that we boost our economy by ensuring that our wealth is in the hands of the many&#8212;not of the few.</p><p>Members have already mentioned that the living wage (Scotland) bill that has been proposed by my colleague John Park MSP would be an important step forward in extending the living wage beyond the boundaries of local government and the public sector. It would also serve to change the destructive culture among some businesses of paying staff as little as possible in order to maximise profit.</p><p>Alongside other key measures, the living wage has already provided working families in Scotland with financial security in difficult times, and it will continue to do so.

I am sure that people on all sides of the debate would agree that positive actions need to be taken urgently to address that situation. At this time, more than 600 Scottish people are on the waiting list for a transplant operation, and on average three people die each day as a result of no suitable organs being available in time.</p><p>The campaign to raise awareness of the issue by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Evening Times has highlighted some of the key issues that need to be fully considered in the course of the debate, principally whether an opt-out system would result in a greater number of organs being made available for transplant and how many lives would subsequently be saved.</p><p>As we heard in earlier speeches, about 40 per cent of people in Scotland have signed up to the organ donation register. That compares favourably with a number of international examples of opt-in systems that are similar to the UK model of the organ donation register. However, international examples of opt-out systems show that organ donations tend to be between 25 and 30 per cent higher under such systems, compared with systems in which individuals have to register to donate. That trend has been consistent, and it illustrates that the adoption of a new system in Scotland could play a vital role in saving lives.</p><p>Recent studies of public support for organ donation have found the intention to register to be as high as 90 per cent while actual registration is as low as 25 per cent in some parts of the UK. That is strong evidence that an opt-in system could increase access for those who are unaware of the current process and encourage greater awareness of the impact that organ donation can have. I believe that many more Scots than are currently on the organ donor list would be in favour of registering. They might have not registered only as a result of a lack of information or the time constraints that are involved in their leading busy and active lives. The comparatively high percentage who have already registered as donors suggests that our population is receptive to the idea of organ donation and that many more would be comfortable with being added to the list of potential donors in the future.</p><p>Although I support the adoption of an opt-out process and believe that the benefits of such a system would outweigh the administrative challenges of its operation, it would have to be accompanied by high-quality and readily available information on how to opt out. It would be unacceptable to have large numbers of people registered as donors who would be unhappy with that arrangement, and it would be unacceptable to cause unnecessary distress to families after the death of a loved one. That is why the process of opting out should be made simple and patients should routinely be asked for their continued consent at all available opportunities.</p><p>It is clear that we have a crisis in organ donation in Scotland and tough decisions have to be made to rectify that devastating reality. An opt-out system would act as a prompt for those who are in favour of registering to have the process completed for them, and many lives would undoubtedly be saved as a result.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675729", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Organ Donation (Presumed Consent)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Kenny Gibson for securing the debate.

Not one Labour amendment has been accepted during the process.</p><p>With more than 100,000 empty properties in Scotland, I recognise that there is a serious issue and that the regeneration of these buildings must be a priority. High streets and city centres are too often blighted by derelict buildings, unoccupied properties and abandoned offices. That must be addressed, and I encourage the Scottish Government to invest in our town and city centres in order to tackle that growing problem.</p><p>However, a principal aim of the bill is to encourage economic growth and allow our local communities and small businesses to develop. How can that be achieved when councils across Scotland are telling the Scottish Government that they will have to demolish buildings in order to survive the economic implications of this ill-considered bill?</p><p>In such a challenging economic environment, the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals fail to take into account the many public bodies that will have either to sell off or to pull down buildings simply to maintain current budgets. The proposals also fail to consider the negative impact that the measures will have on future planning processes, where buildings have been designated for long-term reallocations. Local authorities, health bodies and other public bodies are deeply concerned by the uncertainty and unnecessary challenges that the measures contained within the bill will bring.</p><p>Despite that, the Scottish Government continues to claim that the bill will have a positive impact on our fragile economy and somehow encourage growth in our town and city centres. The bizarre belief that charging small businesses and public bodies more for disused buildings will result in fewer unoccupied properties is both misinformed and unfounded. The assertion that the measures will generate much-needed funds for the public purse is shamefully short-sighted, given that the Scottish Property Federation has estimated that around 20 per cent of the additional revenue generated by the bill will come directly from public bodies.</p><p>The Scottish Government has consistently sidelined the concerns of public bodies, small business owners and town planners.

Slow and inefficient responses from the Scottish Government to severe weather lead not just to frustration and delay for commuters but to potential isolation and loneliness for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities.</p><p>For too many people, winter means taking difficult decisions about household incomes. It is unacceptable that any of my constituents should be forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table but, tragically, that will be a daily reality for an increasing number of families.</p><p>If the Scottish Government fails to respond swiftly and effectively to failures in our transport network, we risk damaging any fragile economic recovery that our small businesses, employers and employees and their families across Scotland are counting on. The challenges for employers are great enough without the added financial pressure of vehicles that cannot be used, employees who cannot attend work and suppliers that cannot deliver. That is why the debate concerns much more than cancelled trains and delayed journeys. Scotland needs a Government that recognises the huge range of issues that directly impact families over the winter months and a Government that adopts a proactive approach to supporting communities in that difficult period.</p><p>A key issue for many of my constituents in Glasgow is the increasingly high cost of energy bills at a time when many household incomes are overstretched. Many older people who are isolated and have low incomes are being exploited by the pricing structures of the big six energy companies that operate in the UK. Customers who remain with one company for long periods are being substantially overcharged for energy supplies in comparison with new customers who have moved from a competitor. Too often, vulnerable and older people suffer the most from that disgraceful business practice, as they are the least likely to have access to the information and support to make informed choices about their energy supply and costs.</p><p>I commend the action of many of my colleagues in the Labour Party in working to promote the switch together initiative, which is helping many overstretched families and vulnerable people in our communities. In Dundee, our Labour MSP Jenny Marra is championing a collective approach to rising energy costs, to drive down prices by negotiating tariffs on behalf of thousands of ordinary customers and achieve far more competitive pricing as a result. We in the Labour Party believe that</p><p>&#8220;by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone&#8221;,</p><p>and that opportunity allows ordinary people to have the kind of bargaining power that could make a real difference to household budgets over the difficult winter months.</p><p>It is time for the Scottish Government to learn a lesson from the Scottish Labour Party and work with us to deliver innovative and dynamic solutions to the tough realities of supporting Scotland in the current challenging economic circumstances.</p><p>My constituents in Glasgow deserve a consistent and effective response to severe winter weather and its effects on transport links and infrastructure. More fundamentally, they deserve a Scottish Government that fully addresses the wide range of issues that affect families and vulnerable people who live alone during the winter. I will continue to campaign for those who suffer from fuel poverty, who have to make the tragic choice on a daily basis between heating and eating.</p><p>Finally, I encourage the Scottish Government to invest in and work with organisations such as Energy Action Scotland in order to support families and individuals with ever-shrinking household incomes to make smart choices about their energy supplies. Citizens Advice Scotland, which was mentioned earlier, is working with Scottish communities to provide useful and impartial advice on energy consumption and on how to find the best deals. In the past year alone, CAS has noted a rise in the number of people who struggle to make their payments during the winter. That is simply not good enough.</p><p>The Scottish Government should support the Scottish people in their struggles during the winter instead of cutting local government budgets, which are already so overstretched. It is only through the full and unqualified resourcing of voluntary organisations and community groups that we can minimise the effects of severe winter weather alongside our unfortunate economic reality.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to speak on the important subject of winter resilience and to have the opportunity to represent the many concerns of my constituents in Glasgow.

That local group gives boys and young men from the ages of eight to 25 with physical disabilities the chance to take part in outdoor adventure activities and international excursions. The vital work that the group carries out is undertaken by volunteers. The organisation employs no paid full-time or part-time staff members. One of the local volunteers there is Michael Shanks, who does an excellent job with the group. The group has no statutory funding. All its funds are raised from voluntary donations, without which the association would not exist.</p><p>Given the vital role that volunteers play in the lives of young people in Scotland, it is right that such work should be fully and sustainably funded and that volunteers should never go unrecognised or be out of pocket as a result of contributing their time and energy to our communities.</p><p>With the curriculum for excellence being implemented in Scottish schools, we must ensure that our children&#8217;s education is of as high a quality outside the core academic curriculum as it is within it. Part of that is supporting organisations such as the Scout Association to equip their members with the practical skills and confidence to create the community champions of tomorrow. Without proper investment in the voluntary sector and others who support extra-curricular development, the four capabilities&#8212;competent individuals, successful learners, responsible citizens and effective contributors&#8212;remain ambitious phrases with little relation to what is delivered.</p><p>The current financial crisis all too often restricts opportunities for young people, but volunteers and local charities are stepping up to offer training and support in our communities, build the skills of local people and champion our economic recovery.

Therefore, it is vital that we all continue to do what we can to prevent history from repeating itself.</p><p>Let us take a couple of modern examples.

It is our responsibility to identify and target children before neglect becomes an aspect of their lives.</p><p>Although the results of the improving parenting, improving practice programme are pertinent to today&#8217;s debate, it is only right to note the other projects and trials that the NSPCC is undertaking in Scotland. For example, the introduction in Glasgow of the New Orleans intervention model, as a partnership between the NSPCC, Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, has been a particular success. The model, unsurprisingly, was developed in New Orleans as a mechanism that allows professionals to assess whether children should be reunited with their birth family or placed for adoption. When the model was used in the United States, the results were startling. Children who were assessed using the model were less likely to suffer abuse or neglect when they were returned to their birth family and, conversely, more likely to settle in well with a new family.</p><p>The seven-year follow-up of the 80 children who were exposed to the New Orleans intervention showed that, on virtually all mental health measures, the graduates of the intervention were similar to the general population. The hope is that the model could inform child protection decisions throughout Scotland, and I urge the minister to look at the findings from Glasgow.</p><p>I am sure that we all agree that preventative measures and intervention at an early age are the key to success. Even before a child is born, its life chances are affected by its mother&#8217;s situation. Early intervention must start from the womb and not just from the cradle.</p><p>The Scottish Government has taken positive steps. The introduction of the early years framework and of getting it right for every child means that we are now catching more cases of child neglect than ever before. However, as we know, Government strategy alone is not enough to combat the problem; we also need projects at the grass roots to support families.</p><p>For example, Parent Network Scotland has had particular success in Glasgow and throughout Scotland&#8212;even as far as Shetland, I am led to believe. The organisation&#8217;s director is Jackie Tolland, whom I met recently and who is another former colleague of mine. The network runs support courses for struggling parents on parenting matters and to give an introduction to curriculum for excellence. The courses are flexible and are delivered in a targeted way to help parents to support one another in a school environment, while taking into account the needs of children, parents and schools.</p><p>Such courses allow people to learn necessary parenting skills from their peers, without the prospect of feeling ostracised. I congratulate Parent Network Scotland on its considered approach and I urge the minister to observe the work that it undertakes.</p><p>The issue is too important for members to make party-political points. We have made great strides in recent years, but we must do more. We must all work together to ensure that child neglect is eradicated from Scottish society.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and I thank my colleague Hugh Henry for bringing the issue of child cruelty and neglect to the Parliament&#8217;s attention.

There are far too many betting shops in Glasgow and it is clear to me that betting shops are indeed preying on the vulnerable in our society. I am seriously concerned about the number of betting shops that exist and their locations near pubs and ATMs. They are luring new customers, particularly young people, off our high streets and through their doors.</p><p>Although I acknowledge that the majority of those who choose to gamble do so responsibly, gambling addiction is a problem, albeit one that is not often discussed. I commend the excellent work that organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous and the RCA Trust do in working with those who are affected by gambling addiction. I am pleased that a question on gambling was included in the latest Scottish health survey and I look forward to seeing the findings when the report is published later this year.</p><p>A number of issues need to be raised regarding betting shops, including the safety of their staff. Changes in working practices have meant that lone staffing is now commonplace. Worryingly, workers can be left to work alone in betting shops for hours at a time, often early in the morning or late at night. More than 55 per cent of betting shop workers are women, so there are concerns about how appropriate lone working is for betting shops, particularly as stores that are staffed by one person are more vulnerable to attack. No one should feel frightened to go to their place of work.</p><p>In 2008, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and Community, the only union that represents betting workers in all the major and independent betting shop chains in Scotland, launched a fantastic poster campaign that was geared towards eliminating violence against betting shop workers and which was highlighted in a motion lodged by my colleague John Park. The campaign achieved cross-party support and did an excellent job in raising awareness of what betting shop staff are subjected to every day.</p><p>Community members&#8217; experience suggests a direct link between increasing levels of violence and abuse in betting shops and the proliferation of FOBTs, which make up a rapidly increasing share of the profits generated by high-street bookmakers. Although official police figures suggest that violence and criminal damage in betting shops are falling, that does not reflect the daily experience of Community members and I want to share with the chamber two concerns that the union has raised.</p><p>First, Community believes that police authorities are neither gathering data effectively nor recognising that betting shops form a particular usage group that ought to be monitored more closely. Secondly, we know that some major betting shop operators are systematically discouraging the reporting of incidents involving FOBT machines to the police. Two members from two of the major betting chains in Scotland have noted:</p><p>&#8220;Company don&#8217;t want police involved unless staff are hurt&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;Company policy not to involve police, apparently due to low conviction rate&#8221;.</p><p>Betting shop chains provide limited support for staff who have been victims of a violent robbery and many have to return to work after they are threatened with loss of sick pay. Many betting shop workers are subject to regular verbal and physical attacks. That is wholly unacceptable.</p><p>We must put more pressure on betting shops operating in Scotland to provide safe environments for their workers and I believe that ending lone working in such shops is a step in the right direction.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gambling Proliferation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak on the topic of gambling as I agree with John Mason in this instance.

In 2003, one of the Labour-led coalition&#8217;s flagship bills was the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, which, for the first time, gave communities the right to buy land in their areas. That legislation was much welcomed and went a long way in encouraging communities to buy into their own land. However, work is still needed to ensure that communities in urban areas&#8212;such as Glasgow, the area that I represent&#8212;are given the same opportunity to be enfranchised and are encouraged to find use for unused and derelict land and buildings.</p><p>Since the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was passed, local people have made more than 120 applications to buy out land in their areas. We should learn the lessons from rural areas and apply them to urban areas. Throughout Scotland, there are towns and cities that have been left out of community renewal and which are in desperate need of regeneration. Therefore, it is essential that, when the Government formulates and considers the bill, it makes urban areas and areas of deprivation a priority.</p><p>The Government must resist the urge to centralise and it must realise that local government is best placed to deliver the initiative. The bill should be about a localised, bottom-up approach to regeneration to allow local communities to grow and flourish. It must put in place a framework that will ensure that local people are able to access their communities. Localism must be at the heart of the bill, and the Government must find a way to work with local government to ensure that that goal is achievable.</p><p>Glasgow City Council has been putting localism and Labour values into action. That process has been led by Councillor Aileen Colleran. Only last week, the council&#8217;s stalled spaces programme won top prize for community involvement at the Scottish awards for quality in planning. That programme is a community project designed to target temporarily vacant or underused land and bring it back into use.</p><p>I was happy to lodge a motion in the Parliament last week congratulating the council on that achievement.

We were also told that the reform would help to clamp down on benefit fraudsters who take from the state what they are not entitled to. Yet, the same coalition Government has made no attempt to tackle the tax-evading companies that fail to pay billions of pounds that they owe. Protection of those companies at the expense of some of our most vulnerable groups leads me to believe that the UK Government protects the rich and lets the vulnerable pay dearly.</p><p>We often hear in the chamber that the Scottish Government wants more powers for Scotland. The act provides exactly that. Attention now must be on what will be done with those powers. A huge number of questions need to be asked not for partisan political reasons, but because of what is at stake for some of our most vulnerable people.</p><p>Members will be well aware that I am a proud supporter of the credit union movement. There is no doubt that credit unions will be at the front line in dealing with people as welfare reform kicks in. However, the impact and scale of the reform suggest that credit unions will be stretched to the extreme, with some possibly being unable to cope with the demands that will be placed on them by the financially excluded individuals and families who will be hardest hit by the welfare reforms. Some credit unions may not have the necessary range of products to deliver relevant services to those who are most affected by the reforms. The credit unions of Glasgow strategy group has been proactive in bringing 34 of the city&#8217;s credit unions together to co-operate and to try to ensure that they can offer the best possible services. However, in other parts of the country that is not happening. It is imperative that the vulnerable groups who turn to credit unions that may not be able to cope with the increased demand are not forced into the arms of legal loan sharks or backstreet lenders.</p><p>It is important that we protect our smaller ethical financial service providers from trying to do too much for too many. Therefore, I ask the cabinet secretary what assistance the Government will provide in research and development for appropriate financial products for the people who are set to take the brunt of the reform. I also ask how the Government aims to support provision of financial advice and how it is supporting front-line organisations to work together in developing actions to mitigate the impacts of welfare reform&#8212;specifically with regard to financial products for excluded families.</p><p>The bill seems to be based on a presumption that benefits will be paid into bank accounts. Therefore, what provision has been made to ensure that individuals have an appropriate bank account that will allow them to receive their benefits? Further questions also need to be addressed. Given that much of the access to the new system is expected to be online, are the individuals who are likely to be affected computer savvy or do we need to provide more computer courses? On computing, I have previously raised the fact that the Glasgow area has a poor rate of broadband take-up in low-income households, so there may also be issues about access to the internet for many of the people affected.</p><p>Another unanswered question, which I have heard from a number of third sector organisations, concerns the advice that is to be given to recipients. The reform means that benefits and tax credit recipients will be looking for comprehensive advice on all forms of benefits, which are currently all quite specialist areas. The changes suggest that individuals and organisations that give advice will have to increase the breadth of topics on which they provide advice. Again, it is important for them and Parliament to know how that will be orchestrated and what support will be given to ensure that it can be done.</p><p>We also need to know what the Scottish Government is doing to identify target groups, where they are located and which areas require particular types of support. Perhaps the Scottish Government&#8217;s Scottish neighbourhood statistics project could help with that. It is a great tool, which I hope the Government considers promoting.</p><p>As I said earlier, there are many unanswered questions that need to be addressed. For the sake of the individuals and families who are supported by benefits contributions, I hope that the Scottish Government listens to all parties who are concerned with providing the answers that are so desperately required.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667406", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Welfare Reform Act 2012 was described by the Prime Minister as a revolutionary piece of legislation that would make work pay and protect the vulnerable.

Young people and their parents have raised those queries on the doorstep over the past months.</p><p>Organisations such as Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland have called for a maximum waiting time for young people to get access to the opportunities for all programme. I whole-heartedly endorse that idea. To ensure that apprenticeships provide a positive destination for our young people, we must ensure that there is a clear and transparent mechanism for monitoring them. Much of the correspondence that I have had with Skills Development Scotland shows that it does not track the long-term progress of apprentices following the completion of their scheme. That must change if we are to be certain that the schemes are making the positive impact on young people&#8217;s lives that they deserve and which we expect.</p><p>It would be remiss of me to omit from my speech the concerns about further education that many of my constituents have brought to my attention. More and more young people are facing a catch-22 situation. With the daunting prospect of unemployment on the one hand and swingeing cuts to local colleges on the other, they are left unable to find a job or gain a place on a college course that will equip them with marketable skills. Now, more than ever, further education has a vital role to play in Scotland&#8217;s move towards economic growth, but the Scottish Government&#8217;s cuts to the sector suggest that that has not been recognised. I note for the record that, through Labour-led Glasgow City Council, 16 to 24-year-olds will have the Glasgow guarantee of training or work.</p><p>It is not just youth unemployment that is affecting Scotland. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s motion mentions many sectors that are performing well, but it does not mention the alarming rise in the rate of female unemployment in Scotland, which, like the youth unemployment rate, is higher than the UK average. As a working mother of three children, I know just how difficult it is for people to ensure that their children are looked after while they are at work. The childcare factor plays a large part in many women&#8217;s lives as they look to get back into work. The Labour Party in Glasgow has already pledged to guarantee every child in the city 15 hours of childcare from the age of three&#8212;a move that could be worth up to &#163;1,500 for every child. I have spoken to a number of parents who are both relieved and excited by that prospect, which they feel will make a big difference to their ability to secure and maintain employment.</p><p>I am pleased that Glasgow will continue to roll out employability programmes that train early years staff to help parents back into work. I urge the Government to endorse that approach and to encourage its take-up across the country.</p><p>As we look to rebuild and to encourage growth, it is imperative that we base our efforts on ethical and co-operative foundations. Many parts of the social economy and many social enterprises are growing year on year. Members will be aware that 2012 is the international year of the co-operative movement, and we should be striving to expand the co-operative model, particularly in the financial sector, where a drive to support and encourage credit union membership would be a huge boost to responsible banking.

It is crucial that we give further support to the various green initiatives that exist throughout the country and set our minds to conceiving new and innovative ways to turn Scotland into an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy.</p><p>In Glasgow, Labour is stepping up to that challenge. We will lead the implementation of the green deal to improve the energy efficiency of residents&#8217; homes. We have committed to develop a centre for green building skills, which will help local workers and the construction industry to make the transition to a low-carbon economy.

In Glasgow, where the Labour council was the first in Scotland to provide funded childcare for three-year-olds, work on that can already be seen. At the moment, children get 15 hours of such childcare a week, starting at the beginning of the term after their third birthday, and the city&#8217;s Labour council has pledged that, if&#8212;I mean, when&#8212;re-elected in May, it will expand provision to ensure a funded childcare place for every child at the start of the term in which they turn three.

We are moving closer to the changes in working tax credits, and I am sure that we will all have heard the concerns that were expressed this week by Save the Children about the effect of the changes on working parents. There is no doubt that, for those families, the already difficult task of securing quality childcare will be all the more challenging.

I hope that the report and today&#8217;s debate will further strengthen the Scottish Government&#8217;s support for the move towards greater implementation of the pay rate.</p><p>The campaigners for the living wage campaign have long championed the benefits for employees in the private and public sectors as well as the potential boost for the economy and combating poverty. In Glasgow, the local authority now has more than 160 recognised living-wage employers from the public and private sectors. By committing to the living wage, each of those employers has their details included on the dedicated website, www.glasgowlivingwage.co.uk. Those companies have a combined workforce of more than 50,000 people and, from 1 April this year, those people should earn a minimum of &#163;7.20 per hour.</p><p>Some might argue that encouraging the public sector to increase wages, even for the lowest-paid people, is not wise in the current climate, but as the committee report recognises, strong preventative spend benefits are associated with implementation of the living wage. That should be noted, particularly when preventative spending is being encouraged. There are knock-on effects for issues such as fuel poverty. I often hear about the need for greater support for low earners who are suffering from fuel poverty; the living wage can help to tackle that problem.</p><p>The link between gender and low pay can also be targeted through the living wage, which in turn can help to tackle child poverty. Figures from the Poverty Alliance Scotland suggest that two thirds of all low-paid workers are women, which increases the number of children who are living in poverty. The living wage has had support from Save the Children as being one tool that can lift families and children out of poverty.</p><p>As I said earlier, more than 160 public and private employers in Glasgow are now committed to the living wage for their employees, but none of those employers is in the hospitality industry. The Commonwealth games is coming to the city in 2014 which, it is hoped, will mean a boost for the hospitality economy in the city. We need therefore to ensure that that potential boost is reinvested in the people of Glasgow, especially those who are on low incomes. Also on the hospitality trade, during the games, we must make sure that sessional workers who are employed to accommodate an increase in demand are fairly rewarded. A living wage for what are likely to be young people, for the most part, is essential so that they can build up finances to support themselves when the work is removed.</p><p>It is fair to say that, if low-paid workers are paid a bit more, local economies will benefit from the increase in people&#8217;s incomes. Spending more in their local communities, and supporting jobs and growth, will clearly bring great benefits and the living wage can help to achieve that.</p><p>Although there are success stories across the country for the living wage, there are difficulties with rolling it out further, particularly through procurement processes. In Glasgow, the council asks bidders whether they pay their staff the living wage, but that cannot be a weighted factor at the moment.</p><p>Although local authorities such as Glasgow City Council have worked well and hard to increase the number of businesses in their areas that take seriously the responsibility to pay their employees at the living-wage rate, we need more support for greater implementation from the Government. The public sector, along with the trade unions and anti-poverty groups, has been at the forefront of the campaign for a living wage, and the Scottish Government must also become an advocate for changes to legislation, to support the growth of implementation. As the committee report notes, the experience of the London living wage has been that major international companies have signed up, and that needs to happen here, too.</p><p>I hope that any future procurement legislation proposals that are brought to the chamber will take note of those issues. It would be the perfect chance to put the living wage at the heart of employment in Scotland. I look forward to the day when everyone in Scotland can engage with a living wage.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662360", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest as an elected member of Glasgow City Council.

We must also make it clear that kinship carers are often unaware that they will have to take on that responsibility.

There is often a knock at the door in the evening and a plea from social work explaining that if the prospective carers do not take responsibility for the child or children, they will end up in care.

The usual result is of course that gran, granddad, aunt, uncle, friend or relative takes the children in.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Kinship Carers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by stating my appreciation for the role that kinship carers play in providing a safe and loving home for some of Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable children.

Adoption parents and foster carers have a process by which they make themselves available to bring children into their lives and their homes. Foster carers build up the experience of having to take in children at short notice, as well as building up the much-needed clothes and other essentials. The difference is that they can afford to build such stocks over time because foster carers generally receive more financial support than do kinship carers.</p><p>We must also acknowledge the impact on the health of kinship carers from the stress of having extra mouths to feed and bodies to clothe. One of the most important points to be made is that problems can arise because many carers might be unaware of the process that they need to go through to claim what they are currently entitled to.

I hope that it brings everyone good health and happiness.</p><p>I am glad to speak in the debate, which is in some senses about ensuring the health and happiness of looked-after children through their educational attainment. As a former care manager for children and families in Glasgow&#8217;s social work department, as a member of the Scottish Parliament, as a corporate parent with Glasgow City Council&#8212;as a Glasgow councillor&#8212;and of course as a mother of three children, providing education services that deliver for and meet the needs of all Scotland&#8217;s children is extremely important for me.</p><p>However, the reality is that in our country there are unacceptable levels of youth unemployment, which is expected to be higher among looked-after young people. When we look at the statistics for Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children, we see lower levels of educational attainment than the national average. The number of school exclusions, which can lead to a greater chance of unemployment for those young people once they leave school, is higher.</p><p>Moreover, as the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s inquiry has heard, there are serious concerns about the identification in schools of the individual support needs of looked-after children. The Scottish Government must take note of that concern, especially given that the number of support staff in schools decreased after the first three years that it was in power. However, we should address more than just the issue of support staff; lessons must be learned from Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education reports, which have suggested that schools are not even always aware of the relevant and specifically designed training materials for looked-after children.</p><p>There are positive examples of engagement that can be drawn upon. Other members have spoken about their areas and I will speak about mine. In Glasgow, specific initiatives such as CLASS&#8212;the community learning and support service&#8212;are making a difference to the lives of vulnerable young people. CLASS provides care and education for young people aged between 14 and 16 who have additional support needs arising from family circumstances and social and emotional factors.</p><p>The educational attainment of all Scotland&#8217;s young people is a vital issue, especially at a time when young people are often the recipients of a bad press&#8212;they are painted with the same brush when it comes to their contribution to civic life. It can be even worse for looked-after young people, who can feel demoralised by the stigma that is the result of a situation that is not of their making.</p><p>With public services under threat and the United Kingdom Government Welfare Reform Bill hitting vulnerable groups harder than others, we need to fight to protect the services that work for those groups. We also need to respond to their evolving needs, issues and aspirations in a more creative manner that nurtures the potential of all our young people and enables them to achieve their aspirations. Education and the principle of learning should be liberating rather than domesticating young people for their place in society.</p><p>If, as we so often hear, youth are our future, we must prioritise investment in their education for life and for employment.</p><p>If we are to improve the educational attainment of our looked-after children, reduce the number of exclusions that they experience and increase their attendance levels, we must involve them far more in the detail of the education and learning curriculum and ensure that the ethos of the learning environment nurtures a can-do attitude and a realisation of leadership qualities.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, additional services are available to looked-after young people in Glasgow. We have heard from other members about projects in their areas. A quality learning experience should not be dependent on a postcode lottery but should be funded, resourced and accessible to all young people.</p><p>Young people throughout Scotland&#8212;particularly those from disadvantaged groups&#8212;should all have the opportunity to seek further and higher education. I am aware of how important further education&#8212;in particular, community campuses&#8212;has been to disadvantaged young people in my community and throughout the country. The Scottish Government must protect local access to further education to provide much-needed facilities for disadvantaged young people to use.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s looked-after young people often face difficult circumstances and challenges through no fault of their own.

In the 21st century, there is still a glass ceiling in the workplace for many women&#8212;hitting women harder.

If, as appears to be the case, there is an increase in domestic violence in the wake of those games, we need a concerted effort to ensure that we are prepared to deal with the outcomes.</p><p>In order to target resources where they are most needed, the Scottish Government should commission independent research into the correlation between the 48-hour periods surrounding old firm matches and levels of domestic abuse. I am happy to see that Nil by Mouth is calling both for that measure as part of its 13-point plan and for the expertise of Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid and others to facilitate that mapping exercise, which could play a vital part in future preventative measures to tackle one area of violence against women.</p><p>It is essential that we substantially increase funding to deliver those plans as well as others, such as a groundbreaking advertising campaign aimed at changing wider public attitudes.

Today, I again join Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland in asking for a commitment from the Government to ensure that all Scotland&#8217;s young people are placed in the opportunities for all programme as quickly as possible.</p><p>That said, it is clear that the ever-increasing number of unemployed young people need more than just a guaranteed maximum waiting time to access the opportunities for all programme. We have already spent time in the chamber in this parliamentary session condemning the crisis of youth unemployment in Scotland. Unfortunately, every time we debate the issue, the number of young people who are affected appears to have risen. Action needs to be taken in a number of areas for our young people, and particularly our most vulnerable young people: in employment and apprenticeship opportunities; in education and training; and in tackling the inequalities that are prevalent in our society.

There are particular concerns for people from low-income households, only around 26 per cent of which have broadband access. The low level of broadband access means that young people are in danger of missing out on various opportunities. They have no chance of looking through different job-search sites and making online applications&#8212;that assumes that there are jobs to apply for. Broadband access also gives our young people the chance to search for education places and training. Quite simply, if a person does not have internet access, it is not a case of need not apply but a case of not able to apply.

Our young people, particularly those from our most disadvantaged communities, must have the resources to apply and prepare for those opportunities. However, those are the very communities that will suffer from the Government&#8217;s slashing of further education college budgets.

I also acknowledge the foster carers, kinship carers, adopting parents and all those who strive to provide a caring and supportive life for Scotland&#8217;s looked-after children.</p><p>All members will agree that, whether or not this debate is taking place during national adoption week, it is extremely important that we secure a safe and loving home for all children as soon as possible. Members often hear the phrase &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s future&#8221; used in debates, sometimes on education and sometimes on modern apprenticeships. Today&#8217;s debate is equally about supporting Scotland&#8217;s future. We must ensure that the most vulnerable children in our society have the same opportunities as any other child has to be part of that future. As we have heard today, there is a lot of evidence that delays and hold-ups in finding suitable homes for children can impact seriously on long-term outcomes.</p><p>Given that around 16,000 children and young people are in local authority care but only 218 were adopted last year, calls for greater outcomes for adoption services have been made by a number of organisations as well as by different levels of government. For example, Barnardo&#8217;s is concerned that there are not enough foster carers with specialist training and skills to support children with complex and demanding needs. We need the Government and local authorities to consider ways of recruiting and supporting many more such foster carers throughout Scotland. There is concern about the demand that is being placed on residential units throughout Scotland, as more and more looked-after children with complex needs come into units and more wait for places. Without more specialised foster carers, long-term placements for those children may be only an aspiration, not a reality. There is a danger that the children may spend their childhood in numerous placements and residential units. The Government and local authorities must therefore focus on ensuring that all looked-after children, especially those with the most challenges and needs, are given the opportunity to have a safe, loving and nurturing home.</p><p>Despite the low number of adoptions last year, we can at least see some positives. In Glasgow, we have seen progress, with the figures doubling last year after a concerted effort to encourage more people to come forward. Glasgow City Council is already taking further proactive approaches in tackling some of the factual inaccuracies that are associated with adoption, particularly in relation to eligibility criteria.</p><p>However, we cannot look solely at adoption as a way to improve the lives of our looked-after children. A number of children may not be being cared for although they still live at home, and those children may enter the care system. The damage to life chances that can come from living in an abusive household are well documented. In an attempt to support those children, Glasgow City Council and the local health board are working in partnership with the NSPCC to test the New Orleans intervention model. That early intervention method has had a positive effect on similarly vulnerable children in the United States. I am glad that the Scottish Government&#8217;s chief scientist office has provided funding for research into the pilot. Although it is aimed at building relationships between children and foster carers, it has potential benefits for other children in their interpersonal development, providing a steady platform on which to build the rest of their lives. The model also has potential benefits for children who are regarded as looked after but who remain at home.</p><p>No one would argue against all of Scotland&#8217;s young people being given the best support possible from all public services. Under the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposed bill on young people&#8217;s rights, ministers would have to have regard to children&#8217;s and young people&#8217;s rights and views in making policy. That is a step in the right direction. However, although I support the intention behind the proposals, children and young people may still lose out if the proposals are not extended to cover local authority and health board decision making. We must take a comprehensive approach to recognising children&#8217;s rights in the policy process. By doing so, we can begin to tackle many of the barriers that looked-after children face and help them and all other children to become part of Scotland&#8217;s future.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my support for Monday&#8217;s launch of national adoption week, which I am sure every member will support.

I am glad that the Government acknowledges in it that lessons had to be learned from last year.</p><p>Last year, we witnessed the appalling situations that we have heard about from the previous speakers. I agree with the review group&#8217;s assertion that disruption from severe winter weather is inevitable, but a standstill should not be. We cannot run the risk of families, commuters or ill people being stuck on a motorway worrying whether they have enough petrol to keep their car running in order to keep warm.</p><p>The report states that, in terms of snowfall and cold weather, the winter of 2009-10 was the most severe for 31 years and that December 2010 was the coldest December for over 100 years. All of that is fair to say, but it fails to recognise that our technology, machinery and forecasting ability were the best that they had ever been. In other words, the problem of the coldest December in a century was made worse by the mismanagement of resources.</p><p>The gridlock on our motorways not only left people of all ages isolated but left businesses out in the cold. According to the Freight Transport Association, a haulage vehicle&#8217;s running costs can reach &#163;400 a day, so the standstill was an unwelcome blow for smaller businesses, in particular. The weather struck the business community when our economy was taking a hit as a result of the Government in Westminster cutting too fast and too far, and the problem was compounded by the Government in Holyrood acting too slowly and too late.</p><p>We witnessed unnecessary problems not just on our roads but in our public transport services. Delays and cancellations as a result of bad weather are not unheard of&#8212;I am sure that every member can testify to that&#8212;but the cancellation of train services mid-journey, without replacement services or stand-by buses being organised, was not good enough.

We must also address another alarming issue. The number of Scottish households that are categorised as fuel poor has reached 900,000. The Scottish Government must act to protect vulnerable members of our community as winter approaches. If conditions are similar to those last year, the number of fuel-poor households will rise, as will, I fear, the number of deaths that are attributable to people having to choose between being cold and going hungry.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

The free home visit by GHA&#8217;s energy specialists allows tenants to be guided through the process of ensuring that their homes and lives are more energy efficient. It is not only through Glasgow Housing Association that support has been made available. The Glasgow home energy advice team&#8212;G.HEAT&#8212;offers Glasgow residents free and impartial advice on all aspects of energy use.</p><p>Both those services can help residents to save money on their fuel bills, as well as making their homes easier to heat.

I am sure that all members have personal experience of the hassle that can arise from trying to change suppliers. However, for many of our most vulnerable groups, the task of trying to rearrange utility provisions is far more daunting than we can ever imagine. That is where G.HEAT can make a difference to people&#8217;s lives. Its specially trained advisers can act on residents&#8217; behalf when dealing with the energy companies and arranging better deals. If the Scottish Government is serious about helping some of the 900,000 fuel-poor households, it needs to recognise and build on the positive work and engagement of the likes of GHA and G.HEAT.

I also welcome the members of the East Glasgow Parkinson&#8217;s support group to Parliament this evening along with some of my colleagues from Glasgow City Council.</p><p>There is widespread concern at Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board&#8217;s decision to close Lightburn hospital, as was demonstrated by the recent march and rally calling for the plans to be dropped.</p><p>As some members will be aware, the east end of Glasgow has some of the poorest health statistics in Scotland and the United Kingdom. We know that the rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer are extremely high and that life expectancy figures, particularly for men, are at an alarming level. We must therefore question why our local communities, which rely on the vital services that are provided at Lightburn hospital, will be cut off from them and will be given little or no alternative.</p><p>The lack of alternative for local people is why the Scottish Government must step up and keep Lightburn hospital open. Rates of car ownership are significantly lower in the east end than they are in Glasgow as a whole, which means that more people in the area rely on public transport. However, the bus services coming out of the east end are limited, particularly in Cranhill, from where there is no public transport after 7 o&#8217;clock. As local people will rely on public transport to get to alternative hospitals, they are left with no alternative. Even if someone meets the criteria and qualifies for patient transport, it finishes at half past 6 in the evening, leaving local people with no alternative. With no direct trains or buses to Stobhill hospital from the wider east end area, local people will again be left with no alternative.</p><p>Even if someone is able to get to a different hospital, there is no guarantee that it will be able to take the patients that Lightburn would have been able to take. Stobhill hospital has been selected as one of the hospitals that could shoulder the burden of the closure of the Lightburn hospital, but the acute bed space that would be required at Stobhill is not even in place, so where is the viable alternative for patients?</p><p>I heard today that a person from the east end of Glasgow has had to be hospitalised in Edinburgh, which means that he does not have the vital support of his family, who cannot afford to go there on a daily basis.</p><p>What all this means for local people is that there is no alternative to Lightburn hospital if it closes. That is why they have campaigned so strongly to keep it open and why the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy must listen to those calls and act to halt the hospital&#8217;s closure.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lightburn Hospital"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Paul Martin for securing the debate.

This debate on the Scottish Government&#8217;s economic strategy allows us to address some of those decisions, and it is important to use the opportunity to highlight any strengths or offer alternatives to any weaknesses in the strategy.</p><p>I am glad that the strategy details plans to provide our young people with employment opportunities. With the youth unemployment that exists, it has never been more important to deliver for our young people. That unemployment, coupled with the proposed changes in the Welfare Reform Bill, which will mean that 16 to 20-year-olds will lose their exemption from national insurance contributions when they receive the employment support allowance, could leave our young people in an extremely vulnerable position.</p><p>I am glad that the economic strategy plans for the delivery of 25,000 modern apprenticeships per year. The delivery of modern apprenticeships can provide excellent opportunities for our young people to enter the workplace with the skills that they need to succeed and to contribute to our communities. Ensuring that such a scheme truly delivers for those people is a must.</p><p>Members may be aware that, to enhance the modern apprenticeship schemes, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland is calling for a guaranteed maximum waiting time for young people to go on to an opportunity for all programme. I am happy to support that call. I want to raise the issue because it is not enough for young people to be told that the opportunities for all programme will be available to them&#8212;they must be able to plan and work towards entering it. A guaranteed maximum waiting time will indicate clearly that the programmes are being run with the purpose of ensuring that provision is available within a reasonable timescale. It is vital that our young people feel that they will enter a programme that will deliver for them. That is why the economic strategy needs to ensure that the programmes are clearly monitored and there are full reports back to the Parliament.</p><p>I am aware that, in response to previous freedom of information requests, Skills Development Scotland has indicated that it does not track the long-term progress of apprentices following the completion of their modern apprenticeships. That simply cannot be allowed to continue. I want the young people of Scotland to feel that they have a real and meaningful opportunity to gain the skills, experience and qualifications to go on and succeed in their endeavours. Without the monitoring of those programmes and the subsequent information being provided, how can we show that they provide the opportunities that they are designed to provide? Without that reassurance, I worry that our young people will not be able to engage fully with the programmes and receive the opportunities that they deserve.</p><p>It is also important that we are able to monitor the quality of the apprenticeships that are being delivered to our young people, to ensure that they are fit for purpose. It is surely not unreasonable to ask that our young people know that they are being given the best possible training. We cannot allow our young people simply to be shipped from one training scheme to another without any positive outcome for them.</p><p>Before I move on, it would be folly not to highlight the growing concern about the increase in women&#8217;s unemployment.</p><p>I opened my speech by saying that I would highlight strengths and weaknesses, but one of the weaknesses is more of an omission. I am disappointed that there is severe lack of recognition of the contribution that the social economy makes to our economy. The global financial crisis has shown that the consequences of irresponsible financial practices are hitting our most vulnerable hardest. That is why I hoped that the economic strategy would indicate more support for social enterprises, credit unions and other forms of financial co-operatives. Credit unions in particular should be supported in their role of providing responsible lending within their communities, as well as encouraging people to save. The credit union movement plays a crucial role in local communities in tackling poverty and providing financial inclusion to the wider community.</p><p>The social economy also needs to see a real effort from the Scottish Government to increase business strength through enabling competitiveness in procurement and tendering opportunities. There is evident year on year growth within the social economy in Scotland, and that needs to be harnessed to maximise its role in our economy. In Glasgow, the city that I represent, there are a number of examples of businesses in the social economy that make a genuine contribution to people&#8217;s lives and to the economy. However, more support is needed to grow the sector across Scotland and within our economy. I urge the Government to take note of that omission and to acknowledge and further strengthen that infrastructure.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Government Economic Strategy&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.

I congratulate all my colleagues in the chamber who have delivered their maiden speeches; they have set the bar really high&#8212;thanks for that, there is no pressure now. To those who are still to undertake theirs, I say good luck.</p><p>I thank the constituents of Glasgow for their faith in electing me as a representative, and I pledge to them my proactive participation at the highest level in representing their needs, issues and aspirations.</p><p>I thank my predecessor members of the Scottish Parliament who built the foundation of representation in Glasgow: Frank McAveety, Charlie Gordon, Pauline McNeill and Bill Butler. I pay tribute to their sterling efforts as Glasgow constituency candidates of great integrity and conviction.</p><p>Last but by no means least, I thank my family and friends for their uncompromising love, support and faith&#8212;and a special thank you to the chair of my local Labour Party branch and the Glasgow city party, Mr Tommy O&#8217;Connor, my great friend and mentor.</p><p>As a newly elected MSP I intend to work with a passion to pursue social justice. Glasgow is and has a history of being a city enriched by the politics and principles of fairness, with a strong sense of community. As a Glaswegian I am proud to serve the city, as I share that passion for socially enriched, sustainable and inclusive communities.</p><p>Prior to my becoming an elected member, my academic training and practice were as a community education worker, in the realms of social work. The job encompasses the privileges of responding to the diverse and complex needs of communities in the most disadvantaged areas in the west of Scotland and responding to the challenges of active citizenship, to enable and empower young people to articulate their voices. It is about the development of structures that enable communities to be central in local decision-making processes. It is about building community capacity, enhancing the local social economy and enabling communities to be self-determining and self-directing, with services provided for and by communities&#8212;something that is imperative given the prevalence of ideas about the big society and the transfer of public services. It is about the design, development and delivery of community-based adult learning, including literacy and numeracy programmes. The aforementioned work afforded me the honour of engaging with numerous dedicated volunteers and community groups, while turning social policy into action.</p><p>Education and lifelong learning is therefore a passion of mine. I am passionate about the right of every individual to pursue their potential through education. I urge members to subscribe to an idea of education that is not merely for school-age pupils but is for a nation of ageless learners, and to acknowledge the trajectory from early years and through mainstream education to adult and continuing education, as rites of passage. Education and lifelong learning are key to economic development, employment imperatives, entrepreneurialism, active citizenship and personal, social and community development.</p><p>The current disharmony and revolt on education in rural Scotland and in our Scottish universities is manifesting itself in students&#8217; and parents&#8217; engagement in demonstrations and rallies, which have been indicative of people&#8217;s passion for local, accessible schooling, the retention of university departments, the maintenance of student numbers and the preservation of jobs.</p><p>It is therefore incumbent on the Scottish Government to re-engage with COSLA on a Scotland-wide strategy for schools and to ensure that departments of, for example, sociology, art, music, geography and community education are retained. Community education departments train students who will be deployed in the most disadvantaged communities in Scotland, nurturing lifelong learning and building capacity so that services can be run for and by communities.</p><p>Widening access should be a key priority during this parliamentary session. We need an education system that is open to everyone on the basis of ability, not income or background. I urge the Scottish Government to commit to a nation of ageless learners, whether people&#8217;s reasons for learning are to do with academic excellence, employment, personal or social development or entrepreneurialism&#8212;or indeed are intrinsic&#8212;because strong, empowered citizens make for effective Governments.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648601", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Education and Lifelong Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer, for the privilege of presenting my maiden speech today.
