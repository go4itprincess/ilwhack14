At that meeting, we heard first hand from specialist nurses&#8212;as well as from the patients and families that they work with&#8212;about how invaluable the services are. I will come back later to examples that we heard about at that meeting, but it is important first to define heart failure in order to set our discussion in context.</p><p>Heart failure is a complex condition for which there is no cure for the majority of people. Heart failure occurs when the heart, which is a muscle, is damaged by a cardiac event&#8212;most commonly following a heart attack, or from long-term high blood pressure, or valvular disease, which I suffer from myself.</p><p>It is really important to make the distinction between heart failure and heart attack, because there is a common misconception that they are the same conditions&#8212;they are not. Heart failure can be the result of a heart attack, but heart failure is a long-term condition, whereas a heart attack is an emergency or acute event and happens when a blockage occurs in one of the arteries to the heart, which restricts the flow of blood.</p><p>Due in part to the very welcome improvements in the rate of premature mortality through heart disease, the prevalence of heart failure is rising. It is the only cardiovascular condition that is on the rise, in part because acute events such as heart attacks, which would have been fatal a few years ago, are now survivable. As a consequence, however, many people with damaged hearts end up living with heart failure. Additionally, because heart failure is more prevalent in older people, our ageing population also further increases its prevalence. Improved heart attack survival is, of course, tremendous progress, but it presents the national health service with different challenges, including how to help people to cope when living with heart failure.</p><p>Specialist heart failure nursing services are one of the most important ways that the NHS can treat heart failure patients. At the meeting in March of the heart disease and stroke cross-party group, we heard from Mr Thomas Stark, who is a heart failure patient. Thomas described his family&#8217;s and his experience of a heart failure diagnosis and his treatment and rehabilitation at Astley Ainslie hospital. Thomas, who felt that he had been well supported throughout his time at Astley Ainslie, described the value of group discussions and of listening to the experiences of others. He also shared a moving letter that his wife had written to the NHS to express their thanks. Thomas summed up the input of the specialist nurse in this way:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll no beat about the bush, but the nurse was our lifeline.&#8221;</p><p>We also heard from Mrs Lorraine Jones&#8212;a carer for a heart failure patient. Lorraine and her sister were both full-time carers for their mum since her diagnosis of end-stage heart failure. Lorraine described the journey that she and her family had been on as they had, after losing their father, then to deal with the impact of their mother&#8217;s illness, which was particularly challenging because she would not accept the diagnosis. Lorraine talked about all aspects of the support that was provided by the nurse. The support was practical, with arrangements for the end of life, and emotional, in that it supported everyone involved in coming to terms with what was happening. Lorraine summed up the support by saying,</p><p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t repay what she&#8217;s done for me and my family.&#8221;</p><p>Since 2002, the British Heart Foundation has supported heart failure specialist nurses around the United Kingdom to ease the burden and improve the quality of life for people with the disease. The British Heart Foundation has funded or pump primed many of those roles in numerous NHS board areas in the expectation that boards would mainstream the funding when the British Heart Foundation funding ended. An evaluation of the impact of the services, which was published in 2008, found dramatic reductions in hospital readmissions for patients who were cared for at home by specialist heart failure nursing services. The report concluded that every patient who is cared for by a specialist heart failure nurse equates to a saving of &#163;1,826 per patient, including the costs of the specialist post. It seems to me essential, therefore, that NHS boards make specialist heart failure nursing services a top priority.</p><p>The Scottish heart failure nurse forum, which is the independent representative body for such nurses in Scotland and which is supported by BHF Scotland and Chest Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland, produced the report that stimulated this evening&#8217;s debate. That report compares the provision of specialist heart failure nursing services in Scotland in 2012 to provision when it published its previous report in 2008. Unfortunately, the national situation is not a good one. Despite the fact that the prevalence of heart failure is increasing, nationally the overall provision of specialist heart failure nursing posts has fallen, from 51 whole-time equivalent posts in 2008 to 47 in 2012. Only four NHS boards meet the minimum ratio that is set down in the 2007 Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network recommendation of one nurse per 100,000 of population. One NHS board&#8212;NHS Orkney&#8212;has no specialist heart failure nursing service at all. That is simply not good enough.</p><p>We all know that NHS boards are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, but it is crucial that they up their game by improving provision of such nurses. Otherwise, as well as costing themselves more money in the medium to long term through increased hospitalisation costs, they will badly let down heart failure patients, who desperately need the kind of care that only specialist nurses can provide.</p><p>When the Parliament&#8217;s Public Audit Committee considered the issues last year during its inquiry into cardiology services, it concluded that clarification was needed from the Scottish Government on future plans for specialist heart failure nursing services. In response, Derek Feeley wrote to the committee and stated:</p><p>&#8220;On 1 November 2012 the National Advisory Committee on Heart Disease agreed to support the establishment of a heart failure short life working group. This group will be well placed to advise NHSScotland on how heart failure nurses role can be further strengthened. The group, which will include heart failure nurse representation, is expected to have its first meeting in spring 2013.&#8221;</p><p>That will be a welcome development if&#8212;it is a big &#8220;if&#8221;&#8212;the group&#8217;s recommendations are taken forward by ministers and NHS chief executives and are regarded as a priority. Perhaps in concluding the debate, the minister can inform us whether the group has met yet, when it will meet if it has not met, and what more he thinks the Government can do to get NHS boards to provide the services at a sufficient and sustainable level.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694546", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Specialist Heart Failure Nurse Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion was stimulated by a discussion at the cross-party group on heart disease and stroke, of which I am a vice-convener, in March.

The information in the trust&#8217;s briefing is truly humbling. As has been said, on average, five children arrive in Scotland every month, seeking asylum without their parents, through separation or another tragedy. Very few can speak English, and more than half have so little information or documentation that they are classified as &#8220;age disputed&#8221;. That is a potent reminder that there are societies around the world in which people exist in incomprehensibly desperate circumstances. It is a sad indictment of humanity that societies still exist in which life is so desperate that children have to make a dangerous journey across the world to seek asylum.</p><p>The guardianship service, as others have mentioned, is a programme that pairs those vulnerable children up with an adult who can act as a guide and confidant throughout the asylum process. As Malcolm Chisholm said, they provide advice and emotional support. The second of those things is really important because we need to be wary of the cold approach. As well as guidance, probably the best thing that we can offer those children is a shoulder to cry on&#8212;a human, caring face for the whole process&#8212;because they will be traumatised and need someone whom they believe cares about what will happen to them.</p><p>As has been pointed out, the project began as a three-year pilot in 2010 operated by the Scottish Refugee Council and Aberlour Child Care Trust and, in February, the Scottish Government announced that it would fund the project for another three years. Although that is very welcome, it is unsurprising. In its relatively short period of operation, the Scottish guardianship service has attracted praise from the Joint Committee on Human Rights at Westminster, which has recommended that the UK Government introduce a similar pilot for England and Wales.</p><p>Children who have received a guardian through the service have a significantly higher success rate in their asylum applications, with 44.2 per cent being granted refugee status or humanitarian protection, compared with only 20 per cent in the parts of the UK where no such service operates. Clearly, the Scottish guardianship service has already had a positive impact on those who have arrived in Scotland, and is serving as an example of good practice across the country. It is right that we, as a relatively rich developed country, do all that we can to help those who do not enjoy our luck in living in a wealthy and democratic nation. It is our responsibility to do all that we can to help those who arrive on our shores in desperate need of assistance, so I am pleased that the guardianship service is helping those most vulnerable of asylum seekers to navigate the process when they arrive.</p><p>However, although I sincerely welcome the service, it is&#8212;as John Mason suggested&#8212;a way of addressing the symptoms rather than the underlying problem. Of the children who arrived between September 2010 and August 2012, almost three quarters came from just seven countries: Afghanistan, Vietnam, Nigeria, Iran, Somalia, Gambia and Eritrea. To truly improve the quality of life of people around the world, we need to be internationalists and to champion causes that address the vast inequalities that still exist.</p><p>As part of their campaign for global tax justice, Christian Aid and Church Action on Poverty have highlighted that each year the amount of corporation tax that is avoided by international corporations in developing countries is three times the global aid budget. The UK is about to host the G8 summit and David Cameron and George Osborne have both stated that reforming international tax practice will be high on the agenda. Although that would be a welcome step, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should perhaps look closer to home and prevent tax avoidance in the UK. Words are all very well but, as we know, actions speak far louder, and only through taking action on tax havens and tax avoidance can we truly improve the situation of many people living all over the world. After all, the United Nations projects that, by 2015, around 1&#160;billion people will be living in extreme poverty on less than $1.25 a day: we must do all we can to drastically reduce that figure.</p><p>While these conditions exist around the world, services like the Scottish guardianship service will continue to play a vital role in helping vulnerable children to escape desperate circumstances and to settle into better lives. However, there are a number of steps that we can take to build on the solid foundations that have been created through the service. As Murdo Fraser pointed out, we in the UK do not distinguish between children and adults in respect of completion of assessments, unless the children show signs of torture or trauma. Moreover, although the UKBA will allow interviews of children to take place offsite, it will not allow those offsite interviews to be recorded. I have no idea why that should be the case.</p><p>Aberlour has suggested that the UKBA might not have the required expertise to deal with vulnerable children in such cases, and that a two-stage process involving child protection committees having responsibility for formal identification of trafficking, while the Home Office and UK human trafficking centre retain responsibility for making the immigration decision. I think that that sensible suggestion is worth looking at.</p><p>I am very pleased that the Scottish guardianship service has had such a positive impact and that it will continue to operate for the next three years. However, although I believe that we should all welcome that move, we must not lose sight of the fact that the need for the service highlights the unacceptable inequality that exists around the world. That should spur us on to take decisive action to reduce global poverty and to lift hundreds of millions of people out of desperate situations.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693870", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Guardianship Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In preparing for the debate, I read the briefings that were provided by a number of organisations, in particular the Aberlour Child Care Trust.

Although we must ensure that no mistakes are made, the sooner we complete the legislative process, the sooner our owner-occupiers will be able to go on with their plans for new homes and suchlike.</p><p>My constituency is home to about 3,000 of Scotland&#8217;s crofts, predominantly on the west coast, Skye and the small isles, but also in the farmland around Dingwall, the Black Isle and Badenoch. On Skye, crofters account for around 65 per cent of households, so crofting is clearly an exceedingly important issue for my constituency and me.</p><p>Since the decision to halt applications for decrofting was taken in February&#8212;the only possible decision, in view of the legal consequences&#8212;I have been contacted by constituents who are concerned about the halt and its impact on their plans to build new homes and to secure mortgages. That shows why it is so important that amendment of the 2010 act, in the form of the bill, will comprehensively fix the legal difficulty and put the solution in place as quickly as possible so that all those who have been affected can resume their applications as soon as possible.</p><p>After the minister&#8217;s recent statement on the plans for legislation, I asked what plans had been considered to allow the Crofting Commission to deal with the backlog that has built up since February. I was reassured by the minister&#8217;s answer that the Crofting Commission has been asked in the meantime to process pending applications as far as possible, so that once we have robust legislation in place they can be concluded quickly in order to minimise the disruption that is being caused to crofters.</p><p>My constituents have expressed concern that information has not been forthcoming on how quickly the backlog will be tackled. I therefore hope&#8212;and expect&#8212;that the Crofting Commission will put its back into dealing with the backlog in order to clear it as quickly as possible. I am sure that that will be done.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee stated in its stage 1 report that it is important to ensure that the legislation will apply retrospectively. Obviously, that must be the case. The Scottish Crofting Federation, in an article in its in-house magazine The Crofter, described the Scottish Government&#8217;s plans to introduce the bill as</p><p>&#8220;the correct (and only) way forward.&#8221;</p><p>I am pleased that we are already at stage 1. Given the disruption that the current situation is causing crofters, our priorities for the legislation must be to ensure that it is, in order to avoid the need for amendment again in the near future, of high quality and in place as soon as possible.</p><p>In evidence to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee were a number of suggestions that wider reform of crofting legislation would be desirable. I agree with those calls and look forward to the Government&#8217;s response, because there is no doubt that crofting legislation could do with consolidation. We have had the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1955, the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1961, the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1968, the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 1976, which gave crofters the right to purchase their crofts, and we have had supposed consolidation through the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. Then, the Scottish Parliament had a crack with the Crofting Reform etc Act 2007, and a second go in 2010 with the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. Now we have this bill, and I have probably missed something out. On top of all that, there are many regulations and there is guidance.</p><p>As Tavish Scott said, consolidation has been needed for some time, but previous Governments have ducked the issue. No one has been brave enough to tackle the issue, as Sir Humphrey may have said. Perhaps Minister Hacker&#8212;I am sorry; I meant Wheelhouse&#8212;will be the one to do so.</p><p>As well as consolidation and simplification of the law and regulations governing crofting, there are a number of other opportunities that we could take to improve life for crofters, particularly those in Skye and Lochalsh. Please forgive me for mentioning the recent study that was commissioned by the Scottish Crofting Federation and funded by the Scottish Government, which concluded that a Skye and Lochalsh abattoir could return a modest profit if the capital costs were funded. What has that to do with the bill? It is to do with sheep, cattle and pigs, without which there would be no crofting, in which case the bill would not be needed. The abattoir would have a maximum capacity for 4,000 sheep, 200 cattle and 130 pigs a year, with projected initial throughput of 800 sheep, 100 cattle and 130 pigs. The challenge will be to secure the funding to cover the capital costs. I intend to do all that I can to support that proposal, and I hope that the minister will look at it favourably.</p><p>Crofting is an important part of the heritage and identity of the Highlands and Islands; it is also the lifeblood of about 33,000 people across the country. The Highlands and Islands have some of the least favourable land for cultivation, so it is vital that we support our crofters and thereby ensure that, in return, the country always enjoys the security of producing good-quality foodstuffs for our own consumption, while benefiting the environment. We all rely on agriculture to give us the basic ingredients that make life possible, so we must all ensure that agriculture gets the support that it deserves. I am pleased that Parliament will back the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the progress that has been made with this essential amendment of the 2010 act, and I am glad that we are already at stage 1.

In the past, we would have put in great, lengthy platforms at any new station, so we are making progress in terms of how people think and innovate when it comes to improving railways. If we can think a wee bit out of the box, improvements do not always have to cost a fortune. The reopening of that station has helped to alleviate the congestion resulting from the maintenance work that is taking place on the Kessock bridge.</p><p>We have made progress in eliminating open level crossings on public roads. Following a campaign that was started by me just over five years ago, Network Rail has started putting barriers on all 23 of Scotland&#8217;s open level crossings. Barriers have been installed at the crossing in Ardrossan&#8212;that was the pilot project&#8212;and at the one in Corpach, and the project is being rolled out across the others, which are mainly in the Highlands. Further, Network Rail will do the same thing to more than 100 open level crossings in England and Wales. I am extremely pleased about that.</p><p>Other improvements that are in the pipeline have been spoken about already today. Phase 2 of the Highland main line improvement will increase capacity on the line and decrease journey times in due course between the Highlands and the central belt, with a target of reducing the shortest journey time to 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p><p>It has been announced recently that 25 stations around Scotland, including Inverness and Fort William, will have free wi-fi. I am pleased about that. Wi-fi is also being rolled out to all class 170 trains, which run between Inverness and other Scottish cities, and to the class 380 trains. Soon, a third of Scotland&#8217;s rolling stock will have free wi-fi.</p><p>The planned and delivered improvements are welcome and will significantly improve transport links between the Highlands and the central belt. I was encouraged by what today&#8217;s motion says about the use of franchise specifications to better meet the needs of the people of Scotland. I am sure that that will be the case. However, I want to mention a couple of points that I think are important.</p><p>As I am sure will be the case, the specifications must improve the rolling stock. As has been said, many of the journeys to the north can take three or four hours, so it is important that we have rolling stock that is equipped with adequate luggage and cycle storage, and comfortable seats. That is important from the point of view of our tourism industry, and from that of the people in Scotland who use these trains.</p><p>We must encourage people on to the trains. Time is not the only important factor in that regard; comfort and the ability to take pleasure in the journey are important, too. That includes the ability to get something decent to nibble on as well. Murdo Fraser mentioned the infamous British Rail sandwich. I occasionally take the sandwiches that are offered by ScotRail, but I prefer the bacon rolls on the south coast service. I think that that is a better service. That is what we should aspire too&#8212;the old buffets, and a bit of comfort. That will encourage more people back to the trains.</p><p>We must continue to improve station facilities in the Highlands. For example, we still have anomalies and problems with stations such as Kingussie, where one of the platforms on the other side from the main station is about a foot lower than the one on the station side, which means that people cannot get disabled access. As we can now have two trains at a time coming in, which is an improvement, that is causing a problem for disabled passengers in getting on the southbound train at the other platform. They have to be taxied to the next station, which could be many miles down the road. We need to look at such things in the long term.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned Transform Scotland&#8217;s proposal to use the Glenfarg line to run a service directly from Edinburgh to Perth and save up to 35 minutes on the journey. That would be great. We need to look at that in the long term, but it might be better to spend any money that we have on dualling the line up to Inverness as much as possible and on electrifying that line. That might gain almost as many minutes as reopening the Glenfarg line would.</p><p>We are doing very well on the railways in a difficult period, and I am sure that we will do even better after we get independence.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Railways"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I bow to Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s superior knowledge, but it is very small indeed.

That can be challenging, given the many competing pressures on parliamentary time, but it is hoped that the new procedure will address some of those time pressures.</p><p>The new procedure defines a new kind of bill, to be referred to as a Scottish Law Commission bill, which can be used when the need for reform is widely agreed but no major or contentious political or financial issues arise. Under the procedure, such bills may be referred to the Subordinate Legislation Committee for scrutiny rather than to the relevant subject committee. Only a minority of Scottish Law Commission bills are likely to be suitable for scrutiny by the Subordinate Legislation Committee and, to give some flexibility, the proposed standing orders provide for the Presiding Officer to issue a determination that will specify what the criteria should be. We anticipate that that determination will be based on the proposals in the law reform working group report.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee considered how Scottish Law Commission bills should be referred to the Subordinate Legislation Committee and agreed that, in line with existing practice for bills, there should be a straightforward referral from the Parliamentary Bureau rather than a formal consultation with subject committees beforehand.

There is also a ferry from Arisaig out to Eigg and Muck on a Sunday and there are sailings from Knoydart at 10:30 and 12:30 on a Sunday.</p><p>I mention that because we need to make the most of those sailings. RET will make it cheaper for people to get to the islands and it will boost our tourism and the economy. However, we must look at such things holistically; we must get the trains to arrive at Arisaig and Mallaig at about the same time&#8212;or just before, preferably&#8212;as the ferries are leaving for the small isles. Allan Henderson, the provost of Lochaber, has written to ScotRail about the matter. I ask the minister to tell us in his summing up whether he has had any discussions with ScotRail about the possibility of tying in&#8212;this summer, if possible&#8212;the times of the trains coming into Arisaig and Mallaig with the departures of the small isles ferries.</p><p>The new timetable for the small isles provides a very good service. The only thing that is missing is the ability for islanders to make a return trip to the mainland in the course of a normal working day&#8212;to get to the dentist or the doctor, to go shopping or to do other things that they might need to do. The ferries review suggests pretty major changes to achieve that&#8212;a new daily passenger small freight ferry with a roll-on, roll-off for just two days a week. I do not think that that would be sufficient; we need more than that. It may well be that the best option is to keep the current enhanced service with the MV Lochnevis and to charter a passenger vessel, maybe fortnightly, to provide residents of the small isles with the ability to make a meaningful return trip to the mainland in the course of a normal working day. I would value the minister&#8217;s views on that.</p><p>The advantage of the Lochnevis is that it has a cafeteria and is a comfortable boat. People who have to spend five hours on it in stormy weather, as I have done, feel quite relaxed and safe because it is such a good boat for that part of the world and the waters there.</p><p>I will quickly touch on the staff situation. I was at the meeting with the TSSA that Elaine Murray called, for which I thank her. We got cross-party support there and motion S4M-06510 has cross-party backing. It is just a pity that the issue that it concerns could not have been separated out from the motion that is being debated today, or we might have got cross-party support across the chamber for it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691872", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The small isles ferry services to Rum, Eigg, Muck and Canna are in my constituency.

I received a leaflet from one of the suppliers that included a breakdown of the regional differences in unit price across the UK. The north of Scotland is consistently one of the most expensive regions; there is a difference of between 1.13p and 1.6p per unit between the unit price charged in the north and the unit price charged in the south of Scotland. For example, on the general domestic tariff, consumers in the north of Scotland pay 13.77p per unit; those in the south of Scotland pay 12.45p per unit; and those in Yorkshire get a unit for 12.12p. That represents a difference between the north of Scotland and Yorkshire of 14 per cent. That is replicated in some of the other tariffs. The economy 7 tariff has a 16.34p per day unit in the north, compared with 15.21p in the south of Scotland, with Yorkshire at 14.76p&#8212;a difference of 11 per cent. Equally, on the economy 10 tariff, there is a price difference of 10 per cent between Yorkshire and the north of Scotland.</p><p>That is a huge and unfair difference, which I believe is unjustified. Consumers in the north of Scotland&#8212;such as in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch&#8212;also face a double whammy as homes are difficult to insulate, which further increases our costs. Whatever review of electricity systems we have, we must bear in mind the need for a level playing field in charges to consumers across the country. I hope that that will be addressed.</p><p>The high costs in the north come despite the fact that the most remote parts of Scotland have some of the best potential renewable resources in the European Union, as well as existing hydro power. Just last week, SSE confirmed that it will proceed with the Glasa development near Ardross&#8212;a new &#163;30 million hydro scheme, which is the largest to be built in the UK for five years. SSE has also proposed a huge 600MW pumped storage hydro scheme, Coire Glas, on Loch Lochy. At Kyle Rhea, the proposed tidal array has attracted more than &#163;15 million in European funding through the NER300 programme&#8212;it is one of only 23 renewable schemes throughout the EU to share a &#163;1 billion funding stream.</p><p>There are countless other examples along the west coast, in the Moray Firth and around Shetland and Orkney, yet consumers in the Highlands and Islands face amongst the highest bills in the UK. As we all know, the cost of fuel has risen substantially for consumers across Scotland in recent years. As the cost of heating our homes accounts for a greater part of families&#8217; budgets, the geographic differences seem increasingly unjustifiable. Future policy must ensure a level playing field for all consumers in the UK.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to deal with geographic variations in the prices offered to consumers.

There are numerous good practice guidelines and systems to deal with the distribution of community benefit. For example, Highland Council has published guidelines according to which the amount of community benefit is distributed among the local community, an area-wide fund and the Highland trust fund so that everybody benefits. The existing good practice guidelines are generally for onshore wind developments, but as new renewables technologies approach maturity, we will see an increasing number of offshore developments such as tidal arrays, offshore wind farms and wave farms. It is important that we recognise that and develop a robust framework to ensure that coastal and other communities get a fair share of community benefit in the coming years.</p><p>Offshore resources will make a huge contribution to meeting Scotland&#8217;s ambitious renewable energy targets and will secure jobs in the renewable energy industry, bringing significant profits for the developers and benefits to the country. It is therefore right that we are prepared to ensure that some of the money goes to our coastal communities, and for that to happen we must have a robust community benefit system in place that ensures that the riches from areas such as the west Highlands do not just flow out of the area but directly benefit local communities as well.</p><p>Remote areas where the best resources are located will gain some improvements to infrastructure, but we must do better than that. As well as ensuring that there is direct community benefit, we must also feed back some of the bonanza to west coast communities. The Government must look favourably on using the benefits that we will get from west coast renewable energy for extensive improvements to our roads, rail, ferry and air infrastructure. If huge amounts of money are coming out of the west Highlands and Skye, surely it is not unreasonable to ask that some of it goes back in again.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would certainly hope that Ofgem would pick up on these things.

David emulated his father&#8217;s love of theology and his father&#8217;s faith in Christ, but he mixed it with a distinct passion for the sciences, which led him to study medicine and to being ordained as a missionary.</p><p>David Livingstone&#8217;s father feared that reading science books would undermine David&#8217;s Christianity. David&#8217;s deep interest in nature led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. However, after reading the book &#8220;The Philosophy of a Future State&#8221; by Thomas Dick, the young David reconciled his two loves of faith and science. He believed that the two are not at odds with each other but are both essential to a fulfilled life.</p><p>David Livingstone went on to establish Christian missions in central Africa and to become one of the most famous missionaries in history. His motto, which is inscribed on the base of the statue to him at Victoria falls, was &#8220;Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation&#8221;. He saw his mission as opening a path for commerce and Christianity. It is important to note that his championing of commerce was not colonialist; it was more to do with providing an alternative economy to the slave trade.</p><p>David Livingstone encouraged small groups of Presbyterian men, and eventually their families, to form communities in Africa that would bring their skills and pass those on to local people. He saw that not as a means of European settlement but as a transfer of skills and techniques and a way of Christian living.</p><p>During his travels, David Livingstone preached a Christian message, but he never forced it on unwilling ears. He listened to the African chiefs with respect and courtesy; he treated them as equals, which was in stark contrast to the treatment of the African people by many other Europeans.</p><p>In taking that attitude, David Livingstone was acting just as he had learned in his readings of the Bible.

This is a relatively simple issue, so I apologise if I repeat and reinforce some of the points that he made.</p><p>I have initiated and sustained many discussions with a number of trade associations, local businesses, MSPs and Scottish Government ministers in support of the change that is proposed. I believe that we are moving forward.</p><p>Raising the speed limit for HGVs over 7.5 tonnes from 40mph to 50mph on single-carriageway roads is an issue of great importance to my constituency, as the A9 is the main artery connecting Inverness and the north-east Highlands with the central belt.</p><p>As David Stewart said&#8212;I have personal experience of this&#8212;the build-up of long queues of traffic behind convoys of slow-moving lorries, which is known as platooning, is a particular issue on the A9, where much of the route is single carriageway. Frustrated drivers who are stuck behind such lorries are tempted to take chances overtaking, which is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the A9 has experienced so many safety issues over the years.</p><p>I applaud the designing and planning that are currently under way to dual the A9 from Inverness to Perth by 2025&#8212;perhaps that will be completed a bit sooner; I hope that it will&#8212;but in the meantime, action must be taken to alleviate the dangerous conditions that are currently faced on the A9 and other single-carriageway roads throughout Scotland. I believe that increasing the speed limit for such HGVs from 40mph to 50mph would lead to a reduction in platooning and risky overtaking manoeuvres, which would mean that the roads would be safer for all drivers.</p><p>Beyond creating a safer Scotland, the decision would create increased revenue and savings for local businesses. According to the Department for Transport impact assessment, raising the speed limit for HGVs over 7.5 tonnes from 40mph to 50mph would create a net benefit of &#163;454 million by 2030 throughout the UK. In addition, an increase in the speed limit would save 2.4 million man hours a year for HGV drivers and countless more for other motorists. The direct impact of the change would save UK businesses &#163;30.6 million a year. Obviously, significant proportionate savings would apply in Scotland.</p><p>There would also be positive environmental impacts, as Dave Stewart said. The increase in the speed limit is supported by the Road Haulage Association, which has noted that the increase would mean that drivers would be able to stay in a higher and more fuel-efficient gear, which would lead to a more sustainable drive. That would mean fewer CO2 emissions not only for HGVs but for all the traffic behind them. The Malcolm Group Ltd, which is a leader in logistics, has stated:</p><p>&#8220;the vehicles of today run at their optimum level at about 50mph. At 40mph, an HGV is labouring and costs more to operate.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Transport Committee, 7 March 2006; c 3481.]</p><p>In 2006, the freight transport inquiry that the Scottish Parliament conducted recommended that select arterial roads should incorporate the higher speed limit to test the effects of a change on traffic. A Transport Scotland project report in 2008 suggested that an experimental trial should be conducted on the A9 between Perth and Inverness to resolve the issue. It is regrettable that no action was ever taken.</p><p>The Government should be applauded for its commitment to dualling the A9 all the way to Inverness. That will deliver a huge boost to the Highland economy and road safety along the route, but in the meantime there is a strong case to pilot an increase in the speed limit on single carriageways for HGVs.</p><p>Increasing the speed limit on single-carriageway roads would have many benefits for all drivers and the wider economy, not only HGV drivers. It would also deliver an environmental boost through a more efficient average speed. I hope that the minister supports a pilot project on the A9 so that we can properly evaluate the pros and cons of such an increase.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684731", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Speed Limits (Heavy Goods Vehicles)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Stewart on securing the debate, which is on an incredibly important issue, and I agree with what he had to say.

I particularly thank those members who are here to speak on this important subject.</p><p>Before I go any further, I must declare an interest, as I am a vice-president of the United Kingdom&#8217;s Trading Standards Institute and a past director of trading standards and protective services.</p><p>The issue of cold calling for property maintenance and repairs causes a huge amount of stress for Scottish consumers. I have come across many such cases over the years. Last year, between April and November, the citizens advice helpline dealt with 421 cases of such cold calling, involving nearly &#163;700,000 of consumer expenditure, and that is just the tip of the iceberg&#8212;an iceberg that the Scottish branch of the Trading Standards Institute has labelled</p><p>&#8220;one of the most disturbing and socially significant issues that is faced by Trading Standards Officers today.&#8221;</p><p>Due to the nature of property maintenance work, it is particularly important to ensure that consumers are not being misled, taken advantage of or tricked into agreeing to unnecessary work. The purchase of many other items or services from cold callers is protected by legislation that creates a cooling-off period, which means that people can change their minds, but that is not the case for property maintenance and repairs. People are protected by a cooling-off period if they buy double glazing or insurance from a cold caller, but not if they agree to a property maintenance or repair job such as fixing a roof or tarring a drive.</p><p>The added problem is that many property maintenance and repair jobs are not easily reversible. If a trader resurfaces a driveway or harls a wall, it cannot simply be undone. For that reason, it is critical that consumers are afforded the time to make an informed decision on such jobs.</p><p>Direct marketing through online adverts, emails and phone calls is fairly easy to deal with. Consumers are protected from intimidation and are offered a reasonable period of time between contact being made and the work starting. However, when someone appears at the door who is often ready to start the work immediately, it can be intimidating, and it is worrying to note that many cold callers target vulnerable groups, particularly older people, who might not feel confident in refusing rogue traders.</p><p>In a case last year in Newtonmore, in my constituency, which was reported in the Strathspey and Badenoch Herald, an elderly couple agreed to have their drive tarred for &#163;600. The two men poured an oily liquid on to the drive and brushed it in and then told the couple that they had run out of material and needed &#163;300 to buy more from their boss, who was allegedly running road works on the A9 and would supply them with his leftovers. The money was handed over and, of course, they disappeared. Fortunately, but unusually, the suspects were traced and the two men returned and handed back the money, but the drive was ruined.</p><p>As well as the evidence from Citizens Advice Scotland on the number of people who are dissatisfied with jobs completed as a result of cold calling, a worrying amount of anecdotal evidence highlights some appalling practices. In a worrying number of cases, the final bill is far larger than the price that was agreed before the work was started. Most troubling of all, there are all too many descriptions of customers being intimidated into paying, and even extreme examples of customers being marched to their closest cash machine or bank and handing over large sums of cash to rogue traders.</p><p>Practices such as those not only adversely affect consumers; they damage the vast majority of businesses, which are honest and conduct their affairs properly. Without official records, and operating through cash payments, rogue traders avoid tax and VAT liabilities and undermine the local economy.</p><p>The Trading Standards Institute has been running an excellent campaign to encourage people who are confronted by cold callers not to be pressured into agreeing to work on the spot. It has created a &#8220;No to Cold Calling&#8221; poster for its website, which has been downloaded more than 15,000 times. Unfortunately, however, such measures will not put off the worst offenders.</p><p>In order to protect consumers and honest businesses, we must ensure that the police and trading standards officers have the tools to tackle cold calling for property maintenance and repairs. The best way to achieve that is by bringing in legislation to outlaw the practice on the ground of community safety, making it a criminal offence for people to cold call at people&#8217;s doors to do property maintenance and repairs. By making cold calling for property maintenance and repairs illegal, we would deter rogue traders from the practice, while giving the public increased confidence to refuse a rogue trader and a solid reason for doing so. The police and trading standards officers would have a far stronger hand to play when tackling such incidents and would be able to greatly reduce the number of people who end up as victims of the poor service, extortion and scams that go hand in hand with the practice.</p><p>However, I would also like to sound a note of caution. Last week, the Accounts Commission published a report entitled, &#8220;Protecting consumers&#8221;, which highlighted just how stretched Scottish trading standards services are. The report highlights the fact that trading standards budgets have been cut disproportionately compared with those of other council departments and says that the number of officers is at a record low and that they are poorly co-ordinated.</p><p>The benefit of legislation such as I am suggesting relies on effective enforcement, and we must ensure that we take the Accounts Commission&#8217;s recommendations on trading standards seriously so that we can safeguard consumers and honest businesses alike.</p><p>I hope for a positive response from the minister on the introduction of legislation to curb cold calling for property maintenance and repairs, and for an assurance that the Government will seriously consider the Accounts Commission&#8217;s report, which calls for a redesign of the trading standards service in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Maintenance and Repairs (Cold Calling)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members of all parties for supporting my motion and thereby enabling tonight&#8217;s debate.

Following open heart surgery in 2006, I also have personal experience of how effective cardiac rehab can be.</p><p>Last year, the group heard a presentation from the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation on the new standards on which Helen Eadie&#8217;s motion focuses. Those standards include the goal of</p><p>&#8220;Ensuring referral of all eligible patients by cardiologists and/or specialist cardiovascular health care physicians to a prevention and rehabilitation programme as a standard (not optional) policy that is held in the same regard as the prescribing of cardioprotective medications.&#8221;</p><p>That is a worthy aspiration towards which we should all be working.</p><p>The evidence base for the effectiveness of cardiac rehab is overwhelming, as Helen Eadie said. It is highly cost effective&#8212;especially compared with surgical interventions for cardiac conditions&#8212;and it reduces premature mortality and hospital readmissions.</p><p>The Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network guidelines of 2002 said that cardiac rehab should be provided for all heart attack and bypass patients, and that all patients with heart failure and stable angina with limiting symptoms should be assessed for it. Those were grade A recommendations, which is the highest category of recommendation. In addition, the Government&#8217;s 2009 &#8220;Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan&#8221; reiterated that health boards should recognise the importance of providing rehab to all heart patients.</p><p>As a result of that focus, NHS Scotland has over the past few years made good progress in improving provision of cardiac rehab, especially for people with acute heart conditions. The figures show that, nationally, 75 per cent of heart attack patients and 68 per cent of heart bypass patients were referred for cardiac rehab.</p><p>However, some health board areas still appear to be underperforming in provision of cardiac rehab. In the NHS Highland area, for example, just over 40 per cent of eligible heart attack patients were referred for cardiac rehab. It is clear that providing such services over a large rural area is a challenge, but that figure shows that there is still some way to go.</p><p>As is noted in the motion, there are particular issues to do with the provision of rehab for people with longer-term conditions&#8212;especially those with heart failure and angina&#8212;right across Scotland. In the NHS Highland area, for example, only 3 per cent of eligible heart failure patients appear to have been referred for rehab in 2011 and, nationally, the proportion of referrals of such patients is no better.</p><p>The British Heart Foundation Scotland and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland, which have led the campaigning work in this area over the past few years, now say that they believe that the time is right for the Scottish Government to consider what further steps it can take to drive improvements. I agree. Specifically, they feel that ministers should consider whether assessment for cardiac rehab would be a suitable candidate for a new HEAT target, as Helen Eadie said.</p><p>I am aware that ministers share the aspiration of the BACPR, the BHFS and CHSS that referral to cardiac rehab should be mandatory for all heart patients, as is the case for many pharmaceutical treatments for cardiac disease. Therefore, I would be interested to hear whether the minister believes that a HEAT target on referrals to cardiac rehab, which the charities are proposing, is something that his officials could examine.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682566", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cardiac Rehabilitation (Clinical Standards)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Helen Eadie for securing this debate on an extremely important issue.

As CPGs are formed within the context of the changing people, preferences and politics that shape each session of the Parliament, they keep changing. Therefore, with the benefit of three sessions of experience behind us, the committee has set out changes to the CPG system that will take account of that context while maintaining effective CPGs.</p><p>Throughout the committee&#8217;s consideration, the value of CPGs to MSPs and to organisations and individuals outwith the Parliament was made abundantly clear to us. The changes recommended for the regulation of CPGs are intended to enhance that value.</p><p>However, before I describe those changes I wish to place on record the committee&#8217;s thanks to those who took the time to provide written submissions and give oral evidence. I also thank the clerks, who looked after us very well during the inquiry. The perspectives and experiences of the witnesses were of great use in informing the committee&#8217;s recommendations.</p><p>One of the first things that the committee turned its mind to was the definition of the purpose of CPGs. In the revised code, the purpose has been set out simply as follows:</p><p>&#8220;Cross-Party Groups provide an opportunity for MSPs from across the parties to engage with external stakeholders, primarily to enable the sharing of experiences and information on a particular subject and to raise awareness of issues relevant to MSPs&#8217; parliamentary duties.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to elaborate on that so that the purpose is clear.</p><p>Other changes recommend that details of the planned frequency of meetings and proposed key topics of discussion in the forthcoming year are provided at the point of registration. Annual returns will now ask CPGs to provide details to reflect the breadth of their work in terms of the topics discussed at each meeting and any reports that may be published by the group.</p><p>In addition to knowing what CPGs do, a clear understanding of who supports the work of a CPG is vital in ensuring that CPGs operate in an open and transparent manner. The revised code requires a CPG that receives secretariat support worth more than &#163;500 from an external organisation to register that support, as it is a material benefit.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that most of the financial benefits received by CPGs do not amount to vast sums of money&#8212;unlike the all-party groups at Westminster. Most registered amounts are less than &#163;1,000, although the largest amount registered this session was &#163;10,000 from Novartis for the CPG on visual impairment. At face value, that is a significant sum. However, on examination it transpired that the bulk of the money was to be used to support the provision of information in alternative formats to suit the needs of visually impaired CPG members. I am sure that members would agree that that is entirely reasonable.</p><p>The revised code will introduce a new requirement that external organisations providing secretariat support must agree to provide, if requested by the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, information about clients or donors.</p><p>In that respect, it is worth while emphasising that we envisage requests being made only where concerns have been raised about a particular CPG&#8212;for example, if a complaint was made to the committee or if the group was failing to provide details of financial assistance.</p><p>The committee looked at the period in which CPGs can reregister following an election and decided that it will remain at 90 days. However, that period will no longer include any recess of more than four days, which will end the need to cram meetings in before the summer recess. Reregistration criteria are explicitly stated in the new code and we are seeking to bring consistency into the information that is available about CPG meetings by introducing a single advance notification period of 10 calendar days for all meetings.</p><p>There will also be a requirement for CPGs to provide minutes for publication on the Parliament website and&#8212;in another change to current practice&#8212;groups will now be able to publish draft minutes. That means that anyone who is interested in the work of a group will be able to learn about that work with the minimum of delay.</p><p>So far, I have set out the main changes that the committee has proposed, which require more from CPGs. However, the committee report is not all stick and no carrot. We also hope to reduce bureaucracy in a number of areas, for example, by enabling the submission of documents electronically and by enabling MSPs to delegate permissions to staff members to submit information.</p><p>A more clearly defined role for the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee clerks in providing guidance and advice to assist CPGs to comply with the code is also proposed, and the committee itself will take a more active role in considering twice-yearly updates on CPG activities. That will allow the committee to identify and acknowledge good practice and also to deal with any group that is failing to operate effectively.</p><p>Taken together, the committee believes that the changes in procedures and practice that have been outlined will enable the cross-party group system to continue to offer value to MSPs, to the Parliament and to organisations and individuals throughout Scotland, while ensuring appropriate monitoring of the system.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#8217;s 9th Report, 2012 (Session 4), Review of Cross-Party Groups (SP Paper 227), and agrees that the changes to the Code of Conduct set out in Annexe A of the report be made with effect from 24 January 2013.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Review of Cross-Party Groups&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open this debate on the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#8217;s review of cross-party groups.

The Sainsbury&#8217;s agreement therefore represents not only a great deal for UK consumers, who can now buy our high-quality Scottish products, but offers a degree of security to the prawn fishermen in the Minch.</p><p>From Sainsbury&#8217;s point of view, the good practice of the west coast prawn fishermen means that there is a sustainable fishery that offers a consistent supply for the supermarket. The security of income that is provided by the deal is a solid platform for growth. I understand that the project is making good progress and that it is hoped that it will be expanded in the new year, with other supermarkets now becoming interested.</p><p>Of course, such projects depend on a steady supply of prawns, which brings me to the inflexibility of the common fisheries policy. That inflexibility was highlighted for all to see by the move of the east coast prawn fisherman to the west coast fishery when their own supplies dried up. Unfortunately, because of the crazy common fisheries policy, there is currently no easy way to deal with that type of problem, which has caused great uncertainty for the west coast fishermen, as has been said. They faced the prospect of their fisheries being closed in January. However, I am pleased to welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s assurances that options will be in place to ensure that that does not happen. I agree with him, however, that it would be far better for all involved if the regulatory framework was responsive enough to recognise and react to changing circumstances much more sensibly.</p><p>It has been clear for many years that the common fisheries policy is not fit for purpose and is failing Scottish fishermen. Another unfortunate symptom of that is that despite the acknowledgement by fishermen, scientists and even the European Commission that the cod recovery plan is counterproductive and encourages discards, we seem to be unable to make the necessary reforms.</p><p>Our fishermen face further effort reductions in 2013. That nonsense must be stopped. I wish the cabinet secretary well in his efforts to knock sense into the heads of the Brussels bureaucrats.</p><p>There are a number of quota increases. West coast prawn and North Sea haddock, whiting and herring quotas are expected to rise next year, in recognition of our fishermen&#8217;s commitment to sustainable practices. However, misguided quota cuts might drive up discards. For west coast fishermen, the reduction in haddock, monkfish and megrim quotas, coupled with an increase in the prawn quota, might lead to an increase in discards, which we all agree are an unacceptable waste of fish. The 48 per cent decrease in the haddock quota seems to be at odds with what fishermen are seeing in the grounds. Perhaps further scientific advice is necessary before such a large reduction in the quota is made.</p><p>We all know about the positive impact of adoption of selective gear. Our fishermen are to be commended for their enthusiasm for taking such measures. However, their efforts are being undermined by a regulatory system that is not responsive to local needs.</p><p>Fisheries do not respect international boundaries and are complex. Co-operation with our European neighbours is essential if we are to fish sustainably.</p><p>Scottish fishermen have worked incredibly hard in challenging circumstances to make huge progress on reducing discards and ensuring that stocks remain sustainable, while delivering the economic benefits on which we and our fishing communities depend.</p><p>The future of the Scottish fishing industry requires us to promote sustainable practices internationally and to ensure that all states fish in accordance with the principle of sustainability. The European Union is&#8212;this is unfortunate or fortunate, depending on how we look at it&#8212;the best forum for formulation of policy and agreement on future action, but the current common fisheries policy framework must be reformed and its shortcomings addressed.</p><p>At a time of economic hardship, we all agree that we must tackle the obscenity of waste through discards. I am confident that the cabinet secretary will push for the best deal for Scottish fishermen. The Scottish langoustine project demonstrates the high standards of our fishing industry and what can be achieved when the Government and the industry work together.</p><p>It is essential that UK ministers appreciate how important our fishing industry is and that they do all that they can to secure the best deal for Scottish fishermen.

The 2011 act gives UK ministers the authority to abolish, merge or transfer the functions of certain public bodies. The act is largely enabling legislation, with any changes to public bodies taking place via secondary legislation and orders being brought forward at Westminster. However, any orders that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament require to be consented to by this Parliament.</p><p>Interim arrangements have been in place since last year and the procedure used has been based on that for legislative consent motions. First, the Scottish Government lays a memorandum that gives its views on the order, with that memorandum being accompanied by a copy of the order, plus relevant accompanying documents; secondly, a lead committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee consider the memorandum and report on it to the Parliament; and, finally, the Parliament has to debate an LCM-style motion and vote on whether to give its consent to the order.</p><p>Over the past year, the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee has taken the opportunity to consider how well those interim arrangements have worked in practice, and we have concluded that the arrangements have provided an effective model for scrutiny of the orders. In each case, the relevant subject committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee have scrutinised the order and reported on it to the Parliament, which has then taken a decision, informed by the scrutiny, on whether to consent to the order.</p><p>We therefore propose that those arrangements should form the basis of new standing orders. The main change being proposed by the committee is a new chapter of standing orders&#8212;chapter 9BA&#8212;covering the procedure for consenting to 2011 act orders. That largely mirrors the legislative consent motion procedure set out in chapter 9B, with appropriate modifications. The remit of the Subordinate Legislation Committee in rule 6.11 is also being amended to allow it to consider the orders. In addition, there are several consequential changes from the new procedure, including changes to rule 5.4 on the business programme and rule 5.9 on the Business Bulletin. The motion in my name invites Parliament to note the committee&#8217;s report and agree that the changes to standing orders are made with effect from 21 November 2012.</p><p>I will move on to deal with the Public Appointments Commissioner for Scotland consultation.

This positive plan looks to build on the success of the previous action plan and outlines a vision for growth of the Gaelic language.</p><p>The Gaelic language is an important part of Scotland&#8217;s heritage and culture, and its continued presence along with English and Scots ensures that Scotland is an active trilingual community. There is growing evidence of the benefits of our children speaking more than one language: it improves the working of the brain and, therefore, health in old age by helping to delay the onset of diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s. It has also been shown to provide economic benefits. As children educated in a Gaelic-medium education environment can be fluent and literate in two languages by the age of ten, they will find it easier to learn a third language.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2011 there was a welcome growth in the number of people entering Gaelic-medium education, and the national Gaelic plan&#8217;s aim is to preserve and increase that growth. Indeed, the main aim is to double by 2017 the number of children starting Gaelic-medium education to 800 per year.</p><p>The national plan gives priority to pre-school education, school education and community action to meet those aims. By community action, I mean that we should use Gaelic speakers to promote the language and create an immersive environment for learners. Over the past two or three years, a lot of work has been done on that, from increasing the use of Gaelic in public bodies to increasing the number of Gaelic road signs. As the Gaelic schools are especially important in this initiative, I welcome Highland Council&#8217;s &#163;7 million investment in a new Gaelic school in Fort William. That school will play a special part as we seek to increase the number of children taught through the medium of Gaelic.</p><p>The biggest benefit and influence of the schools is that they create an immersive environment that encourages and develops Gaelic as a language instead of it being just another subject. It is important that Gaelic-medium education schools retain that immersive ethos. Gaelic should be not only the language spoken in the classroom but used throughout the school in the reception areas, in the corridors, on noticeboards, in the playground and in the canteen. If we dilute that principle, we will dilute the very essence of Gaelic-medium education.</p><p>I believe that the latest national Gaelic language plan offers a template for the continued growth of the Gaelic language over the next five years. The legacy of the previous plan is that more people are learning Gaelic, and B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig is confident that it can build on that. We must all strive to continue the progress made in the past five years and continue to use the language. After all, being part of a bilingual community has many benefits for individuals and the community, and I commend B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig&#8217;s plan as a major step forward in this journey.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Taing, Oifigeir Riaghlaidh.

Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary in London, has confirmed that by signalling that the UK Government will seek to accelerate the drive towards a free market in CAP. That is not the view in Scotland, the other devolved Administrations or most of the rest of the EU.</p><p>Paterson has stated:</p><p>&#8220;I would like to see the MacSharry and Fischler reports carried to their logical conclusions, which is that the production of food should be left to my farmers to decide according to the market&#8221;.</p><p>Although he qualifies that position by promising that farmers will be compensated for providing public good through environmental work, it makes no provision for supporting the overwhelming majority of Scottish farmers and crofters, who work in physically disadvantaged areas and would, therefore, struggle to compete in a free market that offered no compensation for the disadvantages of their location and the environmental and social good that they do. Nowhere is that more true than in my constituency.</p><p>The Commission&#8217;s current proposals include a requirement that three different types of crop be grown on each holding for it to qualify for support. That measure could be particularly challenging for Scottish farmers and crofters to satisfy, as many who work in livestock areas may grow only a couple of fields of spring barley or maize and 55 per cent of Scottish agricultural land is used for rough grazing. NFU Scotland has criticised those Commission proposals as far too simplistic for the more mixed farming that is predominant in Scotland.</p><p>The differences between the agricultural industries in Scotland and England demonstrate the need for a strong Scottish voice in the EU CAP negotiations. While the UK Government champions the principle of a free market in agriculture, we cannot trust that Scotland&#8217;s distinctive needs will be represented. Even Dacian Ciolos, the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, echoed those concerns when he called for the UK Government to recognise the Scottish and Welsh &#8220;specificities&#8221;.</p><p>CAP reform is certainly necessary, as the current system is far from perfect. In the previous reform of CAP, the pressing concern was overproduction. However, it is now clear that the 21st century world faces many different challenges, not least the ever-increasing demand for food from a rapidly growing population.</p><p>In that context, it is crucial that we defend Scotland&#8217;s levels of production, which are not only vital for the people who work in agriculture&#8212;especially in less favoured areas&#8212;but will provide Scotland&#8217;s long-term food security. In an increasingly volatile world economy and with population growth continuing to strain existing production, we must think about the long-term security of Scotland&#8217;s food supplies. Scotland is currently in a relatively strong position and does not face the challenges that many developing countries and others face to provide enough food for their populations. However, that does not mean that we should be complacent.</p><p>A market without support for our farmers and crofters would leave many struggling to compete, solely because we happen to have more difficult land and are some distance from our markets. Such a development would lead to us relying on imports for a large proportion of our needs. That situation would leave us at the mercy of a world market in which demand for food will only increase.</p><p>As we move from the current less favoured areas classification to the new areas of natural constraints criteria, we must ensure that the system is flexible enough to recognise the different levels of disadvantage that land can face and permit differentiated levels of support that are based on needs. The move to a new system will inevitably entail some redistribution of support and the instability that that will cause. However, it is necessary. In all of that, we must ensure that our farmers and crofters do not lose out and that Scotland&#8217;s voice is heard.</p><p>Scotland has priorities and needs that are different from those of the rest of the UK. That has become clear this afternoon, and there is general agreement on that across the chamber.

Although I believe that the occasional flutter is okay, there is a fine balance to be struck between allowing people the freedom to place a bet or have a go at the bingo and protecting vulnerable people in our society from what can, as we have heard, be a damaging addiction.</p><p>I grew up surrounded by gambling: the football pools, the horses, cards and&#8212;of course&#8212;the one-armed bandit, which Nanette Milne mentioned and which is aptly named. When I was a boy&#8212;I admit that that was not yesterday&#8212;I took bets on the horses down to the bookies for my dad. I am not sure that that was altogether legal. In those days the bookies was up an outside stair above a paper shop. The bet and the money, along with a nom de plume, were handed to a man through a wee window, so at least there was a bit of culture in it. My dad&#8217;s nom de plume was &#8220;Black Jet&#8221; after our jet black cross Labrador-Alsatian, who was my best friend. I therefore know a bit about gambling.</p><p>Of course, gambling gives people hope, especially those who are without a faith. Winston in George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;Nineteen Eighty-four&#8221; was always hoping that his lottery ticket would come up and lift him out of his despair, but it never did. It is a trick that is played on us by Government and big business.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with a bit of hope, however someone gets it, but gambling can become a real problem for many people, and it can get a grip before they know it. Bookmakers know that and so do Governments. Recent research has highlighted the staggering proportion of bookies&#8217; profits that are derived from people who have a serious gambling problem. Addiction to gambling not only affects the addict but has, as with addiction to drugs and alcohol, detrimental effects on the people closest to them. We must therefore recognise the damaging effects of gambling addiction on families and move to minimise it.</p><p>Research by the Theos think tank suggests that lower-income gamblers spend proportionately more on the lottery than the rest of the population and, I believe, benefit least from it.</p><p>As John Mason said, Professor Jim Orford highlights the fact that there are significantly more betting shops by population in poorer areas than there are in more affluent areas. That demonstrates that the poorest areas of our society are, in effect, paying a voluntary tax with a low level of return.</p><p>I highlight a new form of lottery that I think is particularly distasteful&#8212;the postcode lottery. Members might find that strange, but in that model of gambling everyone in the country is entered by default, but must pay to be eligible for a share of the prize if their postcode wins.</p><p>Psychologically, that puts people in a similar position to a regular lottery player who uses the same numbers each week and is afraid to miss a week lest their numbers be drawn. The crucial difference, of course, is that in the postcode lottery the pressure to participate and not miss out on the prize exists regardless of whether someone has played before or not. Look at the newspaper headlines: &#8220;Get in! We&#8217;ve won &#163;10,000 just in time for Christmas!&#8221; and &#8220;If you don&#8217;t enter, you won&#8217;t win it!&#8221; That puts pressure on people. It is an insidious pressure that works subconsciously and is a step too far. It is past time for another look at how Government and big business are exploiting our communities through gambling. We must tackle the issue.

Each rescue team is modelled differently, and in the Highlands the teams have adopted a northern model, which means that they operate on behalf of the police without police involvement and deliver best value to the public purse. I commend that model to the Government. As part of a local service, team members know the weather, the contours of the hills and their colloquial Gaelic names, and it is important that the service remains local after the creation of a single police force.</p><p>It is because of the dedication and sacrifice of mountain rescue teams that I warmly welcomed the Scottish Government&#8217;s much-needed announcement last December of an increase in annual grant funding to the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland. The money is being spent on equipment and on a project manager, as well as being distributed among the mountain rescue teams, to be spent as they see fit.</p><p>Mountain rescue volunteers still have to do a lot of fundraising, however. The Cairngorm team reckons that its members raise more than half of its &#163;100,000 annual running costs. Although the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland is adamant that mountain rescue is sustainable only if it is voluntary, members of the rescue teams find it difficult to give the time that is needed for fundraising.</p><p>In Lochaber, the rescue team has been calling for more than just financial support; it also wants a helicopter to be based in Lochaber. As it is, a rescue helicopter can take up to an hour and a half to reach the busiest mountain rescue locations in Scotland as it travels from Prestwick, Lossiemouth, Stornoway or Shetland to Lochaber. A helicopter in the area would much better serve the needs of mountain rescue teams and would save lives. Last year, the Lochaber mountain rescue team called for the assistance of a helicopter on more than 50 occasions, so there is a definite need. As John Stevenson, who was leader of the Lochaber mountain rescue team for four years, said:</p><p>&#8220;having a helicopter ... would mean you&#8217;re taking minutes rather than an hour, and time in any rescue is absolutely crucial.&#8221;</p><p>I support the team in its aim, and hope that the minister can give some support on this important matter.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669175", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mountain Rescue Teams"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Liz Smith on securing this debate.

Having been to sea a few times myself in the Moray Firth and the Minch, I know the difference, and I stand here today to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion because I know that there are few things as harmful to Scottish fishermen as the current common fisheries policy.</p><p>The nation of Scotland, with a population of five million, was responsible for almost 70 per cent of the volume of stock and 67 per cent of the value of sales of fish in the UK in 2011. Those statistics summarise my argument neatly. Fishing is vital to small communities and to our country. The value of fish that was landed by Scottish vessels from Shetland to Stranraer and from Stornoway to Eyemouth in 2011 was a grand &#163;500 million.</p><p>Despite the importance of the industry to our economy and communities, Scottish fisheries are disadvantaged because they are subordinate to a failing common fisheries policy that is decided in Brussels, and because they are dependent on the Government in London to negotiate on their behalf. I am firmly convinced that the common fisheries policy as it stands is flawed and can only continue to harm the Scottish fishing industry. I give the example of the problem of quotas, which is to blame for the incredible amount of fish that are discarded each year. The 2010 report &#8220;The Future of Fisheries Management in Scotland&#8221; estimated that discards of cod, haddock and whiting by Scottish vessels fishing in the North Sea and the west of Scotland in 2009 would have been worth in the region of &#163;38 million at first point of sale&#8212;to say nothing of the damage to the fish stock and the ecosystem.</p><p>As the European Parliament considers reforming the common fisheries policy, which is to be welcomed, I support the Scottish Government&#8217;s position on amending the policy. In particular, decentralising the specific details of the policy first to Scotland and then to the fishing communities is the only way to begin to reverse the damage that has been done and to prevent further damage from being done.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The fragmented coastline of the west coast of Scotland is home to communities that are dependent on fishing.

Despite 70 per cent of the UK&#8217;s fishing catch being landed by Scottish fishing vessels, Scotland does not have an automatic right to attend the Council of Ministers and, therefore, is dependent on Westminster ministers negotiating on our behalf. That is unlike the situation in Belgium, where the Flemish ministers always lead the fishing debates on Belgium&#8217;s behalf. Relying on Westminster ministers has not worked in the past, and I am doubtful that it will ever work.</p><p>Although I fully support the European Union setting the basic principles, overall targets, performance indicators and timeframes, I believe that Scotland should decide how to achieve them&#8212;not Brussels and not London. There are particular concerns in Scotland that need to be voiced on the European stage, one of which involves sustainability. As the Scottish Government suggests, we need to ensure that the fish population is maintained at maximum productivity while, at the same time, fishermen catch the maximum amount of fish. I am pleased to see that maximum sustainable yield is one of the Scottish Government&#8217;s priorities. Waste, which is a contributor to low stocks, must be phased out. Fishermen should not be forced or encouraged to throw dead fish over the side of a vessel because their quota for one species has been used up. I am also glad to see that that is a Scottish Government priority, which could begin in 2014 with a species-by-species approach.</p><p>As MSP for Avoch, in the Black Isle, and Skye and Lochaber, which have substantial fishing interests, I believe that local communities also deserve a louder voice on fisheries policy. It is the fishermen who know best the hardships and struggles of fishing in Scottish waters and how to manage the fish. We cannot analyse and legislate on fishing purely at an economic level; there are social considerations, too. As a Lossie loon, I am all too aware of the detrimental effect of the CFP, as Lossie harbour now holds only yachts where once there were dozens of productive fishing boats. The continuing viability of the fishing industry goes hand in hand with the vibrancy of fishing-dependent communities, and because of that we need to take a big-picture view.</p><p>Prior to the election in 2011, the SNP mentioned several key areas within the fishing industry, two of which are particularly important to my constituency. The first is the restoration of the identity and status of fishing as an occupation of choice in order to help to map out the most profitable future for the industry.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with Jamie McGrigor that we must get decentralisation.

Before I get into the details of the issue, I will explain briefly how we arrived at this point.</p><p>At the early meetings of the committee following the 2011 election, we discussed the idea of an inquiry into parliamentary reform. We were aware that voices within and outwith the Parliament had commented on how the Parliament could be more responsive to emerging and topical issues. Senior figures with significant experience of how this Parliament operates, including Henry McLeish, George Reid, Lord Steel, Lord McConnell, Bruce Crawford and the Presiding Officer&#8212;Tricia Marwick&#8212;all contributed to the debate. Some of those individuals were kind enough to share their ideas with us at our business planning meeting last summer and in our subsequent inquiry.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament is now 13 years old and has achieved much that is in line with its founding principles of sharing power, accountability, access and participation, and the inquiry confirmed that. For example, evidence to the committee from Scottish Environment LINK suggested that the Parliament has</p><p>&#8220;built an admirable legislative ethos and practice, consulting widely, building expertise and avoiding its committees being turned into servants of the executive&#8221;.</p><p>However, we took the view that the Parliament could not continue to be successful and evolve if it was not willing to look at itself with a critical eye. We believed that this parliamentary session was an opportune time to review whether existing parliamentary practices are serving their intended purpose.</p><p>In August last year, the committee received a letter from the Presiding Officer that prompted us to think, in particular, about changes to sitting patterns and the reform of parliamentary questions. Momentum for change had also come from the Conveners Group, which had begun its programme for change in relation to the Parliament&#8217;s committees. The Conveners Group has, for example, supported more focused and objective-based remits for committee inquiries in order to lead to increased quality of scrutiny and greater impact.</p><p>After due consideration, we launched our inquiry in September last year, with a tight deadline of completion by Christmas. Our objective was to conduct an inquiry that could provide a focal point for the parliamentary reform agenda. We wanted to explore on the record the different views on parliamentary reform and produce a clear set of recommendations for improving the way that Parliament operates.</p><p>In order to help us to focus, the committee developed three priorities for the inquiry: first, improving effective scrutiny in plenary session, including through more spontaneous and topical business; secondly, maintaining levels of engagement with outside organisations and individuals following change; and, thirdly, enlivening debate to improve the public perception of the Parliament and increase media interest.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open the debate on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee.

Committees can of course start at 9 o&#8217;clock rather than 10 o&#8217;clock, which would give them a bit of extra time. It is not an insurmountable difficulty. Some committees have much shorter meetings than others. It is readily manageable.</p><p>Secondly, the committee proposes the introduction of a new topical question time, which would enable back benchers to question the Government at short notice on matters that have national implications or national significance. At present, there is little scope for topical issues to be raised by back benchers at short notice, although there is a slot for urgent questions at First Minister&#8217;s question time. The only other avenue is to lodge an emergency question for consideration by the Presiding Officer. Only seven such emergency questions have been taken in Parliament in 12 years.</p><p>Topical questions will help the Parliament to hold the Government to account more effectively. In addition, they will increase the overall time available in the chamber for the questioning of ministers to one and three quarter hours&#8212;an increase of 17 per cent.</p><p>In addition, and importantly, under the new sitting patterns, question times will now open business on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays&#8212;a significant improvement on the current arrangements, whereby questions to ministers take place only on a Thursday.</p><p>A further improvement would be the committee&#8217;s proposal for a shorter period between the lodging of a question and the date on which it is asked in the chamber. That will enable back benchers to ask more relevant questions and reduce the chance that questions are overtaken by events before they are asked.</p><p>The third main point is that there will be an additional members&#8217; business debate each week, as the Parliamentary Bureau has accepted the committee&#8217;s recommendation that there should be more of a role for back-bench business in chamber proceedings, to remove the perception that chamber business is, as one witness put it to the committee,</p><p>&#8220;pre-programmed down party political lines.&#8221;</p><p>A third members&#8217; business debate each week, which represents a 50 per cent increase in the time available for back-bench business, should increase the status of those debates.</p><p>The committee is proposing some further amendments to standing orders to allow procedures to work more easily and to make them easier to follow. For example, deadlines for the submission of questions are being aligned as far as possible. Taken as a whole, the reforms represent a significant evolution of the Parliament&#8217;s working practices and procedures. I believe that they will lead to a more responsive and accountable Parliament.</p><p>In introducing the proposals, I acknowledge the collaborative nature of the committee&#8217;s work and, in particular, the role of the Presiding Officer who, since her election last year, has played a key role in promoting the development of the Parliament as an institution. The committee has always shared the Presiding Officer&#8217;s aims of improving the topicality of parliamentary business and increasing the Parliament&#8217;s ability to respond quickly to emerging issues. The proposals, if approved by the Parliament, will go a long way towards achieving that.</p><p>The committee intends to keep a watching brief on how effective the parliamentary reforms prove to be and whether any further changes would be beneficial. The committee sees this as the start of a process that will run the full course of this session. We intend to look at the operation of committees and other matters after the summer recess.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, with its report on parliamentary reform, has begun an MOT of the Parliament&#8217;s procedures.

The proposed changes put in place a mechanism for the Parliament to communicate its views to the United Kingdom Parliament on European legislative proposals in areas of devolved interest. That gives the Parliament an opportunity to contribute to UK Parliament consideration of whether a proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity. When the UK Parliament considers that a proposal does not comply with that principle, it may, within eight weeks of the proposal being transmitted to it, submit to the European institutions a reasoned opinion setting out why the proposal does not comply. Under the strategy, the Scottish Parliament would be required to transmit its own views to Westminster before that deadline was reached.</p><p>To that end, a legislative proposal that has been identified within the Parliament as raising subsidiarity concerns will be referred to and considered by a lead committee. If the proposal falls within the remit of more than one committee, the bureau can designate a lead committee. If the committee agrees that the proposal raises subsidiarity concerns, it will be required to report to the Parliament and a motion to reflect the committee&#8217;s conclusion will be lodged by the convener for debate. The rules provide for the bureau to allocate such time for the debate as it considers appropriate. If the motion is agreed to, the opinion of the Parliament will be transmitted to the European committees at Westminster. However, it is recognised that the eight-week deadline for Westminster may mean that there is not sufficient time to complete the full procedure that I have just set out. In such cases, the draft rules allow for the lead committee&#8217;s concerns to be notified to the Westminster committees. Similarly, provision is made for notification on behalf of the committee to be provided if the Scottish Parliament is in recess for more than four days.</p><p>A rule change to require each subject committee and the Equal Opportunities Committee to appoint a European reporter is also included. A reporter would promote the European Union dimensions to a committee&#8217;s work and lead on early engagement on any issues emerging from Europe.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee intends to review the operation of the rules once relevant committees have had an opportunity to put them into practice. To ensure that the standing orders remain up to date, we are also replacing the now defunct term &#8220;European Communities&#8221; with &#8220;European Union&#8221;.</p><p>I turn to the minor standing order rule changes. The first change is a proposal to remove the requirement to consider statutory instruments that, although laid before the Parliament, are not subject to any form of parliamentary control. That was a consequence of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 and meant that lead committees had to consider instruments that they would not have had to consider prior to the implementation of the 2010 act. The change that is recommended by the committee removes that requirement while still enabling a subject committee to consider an instrument if it wishes to do so.</p><p>The second change is to alter the reporting deadline for the Subordinate Legislation Committee in relation to instruments that have a period of parliamentary consideration that is longer than the usual 40 days. On a previous occasion when an instrument with a longer consideration period had been laid, the Parliament decided to suspend rule 10.3.2 in relation to it. So that the Parliament does not have to suspend standing orders in that way in future, the committee proposes a rule change to require the SLC to report within a longer timeframe, subject to the consideration period that applies to the particular instrument.</p><p>The third change to standing orders is to remove the requirement for legislative consent memorandums to be printed when they are first published, given that they will in any case be printed as part of the lead committee&#8217;s report. By amending standing orders so that LCMs require only to be published, rather than printed and published, the Parliament will have flexibility in deciding whether it is necessary to print LCMs in addition to publishing them on the Parliament&#8217;s website.</p><p>Fourthly, rule 1.8.3 requires that members are consulted on the terms of a proposed resolution or determination to be made under the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Act 2006. Recent practical use of the rule highlighted that members essentially have to be consulted twice on the same thing. The proposed amendment will ensure that members will be consulted on the substantive content of any resolution or determination, but will not then have to be consulted again on the specific terms of the motion to agree that resolution or determination.</p><p>Finally, there are a number of references in standing orders to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That body was replaced by the United Kingdom Supreme Court under schedule 9 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, so the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee proposes an amendment to update those references.</p><p>On behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#8217;s 1st Report 2011 (Session 4), Minor Standing Orders Rule Changes (SP Paper 25) and 1st Report 2012 (Session 4), European Strategy (SP Paper 59), and agrees that changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A of the 1st Report 2011, other than those agreed to by motion S4M-01347, and in the annexe to this motion be made with effect from 20 August 2012.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668082", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Strategy and Minor Rule Changes"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The changes to the standing orders that are proposed by the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#8217;s report support the operation of the European strategy that has been developed by the European and External Relations Committee.

I share this dilemma with members to emphasise that we already live in a multilingual nation and that effective communication requires linguistic fluency from both the speaker and the listener.</p><p>Ensuring that our education system gives young Scots the linguistic toolbox to allow them to pick up second and third languages to fluency must be a priority&#8212;as has already been said&#8212;and I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to adopt the 1+2 Barcelona model of language learning for Scotland. The European Union is pushing for every person in the EU to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue because language learning helps to build communities and enables effective trading.</p><p>I do not need to stress that language acquisition must begin in childhood. On the back of the languages working group report, the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement that it will explore opportunities for all young people to start learning a second language in primary 1 is welcome.</p><p>Those of us who have tried to learn a language in adulthood&#8212;and who are still learning many years later&#8212;are downright jealous of schoolchildren who pick up languages as casually as they pick daisies in the summer. I believe that we will transform language learning in Scotland by giving five-year-olds first-class language tuition. With the tools to pick up languages, they will be ready to face the international world in adulthood and to represent Scotland on a global stage. If we are all agreed that bilingualism and even trilingualism&#8212;or more&#8212;are to be coveted, the question arises as to how we will get there.</p><p>In Scotland, we start with a distinct advantage in that we are already rich in languages, although in the past we, too, have been on the receiving end of obtrusive linguistic policies that have been far from beneficial to our cultural heritage. I am talking about the slow but enforced decline of our two native tongues, Gaelic and Scots. Our linguistic heritage should mean that we are even more sympathetic towards, and appreciative of, the benefits of multilingualism, but it should also mean that we are quick to protect and enjoy the indigenous languages of our nation.</p><p>Across the country, in 14 different councils, there are 2,316 primary school children in Gaelic-medium education. Every child who is educated in a Gaelic-medium school is fully bilingual by the age of 10, with the ability to read, write and speak fluently in at least two languages. Because many of the children are immersed in Gaelic from the age of three, they are confident in using the language both within the school gates and outside them. It is not just a school language; it is their language in much the way that English is. The growth of the Gaelic economy means that Gaelic can now be heard on the radio, seen in supermarkets and on road signs and read in the newspapers. It also has its own television channel. All of that reinforces the relevance of the language.</p><p>In February 2011, the curriculum for excellence Gaelic excellence group reported that modern language teachers in secondary schools were consistently impressed with the ability of Gaelic-medium educated pupils to acquire other languages. Those pupils appreciate the importance of languages, display confidence in picking up another language and find it easy to switch between languages. Surely, those are exactly the skills that we want to see in young Scots.</p><p>Gaelic speakers can pick up French, German, Spanish or any other language with confidence, appreciation and determination. There are many benefits of Gaelic-medium education. Yes&#8212;learning Gaelic means that one has a unique window on Scottish heritage, and it is a precious cultural gift, but I remind Parliament that learning a second language to fluency when one is still a child means acquiring the toolbox to pick up a third and a fourth language much more easily. I am not downplaying the importance of teaching and learning European languages or other languages in our schools and I do not believe that learning Gaelic is a substitute for that. However, Gaelic-medium education can be an essential building block in that learning. That could also be true of the Scots tongue. We have some way to go to bring it up to the level of Gaelic in literacy terms, but that is also a target to which we should aspire, because that would give us three immersion languages in our language toolbox.</p><p>In Scotland, we have a great gift that we do not appreciate enough in that we have an indigenous language that is distinct from English. That is an important point, because someone who is fluent in English and Gaelic&#8212;two languages whose structures are almost diametrically opposed&#8212;can master anything in between. We have an education system that provides our children with an excellent linguistic toolbox, and we have extensive exposure to the language in everyday life. In short, we have all the ingredients for effective language acquisition and we should all grasp the opportunity that that brings.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Th\u00f2isich mi a&#8217;sgr\u00ecobhadh m&#8217;\u00f2raid &#8217;s a Gh\u00e0idhlig ach cha robh mi cinnteach gun tuigidh sibh gu soilleir na thuirt mi &#8217;san eadar theangachadh.

David Lloyd George&#8217;s welfare reforms should be compulsory history reading for every school pupil, followed by a chapter on William Beveridge&#8217;s proposal for the welfare state and a chapter on Aneurin Bevan&#8217;s establishment of the national health service. I applaud those men for not being so obsessed with power as to be oblivious to injustice, or so concerned with Parliament as to forget the needs of the people.</p><p>However, there is one important chapter in the history books of welfare and social injustice that also needs to be read, and it is entitled &#8220;Sir John Dewar and the Highlands and Islands Medical Service&#8221;. This year, we celebrate the centenary of state-funded medical care because&#8212;contrary to popular belief&#8212;it was neither Beveridge nor Bevan who spearheaded the free, local and accessible healthcare system that we call the NHS. In fact, more than 30 years before that, the blueprint was drawn in the Highlands and Islands by the MP for Inverness-shire, Sir John Dewar.</p><p>At the turn of the 20th century, the Highlands and Islands were extremely impoverished; their inhabitants lived in poor conditions without access to transport, to medical services or even to adequate food. During his committee&#8217;s tour of the Highlands and Islands, Sir John Dewar conducted a series of meetings with local residents to ascertain the needs and requirements of the people&#8212;a bottom-up approach that we should emulate today. Sir John documented his findings in a report that became known as the Dewar report, and proposed the creation of the Highlands and Islands medical service.</p><p>The Highlands and Islands medical service enshrined three inspirational principles, which we still commend today: the right of every individual in society to local and accessible healthcare, the responsibility of the state to provide healthcare to every individual, regardless of their ability to pay, and the importance of delivering good-quality, well-organised and satisfactory medical services. Sir John&#8217;s recommendations were accepted in their entirety by the Government and they revolutionised medical care in remote and rural areas.</p><p>Historians accept that the Highlands and Islands medical service was well ahead of its time. By 1929, there were 175 nurses, 160 doctors and 150 practices in the Highlands and Islands, and in 1935, the first air ambulance service was established. In 1948, the national health service brought together services that had previously been provided by a combination of the Highlands and Islands medical service, charities and private organisations.</p><p>The NHS in Scotland has been very successful. I believe that that is because it has not deviated from the basic principles and values that were enshrined in the Dewar report. As NHS Scotland watches its southern sister suffer at the hands of a United Kingdom Government that does not seem to value the principles that were enshrined in the Dewar report, or to remember the history that gave birth to the NHS, we in Scotland can be relieved that the Scottish Government has a very different attitude.</p><p>The most appropriate way to celebrate Sir John Dewar, the Dewar report and the Highlands and Islands medical service is to continue the good work that was begun 100 years ago. As we consider how to protect and improve medical services throughout Scotland, we already have the foundation of having an exceptionally good model on which to build; as we update the NHS to meet the demands and needs of the 21st century, we must not discard the building blocks of the Dewar report. The NHS in Scotland must still be accessible to every individual in society, irrespective of geographical location, ability to pay or medical needs.</p><p>It is because of my firm belief in free and accessible local healthcare that I lodged a parliamentary motion on the centenary of the Dewar report. In my constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, there are many remote and rural communities that bring challenges to delivery of healthcare, just as they did in Sir John Dewar&#8217;s day.</p><p>Last year, I spoke to Dr Stephen McCabe, who is a doctor based in Portree&#8212;I think that he is in the gallery today. He has been active in promoting the centenary, as have Dr Miles Mack of Dingwall and Dr Jim Douglas of Fort William, who are also constituents of mine. Indeed, the Dewar committee is holding a reception after the debate, to which all members are cordially invited. Dr McCabe told me that many of the issues that Sir John Dewar highlighted in 1912 were still evident when he came to Skye in 1996 and are still evident. The challenges include lack of employment opportunities, poor public transport, poor housing and rural poverty. Although many of the issues are masked by a stunningly beautiful landscape and hard-working people, Dr McCabe comes face to face with the challenges of healthcare provision in remote and rural communities every single day.</p><p>Many communities in my constituency have the same problems as Skye has. Just this week, I have raised with NHS Highland the difficulty of retaining medical staff in Ardnamurchan, following the resignation of the two general practitioners and the practice manager at Acharacle, partly because of the problems of providing a GP service in such a remote and sparsely populated area.</p><p>In Scotland in the 21st century, we need to ensure that we stay true to the foundations of the national health service. We must be careful not to overlook rural medical needs in favour of urban environments, in the rush to make savings. We need to ensure that medical care is easily accessible, while taking into account the longer and more expensive travel that is required in remote areas. We must work hard to deliver health services that are fit for purpose with adequate resources and professional staff.</p><p>Protecting, improving and providing medical care in Scotland requires a collaborative relationship between healthcare professionals and politicians. I value that relationship with doctors and healthcare professionals in my constituency and I hope that, together, we can build up our health services to a standard that would surprise even Sir John Dewar with their accessibility, efficiency and quality.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666839", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dewar Report (Centenary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the first few decades of the previous century, a Welsh MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced a string of reforms that tackled social inequality and delivered welfare provision to men and women across the country.

As the cabinet secretary said, it represents a missed opportunity for Scotland, and it has been overtaken by the real debate on the referendum on independence. I suppose that the only saving grace is that the repatriation to Westminster of powers over things such as health professionals, corporate insolvency and the registration of social landlords has been abandoned and some of the risk that the original bill would have posed to our public finances has been removed.</p><p>We are also to get the power to set the drink-drive limit and the national speed limit, but even those powers have been tainted by Westminster's pathological reluctance to cede power. We are getting only the power to set the drink-drive limit, not legislative devolution over drink driving; and we are getting only the power to set the national speed limit, not the power to set limits for vehicles such as lorries.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is a welcome debate. Hopefully, it will allow us to move forward on drink-driving limits, which is a matter that I have been pursuing since I was elected in 2007. I believe that the drink-driving limit should be reduced from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg. Of course, in December 2008, the Parliament voted to back that measure. As that was more than three years ago, members might therefore ask why a reduction in the drink-drive limit in Scotland has not yet happened. The answer is simple. Westminster has dragged its feet on the matter&#8212;or maybe, as Willie Rennie would say, that is all part of the process.</p><p>As with the Scotland Bill, the UK Government has a poor record on this issue. Before the 1997 election, and again in 1998, the Labour Party announced that it intended to reduce the legal limit to 50mg. That was nearly 15 years ago. However, in March 2000, the UK Government announced that it had decided not to lower the limit, because it was awaiting possible moves to harmonise drink-driving limits in the European Union.</p><p>In January 2001, the EU adopted a recommendation to harmonise the drink-driving level at 50mg or less. However, that was not binding on member states, and the UK announced in 2002 that it had no plans to change the limit. That was the position until early in 2007, when the second review of the UK Government's road safety strategy was published. It stated that the case for a reduction in the blood alcohol limit would again be kept under review.</p><p>As with the Scotland Bill, there has been a great deal of prevarication, and the process is a good example of what Westminster does when it does not really want to do something. In June 2007, the UK minister with responsibility for road safety, Stephen Ladyman, offered some hope to those of us who want a reduction in the limit by saying again that the UK Government was in favour of moving to a 50mg limit but it first wanted to see evidence that it would be properly enforced by the police. Later in 2007, he said that the Government would publish a consultation paper to gauge public opinion on reducing the limit.</p><p>No consultation paper appeared, so I continued to press the Department for Transport, which eventually told me, early in 2008, that it was pressing ahead with the consultation document and that it would give careful consideration to the views of interested parties in Scotland and elsewhere.</p><p>We heard nothing more until November 2008, when the road safety compliance consultation informed us that, once again, the drink-driving limit was to be kept under review and that more time was needed in which to collect evidence. That is more evidence of the Westminster process&#8212;dragging its heels to avoid doing things that it does not want to do.</p><p>A further consultation came out in April 2009, which led to a statement in December 2009 that there may, indeed, be a case for reforming the current legal framework covering drink driving but&#8212;wait for it&#8212;further advice was needed from an independent expert who would report by the end of March 2010.</p><p>Of course, he never did, and Labour lost the UK general election that year and the Tories and Liberal Democrats took over. Since then, there has been no progress, as they have continued the pattern of prevarication established by Labour by insisting that we must wait for the Scotland Bill.</p><p>In recent years, several EU countries have reduced their limits to 50mg, including France, Germany, Spain, Denmark and, just last year, Ireland. Of the 27 states, 24 now have a limit of 50mg or less. That leaves only Malta and Luxembourg&#8212;two huge European states&#8212;and the UK with an 80mg limit.</p><p>There has been no need for such a delay. Even Sir Kenneth Calman, the father of the Scotland Bill, said, a few years ago:</p><p>&#8220;I think there are lots of bits ... which ... can be implemented quickly and easily without too much fuss&#8221;.</p><p>That included the drink-driving limits, which could have been implemented by administrative order two years ago. However, we have had to wait for the bill to get to where we are today. Given that there are 15 deaths a year in accidents involving drivers whose blood alcohol level is between 50mg and 80mg, that prevarication has probably cost 30 lives. The Westminster Government has played politics with those people&#8217;s lives and should be ashamed of itself.</p><p>Once the bill is approved, I would hope that the Scottish Government would implement a reduction in the drink-drive limit as soon as possible, along with random breath testing. I look forward to everyone in the chamber getting behind that and to the resulting reduction in the number of deaths on Scotland&#8217;s roads.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scotland Bill is a wishy-washy, paler than pale imitation of even devo max or devo plus, never mind real home rule under independence.

We in Scotland are on the cusp of harnessing great potential in renewable energy. The waves and the wind are powerful, particularly along our coastline. My constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch also has huge potential for tidal energy. Nowhere is that more clear than at the proposed site for an 8MW, &#163;40 million tidal power development in the Kyle Rhea narrows between Skye and the mainland, which could generate annual revenues of between &#163;5.5 million and &#163;135 million over its 25-year lifespan.</p><p>However, as the wind turbines, wave machines and tidal generators go up, so does the cost of living in rural coastal communities. One could be forgiven for presuming that coastal communities are well placed to reap the benefits of the natural resource as a little bit of compensation. That could be true, but before local communities or anyone else can harness the force of the sea and the resultant income, they need permission in the form of a lease from the Crown Estate, which pockets the money. As a constituent said to me, &#8220;We&#8217;ve had the clearances, the sheep, the forestry and the hydro, and the money that was promised to communities has gone absent without leave every time. Will it be the same with tidal projects?&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Affairs Committee answered the question, at least in part, in its report in March, in which it concluded that</p><p>&#8220;the responsibilities for the administration and revenues of the ancient Crown property&#8221;</p><p>should no longer lie with the Crown Estate Commissioners but should be devolved, as David Stewart said. However, the committee also said that handing the responsibilities to Holyrood would not address the fundamental problems and instead recommended further decentralisation of the powers</p><p>&#8220;to local authority and local community levels&#8221;.</p><p>I whole-heartedly concur.</p><p>For the coastal communities in my constituency, the Scottish Affairs Committee report is therefore excellent news. It says what all rural communities said over the past few centuries when the heavy burden of tax fell on them but they got no benefit from revenues that were raised locally, and when investment and development in their areas did nothing to improve people&#8217;s standard of living.</p><p>In the current situation, in which the price of fuel and energy is high and jobs are scarce, it is crucial that fragile communities reap the benefits of their own natural resources. The question is, will London allow them to do so? That does not look likely, which is unfortunate. Independence is the only answer.</p><p>On a slightly different tack, the Glenelg and Arnisdale Development Trust&#8217;s plans will enable communities to take a stake in the &#163;40 million tidal energy scheme that I mentioned. The plans have secured the First Minister&#8217;s approval and Highlands and Islands Enterprise&#8217;s assistance and have been welcomed by the developer, Marine Current Turbines. I look forward to progress on the project. After this debate, I will attend a meeting with HIE on renewables, just round the corner from the Parliament. I will press the agency on where it has got to with the project.</p><p>It is hoped that the Glenelg and Arnisdale project will be a pilot for a community ownership scheme, which can then be used by communities up and down the country. Glenelg and Arnisdale Development Trust envisages that revenues that are generated by its stakeholding will be ploughed back into a community renewable development fund, which will fund community investment in local green energy projects. It will also provide capital for other communities who want to develop renewable energy schemes. As surpluses build up, the cash will be used for regeneration projects. That is exactly the sort of approach that we must develop, so that local communities can benefit from marine development that affects them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Estate (Devolution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to take part in the debate, which I congratulate Dave Stewart on securing.

In my time in the islands, from 1973 to 1983, I remember the Lewis branch of the SNP proposing an RET at SNP conferences, and the party adopting it as our policy. I do not remember the Labour Party making any attempt to introduce an RET, although it had many opportunities to do so. Nor do I remember the Labour Party and the Lib Dems making any attempt to introduce an RET when they were in power in the Parliament from 1999 to 2007.</p><p>Indeed, when the SNP Government proposed an RET, Labour&#8217;s Des McNulty said that the RET plans were</p><p>&#8220;unfair, discriminatory and politically motivated.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 10 September 2008; c 10624.]</p><p>Earlier, the then Lib Dem transport minister, Nicol Stephen, said:</p><p>&#8220;It is far from certain that road-equivalent tariffs would benefit communities such as those in the Western Isles, because the longer ferry routes could well be more expensive as a result&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 6 May 2004; c 8174.]</p><p>So much for Labour and Lib Dem support for RET. Between them, Labour and the Lib Dems did everything that they could to prevent RET from being introduced and now they cry crocodile tears over a system that they never wanted in the first place.</p><p>Since the SNP Government introduced RET in 2007, it has proved to be a fantastic success story for Scotland and our island communities. For locals and visitors alike, RET has narrowed the straits between islands and the mainland by lowering the costs of ferry travel.</p><p>The figures in the RET final evaluation report tell part of the story. Passenger travel increased by 20 per cent and the number of cars using the ferries rocketed by 31 per cent. We need only to chat to a Leodhasach to see that the success of RET is more than a statistic. It has made life in the islands easier and better. Room occupancy has increased by 24 per cent and there is evidence that the tourism season has been extended. The number of tourism businesses has increased by 10 per cent.</p><p>Because of that, in November 2011, I was delighted to hear that the Scottish Government intended to continue with RET in keeping with our manifesto pledge. We will also extend RET to routes all along the west coast of Scotland. It will apply to cars, passengers, vans and other vehicles under 6m in a time of severe budget constraint. That shows a commitment to our smaller, more rural communities that can often slip off the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s radar. For commercial vehicles, however, the Government is replacing RET with a new transitional relief scheme that is worth &#163;2.5 million. Keith Brown, the transport minister, has met transport groups and said that he will keep the situation under review.</p><p>The Government has promised to preserve RET as a permanent feature of ferry travel to the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree. Its ambitious plan is to extend RET to Harris, Barra, Colonsay, Islay, Gigha, and then to Arran. Following that, it will cover Raasay, Mallaig, Armadale, Kilchoan, Lochaline and the Small Isles, all of which are in my constituency. That will help to secure and develop all those routes and is very welcome. The ferries review is being undertaken at the moment and I have had positive responses from the minister in relation to that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661526", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Equivalent Tariff (Commercial Vehicles)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I lived for 10 years on the Isle of Lewis and I travelled extensively to and from and up and down the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra and Vatersay.

With all due respect to the railway network, it takes just a split second for an e-mail to make the same journey. Much commerce and business is now conducted electronically, without the need for face-to-face contact, which greatly reduces costs. Good access to broadband allows Highland businesses and organisations to compete with those in the central belt and indeed across the world. Schools can enjoy the educational benefits of being online and people can keep up to date with friends and family on the other side of the globe.</p><p>However, many thousands of homes in Scotland do not have access to good, reliable and fast broadband, and many of them are in my constituency. This is a serious problem for Scotland&#8217;s economic growth and productivity because a great percentage of Scotland&#8217;s small and medium-sized enterprises are in the currently broadband-deficient Highlands.</p><p>This week, I was contacted by Iain Blois, who lives and works in my constituency. His work requires him to be able to download files, purchase goods and services online and fill in web-based applications. He lives 3 miles from Beauly, which is a small town close to Inverness, so the population density is not as low as it is in many other parts of the Highlands. Nevertheless, he wrote to say that the broadband speed is only 0.34 megabits per second. That means that a one-minute BBC news clip aborts with the message &#8220;Insufficient speed&#8221;.</p><p>The home of another constituent of mine, Henry Mennie, is categorised as &#8220;out of reach&#8221; of the exchange server. He lives on the Black Isle, less than 5 miles away from the exchange in Dingwall and just over the firth from Inverness. We therefore have problems even close to Inverness, but many of my constituents are much more remote than that. My constituency has a low population density, which means that it usually slides off the map of market-led digital provision, but digital inclusion is essential for us; indeed, it is even more essential for us than for those who live in urban Scotland.</p><p>The dangers of the digital divide are self-evident. Without equality of broadband provision across Scotland, businesses in rural areas are uncompetitive, school leavers migrate to the cities, and there is limited economic growth. In a 2009 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it was shown that a 10 per cent increase in broadband results in a 1 per cent increase in GDP. For the sake of my constituents and Scotland, we must ensure that the digital divide does not widen any further; indeed, we must endeavour to narrow it.</p><p>Fortunately, that has been recognised by the Scottish Government, which has set out to deliver world-class broadband to all by 2020. I welcome its ambition, and congratulate it on its publication of &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s Digital Future&#8212;Infrastructure Action Plan&#8221;, which acknowledges that there are particular challenges in delivering broadband infrastructure in rural areas but nevertheless pledges to address those issues and ensure that the broadband roll-out in Scotland matches the UK average. We have already heard that the Royal Society of Edinburgh has said that it has not come across such ambition before. We need ambition in this country and the ability to meet it, which will come fully with independence, of course.</p><p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise is planning to roll out superfast broadband across my constituency and the region, as the cabinet secretary has said. Work will begin in 2013, which is to be warmly welcomed. That work will cover the length and breadth of the region and 125,000 premises, of which 11,000 will be business premises. The roll-out must ensure universality in the provision of broadband, and I have pressed Highlands and Islands Enterprise to guarantee that. In areas of low population density, superfast broadband is very expensive, as fibre optic requires a sufficient concentration of subscribers per cabinet to make it economically viable. Therefore, alternative solutions must be considered for many consumers in my constituency.</p><p>A number of solutions have already been mentioned. One solution is wireless broadband, of course, which includes mobile broadband, 4G and satellite, and which can be deployed quickly and cheaply.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660613", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadband"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At the start of every week, I spend four hours travelling to Edinburgh from my constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

Alternatively, there is Wonga.com, Mr Buck or the Money Shop. All those pay day loan companies promise to pour plentiful pennies into your bank account without asking many questions. It matters not whether you have a good credit rating or any real ability to pay, so for the 9 million people in the UK who do not have access to mainstream credit, it seems like the perfect solution. What could you want in your Christmas stocking more than a quick and easy loan?</p><p>Of course, Christmas has come and gone, but for many people the repercussions of buying Christmas presents on a pay day loan will continue indefinitely as extortionate interest rates make repayments impossible. The interest on loans from Christmascashloans.com is a conservative 1,940.5 per cent. Wonga.com, on the other hand, has a representative APR of 4,214 per cent.</p><p>The recent report from R3, which is mentioned in Margaret Burgess&#8217;s motion, highlights the rapid increase in pay day loans. The report states that 45 per cent of those who were questioned struggled to make it to pay day. As a result, pay day lenders are attracting higher numbers of customers, but short-term relief fades quickly. In my constituency, more and more desperate constituents are drowning in the deep sea of debt. One young lady on the Isle of Skye owes money to no fewer than five pay day lenders and the interest on her loans is escalating out of control. Unable to pay, she is being harassed by threats and demands for payment. It is ironic that she resides in an area where there are no pay day loan shops.</p><p>A local independent debt advice service called Christians Against Poverty told me that very few of the debt disasters that it witnesses are caused by irresponsible or negligent behaviour by the customer. Often, people are struggling to pay for life&#8217;s necessities. Recently, Citizens Advice Scotland joined Shelter in expressing concern at the number of people who are taking out pay day loans to avoid homelessness. Last week, Shelter published evidence showing that 2 per cent of the UK population admitted to paying their rent or mortgage using a pay day loan, and Shelter Scotland confirmed that trend in Scotland. Pay day loans are a dream today but a nightmare tomorrow for my constituents who find themselves in dire straits.</p><p>There is an alternative to pay day lenders, which Margaret Burgess mentioned: credit unions. The Lochaber, Inverness and HI-Scot credit unions operate across Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. I encourage everyone to join, as I have done myself. Credit unions are not just for people who have poor wages&#8212;they are for everyone in society, because we can all help each other by using them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658774", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-interest Pay Day Loans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Margaret Burgess on bringing the debate to the chamber.

In my constituency, and throughout the Highlands and Islands, the issue of high fuel prices has long been contentious. Although the Greenock Telegraph feature that is mentioned in Stuart McMillan&#8217;s motion serves to highlight price discrepancies between filling stations, the issue in the Highlands is not so much that retailers are profiteering but that Westminster is cashing in by taking too much tax from the motorist and that fuel prices in rural areas are higher than they are in towns and cities.</p><p>Recognising that, Lib Dem MP Danny Alexander based much of his 2010 re-election campaign on promises to take action on the issue. Of course, his re-election was successful and he is now chief secretary to the Treasury with power to act and nowhere to hide, unlike his Lib Dem colleagues in the Scottish Parliament who are all hiding tonight&#8212;there is not a single one of them in the chamber&#8212;unless of course Murdo Fraser is a proxy Lib Dem for the coalition parties. I see from the horrified look on his face that he is not.</p><p>Danny Alexander tried to implement a little bit of his promise and, this autumn, after months of delays and excuses, island motorists heard that next year they will see a small reduction in the price of their fuel.</p><p>Although any reduction in the cost of fuel is welcome in areas in which the use of a car is essential, I am afraid that the impact of the 5p cut in the limited geographical area in which it has been delivered has only made the price a little bit less exorbitant. It is still much higher than the price that we see in other parts of the country. In Skye, the 5p off is welcome, but it must be balanced against growing public anger throughout mainland Highland that the Lib Dems have failed to deliver on their main pledge to have cheaper petrol in rural areas, which persuaded so many to trust them with their votes.</p><p>Earlier this year, I was contacted by several independent filling stations on the west Highland mainland who feared that cut-price competition on Skye would fatally undermine their business. For instance, today, at 140.9p per litre, there is no difference between the price of petrol at the pumps in Broadford on Skye and at pumps in Inverinate, which is just 20 miles away on the mainland. Diesel is actually a penny cheaper in Broadford. With the fuel discount, the difference would be 5p for petrol and 6p for diesel, with the mainland filling stations being disadvantaged.</p><p>In October, I wrote to Mr Alexander to make the case for applying the discount to all disadvantaged rural areas. Sadly, that commonsense approach appears to have been beyond him, as he rejected my call. My letter to him suggested a two-stage roll-out of a rural petrol discount programme, to be applied initially to the west Highlands, to tackle the issue of uneven competition that is feared by those petrol retailers close to the fuel discount area, and then to all rural areas.</p><p>However, that would need to be supplemented by implementation of the SNP&#8217;s long-standing policy to have a fuel duty regulator for all areas, which would reduce the Government&#8217;s tax take from fuel sales as prices rose, to allow the maintenance of stable prices at the pumps.</p><p>Given that Scotland is the European Union&#8217;s largest oil producer, it is surely not too much to expect our citizens at least to have stability in the cost of their fuel, even if they pay a higher price for petrol than people in almost the entire continent.</p><p>The newspaper feature that is referred to in Stuart McMillan&#8217;s motion sounds like an example of the reliable information that is needed to enable the fuel market to operate efficiently, and it should help to equalise prices in the Inverclyde area.

As a former director of protective services I have some experience in regulatory matters. I declare an interest, in that I am still a vice-president of the UK Trading Standards Institute.</p><p>There is good regulation and there is bad regulation. Business often calls for regulation to protect good business against bad business. There are also good regulators and poor regulators. What regulators often lack is common sense. One of the things that I always applied, and which I encouraged my staff to apply, when enforcing various regulations was that it is possible to turn a blind eye. That is how good regulators do their job. Good regulation and good regulators protect consumers and honest businesses. Anti-counterfeiting laws are a good example of protection for honest businesses.</p><p>There are problems with the trading standards service in Scotland. Consumer Focus Scotland has responded to the consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the consumer landscape by saying:</p><p>&#8220;Because many Scottish councils are much smaller than their English counterparts, trading standards services are often tiny, isolated and marginalized, leaving them struggling to deliver a full range of services to the public. As recognised in the UK Government&#8217;s consultation paper this creates the potential for a gap in enforcement. However, the Scottish Government has no legislative locus to require councils to collaborate ... We would therefore suggest that an adjustment to legislative powers to give an administrative role here for the Scottish Government would add value for Scotland&#8217;s consumers.&#8221;</p><p>The problems with trading standards are also borne out by the chief executive of the Trading Standards Institute, who commented on the report published last month by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, saying:</p><p>&#8220;The cross-party group of MPs on the Committee had just delivered a devastating analysis and verdict on the state of our UK system for enforcing consumer law. Its references to trading standards &#8216;enforcement deserts&#8217; where councils do not provide the funds required to maintain an adequate trading standards service provided a clear indictment of such councils.</p><p>When linked with the MPs&#8217; criticism of government in failing to establish clear arrangements for who does what and how to protect consumers; the inadequate infrastructure for dealing with cross-border consumer malpractice; crime and enforcement; the lack of sufficient power; expertise and money to enable trading standards and others to tackle major and emerging cases of consumer fraud and detriment; it all reads as a sorry state of affairs.&#8221;</p><p>I wrote to the minister in October commenting on the BIS proposals to change the consumer landscape by disbanding the Office of Fair Trading and Consumer Focus Scotland and transferring some of those powers to citizens advice bureaux and some to local authorities. That is all very well, but those bodies need the resources to be able to do the work. At the moment, local authorities are not doing what they should be doing already, even before they have more responsibilities put on them.</p><p>I support the retention of Consumer Focus Scotland, which does a good job in a number of different areas and receives the majority of its funding from the private sector. I ask the minister to consider killing two birds with one stone, with a unique Scottish solution to the issues raised in the BIS consultation. Rather than abolish Consumer Focus Scotland, I would strengthen it by giving it responsibility for the management of the trading standards service in Scotland and by designating it as the local weights and measures authority for Scotland, rather than leaving that to individual local authorities. That would fit well with some of its current responsibilities in relation to regulation.</p><p>Effectively, the proposal would create a Scottish trading standards service, which I envision would have a number of strong regional offices while being able to use economies of scale to deal with specialist areas across Scotland. The problem at the moment is that there are 32 councils enforcing trading standards legislation&#8212;there used to be 12, prior to local government reorganisation. The people are spread far too thinly and the range of responsibilities and duties is far too great.</p><p>In his reply to me, the minister said that such a change might need devolution of powers. However, Consumer Focus has identified another way, which it has recommended in a briefing. It says that, rather than amending the Scotland Bill or the Scotland Act 1998, the most straightforward way to achieve the proposal would be</p><p>&#8220;to make an Order in Council under section 63 of the Scotland Act 1998 to provide for the functions that are listed in Schedule 5 Part II Section C7 (consumer protection) to be exercisable by Scottish Ministers concurrently with UK ministers.&#8221;</p><p>That solution would allow for the delineation of responsibility to be clarified not through the legislation itself but through discussion and agreement between Scottish and UK ministers. It is Consumer Focus&#8217;s understanding that any agreement and arrangement so arrived at may be reviewed administratively at agreed times. I ask the minister to seriously consider that course of action, so that we have a fit-for-purpose trading standards service in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to take part in the debate.

That might sound like a silly question or a reference to Sorley, the great Gaelic poet from my constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, but it is a very serious question. It is exactly the type of query on which lives may depend following Westminster&#8217;s decision to close two of Scotland&#8217;s five coastguard maritime rescue co-ordination centres. Clyde coastguards will know the answer, as Maclean&#8217;s Nose lies within the patch that they have covered for years. It is a promontory into the Sound of Mull opposite Tobermory, to be found on the southern edge of the Ardnamurchan peninsula, within my constituency, and about halfway between Kilchoan and Ardslignish. The precise location of Maclean&#8217;s Nose is just one of the thousands of extra pieces of local knowledge that coastguards who take over Clyde coastguard&#8217;s responsibilities will need to know immediately if mariners or coastal walkers who are in difficulty are to be assisted.</p><p>In its report on &#8220;The Coastguard, Emergency Towing Vessels and the Maritime Incident Response Group&#8221;, which was published in June, the Westminster Transport Committee said:</p><p>&#8220;Our main concern about safety is the loss of local knowledge amongst coastguard officers that will inevitably occur under these proposals. Rationalising the number of MRCCs so drastically, in our view, will reduce the quality and rate of exchange of information, particularly at key points when information needs to be passed swiftly in order to save lives.&#8221;</p><p>In addition to the huge number of ferries, fishing vessels and bulk-cargo vessels that can be found off our west coast every day, there has been an increase in leisure traffic, as a result of the area&#8217;s justified reputation for stunning scenery and good sailing. There are also regular military manoeuvres. That gives an indication of how busy the coastguard is and how serious the implications of any shipping incident could be.</p><p>The announcement that Aberdeen, Shetland and Stornoway will remain as 24-hour co-ordination centres is good news and does credit to the hard-fought campaigns for the centres&#8217; retention. However, the centres have been left with a heavy burden and the daunting responsibility for providing maritime safety cover for dozens of islands and thousands of miles of coastline that were previously the responsibility of the co-ordination centre at Greenock.</p><p>The Stornoway team&#8217;s role increased as recently as 2000, when the last round of Westminster cuts resulted in the closure of coastguard centres at Oban and at Belfast, across the Irish Sea. The extra section of rugged Argyll and Clyde coast includes countless small islands, sea lochs and headlands, many of which have similar or identical names to features that are in the team&#8217;s current patch. The challenge of picking up responsibility for a vastly increased area is made all the more difficult when we take into account that the Clyde coastguard at Greenock is Scotland&#8217;s busiest. There is a huge volume of leisure craft in the area and there were more than 1,400 incidents in 2010.</p><p>The scale of the task that faces the reduced coastguard presence will be even greater as a result of Westminster&#8217;s announcement of the scrapping of the RAF&#8217;s fleet of long-range Nimrod search and rescue aircraft. Moreover, the contract to operate the emergency tugs that are stationed around our coast has been awarded only on an interim basis, as members said. Over the years, the tugs have helped to avert many catastrophes on a scale that can hardly be imagined, by coming to the aid of shipping when power was lost in the treacherous waters of the Minch.</p><p>The area is well known to me. I lived and worked in the Western Isles for 10 years and I have had many an interesting trip, courtesy of local ferries, local fishing boats and, occasionally, a small yacht. I recall one occasion&#8212;in the late 1970s, I think&#8212;when, on a near-perfect day, with a flat-calm Minch, the ferry hit the rocks as it came into Tarbert on Harris, tearing an 8ft hole in the hull. We were fortunate to get into harbour safely. However, every vehicle on the car deck, including mine, had been shunted, front and rear, and I ended up with an expensive repair bill&#8212;it had to be met by yours truly because the law back then allowed ferry operators to do what they liked with passengers and their property.</p><p>I think that that accident was caused by a navigation error, but the incident shows how easy it is for something to go wrong, even in near-perfect conditions. If on just one occasion a tug is not able to reach one of the hundreds of bulk tankers or nuclear submarines that might be in difficulty in the Minch, the consequences will be unthinkable.</p><p>John Hermse, secretary of the Mallaig and North West Fishermen&#8217;s Association, told me this week:</p><p>&#8220;Our main concern is the loss of local knowledge.

They soon had me practising CPR on the mannequin&#8212;which did not, for some reason, like my kiss of life.</p><p>In a matter of weeks those teenagers had learned the skills to use a defibrillator and to administer basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When it comes to a matter of life and death, those youngsters will be well prepared.</p><p>The pupils who demonstrated their skills in the Scottish Parliament last month are part of a much larger group at Portree high school. Heartstart Skye&#8212;the team of volunteers that provide the training&#8212;has not been given a moment&#8217;s peace by those pupils since the programme started.</p><p>In April this year, 145 Portree pupils were presented with certificates for completing a short course in basic emergency support. However, the keen pupils are not resting on their laurels&#8212;instead, they have invited the training team back to train the current fifth-year pupils. The hope for the future is to train first-year and second-year pupils so that by fifth year, pupils will need only a refresher course. Portree high school is a case study of the benefits of incorporating ELS into the school curriculum. Basic training can save lives. In Skye more than 200 pupils are now able to use their training to save a life, which is crucial in a rural community where an ambulance can take up to 20 or 30 minutes, or more, to arrive.</p><p>The initiative is not just a case of imposing another subject on children in an already-packed school syllabus. It is about giving them vital life skills to serve their communities, and about enabling them to care for family members, friends and strangers in a very real way. It is about tapping into their innate compassion and concern for humanity. To top it off, they actually enjoy it. They feel useful and valuable, which is fundamental in developing a child&#8217;s character.</p><p>The deputy headteacher of Portree high school, Kenny MacDonald, is a strong advocate of teaching ELS in schools, because he has seen that it is vital. When he taught at a school in Johnstone, CPR training was on the curriculum. Of those who received it, one boy had to use CPR on his grandfather and another two boys helped to revive a man who had taken ill while fishing. If only one student is able to use it, surely the training is worth while.</p><p>One of the key organisations behind the work of Portree high school is Lucky2BHere. The charity has three aims: community empowerment, education and co-operation. Since its birth in 2007, Lucky2BHere has placed defibrillators across Skye and Lochalsh and it is expanding into other communities.</p><p>The training starts when the community engages with the initiative. Communities are encouraged to raise contributory funds through healthy activities. Free emergency life-support training is then provided by volunteers of Skye heartstart team. Finally, a defibrillator is placed in a central location that is accessible to all.</p><p>Our schools are training, equipping and resourcing the next generation of Scots. Our hope for Scotland&#8217;s future is to see healthier, safer and more caring communities.

That rule can cause difficulties to parties, particularly the smaller ones, when they are trying to find substitutes for a number of parliamentary committees.

It is estimated that a billion copies have been printed since 1611, and the man responsible for it was none other than the king of Scots, James VI of Scotland. In recognition of his work, the book is known as the King James Bible. The Bible&#8217;s transformative influence is more entrenched in Scotland than just in relation to its multiple literary editions. The Bible is at the very heart of our history. It is the cornerstone of our society.</p><p>Neither our politics nor our culture, and neither our education nor our religion would be the same without the King James Bible. The sweeping scenes of Scotland&#8217;s history have been performed on a scriptural stage against the backdrop of biblical belief. As a nation, the Bible has directed our movements, our behaviours and our beliefs. It is the script at the heart of history and at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s history.</p><p>Many have pored over it, reading, writing and realising that there is priceless treasure contained within its pages. The glorious speeches of the past few centuries envisioning democracy and equality are suffused in the cadences of the King James Bible. The Bible is the bedrock on which we have built our past, but will it be the foundations of our future?</p><p>The King James Bible is a prophet without honour in the country of its birth. It has all but disappeared from our schools, our media and our Parliament. The key player in our past, the great motivator of our people and the foundation stone of our values and ideals is hardly anywhere to be seen. However, the question is, at what cost?</p><p>This year the Scottish Bible Society decided to bring the Bible back. In June, an initiative known as the people&#8217;s Bible was launched. Its purpose was to produce a Bible written by the people for the people. This they have done, and earlier today a bound copy of Genesis was presented by representatives of the Scottish Bible Society at Westminster Abbey in the presence of the royal family.</p><p>The people&#8217;s Bible has travelled the length and breadth of Scotland, with members of the public encouraged to handwrite two verses of the Bible, until all 66 books were written.</p><p>More than 5,500 miles have been covered since June, taking in an awesome 60 towns and cities in Scotland. What has been uncovered so far? One primary 7 pupil had never seen a Bible before. Another 20-something man stopped short when he saw the exhibition stand and asked, in all seriousness, &#8220;What is a Bible?&#8221; The Bible Society has found a new generation to whom they are bringing the Bible.</p><p>At the beginning of the last century, the American President, Theodore Roosevelt, heralded the Bible as</p><p>&#8220;the most democratic book in the world&#8221;,</p><p>and so it still is. Scots from diverse backgrounds have penned their verses. Cameron Scott, the former &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; winner, wrote his verses in Orkney. A young girl from a council estate wrote hers in Glasgow. A grand total of more than 18,400 verses have been written in Scotland. Those verses, in the handwriting of the people who contributed to the project, will appear online for all to read in perpetuity. That thought caused one terminally ill gentleman to weep. He was overcome that his handwriting would be there for all to see, for all time.</p><p>The Scottish Bible Society claims that there has never been a better time to get into the Bible. With that in mind, it has republished the Bible in several new formats. There is one for new readers, selling at 99p and readable in an hour, and there is the old-style King James version, with a foreword by the Prince of Wales. Now, there is also the people&#8217;s Bible. The Bible is accessible to all. It is the great leveller of society. Roosevelt&#8217;s statement stands true.</p><p>The preface of the first edition of the King James translation reads:</p><p>&#8220;Translation it is that openeth the window, to let in the light&#8221;.</p><p>Eighty years of struggle and several martyrs were the labour pains that birthed an English edition of the Bible. Having the Bible in a comprehensible language is a privilege that we have forgotten. It is a prize that we no longer treasure. However, through the people&#8217;s Bible, some people have discovered the Bible and others have rediscovered it. One lady in Dundee returned to church after writing her verses; another chose to check out Christianity for the first time.</p><p>No matter their background, people are being touched by the verses that they write. An ex-alcoholic who stumbled upon the people&#8217;s Bible exhibition at the Mitchell library in Glasgow was on his way to buy a bottle of vodka. Persuaded to write a verse or two, he stopped and chatted to the volunteers. He bought a burger instead. Another gentleman walking along Princes Street in Edinburgh was invited to write a couple of verses. He obliged. His story spilled out to the volunteer&#8212;a story of brokenness, addiction and homelessness. He finished by saying that writing those verses was an acknowledgement that, in the midst of suffering, there was light.</p><p>The word of God has shaped the Scottish people, and the people&#8217;s Bible has put the Bible back in Scotland&#8217;s history books. The general public have come into touching distance of this historic and inspired book. As society dips and dives into secularism, as fewer go to church and as public institutions distance themselves from faith groups, the Bible has not lost its transformative impact on our nation and Scotland has not lost its need for the word of God.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654915", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: People&#8217;s Bible"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This year marks the 400th anniversary of the bestselling English language book of all time.

It is an important and serious issue, as many people across Scotland and the UK suffer because of rogue traders.</p><p>I declare an interest. I am a vice-president of the UK Trading Standards Institute and I spent many years as a professional trading standards officer, so I have some experience in this field.</p><p>From listening to members&#8217; speeches, it is obvious that the problems are widespread. Quite a spread of members have spoken in the debate, which shows that the problems are spread across the whole country and all the constituencies.</p><p>Margo MacDonald made a point about cooling-off periods. There are cooling-off periods in place in relation to unannounced callers coming to people&#8217;s houses and getting them to sign up for things. If the value is more than &#163;35, people have seven days to cool off. Perhaps not a lot of folk know that. That is the sort of information that we need to get out to people so that, if they feel that they have signed up for something that they do not want after an unannounced call&#8212;it is different if they invited the seller to their home&#8212;they should feel confident about cancelling the contract, if a contract is involved. Of course, in many cases, there are no contracts at all.</p><p>I commend the Federation of Master Builders, the trading standards departments and the Office of Fair Trading for mounting these campaigns. However, no amount of campaigns, codes of practice, laws and suchlike will be any good if we do not have proper consumer advocacy bodies to help people and proper consumer protection enforcement.</p><p>Unfortunately we have developed a situation in Scotland where the enforcement is not nearly as effective as it could be. In fact, it is non-existent in some areas. The phrase &#8220;enforcement deserts&#8221; is being used within the trading standards profession to describe areas where there is virtually no trading standards enforcement at all. The Consumer Focus Scotland response to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills consultation on consumer advocacy and enforcement said:</p><p>&#8220;trading standards services are often tiny, isolated and marginalized, leaving them struggling to deliver a full range of services to the public ... this creates ... a gap in enforcement. However, the Scottish Government has no legislative locus to require councils to collaborate ... We would therefore suggest an adjustment to legislative powers to give an administrative role here for the Scottish Government would add value for Scotland&#8217;s consumers.</p><p>At a national Scottish level a mechanism for the delivery of national consumer enforcement will need to be agreed that addresses the interests of government, trading standards and above all of consumers.&#8221;</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with that.</p><p>Peter Peacock&#8212;a former Labour MSP and minister who spent many years with the citizens advice bureaux&#8212;also raised this issue in the previous session of Parliament. There is general agreement among the trading standards and consumer people in Scotland that something needs to be done about it. The big problem started with local government reorganisation.

They have been hit hard by high and increasing fuel costs in particular&#8212;some of the larger vessels in the fleet are having to find as much as &#163;100,000 extra a year just for fuel. I know that the cabinet secretary understands that and I wonder whether he would support an increase in the de minimis aid limit to alleviate those very high fuel costs&#8212;that is something worth thinking about.</p><p>Another area where we can make progress, as the cabinet secretary has already acknowledged, is the haddock quota, or the current lack of it, on the west coast. Even the scientists now agree that there are plenty of haddock. I look forward to a realistic haddock quota on the west coast for next year.</p><p>As I said, I also have some good news. A little over a year ago, I was very grateful when Richard Lochhead, our cabinet secretary for fisheries and so on, agreed to accompany me to Mallaig, where I had arranged a meeting with the Mallaig and North West Fishermen&#8217;s Association. We met a group of fishermen who were worried about what the future held for their industry and whether they would be able to pass on their way of life to their children as their fathers had passed it on to them. As a Lossie loon, fae a fishin toun, ah kent jist far they wir comin fae.</p><p>John Hermse, the secretary of the association, and his fellow members took the opportunity to make clear to the cabinet secretary their concerns for the future and their frustration that their quotas were being cut year on year, threatening the continued existence of many boats and the future of fishing on the west coast. One of the key issues that members of the group raised was their desire to promote their catch to UK consumers because, habitually&#8212;certainly in recent years&#8212;most of their landings have been bought by buyers from southern Europe, where the high quality of such Scottish produce is recognised and prized. To his credit, the cabinet secretary agreed to do what he could to help to market their wonderful fresh prawns and langoustines to the UK market.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I was delighted to hear that that additional help was paying off and that talks were far advanced with two major UK supermarket chains about supplying high-quality fresh prawns from the west coast to hundreds of supermarkets all over the UK. Earlier this week, news of the deal with Sainsbury&#8217;s leaked out and we now know that consumers at 500 of Sainsbury&#8217;s 800 UK stores will soon see a new premium product on the fish counter, which will be sold as fresh Scottish west coast langoustines.</p><p>The impact of that deal goes much further than merely providing a new customer for our west coast fishermen. It will highlight the fact that the products in question are not French or Mediterranean delicacies but ones that originate here and which are part of Scotland&#8217;s fantastic larder. I am sure that there are many people in Scotland who think that it is possible to get langoustines only when they are on holiday abroad.</p><p>I am sure that, through their advertising, Sainbury&#8217;s and others will seek to emphasise the quality of their new products, which can only enhance the reputation of our seafood and lead to more business and better prices for our fishermen. If, in turn, that leads more people to seek out the very best produce from our seas and farms, that can only be good news for our food producers, which will give them the confidence to expand and develop their businesses. Such endorsement of a traditional and sustainable source of employment for fragile communities will, I hope, encourage others in similar traditional professions to seek wider recognition and reward for their endeavours.</p><p>The west coast community has always had an entrepreneurial edge, and the confidence and financial security that such a major supermarket order brings will, I am sure, encourage greater investment in the onshore infrastructure that is needed to service a greater demand for its landings.</p><p>To add to the good news for the fishing communities of the north-west, I am delighted to have been told of plans for a pilot programme to introduce courses leading to a Scottish Qualifications Authority qualification in maritime skills for fifth and sixth-year pupils at six secondary schools in the north-west Highlands. The new courses will be introduced in partnership with Highland Council&#8217;s skills for work programme and have been made possible through financial support from the Highlands and Islands Fish Industry Training Association. Given that funds are being provided to help to train future generations of fishermen and women, I hope that we are beginning to see evidence of more confidence in the future of this important industry than has been witnessed in the north of Scotland for many years.</p><p>I thank the cabinet secretary and his officials for taking the time to join me in Mallaig to meet the fishermen a year ago and for assisting the fishing community in moving the matter forward.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Very often, our common fisheries policy debates are dominated by doom and gloom, and we have heard some of that today, but I have some good news to tell the chamber&#8212;after I add just a little bit to the doom and gloom.

The bill aims to codify in statute a long-held Scottish law principle that a person should not normally be prosecuted a second time for the same offence. The wide agreement that such codification is desirable was reflected in the evidence taken by the committee, which did not hesitate to recognise the fundamental importance of the double jeopardy rule and therefore fully supported putting it on a statutory footing.</p><p>However, one subject of discussion on which witnesses&#8217; views differed was whether the law should be retrospective. The SLC did not support retrospection and claimed that it would have little practical effect, as much evidence is not kept after a trial. That argument has merit, but it does not provide sufficient reason not to apply the law retrospectively. Even if retrospection applied to only a small number of cases&#8212;I think that the number would be tiny&#8212;a public outcry would arise if evidence of an offence came to light but the Crown could not pursue the offender because the law was not retrospective.

The argument is not strong enough to convince me that the bill should not be retrospective.</p><p>New evidence generated much discussion. The SLC found that to be the most difficult issue that it faced and made no recommendation on whether a new-evidence exception should be created. The Crown Office felt that the new-evidence exception in the bill struck a proportionate balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of victims. It also felt that the tests that would require to be passed were very high and would provide sufficient safeguards.</p><p>Those tests are in section 4(6), which says that the High Court can set aside an acquittal only if, first,</p><p>&#8220;the case against the accused is strengthened substantially by the new evidence&#8221;;</p><p>secondly,</p><p>&#8220;the new evidence was not available, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence have been made available, at the trial in respect of the original offence&#8221;;</p><p>thirdly,</p><p>&#8220;on the new evidence and the evidence which was led at&#8221;</p><p>the original</p><p>&#8220;trial, it is highly likely that a reasonable jury properly instructed would have convicted the person of ... the original offence&#8221;;</p><p>and fourthly,</p><p>&#8220;it is in the interests of justice to do so.&#8221;</p><p>Those are not easy hurdles to overcome and they are sufficiently robust to protect the accused effectively.</p><p>Unlike the exceptions for tainted acquittals and admissions, the new-evidence exception is tightly drawn, with the intention of restricting it to certain offences. The SLC recommended that, if a new-evidence exception was created, it should be restricted to murder and rape, although ministers should have the power by affirmative order to add other serious offences.</p><p>The bill goes further than that and adds culpable homicide, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and a broader range of sexual offences. What the list of offences should include is not agreed. The problem with such a list is that, once it is created, all sorts of groups will exert pressure for new offences to be added to it. In our deliberations, the committee agreed that the general new-evidence exception should apply to only a limited number of very serious offences but questioned whether a list was the best way in which to achieve that.</p><p>As has been said, the committee suggested that consideration should be given to replacing schedule 1 and dealing with the matter in another way. The suggestion is that the new-evidence exception would affect only offences that were originally prosecuted on indictment or tried in the High Court. The advantage of restricting the measure to High Court-only offences is that that restricts application of the new-evidence exception to cases that the Crown felt merited a sentence of more than five years. It has been suggested that such a proposal may encourage the Crown to put more cases to the High Court on the basis that that will make such cases eligible for the new-evidence exception in future. I doubt that that will be the case. The option of High Court-only cases is well worth considering. I await the Government response with interest.</p><p>The bill will enshrine in statute a long-held Scottish legal principle that an accused can be tried only once on the same set of evidence, but it allows, rightly, for exceptions. The number of cases that will be caught by the provision will be tiny, as evidence elsewhere shows clearly. I hope that the Parliament can and will support the general principles of the bill this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643755", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill is based on the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s &#8220;Report on Double Jeopardy&#8221;.

One could be forgiven for thinking that the lunatics are running the asylum in Westminster. The decisions starkly highlight why decisions that affect our lives in Scotland must be made in Scotland for the benefit of the Scottish people and not be driven by distant civil servants and politicians who have little understanding of our country.</p><p>The consultation contains little detail and no evidential back-up. It is obvious that the statistics that are being used to justify the case for closures have not been analysed properly and that the case is flawed. For example, the number of incidents has been quoted, but the type or length of incident has not been taken into account. No account has been taken of the differences between north and south. I understand that in the south there are greater summer peaks but that incidents in the north are more evenly spread throughout the year, and that incidents in the north are more evenly spread throughout the day and night and that there are more daylight incidents in the south.</p><p>There is also confusion over the length of our coastline, as Tavish Scott highlighted in The Shetland Times a few weeks ago. The shipping minister, Mike Penning, claims in the consultation document that the UK has a coastline of more than 10,500 miles. He is right. In fact, according to Tavish Scott, it is more than 26,000 miles long, so Mr Penning is only 15,500 miles out. To be fair, Ordnance Survey puts the figure at just 17,820 miles, but he is still well out. Interestingly, according to Scottish Natural Heritage, Scotland alone has at least 11,800 miles of coastline. That could account for his error. How can we have confidence in a man who does not get his basic facts right? Perhaps he just made the mistake of thinking that England is the UK and gave us an English figure.</p><p>Another important issue is local knowledge, which can be crucial to search planning. John Hermes, the secretary of the Mallaig and North West Fishermen&#8217;s Association, has stated:</p><p>&#8220;This is one area where local empirical knowledge is of prime importance ... closure of the coastguard stations can only lead to deterioration of service and, ultimately, to loss of life.&#8221;</p><p>No one denies that the configuration of the coastguard service needs to change, but it must be thought through. It should not be allowed to be driven by someone who is looking through an accountant&#8217;s eye. In the words of Captain George Sutherland, the former director of Shetland Islands Council&#8217;s marine operations:</p><p>&#8220;This is an example of an authority knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing.&#8221;</p><p>We have a massive industry afloat off the shores of Scotland, with oil, fishing, renewables, aquaculture, ferries and merchant and leisure craft continually on the go. They need a resilient coastguard service, but the current ill-thought-out proposals do not provide it.</p><p>My final point is that we must not forget our dedicated coastguard staff, whose jobs are on the line. They do a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances and need to be valued. As one of them said to me this morning:</p><p>&#8220;They are taking humanity out of the Coastguard.&#8221;</p><p>We cannot and will not let that happen.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Centre Cuts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Alasdair Allan on securing this debate on the UK Government&#8217;s devastating plans to cut the number of coastguard stations in Scotland, which come on top of its plans to axe the tugs at Lerwick and Stornoway and its scrapping of air cover from the Nimrods at Kinloss.

The science is unreliable and, in areas such as the west coast, almost non-existent. John Hermse, the secretary of the Mallaig and North West Fishermen's Association, told me this week:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Fishermen don't mind being told they have to catch less if they can see this is based on a sound scientific rationale, but there are too many mistakes in the advice coming from the scientists. ICES has made numerous errors but, even when these are discovered, there is no recalculation of the stock levels, and the quota calculation based on the incorrect evidence is allowed to stand.\"</p><p>John's members, who represent the bulk of Scotland's west coast fleet, have reported more whiting, cod and hake than ever before in the waters off the west coast, yet we are to get a zero quota for cod.</p><p>The size of the fishing fleet in Mallaig today&#8212;at just 20 boats&#8212;is less than half that of just a decade ago. The fleet is being squeezed further <place-holder colnum=\"31028\"/> by the so-called emergency management measures that have been in place since 2009. Those measures unfairly preclude our fishermen from diversifying into the sustainable harvesting of other species such as squid and queen scallops and cause discards of dogfish, because there is no dogfish bycatch allowance.</p><p>Earlier this year, the cabinet secretary and I had a good meeting with west coast fishermen. The cabinet secretary agreed to take back several issues for further consideration, including creel management, marketing of prawns, crab and lobster and possible displacement because of offshore renewable energy developments and marine protected areas. The meeting was robust but useful. The cabinet secretary also promised to look into initiating research and sea-going trials into the viability of a west coast squid fishery. Is he in a position to tell us where he is on that?</p><p>The big problem is discards, as has been said. It is good to note that Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's fish fight against that terrible waste has recognised that the problem is bad regulation through the CFP. That is refreshing as, until now, the problem has always been laid at the door of fishermen by the bureaucrats who manage the CFP. As Bertie Armstrong&#8212;who has been quoted today&#8212;said last week:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have been innovating with selective nets, making sacrifices in support of closed areas and rationalising the fleet but this has not resulted in any significant changes in the approach of the European Commission&#8212;almost the reverse.\"</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said, review of the common fisheries policy is long overdue. I am pleased to note that bodies such as WWF Scotland and the RSPB have joined our fishermen and the Scottish Government in calling for regionalisation of fisheries management. WWF says that the reduced fishing opportunities for 2011 demonstrate the strong case for reform of the CFP in 2012, and that the CFP has an overcentralised, top-down, complex and short-term approach to fisheries management that leads to an imbalanced marine environment, depleted fish stocks and alienated stakeholders. I could not agree more.</p><p>Regionalisation would allow proper long-term management of our fisheries and would let the Government, scientists and fishermen in Scotland develop a system that was sensitive to local needs and which balanced all the competing demands on a modern fishery. Let us make that our top priority for 2012.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sorry&#8212;I did not see the member at the back there.

It is unacceptable that Moray should suffer in that way, especially as the UK Government takes in hundreds of millions of pounds a year from Moray whisky, which is enough to pay for the bases many times over.

This child of a partnership between the BBC and MG Alba has progressed well since its birth and the proud parents should be very pleased with the baby's progress.</p><p>Gaelic is an ancient Scottish language that needs to be nurtured if it is to reclaim its former status as an everyday tongue that is used to discuss everything from the weather and health to science and philosophy. As long as the language is heard only in classrooms and concert halls, there can be little hope of Gaelic being more useful than Latin to young people in chatting about the ordinary business of daily life, their favourite football team or even politics.<place-holder colnum=\"29371\"/></p><p>One of the reasons why BBC Alba is so important is that it gives hundreds of thousands of people the opportunity to hear Gaelic being used in an everyday way. That is particularly important for young Gaelic speakers. It is all about the normalisation of Gaelic, and it will go a long way towards helping to restore it to its rightful place as a language in common use.</p><p>Great strides are being made in Gaelic-medium education, and we have a new generation of people growing up who can learn and think about maths, science and engineering in Gaelic. However, Gaelic-medium education is just one of the things that we must develop if we are to encourage our people to regard Gaelic speakers as a normal part of our daily lives.</p><p>That is where BBC Alba comes into its own. It is perhaps the most effective way of getting Gaelic out of the classroom and into the heart of our communities. BBC Alba is a new platform for exciting and interesting programming on a wide variety of subjects that just happen to be researched and discussed in Gaelic. They are programmes whose subjects draw people to watch them and, in so doing, expose viewers to Gaelic in a positive and modern way that makes it of relevance to today's society. That is exactly what we need if we are to develop and expand Gaelic, and that is why BBC Alba must be offered on Freeview.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about Gaelic, although I am still learning, and I know how valuable the opportunity to hear Gaelic regularly on television at sensible hours is for people like me who are trying to improve their language skills in an environment in which it is difficult to hear Gaelic in a natural setting. Unfortunately, in the same way as many thousands of others, I use Freeview and cannot get access to BBC Alba to help to improve my Gaelic. In fact, I have never seen BBC Alba although I do occasionally listen to the radio on Freeview. It would be no great loss, however, if that was not possible and I, like everyone else, can listen to the radio very easily using many different, relatively cheap, means. I do not, therefore, believe that it would be a great hardship for the small number of people who use Freeview for the radio to find an alternative.</p><p>I support B&#242;rd na Gh&#224;idhlig's view that the name of Freeview is a clear indication that it is for watching rather than just listening to. It is a waste to use the facility for radio only when it can be used for television to the great advantage of Gaelic speakers, learners and enthusiasts. That is why I am pleased that the Scottish Government and a host of cultural organisations have joined forces to urge the BBC trust to grant BBC Alba its own slot on Freeview. I hope that we are successful, because I believe that access to <place-holder colnum=\"29372\"/> Freeview will have a positive effect on Gaelic that will, in turn, have a positive effect on Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: BBC Alba"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "M\u00f2ran taing, Oifigeir-riaghlaidh.

Some are administered by independent quangos here in Scotland, others by a Scottish offshoot of a UK body, some by local authorities and others by health boards. They cover matters as varied as licences for haulage companies, disciplinary hearings for children, workplace discipline, the ownership or tenancy of property, insolvency and social care provision, not forgetting the payment of parking fines and criminal injuries compensation. This confusing group of quasi-judicial bodies delivers what is known as administrative justice in Scotland.</p><p>Although the workings of the criminal and civil courts are conveniently overseen by the Scottish Court Service, responsibility for administrative justice is spread over a multitude of smaller organisations, several of which are retained under the control of UK-wide organisations&#8212;not all of which understand Scotland's unique legal system.</p><p>The situation in other parts of the UK was almost as confused as ours until Westminster passed the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which, among other things, sought to gather all tribunals in England and Wales under a single body, the UK Tribunals Service&#8212;although it covers only England and Wales, not the UK.</p><p>Last year, in its report \"Administrative Justice In Scotland&#8212;The Way Forward\", the administrative justice steering group, under the chairmanship of Lord Philip, highlighted a number of worrying weaknesses with the current system, and it proposed a series of potential solutions to correct them and to establish a system in Scotland that we can be confident in and proud of.</p><p> As regards the failings that were noted, the report contained a warning&#8212;to which John Lamont has already referred&#8212;that<place-holder colnum=\"29196\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"incorrect initial decisions and other administrative failings are more frequent than they should be\".</p><p>The report also said that more needed to be done to improve systems for raising grievances about the outcome of initial hearings. The steering group noted, unsurprisingly, that members of the public are often \"confused by the complexity\" of the administrative justice system and struggle to initiate a complaint, particularly as they might be unable to use the process themselves, and the high cost of legal help can act as a barrier to starting an action. That led the group to conclude that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The existing system does not, therefore, sufficiently meet the needs of users\",</p><p>which is a good example of Scottish understatement. I have a great deal of sympathy for the people who have had to deal with the confusing array of quangos and quasi-quangos, and I am all for simplification of this highly complex system.</p><p>I spent many years as a trading standards officer, and I have personal experience of how arbitration can help to solve many problems without recourse to the courts. I was directly involved in setting up consumer advice and conciliation services, where local authority trading standards and consumer advice officers did all that they could to facilitate an agreement between disputing traders and consumers without the need to go to the civil or criminal courts.</p><p>Such services are hugely beneficial to consumers and honest businesses alike, but I recently found out that, unfortunately, 10 out of Scotland's 32 councils have now withdrawn those valuable services. That might save a small amount for the councils concerned, but it is a false saving for the community as a whole. I hope that common sense prevails, and that the services can be reinstated. If the councils do not look after their consumers and honest businesses, we might have to look elsewhere to get things done. Perhaps some other body that understands trading standards and consumer protection is the answer, and I think that we need to consider that.</p><p>Members will gather from my comments that I am very much in favour of easy, low-cost access to justice, and of simple, sensible solutions to problems. I am very much in favour of simplifying the current confused situation. I therefore welcome the justice secretary's announcement that a new Scottish tribunals service will be established on 1 December this year. The new service will bring together the administrative support for the Scottish tribunals into one organisation, which will create a more efficient and effective tribunal administration, and it can begin to tackle the widely criticised fragmentation and incoherence of the tribunals.<place-holder colnum=\"29197\"/></p><p>I warmly welcome the news that the Lord Chancellor has formally written to suggest that the Scottish Government and Whitehall officials develop detailed proposals for the devolution of tribunals. That would ensure that all tribunals in Scotland were part of the Scottish justice system, and it would help us to make our justice system as coherent as possible. The Lord Chancellor is to be congratulated on his common sense, and I am sure that we will soon see a streamlined tribunal system in Scotland that is fit for the 21st century. Oh that others in London&#8212;or even some of the unionists in our midst, especially Richard Baker&#8212;were equally enlightened! We might then get sensible proposals for further devolution&#8212;rather than the hotchpotch, minimalist, dangerous and damaging Calman proposals&#8212;or, better still, independence, so that such decisions would automatically be taken here in Scotland for the benefit of the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21015188", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For too long we have been faced with an alarmingly confused guddle of tribunals, hearings, panels, committees, secretariats and commissioners when we have sought a legal ruling on any one of the many issues that are vital to a wide range of matters of importance to our lives.

In the past, that health care was delivered by innumerable village doctors and community nurses who were scattered throughout the Highlands and Islands, who made themselves available to their patients whenever the need arose.</p><p>Times have changed and individual doctors are no longer available to serve their patients 24 hours a day, so we must consider new ways of delivering the ever-more complex benefits of medicine and nursing care to patients throughout our rural and island communities.</p><p>In that context, modern information and communications technology comes into its own. It allows medical staff to spread their expertise over a far greater area than used to be possible by jumping into a car to pay a personal visit to a patient's home or requiring a sick highlander to make their way to Inverness, Broadford or Fort William for what was often an urgent medical appointment.</p><p>In recent years, improvements in communications technology have allowed some of our more experienced doctors&#8212;in Inverness, for example&#8212;to use telemedicine to have consultations with patients in Caithness, Skye or the Western Isles by using a videoconferencing link and to make an informed diagnosis of a patient's condition and create an individual treatment plan.</p><p>However, not all remote health care needs to involve consultants. At another level, it can involve an elderly or infirm patient wearing a sensor to alert staff in a sometimes distant care centre of any change in their condition. Sometimes that is as simple as a button on a box hanging around the patient's neck that can be pressed in an emergency, but advances in such telecare technology have allowed that simple alarm button to be supplemented with a range of sensors to monitor breathing, blood pressure or heart rate.</p><p>Between those two extremes is telehealth. Increasingly, it allows health professionals to access a growing range of vital details about the changing condition of patients who have long-term <place-holder colnum=\"28780\"/> conditions, such as diabetes, or a history of heart failure without the need for patients to leave their homes and be brought into often distant hospitals that are many miles from their local support network of family and friends.</p><p>Health care managers and enterprise chiefs in the Highlands and Islands have adopted e-health enthusiastically, and not just for its benefits in spreading care to remote and isolated communities. A cluster of related businesses has been built to help progress and test e-health developments in exactly the type of environment in which they are most needed.</p><p>Capitalising on this new sector of health care was a key driver in Highlands and Islands Enterprise's decision to invest &#163;24 million in the creation of the new centre for health science beside Raigmore hospital in Inverness. E-health companies are being encouraged to congregate at the centre to allow cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge in a manner that is similar to that used in silicon valley in California, where great advances in computing have been seen in recent decades. The cluster of cutting-edge researchers who operate from the centre for health science has helped to establish the region as an internationally recognised centre of excellence in this pioneering area. Indeed, the strategy is already bearing fruit. So far this year, some of the world's leading communications and telehealth experts have gathered twice in Inverness for major e-health conferences.</p><p>Although current developments in telehealth require only a relatively conventional mobile phone or traditional land-line telephone connection to operate, there is growing concern that the patchy provision of broadband in rural areas will have a limiting effect on the next generation of e-health developments in the areas where those developments are needed most. Other members have mentioned that, and the committee touches on the issue in paragraphs 78 and 79 of its report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A key piece of infrastructural development necessary to support such telehealth services is the availability of high-speed broadband internet access. As with many other aspects of the public services, broadband access is especially important in remote and rural areas.</p><p class=\"indent\">In our view, the forthcoming telehealth strategy must clearly set out how such services will be delivered and how this links with the Scottish Government's broadband development policy.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, responsibility for Scotland's broadband infrastructure is reserved to Westminster, although the Scottish Government has done what it can to support the roll-out of vital new communications technology into communities where it is needed desperately.</p><p>Westminster's approach to broadband roll-out often appears to be that it should be driven purely <place-holder colnum=\"28781\"/> by commercial considerations. Regrettably, the businesses with a role in delivering the telecommunications infrastructure that is needed for modern broadband access will always concentrate on areas of high population, not scattered communities in large regions. Government intervention is needed to help with that. We must do all that we can to encourage Westminster to ensure that Scotland's rural and island communities catch up with the provision that is taken for granted in the rest of the UK&#8212;provision that allows people to benefit fully from the important developments that are taking place in e-health. Jamie Stone and Liam McArthur touched on the problem, but we do not need yet another Liberal Democrat campaign and petition. I say to them, \"You are in government now, gentlemen.\" Jeremy Hunt must deliver broadband for the Highlands and Islands, too.

I am sure that everyone accepts the importance of animal health, but there is obviously a need for a debate to be had on the interpretation of which breaches of the rules should fall into the minor category and which should be treated more seriously. That is where Mr McArthur's point should perhaps be picked up.</p><p>Another area of contention relates to gorse and bracken claims, as some farmers misunderstand <place-holder colnum=\"27635\"/> the rules. Nothing has changed: EU rules stipulate that land must be arable, permanent pasture or permanent crop to be eligible for the SFP. Obviously, areas of impenetrable bracken are not eligible, but the Scottish Government has made it clear that less dense areas of bracken with growth below that can be grazed are eligible. That being the case, we must all redouble our efforts to ensure that all farmers are fully aware of what complies. We do not want to see farmers needlessly cutting back gorse and scrub in the mistaken belief that the land will be eligible only if that is done. Let us get the message across: if it can be grazed, it can be claimed.</p><p>Failure to tighten up the system would have led to the Scottish Government incurring heavy penalties, which would ultimately have led to less money being made available to all farmers.

However, that is now changing.</p><p>The publication of \"Ginealach &#217;r na G&#224;idhlig: Plana Gn&#236;omha gus &#224;ireamh luchd-labhairt na G&#224;idhlig a mheudachadh\" by B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig this week is a further major step forward in plans to create a new generation of Gaelic speakers, and it is to be warmly welcomed. However, if we are to continue to take the majority with us, we must consider other factors, such as the economic benefits to be gained from the continued survival of Gaelic and the rich culture and heritage that accompany it.</p><p>Tourism is one of Scotland's most important industries. People flock to the Highlands to marvel at our spectacular scenery and abundant wildlife, but many are disappointed to be brought back to earth on their holidays by seeing exactly the same traffic signs and street names that they can see at home in Leamington Spa, Doncaster or Basingstoke. Contrary to the constant refrain of those who are hostile to Gaelic that bilingual signs are a confusing driving hazard, for many people <place-holder colnum=\"25414\"/> they add to the texture and culture of the areas in which they are displayed.</p><p>In addition to the local population's enjoyment of Gaelic music and arts, the existence of a thriving and distinct culture in these isles is an important reason why the Highlands and Islands are such a draw for visitors from other parts of the United Kingdom. Many people who are on holiday may be content to stay within the confines of a holiday camp, but most prefer to live among the local population and sample something of the lives of the people in that population.</p><p>In recent years, thanks to the support of forward-thinking politicians and supporters from all parties, Gaelic has seen something of a revival, and its educational benefits are now being recognised. More and more parents have come to appreciate the educational benefits that are available to their children through bilingualism. The popularity of Gaelic-medium education has soared as more and more families have come to appreciate that children who are brought up to be bilingual have a competitive advantage over their peers who go through life with just one language.</p><p>In his study of bilingual pupils, Professor Richard Johnstone of the University of Stirling noted a tendency for children who are educated in Gaelic-medium schools to outperform their contemporaries in English-medium education. Educationists must recognise that children who benefit from fluency in and understanding of two languages have a greater ability to handle a wide range of thought processes. On top of that, bilingualism can enhance a child's ability to learn other languages.</p><p>One of the key benefits of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament has been to minimise the characteristic of the national psyche known as the Scottish cringe&#8212;the tendency to regard our country as less good than others around the world. The fact that some even regard the language of our forebears as inferior to French, Danish, Finnish or Korean must have a bearing on that. Gaelic's restoration to a position of respect and acceptance must surely play a part in giving Scotland back its lost self confidence.</p><p>Of course it is not only our children who can benefit from learning Gaelic. That is why the acclaimed ulpan Gaelic courses for beginners of all ages have been increasing in popularity and are to be further promoted and improved.</p><p>Another key aspect of the encouragement of Gaelic's revival has been the formation of BBC Alba, a high-quality Gaelic-medium broadcaster, which confirms Gaelic's status as a language that is as important as any other. However, the success of that extremely positive development has been hampered by the fact that BBC Alba is <place-holder colnum=\"25415\"/> not provided to viewers through the BBC's Freeview service. The BBC trust's argument that it must sort out what universality should mean for the BBC as a whole before it makes a decision on BBC Alba just does not add up. It should go away and think again. That is important, because many of those who wish to use the channel cannot access it and the progress of Gaelic is being unfairly hampered because of that.</p><p>The fortunes of Gaelic are changing for the first time in centuries. It is important that modern Scotland recognises just how fragile its recovery is and that we continue to do all we can to maintain it.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763495", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic (Action Plan)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Faodaidh mi t\u00f2iseachadh le r\u00e0dh gu bheil e na n\u00e0ire mh\u00f2r nach eil G\u00e0idhlig aig ach aon Albannach a-mach \u00e0 50.

However, the experience of other countries shows us how easily such a vital industry can collapse if regulation fails.</p><p>Aquaculture provides and supports thousands of jobs in areas where other sources of employment are difficult to provide without devastating the very thing that makes such areas special&#8212;their unblemished environment. The importance of the environment to this vital rural industry cannot be overstated, as the unspoilt quality of the waters in which fish are reared is one of the reasons why this produce from Scotland is hailed internationally as among the finest to be found anywhere on earth.</p><p>Today, the picture for the aquaculture industry looks rosy, but we must be aware that it can be more vulnerable than most to the dangers of disregarding the needs of the environment. We need only look, as has been mentioned, as far as Chile, where the volume of fish that is produced today stands at just a fifth of the level that was reared in 2008 when the country was the world's second largest producer of farmed salmon.</p><p>Chile's catastrophic collapse in production, which led to thousands of job losses, followed a headlong dash to maximise production by cutting the length of time for which waters were left fallow to recover from the stresses of being used for the intensive rearing of fish. That is why the Scottish Government's strategy as laid out in \"A Fresh Start\", which aims to ensure that Scotland's industry remains healthy, is to be commended. Although some in the industry may grumble about supervision of their affairs by civil servants far away, monitoring is vital if we are to avoid the consequences of an unchecked rush to crop as many fish as possible from our waters.</p><p>Another key threat to the industry is the spread of sea lice. Praise is due to those at the marine centre in Scalloway in Shetland, who have recognised the potential of using wrasse, which eat sea lice, as a biological solution to their spread, and who have researched the commercial <place-holder colnum=\"24405\"/> farming of that interesting fish. Fortunately, funding for the development of such an important new pest control method is available from the European Union fisheries fund, so that promising new species may shortly be reared on a commercial scale in Scotland.</p><p>The use of that native species as a cleaner fish to control in an environmentally sound manner one of the most problematic hazards to threaten the industry may help to lift the reputation of Scottish aquaculture still higher, as it would allow fish farmers to reduce their reliance on the artificial pest control compounds that are provided by pharmacological and chemical companies.</p><p>The use of wrasse as a form of biological pest control is already well established in Norway, where the fish is to be found, kept in cages with the crop fish, at almost a third of fish farms. However, that most environmental of solutions has so far been adopted by less than five per cent of the sites in Scotland. Nevertheless, that development in pest control, coupled with the opening of the North American market that was previously served by Chile, has added to the bright future that is predicted for Scotland's aquaculture industry. Indeed, I am told that that hopeful perception appears to be making it easier for the industry to convince lenders to provide the funds that are needed to continue the sector's responsible growth and to encourage further research into new developments. If that is the case, it is to be welcomed.</p><p>Increasingly, aquaculture will be viewed as a stable long-term prospect that is well equipped to grow to meet the world's increasing food demands. Scotland is already the largest producer of farmed salmon in the European Union, and is second only to Norway in the world since Chile's industry was decimated by the problems that I mentioned.</p><p>Such a promising future has given Aquascot Ltd in Alness in the Highlands, which is one of the industry's main players, the confidence to embark on an exciting new future as a wholly employee-owned business with a new forward-thinking management and ownership structure for which the founders are to be commended. Aquascot directly employs 135 staff and provides work for a further 400 people in stakeholder businesses throughout the Highlands and Islands, including farming supply partners, hauliers, feed manufacturers, vets and mechanics. That multimillion pound firm has already begun the process of transferring its ownership completely to a trust whose sole beneficiaries are the staff, on a model that is used by firms such as the John Lewis Partnership. That will ensure that ownership and control continue to remain close to the community that relies on the firm for economic <place-holder colnum=\"24406\"/> activity and employment. The staff will earn a partnership bonus&#8212;a form of dividend when the firm is in profit&#8212;thereby ensuring that all staff are focused on maximising profits.</p><p>With such firms at the forefront in Scotland, it is surely time that Scotland's aquaculture industry came to be one of the country's most celebrated food sectors. The industry has developed into one of the main employers in some of our most fragile and remote communities around the fringes of the country as well as in towns such as Alness.

Agriculture has a pivotal role to play in tackling the challenges of food security, water supply, energy supply and climate change and in protecting biodiversity. That is why the Pack inquiry into future support for agriculture in Scotland is so important. Mr Pack is to be congratulated on giving us plenty of food for thought.</p><p>As we move down that road, there is a heartening sense of optimism in the farming and crofting industry, which was elucidated by NFU Scotland's president, Jim McLaren, as he entered his final year in post. In his keynote address to the union's annual general meeting in St Andrews last week, he highlighted the considerable progress that has been made in key policy areas over the past 12 months, which has given him a sense of optimism both about NFU Scotland as an organisation and about agriculture as an industry. <place-holder colnum=\"24074\"/></p><p>That is a good starting point for the debate, and it shows that after just three years of Scottish National Party government, things are very much moving in the right direction for our agricultural communities.</p><p>I do not want to break the political consensus, but it is a pity that we have to go through Westminster to influence the EU. Of course, the solution to that problem was announced this morning, and I encourage all members to support our referendum bill, so that we can properly champion our farming and crofting communities in our rightful place at the top table in Brussels.</p><p>The Pack report is an interim report that has sparked much discussion, but I think that everyone will agree with its conclusion that there is an on-going need for direct payments to farmers and crofters to provide some financial stability against a background of market volatility, and to compensate them for the increased costs that stem from regulation.</p><p>Although I am sure that not all will agree that deer farming should be included as active farming, because that would further dilute the money that is available to be paid out, I think that deer farmers have a legitimate claim for support, provided that the definition of deer farming is drawn tightly, so that wild deer are not included. That proposal should be looked at closely.</p><p>There appears to be strong support for the report's conclusion that any future direct support system should include an activity requirement, so that people who collect payments for, in effect, doing nothing are taken out of the system. However, the proposed solution of having a minimum stocking rate needs to be given careful consideration, in case it has unintended consequences for farmers on sparse, marginal land, particularly in the north and west Highlands.</p><p>Another area of major concern is the effect that the proposed area-based system could have on tenant farmers. Angus McCall, who is chairman of the Tenant Farmers Association of Scotland, has gone as far as to say that the proposal to move towards area-based payments could sound the death knell for tenant farming in Scotland, and I have a great deal of sympathy for his position.</p><p>Mr McCall maintains that the proposed level of area-based support will act as a direct disincentive to landowners to rent out land. He believes that the area payment that is illustrated in the report is set too high at &#163;130 a hectare. To illustrate the point, he gives an example of a 240-hectare upland farm that supports 150 suckler cows and 300 ewes, and which employs one man. It will require to stock only 24 cows and 150 ewes to satisfy the minimum stocking density needed and draw in the basic area payment of &#163;130 a hectare. <place-holder colnum=\"24075\"/></p><p>That compares extremely unfavourably, from the landlord's point of view, with rental levels of just &#163;86 to &#163;100 a hectare, not to mention the associated costs of providing and maintaining suitable buildings, fences and so on for a new let.</p><p>Mr McCall believes that rather than rent out land, landowners will prefer to carry out minimum activity and use short-term grazing or contract farming arrangements, and that that will have an impact on the existing tenanted sector, as tenants come under increasing pressure to quit their farms. He believes that the solution to the problem would be to set the area-based support at 10 per cent of the average single farm payment, according to land grading, which would give about &#163;20 to &#163;25 a hectare on arable and grazing land, with the balance of the SFP being made up through a dynamic top-up payment, according to the level of activity that was taking place on the land, which he thinks must reside with the tenant and not the landlord. I believe that his views warrant serious consideration.</p><p>Change is never easy and a sudden massive change is even more difficult, so we must be extremely careful about how the proposals are implemented. A smooth transitional phase over a few years is an attractive proposition and should be considered as a way of minimising disruption for agricultural businesses. I am sure that all those points and many others will be considered fully by Mr Pack and the minister, and I look forward to Mr Pack's final report, which will be published later this year.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice and Law Officers: \"Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The future of farming, including crofting, is crucial not just for Scotland's rural areas but for the nation as a whole.

Freeview is very important for BBC Alba.</p><p><em>The member continued in English.</em></p><p>I welcome this debate on access to BBC Alba, not least because I do not subscribe to satellite television and rely on Freeview for my TV viewing. That means that I have never seen BBC Alba, despite the fact that I am a keen Gaelic student who would like to watch it and whose Gaelic would benefit greatly from access to it. In that, I suppose, I must declare an interest.</p><p>BBC Alba is a great success, but at present it is available only to the 40 per cent of Scottish households that receive satellite TV. Freeview would make it available to nearly all others. Its current weekly reach is 4 to 5 per cent of viewers throughout Scotland and 11 per cent in the Highlands and Islands. It also has a high approval rating. Its availability on Freeview would probably double those figures and give the channel a huge boost.</p><p>Gaelic is an important part of Scotland's culture, heritage and identity, and it was once widely used all over Scotland. It has been discriminated against for a long time, however, and it has only relatively recently started to receive fair treatment. As Ted Brocklebank said&#8212;dare I say it, too?&#8212;the Tories at Westminster were instrumental in getting that going with the promotion of Gaelic-medium education in the 1980s, for which we must thank them. That continued with the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005, the bill for which was ably promoted by Peter Peacock, who has done a lot for Gaelic. It is all the more sad, therefore, that, at a time when the confidence of Gaelic speakers is beginning to grow, some people choose to attack and vilify Gaelic under the pretexts of disproportionate spending on a minority and the need for savings. Some councillors in the Highland region, of all places, have jumped on that misinformed populist bandwagon. Councillor <place-holder colnum=\"23769\"/> Crawford, of Inverness, and Councillor Rosie, of Caithness, spring to mind. That is despite the fact that Highland Council spends only a quarter of 1 per cent of its annual budget on Gaelic&#8212;well below what would be proportionate given the number of Gaelic speakers in its area.</p><p>The latest populist to jump on the bandwagon is Labour Councillor Deirdre Mackay, of East Sutherland and Edderton, who, as it happens, is the daughter of Councillor Rosie. She has obviously seen her dad hitting the headlines and wants some of the action. At a recent meeting, the Labour councillor criticised Government support for Gaelic and labelled the council's efforts to develop Gaelic education elitist. Bizarrely, she went on to say that she supported bilingual education, which could involve Spanish, Urdu or Chinese but not Gaelic. Are those languages cheaper? She also criticised the plans that were introduced by the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive to support the promotion of the Gaelic language, despite the fact that she works for Peter Peacock, who, as I said, has done a lot for Gaelic and promoted the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20565547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: BBC Alba"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tapadh leibhse, Oifigeir Riaghlaidh.

As an MSP for the Highlands and Islands&#8212;a part of the country that has the most to gain from the introduction of modern communications technology&#8212;I have taken a close interest in the provision of internet links in the Highlands and Islands. As we all know, a secure route to the information superhighway is every bit as important for communities, schools and businesses in the north of Scotland as is badly needed investment in the area's physical transport connections.</p><p>With businesses able to market their goods and services internationally, with college and university courses increasingly being delivered online and with medical expertise being shared over the internet, it is vital that the technology that is capable of removing the disadvantages of distance be made available to the country's most remote communities. That is why the announcement in September by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth of &#163;3 million from the Scottish Government to upgrade more than 50 telephone exchanges throughout Scotland to internet-ready capability was so warmly welcomed not just by me, but by the many constituents who have contacted my office to communicate the need for exactly that improvement. We are making good progress in very difficult times, and Jim Mather is to be congratulated on that.</p><p>Some of those constituents run bed and breakfasts or food businesses and need to be online to advertise their activities and take bookings. [<em>Interruption.</em>] Others use the internet to keep in contact with friends and relatives all over the world, and many find that the internet opens the door to continuous education from pre-school right through to postgraduate level. All are inconvenienced by the fact that their outdated dial-up connections mean that their telephones are engaged while a member of their household or business is online. The upgrading of their local <place-holder colnum=\"23429\"/> telephone exchange would remove that inconvenience and would allow them, for the first time, to challenge for business on a level playing field with their competitors, regardless of their location.</p><p>Mr Swinney's first allocation to the national roll-out of internet-ready facilities has resulted in many more exchange upgrades than the 50 that were planned: 71 exchanges have been upgraded in partnership with BT, serving areas all over Scotland that would previously have been regarded as remote or isolated. Although not all the constituents who contacted my office had their internet connection problems solved by Mr Swinney's first tranche of funding, that was only the first step. This week, the good news continued with the announcement that a further eight exchanges&#8212;from Applecross, Kinlocheil and Glenelg, in my region, to Whitsome, in the Borders&#8212;are to be upgraded. The good work continues and moves on.</p><p>That demonstrates the Scottish Government's on-going commitment to the process of laying down this vital infrastructure throughout Scotland so that its benefits can be shared by all. [<em>Interruption.</em>] For far too long, residents and businesses in the Highlands and Islands and other rural areas have been told that the downside of living in such beautiful surroundings is that their remoteness from major population centres means accepting that their businesses will be disadvantaged when they try to contact customers, and that their children will have to leave home if they want to continue their education.</p><p>Now, for more or less the first time, the Scottish Government is providing the infrastructure that is needed to help to improve the economy of remote and rural areas, and to help to end the depopulation that was once caused by the need for young people to move away. That is why I urge members to join me in reminding Peter Peacock that although Westminster's \"Digital Britain\" initiative is a welcome additional step&#8212;I hope that we can all work together to take best advantage of that, and I agree with him that we need a far bigger \"slug\" of the &#163;200 million, based on population alone&#8212;the Scottish Government is already working with BT to open access to modern broadband communications and to widen the participation of our remote and rural areas in the worldwide web.

They deserve our support. I had a little experience of this when I was in charge of emergency planning as director of protective services at Highland Council, and I greatly appreciate their efforts.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister has accepted the Labour amendment, which is on an issue about which I have recently written to the Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service. I believe firmly that adequate equipment and training are essential for the safety of fire and rescue service personnel. In recent years, changing patterns of rainfall have caused ever more rivers to burst their banks. All too often, the result has been that lives have been put at risk or even lost. That is why it is vital that the organisations that strive to maintain the safety of the public are offered the support that they need. They need to be well trained and equipped to carry out this demanding role on our behalf.</p><p>I recall the scenes that greeted the people of Dingwall and other communities around the inner Moray Firth over the past decade following prolonged torrential rain showers. Dozens of residents have cause to be grateful to the RNLI, for example, after its volunteers rescued them from their homes as flood waters rose ever higher. <place-holder colnum=\"23062\"/></p><p>Only last week, I was talking to a lady in Dingwall who suffered from the last flood. She still feels the effects and is constantly worried about a recurrence.</p><p>Each time such an incident happens, the emergency services are summoned to the area to offer assistance. In addition to their role in helping to evacuate people who are trapped in their homes by rising waters and rushing torrents, the team that lies behind this effort must assist the medical folk, gas engineers, electricians and other emergency personnel to reach where they are needed to mitigate the effects of the flood water.</p><p>We are told that such incidents will become increasingly common as climate change brings more extreme weather to our shores and causes higher sea levels than have been seen within living memory. It is therefore vital that the country has enough people who are properly trained and equipped to safely offer assistance to those who need their aid on the country's 27,000 lochs and 120,000 miles of rivers and streams, which together make up 90 per cent of Britain's total volume of fresh water. I hope that the chamber will forgive me if I say that not only does Scotland have the oil, gas and renewables, it has most of the drinking water, too.</p><p>I represent the Highlands and Islands. Given that our huge geographical area is criss-crossed by a multitude of waterways, the challenge of providing a rescue service in our area is more difficult than it is in most other parts of the country, That poses particular problems for our fire and rescue service, which uses risk assessment to help it to identify and target the areas that are most likely to require assistance. In this, they are greatly assisted by the availability of the flood maps that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency prepares.</p><p>The policy of the Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service is that its personnel should not place themselves at risk by entering the water. That policy leaves the Highlands to be served by a single water rescue team, which must be highly mobile if it is to cover an area the size of Belgium. Unfortunately, it is not possible to station a boat on every loch and river. Therefore, in addition to having access to a team of highly trained rescuers who are equipped with the tools to help others while keeping themselves and those in need of assistance safe, everything has to be ready to be rushed off at a moment's notice, sometimes over huge distances.</p><p>Although charity and voluntary groups play an immensely valuable role in providing rescue services at locations throughout the Highlands&#8212;notably the Red Cross at Kyle and the RNLI on Loch Ness&#8212;responsibility over most of the country is largely met by the fire and rescue <place-holder colnum=\"23063\"/> service. Core funding for that is the responsibility of local authorities but, ultimately, it is funded by the Scottish Government through a grant to local authorities. Over the past year, total funding was &#163;328 million. On top of that, the Scottish Government provides financial assistance to progress a number of initiatives that are aimed at improving flood forecasting and warning. Over the past two years, SEPA has been granted &#163;1 million to establish a new north-east Scotland flood warning scheme, which it expects to open in March. In addition, SEPA has been awarded &#163;8.6 million over the 2008 to 2011 spending review period to establish a national flood warning dissemination system, to be in operation in March 2011.</p><p>Thanks are due to Paddy Tomkins, who, following his retirement from the post of Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary for Scotland, was asked to turn his analytical mind to the subject of how public safety can be ensured in these times of changing weather and ever tighter public spending. Among Mr Tomkins's recommendations are a requirement for all fire and rescue services to compile a list of flood rescue equipment and resources that are present in their area, an initiative to promote water safety education to the public and a national register of all water incidents, to allow a complete picture to be built up.

The issue is also a matter of life and death.</p><p>Clear evidence shows that reducing the blood alcohol limit would have a major impact on death <place-holder colnum=\"21989\"/> and injury on our roads, as blood alcohol levels of between 50mg and 80mg per 100ml of blood increase crash risk significantly. Reducing the limit to 50mg would mean that a large measure of spirit, a pint of ordinary beer or a large glass of wine would probably put people over the limit. That would give people the strong message \"Don't drink and drive.\" The UK Government has a poor record on this issue and I fear that its latest position on Calman is just the latest in a long line of blocking manoeuvres.</p><p>I will elaborate. Before the 1997 election and again in 1998&#8212;more than 10 years ago&#8212;the Labour Party announced that it intended to reduce the legal limit to 50mg. However, in March 2000, the UK Government announced that it had decided not to lower the limit, because it was awaiting possible moves to harmonise drink-drive limits in the European Union.</p><p>In January 2001, the EU adopted a recommendation to harmonise the blood alcohol limit at 50mg or less. However, that was not binding on member states and, in 2002, the UK announced that it had no plans to change the limit. Subsequently, the second review of the Government's road safety strategy, which was published in early 2007, stated that the case for a reduction in the blood alcohol limit would again be kept under review.</p><p>However, the Government's prevarication continued. In June 2007, the then Minister of State for Transport, Stephen Ladyman, who had responsibility for road safety, offered some hope to those of us who want a reduction in the limit when he said that the UK Government was once more in favour of moving to a 50mg limit. Later in 2007, he said that the Government would publish a consultation paper to gauge public opinion on reducing the limit.</p><p>As no consultation paper appeared in 2007, I wrote to the Department for Transport in January 2008 and again in April 2008 to ask for an update. However, we heard nothing more until November 2008, when the road safety compliance consultation informed us that, once again, the drink-driving limit was to be kept under review and that the Government needed more time to collect evidence.</p><p>A further consultation came out in April 2009, which led to a statement just last week that there might, indeed, be a case for reforming the current legal framework covering drink-driving but that&#8212;wait for it&#8212;further advice was needed from an independent expert, who will report by the end of March 2010. More prevarication. The proposal will not now see the light of day until after the UK general election.<place-holder colnum=\"21990\"/></p><p>In recent years several EU countries have reduced their limits to 50mg, including France, Germany, Spain and Denmark. Now, the Republic of Ireland and, most interestingly, Northern Ireland plan to do the same. That will leave only Malta, Luxembourg, Scotland, England and Wales with an 80mg limit.</p><p>The decision by the Northern Ireland Assembly to cut the drink-driving limit from next year is particularly significant. First, it is interesting to note that it already has the powers to do so and, secondly, it blows a hole in the UK's argument that we need more information and evidence and that we cannot have different limits in different parts of the UK. As part of my on-going campaign, I have written to Edwin Poots, the Northern Ireland Minister of the Environment, to congratulate him on the move and to ask him for his support in our efforts to do the same here.</p><p>The decision in Northern Ireland also exposes the UK Government's delays in reducing the limit or granting the Scottish Government the power to do so, and highlights the roadblock to reform that is presented by Labour.</p><p>In addition, London's man in Scotland, Jim Murphy, has said that the transfer of powers proposed by Calman, which would allow us to reduce the limit in Scotland, will not be in place until the next session of the Scottish Parliament&#8212;late in 2011, at the very earliest. The issue is far too important to be left so long.</p><p>With Northern Ireland deciding to reduce the limit from next year, the UK Government just looks like it is delaying the process and wasting time for the sake of it. I have no idea what its motives are. Worse than that, Labour is playing politics with the issue and is blocking key powers that could save lives&#8212;65 lives a year, which means that 150 lives have been lost since I started campaigning on the issue two and a half years ago.</p><p>There is absolutely no need for such delay. Even Sir Kenneth Calman said of his report,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think there are lots of bits ... which can be implemented quickly and easily without too much fuss.\"</p><p>All Scotland's unionist parties supported the Calman commission and say that they support the recommendation to transfer powers on drink-driving limits. Can we not, therefore, just get on with it? The order has been drafted&#8212;I have a copy here. It needs only to be laid at Westminster and, in a matter of weeks, it will be law.</p><p>Nobody should play politics with this issue.

A crossing quite close to Inverness, at Bunchrew, has given us problems over the past few years. It took an awful lot of time to convince Network Rail that there was a problem with that <place-holder colnum=\"21028\"/> crossing. More than once we had to get the Office of the Rail Regulator involved, along with various other bodies. Eventually, it was conceded that a battery was faulty and that the lights were, in fact, faulty. In such situations, Network Rail normally denies that there is any problem with its equipment. However, it was clear that that was not the case in this case.</p><p>There are 7,674 level crossings in the UK. If it helps Charlie Gordon, I can say that I am certainly not calling for all of them to be dealt with in a physical sense. I just want the 23 crossings in Scotland that are automatic open crossings to be dealt with. Of course, 21 of those are in Highland, while the other two are in Ardrossan. Like Jamie Stone, I have been pressing the case for gating those crossings.</p><p>Those crossings constitute only 2 per cent of the total number of crossings, but 31 per cent of collisions take place on them. Northern Ireland got rid of all its automatic open crossings in the 1980s for safety reasons. In Highland, we have two such crossings on the Fort William to Mallaig line, seven on the Dingwall to Kyle line and 12 on the Inverness to Wick and Thurso line. Although there are not many trains a day, because there are so many crossings on those lines, we end up with a train crossing an open crossing in Highland every 10 minutes or so. That is a significant fact, which perhaps gives members an indication of why we end up with so many accidents: it is because open crossings are crossed so many times in a day.</p><p>I would like to see a five-year programme of gating open crossings. Like Jamie Stone, I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask for that to be funded. If it costs &#163;1 million a crossing and &#163;23 million over five years, we are talking about a cost that is less than &#163;5 million a year. Such a programme would solve the problem.

The fishermen themselves are far more frank, I can tell you. The proposals do not reflect the reality of what is happening at sea or the composite effect of the cuts and the effort control that are part of the cod recovery plan.</p><p>The proposed cuts on the west coast are particularly perverse as they will only force more boats into the North Sea. That has happened already this year, with west coast trawlers fishing for squid on the Moray Firth and south Caithness <place-holder colnum=\"20984\"/> coast. In fact, I have been told that if it had not been for that fishery many vessels would not have made a pay for the past two months.</p><p>The cuts in the total allowable catches and quotas that have been recommended by the EC show decreases of 54 per cent in west coast haddock, 25 per cent in whiting, 90 per cent in spurdog and 15 per cent in nephrops. Those cuts will only lead to more discards. Spurdog, or dogfish as I know it, is a case in point. The west coast fisheries are, by and large, mixed fisheries where species under restrictive quota are caught alongside those that are not. That means that virtually all dogfish, a non-target species with a 90 per cent cut in quota, will be discarded. Where is the sense in that?</p><p>With madness like that, is it any wonder that the Fishermen's Association believes that what is happening to the fishing industry has nothing to do with the conservation of fish stocks and more to do with the destruction of our fishing industry. The year-on-year cuts in quota, changes to the number of days at sea, constant changes to the rules that have no apparent rhyme or reason and other blows to the industry, such as the application of the new OMEGA mesh gauge, all combine to scunner everyone involved. It is no wonder that many in the industry now see further decommissioning as the only way forward. I also ask, by the way, that the minister ca' canny on the CCTV.</p><p>As we have an ageing fleet with older skippers who want out but no one who wants to buy in, I hope that the minister will continue to consider with the industry what measures might be introduced in due course to alleviate the pressures that the industry faces. The fishing industry really needs stability, with a survivable quota that is maintained for three to five years to rebuild confidence. They need a system that does not constantly change. We must get away from a system in which fishermen&#8212;particularly those on the west coast&#8212;take home less than &#163;10,000 a year from the most dangerous job in the country.</p><p>The only real solution, of course, is to get back control of our fishing. I invite all members to support the SNP Government in that aim&#8212;although, given some members' track records, I am not at all hopeful about that. As the current CFP lasts only until 2012, the Commission launched a green paper on the future of the CFP in April this year that proposes wholesale reform and concedes that there are many failings in the current policy. The Commission's new proposals will be launched in 2010 and a draft successor regulation will be published in early 2011. That presents a real opportunity to gain some control and to decentralise the CFP. However&#8212;surprise, <place-holder colnum=\"20985\"/> surprise&#8212;Sarah Boyack does not like the thought of Scotland getting a say.</p><p>Running in parallel with the review of the CFP is the process of considering the application that Iceland made in July this year to join the EU. It will be very interesting to see how that progresses. Iceland's fishing industry accounts for 70 per cent of its exports and 10 per cent of its gross domestic product. In the 1970s, Iceland fought two cod wars to guarantee unfettered access to fishing grounds within 200 miles of its coastline. Iceland will not lightly give up those rights. I believe that the EU, which wants Iceland on board, will make significant concessions over fishing.

I will try to shed some light on that, so that we can see just how bad PPP was and why it had to go.</p><p>Highland Council has undertaken two PPP schools projects, the first in 2001 and the second in 2006. The cost of the first PPP school is now just over &#163;3 million a year, and the cost of the second was predicted to be just over &#163;18 million a <place-holder colnum=\"20378\"/> year, after inflation, in the current financial year, which comes to a total of about &#163;21.25 million at today's prices. The strange thing is that figures that were released recently by the Government show that Highland Council is actually paying &#163;24.5 million this year for its PPP schools, which is &#163;3.25 million, or 15 per cent, more than was projected. That is not exactly the best value that the Opposition claims it is.</p><p>How did the council get it so wrong? That huge increase in repayments seriously calls into question the value for money of the PPP projects, the way in which the business case was developed and how robust the figures for the public sector comparator were. There is no doubt that the private sector ran rings round the public sector with PPP. Respected figures such as Jim and Margaret Cuthbert have said that there have been gross failures at</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the value for money and affordability stages\"</p><p>of the PPP process. That is very worrying, and it looks as though we are only now seeing just how bad some of the deals were. I fear that there is much more bad news to come.</p><p>Further problems that are linked to PPP are coming to light, and Highland Council is again at the forefront of the failures. The council recently revealed that it has been saddled with an overspend of &#163;754,000 this year due to higher than expected rates payments for its PPP schools. The overspend is so high this year because the council received the first rates bills for the schools only in March&#8212;two years after some of the buildings were completed. The council expects the overspend to be smaller in the future, but it will still be &#163;356,000 a year more than expected. That is an additional expense that will be incurred every year for the next 28 years, until the PPP contract ends in 2037. An extra &#163;10.68 million in rates will have been paid by the end of the contract at a time when Highland Council will have been cutting teacher numbers in many of its schools. Good value, indeed.</p><p>The council has, of course, blamed someone else. Apparently, it has been let down by consultants and is now making threatening noises about taking legal action. I doubt very much that that will ever happen.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207219", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Buildings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion condemns the state of Scottish schools, but omits to say that they got into that state under the Labour and Lib Dem Governments.

It has since gone from strength to strength and is now active all over the world. The society is not linked to any one denomination but seeks to promote the Bible with people regardless of any church connection. That is one of its strengths.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I thought that it would be appropriate to explain the purpose of the Scottish Bible Society. I can do no better than use the words of the society's president, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, a man after my own heart, to whom I had the pleasure of listening a fortnight ago at the Kingsview Christian centre in Inverness. In his introduction to the bicentenary issue of Word@Work, Lord Mackay said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Apostle Peter had many wonderful experiences but one of the most outstanding must have been when, with Jesus and James and John, he heard the voice from heaven. 'This is my Son whom I love, with him I am well pleased.'</p><p>Towards the end of his life, recalling this experience in his second letter to believers, he said 'And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark <place-holder colnum=\"19886\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.'\"</p><p>Lord Mackay concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This 'more certain word' is the scripture, the Bible. What a privilege the Scottish Bible Society has enjoyed for 200 years providing this light to many parts of the earth as well as here in Scotland.\"</p><p>This light is a message of peace, hope, love and transformation that has relevance to all aspects of national life, including family, work, health and education. It is all the more important in an age that is blighted by addictions, greed and selfishness and that has seen the erosion of community and the rise of the cult of individualism, for which we are all counting the cost.</p><p>Unlike a millstone around your neck, the Bible does not stop people from doing what they need to do; it helps them to do it. There is no doubt that it has contributed greatly to the life of Scotland, and that it is a sure foundation on which to build a strong and sustainable society.</p><p>We need only look at our language&#8212;be it Gaelic, Scots or English&#8212;to realise just how embedded the scriptures are in our lives, although most people think that that is just an old wives' tale. They do not realise what an influence the Bible has had and how often they quote from its pages every day.</p><p>I wonder how many members noticed the use of biblical phrases in my speech so far&#8212;or have I just been casting my pearls before swine? Excluding the quotes from Lord Mackay, there were seven phrases: \"the powers that be\", \"gone from strength to strength\", \"a man after my own heart\", \"counting the cost\", \"millstone around your neck\", \"old wives' tale\" and, of course, \"casting my pearls before swine\". See if you can spot some more in the rest of my speech&#8212;there might be a wee test at the end of it.</p><p>As I have said, the Scottish Bible Society is active all over the world, and a little bird told me that the society began to provide translations in Nigeria in 1862 and Malawi in 1884. It expanded into China in 1863, Japan in 1875 and Korea in the 1880s. Those activities laid the foundation for today's active churches in all those countries and many more.</p><p>The society does not just provide scriptures; it also tries to help with medical facilities, for instance. That brings us to the Brazil project, which is the baby of Elaine Duncan, chief executive of the Scottish Bible Society and a good Samaritan. Elaine visited Brazil in 2007 and sailed on a boat called the Light in Amazonia, which is run by the Bible society of Brazil and which visits riverside communities up and down the Amazon. In the true spirit of doing to others what we would like them to do to us, it provides an holistic <place-holder colnum=\"19887\"/> ministry, encompassing medical and dental treatment, health education and citizenship training, all underpinned by the presentation of God's word.</p><p>During Elaine Duncan's visit, she heard about the needs of the north-east sert&#227;o region of Brazil, where some 40 per cent of the poorest Brazilians live, and she learned of the desire of members of the Bible society of Brazil to practise what they preach and extend their ministry into that impoverished region, using a road vehicle. That immediately reminded her of the Scottish Bible Society's own mobile Bibleworld studios, which takes the story of the Bible to children all around Scotland. So, the project known as light in the north-east was born, with not a doubting Thomas in sight.</p><p>The aim in this, the Scottish Bible Society's bicentennial year, is to raise &#163;200,000 for the multi-purpose vehicle, which will provide health care, dental provision, primary education resources, Bibles and a sheltered scripture learning space to the remote sert&#227;o region of north-east Brazil. To date, more than &#163;175,000 has been raised from supporters who know that it is better to give than to receive.</p><p>What a great way to celebrate a birthday: giving, not receiving.

That is witnessed by the fact that it has allocated &#163;1 million a year until 2011 to implement the framework.</p><p>The framework contains 90 commitments, but I will focus on one: the commitment to work to reduce the effect of alcohol on road accidents through a reduction in the drink-driving limit and random breath testing. As members know, I have long campaigned to have the drink-driving limit reduced from 80mg to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. I support the Liberal Democrat amendment in that respect.</p><p>On 18 December last year, the Parliament voted overwhelmingly to support a lowering of the drink-driving limit. Given the outcome of the vote, I will not rehearse again the arguments in favour of such a reduction. The vote last year was 66 in favour of the reduction&#8212;a number that included the Liberal Democrats and five Labour members&#8212;with 49 abstentions and only one vote against. Clearly, a reduction in the drink-driving limit is the settled will of the Scottish Parliament. The Calman commission subsequently recommended that powers over the drink-driving limit be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. That is not such a radical move as it appears, given that the Northern Ireland Assembly not only has such a power but is involved actively in the debate on the issue.</p><p>During the debate last December, great play was made of the reduction in the limit being made across the UK. Some members said that we should await the outcome of a UK-wide review on the matter. Although I would be pleased to see the limit reduced across the UK, we still await action at UK level and meanwhile people are dying or being injured unnecessarily on our roads.</p><p>Given that a reduction in the drink-driving limit would save 65 lives a year across the UK, the prevarication of the UK Government has cost 50 people their lives since last December. Since I started my campaign, 130 lives have been lost and, shockingly, 780 lives have been lost since Labour came to power in 1997. How many more people have to die before Westminster sees sense on the issue?</p><p>In the absence of a commitment by the Westminster Government to reduce the drink-driving limit across the UK, I wrote to a number of organisations that support such a reduction to ask them whether they favour the power to reduce the limit being given to the Scottish Government. Although some, understandably, felt that it would be inappropriate for them to comment, others expressed the strong view that if the UK <place-holder colnum=\"19784\"/></p><p>Government was unwilling to act, Scotland should be given the chance to lead the way. They said that the power should be transferred to the Scottish Government. The British Medical Association, Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents all took that view.</p><p>There is now an unstoppable momentum behind transfer of power over the drink-driving limit. The Calman commission favours transfer of drink-driving powers to the Parliament. Influential bodies such as the BMA, SHAAP and ROSPA also back it. The Scottish Government has already drafted the necessary orders, and Westminster could implement the measure in a matter of weeks, if it wished. What is the problem? I plead with the Opposition parties, especially the Liberal Democrats, to stop playing politics with people's lives, to come on board now and to back the immediate transfer of drink-driving limit powers to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20194125", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Safety Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My Blackberry is definitely off, Presiding Officer.

There is nothing surprising in the document: it reflects the views of the various consultees, which is of course the whole point of consultation. Opposition members never see anything good in anything that our SNP Government does. Why do they always have to <place-holder colnum=\"17776\"/> have frowns on their brows? Lighten up, folks&#8212;this is good news.</p><p>As other members have said, aquaculture is vital to Scotland as whole, and to the Highlands and Islands in particular, where it provides a lot of much-needed employment in many remote and rural areas. We have only to look at the map in the \"Fresh Start\" document to see how true that is. The map shows that all the freshwater and shellfish sites are in the Highlands and Islands. That is how important shellfish and salmon farming are to the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>To put the issue in context and to give members an idea of the industry's importance to Scotland, it has been calculated that salmon farming is worth around &#163;380 million a year, although the figures vary. As well as salmon, we farm trout, cod, halibut, char and shellfish. I had a very nice bit of halibut in Lerwick on Saturday; I would recommend the halibut there to everyone.</p><p>As has been said, salmon farming supports many jobs&#8212;1,195 people are involved directly in salmon production, and there are 3,733 full-time, part-time and seasonal jobs in salmon processing. Those are significant numbers. In total, there are about 6,000 jobs in aquaculture, most of which are in remote and coastal areas of the Highlands and Islands. The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation's briefing claims that the results of the organisation's survey show that salmon farming brings &#163;500 million to the Scottish economy, which is more than the official figures suggest. The SSPO's also figures show that if one applies standard Government multipliers to the &#163;36 million in local wage payments that primary salmon production provides, it translates to an injection of &#163;165 million into the wider local rural economy, because money that is earned locally is spent locally.</p><p>The SSPO also says that expenditure on supplies and services has continued to increase, despite the recession. In 2008, it reached &#163;304 million, &#163;223 million of which was spent in Scotland and, of that, &#163;143 million was spent in the Highlands and Islands. The SSPO's members estimate that they have invested more than &#163;84 million in capital projects over the past three years, the vast majority of which has been spent in the Highlands and Islands. Capital investment has risen year on year from &#163;19.5 million in 2006 to &#163;35 million in 2008.</p><p>I believe that the key to future prosperity in Scottish aquaculture, as in so many areas, is the quality that goes with our clean green image. Our unique selling point is that consumers are guaranteed quality from food that is produced in our pristine environment. We need to do everything possible to retain that reputation. It is essential that we take the necessary measures to <place-holder colnum=\"17777\"/> protect and promote such a valuable industry, which has an enviable worldwide reputation for quality. The aquaculture industry needs a sound regulatory framework that promotes sustainable development, protects jobs and incomes, and enables the industry to continue to make such an important contribution to the Scottish economy.</p><p>As has been said, outbreaks of infectious salmon anaemia, for example, can dent our reputation. Other countries have found, and are finding, to their cost that lax regulation can lead to devastation of their industries&#8212;the Chilean industry is in real trouble and the Norwegian industry is severely affected. However, tight regulation and good practice in our industry have meant that we have had only one outbreak in 10 years. It was one outbreak too many, unfortunately, but we are still streets ahead of our competitors. That gives us a huge advantage that we can exploit.</p><p>Following the Chilean industry's problems, the American market is now wide open, so we must ensure that our aquaculture industry can take advantage. The Scottish aquaculture industry is amazingly upbeat and optimistic, despite the recession. We must do all that we can to help it to fulfil its ambition to expand, to develop and to be the best in the world. It has earned an enviable worldwide reputation for quality, sustainability and high standards, and it deserves praise for its achievements. It also deserves our support and help to ensure that its reputation is maintained and enhanced.</p><p>It is imperative that our aquaculture industry continues to play a major role in providing jobs and income for our local remote and rural communities, and to make a valuable contribution to the Scottish economy. The Scottish Government is highly supportive of an aquaculture industry that is sustainable, ambitious, thriving, competitive, profitable and diverse.

It can be perpetrated by all sorts of people of all ages. Often, drink is the root of the problem, and cheap drink at that. Steve McCabe of the Portree medical centre recently highlighted the problem in a letter to his local paper. A supermarket was selling cans of lager at less than 14p per 100ml, while Irn-Bru was on sale at 17.8p per 100ml. At those prices, an adult could consume their entire week's safe limit of 21 units for much less than &#163;10. Steve McCabe believes that such irresponsible promotions are a major factor in our spiralling problem of alcohol misuse in Scotland. I wonder why some people still cannot see that the problem of cheap alcohol is one of the main causes of our problems today.</p><p>I am sure that we all know of many instances of antisocial behaviour in our own constituencies and many of us may well have personal experience of it. Antisocial behaviour needs to be dealt with so that we can restore a sense of wellbeing to our communities, improve everyone's lives and lift people's spirits.</p><p>Although antisocial behaviour is having a debilitating effect on many individuals and communities, I sometimes despair, like the minister, at the perceived wisdom that only the young are guilty and that nothing can be done apart from imposing draconian sanctions on them. In some cases, draconian sanctions might well be necessary, but I am much more in favour of prevention of the problem in the first place. That is why I welcome the Government's antisocial behaviour framework, \"Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland\", which was developed in partnership with a host of bodies that have experience of the problem.</p><p>Many good things are going on throughout the country that help to prevent antisocial behaviour&#8212;twilight basketball, for instance. I note that Paul Martin was unable to answer my point that his Labour colleague in Inverness thinks that that is a gimmick. Mr Martin has stolen the Liberals' clothes by saying one thing down here in Edinburgh while his colleague says the exact opposite in Inverness.</p><p>Some good things are done by volunteers in the local community, such as the spotlight cafe that is run by my church, which I help out with, when I can, on a Friday night. Other projects are developed by bodies such as councils, but they do not all get an easy ride. One such initiative in Inverness is the Charleston youth shelter, which has just started. I hope that I will be able to come <place-holder colnum=\"16537\"/> back to the Parliament in a few months' time to let members know that the project has been a great success. It has been championed by a colleague, local SNP councillor Pauline Munro, who has pursued the issue with vigour in spite of some local opposition.</p><p>The progress of the Charleston youth shelter illustrates just how tricky it can be to do anything positive because, unfortunately, new ideas and developments always seem to attract opposition. In November 2007, the first youth forum was held for pupils at Charleston academy. The idea was to engage with the young people to find out what they felt about their local area and what they wanted done to improve it for them. That engagement with young folk is crucial. A presentation from secondary 1 and 2 pupils resulted in an altruistic suggestion from them for improvements to play equipment in the area, but the presentation from the secondary 4 and 5 pupils tackled the issue of antisocial behaviour and the need for somewhere they can go without, in their words, \"intimidating people\". The young people were fully engaged in the project. Both groups consulted their peers, and they also consulted the primary bairns at Muirtown and Kinmylies about the play equipment.</p><p>The provision of play equipment was straightforward, but the youth shelter proved to be more problematic, not least because Charleston had no dedicated youth worker. If a youth shelter is to be effective, it is essential for youth workers to work from it and engage further with the young people. The problem was that Highland Council, which is run by Labour and the Liberals, had axed a number of community learning and development officer posts and frozen some youth worker posts, which I thought was short-sighted. Eventually, however, the council made a commitment that youth workers would be ready to work from the youth shelter, albeit only at the weekends, once the shelter was in place.</p><p>The young people came up with the idea of a venue outside the Charleston shops, where they already congregated. The community councils were generally supportive, although the management committee of the nearby Charleston community complex was not as keen, and negative rumours about what was being planned were rife within the community. It was not easy to get agreement but, with the help of the police and others, Councillor Munro managed to convince everyone. Agreement was eventually reached to trial the shelter, which will now be reviewed quarterly.</p><p>My point is that positive preventive action is hard work that needs vision, dedication and perseverance. It is much more challenging than simply locking up the vandals and throwing the <place-holder colnum=\"16538\"/> key away; much more challenging than shouting populist slogans; and much more challenging than rubbishing any new idea that comes forward.</p><p>Your SNP government is up for that challenge&#8212;are you?</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14913150", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Antisocial Behaviour Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Antisocial behaviour comes in many forms, from noise to nastiness, from litter to layabouts, from fly-tipping to foul language.

The supper will be a very enjoyable event.</p><p>I welcome the Government's Gaelic language plan. In developing Gaelic, confidence is paramount. That is what the Gaelic plan and all the other measures are about&#8212;developing the confidence of native speakers, learners, children and communities. In the past, we have been held back by the lack of confidence among native speakers, many of whom were not literate in Gaelic. When they came across a pushy semi-literate learner asking them all sorts of questions about the genitive case and so on and so forth, they did not want to know. That was a real <place-holder colnum=\"14591\"/> problem. The situation is changing a bit, but it needs to change even more. That is why the Gaelic plans are so important. The other measures that we are taking, such as Gaelic road signs, are also important, so that people see the language out there and see that it is part of mainstream life in Scotland, certainly in the G&#224;idhealtachd areas.</p><p>I am a fairly long-time learner of Gaelic, having gone to night school and to Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig for various one and two-week courses. Eventually, I did a full year at Inverness College, the c&#249;rsa comais, and developed reasonably good Gaelic. However, I am still not fully fluent. The problem in Inverness is that the course closed two or three years ago. Parents are sending their children to the new bun-sgoil Gh&#224;idhlig Inbhir Nis&#8212;the new Gaelic primary school in Inverness. My daughter sent her daughter&#8212;my granddaughter&#8212;to the Gaelic-medium unit in Inverness, while she did a two-year full-time course at Inverness College, with the aim of being able to help her daughter with her homework when she came home from school. That worked very well. My daughter is now pretty fluent in Gaelic&#8212;fluent enough to be working in the bun-sgoil as a teacher's assistant.</p><p>That opportunity is no longer available for parents in Inverness. They would have to go to Skye to do a similar course. Parents in Inverness whose children go to school there need a course locally. I know that the college is trying to resurrect the course. Many people who send their children to Gaelic-medium education are not native Gaelic speakers, but they want to help their children, so it is important that they have that ability. Of course, other options are built in, such as other people helping kids with their homework, but it is much better if the parents can do it. As the parents learn, there are more Gaelic speakers and they are more likely to speak in Gaelic to their children at home.</p><p>It is a real joy for me to listen to my granddaughter, who is coming up for 11 this year. One tremendous feature of Gaelic-medium education is the amount of music and culture that is built in. It is lovely to listen to her singing to herself in Gaelic, without any hint of embarrassment. That is a fantastic feature that permeates such schools. The bun-sgoil Gh&#224;idhlig Inbhir Nis has been a great success. It is full, as is the pre-school. When people realise that children do very well in Gaelic-medium education and that their cognitive abilities are very good, they want to send their children through that education.</p><p>Ken Macintosh compared Gaelic-medium units with Gaelic-medium schools. A full Gaelic-medium school is definitely much better than a unit because a unit, by definition, is located within an English-speaking school. The problem for the children is that, although they get Gaelic in the <place-holder colnum=\"14592\"/> classroom, the assembly in the morning has to be held in English because the English-speaking kids cannot speak Gaelic, although the Gaelic-speaking ones can speak English. Out in the playground and in the canteen, English tends to be spoken. There is a dilution of the language when there is just a unit.</p><p>The situation with the Sleat primary school was difficult and traumatic. It was a shame when Highland Council decided to have an English-medium unit within a Gaelic school, because that did not remove the effect that I mentioned. The children in the English-speaking unit, who are a minority in the Gaelic-speaking school, still have to be told in English what is going on at the assembly. The same effect occurs in the canteen and playground. There is not the full immersion that is required to allow the kids to utilise the language right across the board. We need to consider that carefully.</p><p>I am pleased that Highland Council is considering having Gaelic-medium schools in Portree and Fort William. As I said, such schools are necessary because Gaelic units in English-speaking schools do not provide pupils with the full benefit. The situation is hard enough already. When the children at Gaelic-medium schools come out of school, they tend to slip into English because they are surrounded by it. The more that we can do to make them believe that Gaelic is the normal language to use for everything that they do in school, the better things will be in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14649276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tha mi gl\u00e8 thoilichte a bhith an seo an-diugh, ach cha bhi mi a' bruidhinn anns a' Gh\u00e0idhlig.

The flooding was so severe that the A9 was described as being more like a river than a road, and 40 people had to be rescued by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in Ross-shire. Those people were rescued not from the sea but from their own homes in Dingwall. The coastguard even had to be called out to help to rescue four farm workers and a herd of cattle near Cannich, almost 20 miles inland.</p><p>In Inverness, more than 1,000 homes and businesses are threatened by flooding, and the potential costs of damage are estimated at around &#163;77 million. Inverness was devastated by flooding in 1989 and 1990. The railway bridge collapsed in the 1989 storm. In 2002, Inverness was hit again&#8212;roads were closed and train services were suspended. Things were so bad that the police advised people not to travel to the Highland capital after several areas were left under water. Around 200 guests at the Thistle hotel had to be rescued in dinghies after they become marooned in water up to 5ft deep.</p><p>The bill will be welcomed by many, including future guests at the Thistle hotel. Indeed, it has already received a warm welcome from the Association of British Insurers, which is very much in favour of clearly defining the roles of local authorities and Scottish Water.</p><p>It is particularly encouraging that flood management will be listed in the core priorities of local government. That is real progress towards <place-holder colnum=\"14355\"/> ensuring that flood management receives the prominence that it deserves.</p><p>The Association of British Insurers also approves of revising the building regulations to ensure that buildings in flood risk areas are resilient to flood damage. I agree with that, but the association could help by issuing advice on those matters to owners and tenants of such properties.</p><p>The NFUS has some reservations about the bill and the move away from hard-engineered flood prevention and protection to a more integrated flood risk approach using natural flood management. It says that the legislation must recognise the agricultural productivity or economic value of flood plains and that any proposed measures must be fully costed to properly assess their economic impact as well as environmental and social benefits.</p><p>The NFUS has also expressed deep concern about proposals to divert money from the Scottish rural development programme. It proposes either that funding for flood management should come from a different budget or that SRDP moneys should be increased commensurate with flood management requirements. Just yesterday, we had a debate on the common agricultural policy health check, which highlighted many of the problems facing agriculture and the SRDP. I ask the minister to consider the NFUS view sympathetically.</p><p>Less then two weeks ago, I was invited by the Glen Urquhart land use partnership&#8212;GULUP&#8212;to view the flood alleviation works on the River Enrick. Following a series of floods in the 1990s, which caused hundreds of thousands of pounds-worth of damage to homes and businesses in the glen, it was agreed that all agencies and the community would work together to find a long-term solution. A consultants' report led to the publication of an integrated catchment management plan in 2002 and &#163;600,000 of European funding under the strategies and actions for flood emergency risk management programme. An updated report in July last year acknowledged the work that had been done in the upper catchment area of the river but concluded that the river remains unstable and warned that flood events might still create problems downstream.</p><p>It would cost about &#163;100,000 to resolve the situation but, unfortunately, the &#163;600,000 of European funding has been taken up by a report on the flood risk assessment of the Enrick, the employment of a project officer by Forest Enterprise and some works on the upper catchment of the river, which leaves insufficient money to complete the job to stabilise the river downstream. Identifying another source of capital funding to pay for that has proven difficult for GULUP. The original five-year restoration <place-holder colnum=\"14356\"/> programme never had a full programme commitment from the agencies concerned&#8212;Highland Council and SEPA&#8212;and much of the money was spent on the survey work that I mentioned.</p><p>There are a number of lessons to be learned from GULUP's experience. First, we must ensure that agencies engage in co-operation and joint working. Secondly, we need to ensure that there is financial commitment from those agencies. Thirdly, we must ensure that bodies such as GULUP receive help in identifying suitable funding sources. Finally, we must ensure that money that is allocated to flood risk management is not eaten up by consultants' fees, leaving next to nothing for the works that need to be done.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14622229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill is a welcome and long overdue measure to overhaul some seriously outdated legislation and ensure that it reflects the situation that we face in today's world of global warming, climate change and increased flooding risk.

Indeed, part of the cultural celebration of homecoming this year is the world-class food and drink that are produced throughout Scotland, which give us our character and truly set us apart.</p><p>I attended a dinner the other night to mark the opening, by Jim Mather, of the fantastic centre for health science in Inverness. I happened to sit beside a man from Barcelona who now works in Inverness&#8212;no, it was not Manuel from Fawlty Towers, but a well-travelled and well-educated executive. After the meal, the centre laid on a special tasting of the Balvenie signature whisky. I am sure that the cabinet secretary is familiar with the Balvenie, as it is made in his constituency. The whisky had a beautiful aroma and, as we nosed it, the Barcelonian&#8212;if that is what one calls someone from Barcelona&#8212;said that we have real treasures <place-holder colnum=\"14198\"/> in Scotland. He was referring not only to whisky but to tweed that he had recently bought and to our wonderful food and scenery&#8212;things that are unique to Scotland and that give us our character. He said that we must maintain them at all cost if we want to maintain our distinctiveness from other parts of the world. What he said is central to today's debate. Everything that he mentioned comes from, or is dependent on, our land. We must protect with our lives the valuable, exclusive industry that is our agricultural industry.</p><p>I therefore welcome the CAP health check with its aim of modernising, simplifying and streamlining the CAP. The health check will help farmers to respond better to signals from the market and to face new challenges in 2009 and beyond. I particularly like the ability that it gives us to increase support for new entrants. However, the measure will be of little good on its own; we must also ensure that enough land is let to allow new entrants to get started.</p><p>There are many reasons for the distinctiveness of Scottish agriculture. Our land, climate, people and culture are what make it distinctive and all of them must be reflected in our policy decisions. Such decisions must be made to suit Scotland and the diversity that exists in our country. The DEFRA vision and its push for the phasing out of pillar 1 over the next few years do not suit Scotland's distinct needs. Whereas 20 per cent of agricultural land in England is classified as LFA, 85 per cent of land in Scotland is classified in that way. We should make no apology for using all the means at our disposal to support our agriculture. As Richard Lochhead pointed out not so long ago, the UK Government subsidises many things, including the nuclear industry by billions of pounds. Why then should it not subsidise an essential industry such as Scottish agriculture?</p><p>As I have said, Scotland is renowned as a food-producing nation. Indeed, the sector is worth &#163;7.5 billion a year. In a nation with such distinctive products and abundant resources, it is essential not only that we protect those fundamental resources but that we encourage their development and use.</p><p>Highlands and Islands producers are a vital part of the food supply chain and make a significant economic and social contribution to the whole of Scotland. Indeed, it is estimated that in 2006 agriculture in the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area was worth &#163;259 million out of a Scottish total of &#163;720 million. In addition, the Highlands and Islands is where 36 per cent of all agricultural jobs in Scotland are to be found. Agriculture is relatively more important to the Highlands and Islands economy than it is to the Scottish economy as a whole; it accounts for 12.1 per cent of total employment in the Highlands and Islands as <place-holder colnum=\"14199\"/> compared with 2.8 per cent in Scotland as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that we are debating the subject so early in the new year.

Apart from the UK, only Malta, Luxembourg and Ireland still have a limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. When I first looked into the matter, I discovered that one in nine road deaths is caused by drink driving and that the Highlands and Islands suffer from a drink-driving rate that is 27 per cent higher than the national average.<place-holder colnum=\"13535\"/></p><p>Last week was the first week of a Christmas crackdown on people who drive while drunk. In Highland, police arrested 13 people for doing so, which is exactly the same as last year's figure. Those drink drivers included a 23-year-old disqualified driver who was arrested after refusing to do a breath test and a 45-year-old drink driver who was reported to police by a member of the public.</p><p>As has been said, we seem to have reached a plateau. Around 7,000 drink-driving offences are committed in Scotland every year, although the figure dropped as low as 6,000 in 2000. It is worrying that the number of drink-driving offences is creeping up again. There is evidence that reducing the blood alcohol limit would have a major impact. Between blood alcohol levels of 50mg per 100ml of blood and 80mg per 100ml of blood, the crash risk rises exponentially. That is not my evidence, it is the evidence of the University of Oxford. Someone who has 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in their bloodstream is twice as likely to be involved in a crash than someone who has no alcohol in their bloodstream, but someone who has 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in their bloodstream is 10 times more likely to be involved in a crash than someone who has no alcohol in their bloodstream.</p><p>There is a great need to reinforce the message that drink driving is unacceptable and that even a small amount of alcohol can impair people's ability to drive. Reducing the limit to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would do just that. A 50mg limit would mean that a small, 25ml measure of spirit, a half pint of ordinary beer with a strength of about 3.5 per cent&#8212;we should bear in mind the fact that most beers now have a strength of 5 per cent&#8212;or a small, 125ml glass of wine with a strength of 9 per cent would put someone over the limit. It is hard to find wine in the supermarkets the strength of which is less than 14 per cent. Having a 50mg limit would send a clear message that people should not drink and drive at all, because if they do&#8212;thanks to random testing&#8212;they will be caught.</p><p>There has been much discussion of the position of the UK Government, which has a mixed record on the issue. Before the 1997 election and again in 1998, the Labour Party announced that it intended to reduce the legal limit to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. The proposal was put out to consultation. The police, virtually the whole road safety community and public opinion all favoured lowering the limit. That was more than 10 years ago. However, in March 2000, the UK Government announced that it had decided not to lower the limit because it was awaiting possible moves to harmonise drink-driving limits in the European Union. In January 2001, the EU adopted a recommendation that proposed harmonisation of <place-holder colnum=\"13536\"/> the drink-driving limit at 50mg or less, but it was not binding on member states, and in the following year the UK announced that it had no plans to change the limit. In recent years, several other EU countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Denmark, have listened to that advice and have reduced their limits to 50mg.</p><p>Subsequently, the second review of the Government's road safety strategy, which was published in 2007, stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"During this review, many stakeholders have advocated reducing the UK's blood alcohol limit from 80 mg to 50 mg. But the limit cannot be considered in isolation ... We will keep under review the case for a reduction in the blood alcohol limit.\"</p><p>In June 2007, the road safety minister Stephen Ladyman offered some hope to those of us who want to reduce the limit when he said that the UK Government was again in favour of moving to a 50mg limit, but that it first wanted to see evidence that such a limit would be properly enforced by the police. Later in 2007, he said that the Government would publish a consultation paper to gauge public opinion on reducing the limit. No consultation paper appeared in 2007. I wrote to the Department for Transport in January and again in April, only to be told that it was pressing ahead with the consultation document and would give careful consideration to the views of interested parties in Scotland and elsewhere. We heard nothing until last month, when we found, once again, that the drink-driving limit was to be kept under review and that more time was needed to collect evidence. How many times does this matter need to be kept under review?</p><p>I must say that I do not recognise the document from which Bill Butler and other members have quoted. The consultation document, which I have with me, states clearly that \"the limit\" will be kept \"under review\", and sets out \"steps to collect evidence\". Moreover, the three questions in the drink-driving section on which views are sought do not mention the limit. Mr Butler and others must have a different document. I direct them to the relevant pages in the document that I have, which are, I think, 33 and 35.</p><p>That said, the fact that the issue has not been raised in the document does not mean that we cannot raise it or that the Parliament cannot take a strong view on reducing the limit. In that way, we can give the UK Government the benefit of our views and put some pressure on it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14306679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink Driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be taking part in this debate, because I have been campaigning for some time to have the drink-driving limit reduced from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg.

As the committee's convener Gil Paterson said, nearly all the members of the committee who discussed the issue have now moved on&#8212;apart from me. I now regard myself as a veteran of the SPPA Committee, at least in this session.</p><p>The rule under consideration is rule 6.7.1, which says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The remit of the Audit Committee is to consider and report on&#8212;</p><p>(a) any accounts laid before the Parliament;</p><p>(b) any report laid before or made to the Parliament by the Auditor General for Scotland; and</p><p class=\"indent\">(c) any other document laid before the Parliament concerning financial control, accounting and auditing in relation to public expenditure.\"</p><p>Under that rule, the Audit Committee's remit is to consider and report on laid accounts, reports and other documents. However, that was considered <place-holder colnum=\"13197\"/> too restrictive by the committee, as a laid document is tightly defined, and the committee's remit could be interpreted as excluding some of the things that it has already considered. The SPPA Committee took the view that the situation should be remedied and that any amendment to the remit of the Audit Committee should not change the nature of the work undertaken but should merely reflect existing and past practices. The convener of the Audit Committee, Hugh Henry, helpfully assured the SPPA Committee that that was indeed his committee's intention in bringing the matter forward.</p><p>Initial draft changes to the rule suggested that the Audit Committee would have been able to consider</p><p class=\"indent\">\"any other document referred to it by the Auditor General for Scotland\".</p><p>However, it was thought that that would allow an external party unusually direct access to a parliamentary committee. It was also thought that the rules had to ensure that the Audit Committee remained focused on the impartial audit of public expenditure, rather than on wider policy issues, which&#8212;rightly&#8212;are for other committees. The SPPA Committee therefore decided that that suggested change was a step too far. It decided to recommend restricting the ability of the Auditor General to put other documents before the Audit Committee, allowing him to put before the committee only documents relating to financial control, accounting and auditing of public expenditure.</p><p>The changes will help the new public audit committee&#8212;to give the committee the new title that it will have if the motion is agreed to&#8212;to do its work better.

The disaster was really the Stotfield disaster&#8212;Stotfield was a small village to the west of Lossie, which has now been incorporated into it. On that Christmas day, the village lost its fleet of three fishing boats in a violent storm. Each skaffie boat had a crew of seven&#8212;there were 21 men and youths. The morning was fair when the boats set sail for the fishing ground, which was just a mile or two offshore, but the weather took a dramatic turn for the worse, and violent winds from the south-west blew the boats away from land and down the firth. The boats were overcome by the storm's violence, and the village lost all its able-bodied men and youths in one afternoon. The boats and men, who had the shoreline in view, were never seen again, and the village was left with 17 widows, 47 orphaned children and two old men. Stotfield never recovered from the disaster, and no fishing boats have set sail on Christmas day since then.</p><p>I have told that story because the disaster is talked about in Lossie to this day. It illustrates the lengthy and strong connection to the sea and fishing that places such as Lossie and other Scottish communities have. Unfortunately, such links are being broken; indeed, they will soon be merely history if we do not ensure that our fishing industry is supported and developed. I do not know whether the marina in Lossie will ever be converted again into a busy fishing port, but I know that the Scottish National Party Government, unlike our unionist colleagues, who have presided over the destruction of our fishing industry, will do all that it can to ensure the survival of that industry.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271355", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sea Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members know, I am a Lossie loon fae a fishin toon.

However, every cloud has a silver lining&#8212;even fewer members who support that policy will be returned to Parliament after the next election.</p><p>Despite the unionist cabal's best efforts, we still have a fishing industry that contributes immensely to the Scottish economy.

Fishing directly supports 2,800 jobs there and Highlands and Islands Enterprise estimates that it supports as many as 2,200 jobs indirectly.</p><p>Fishing is particularly important on the west coast. That is why the European Commission's ludicrous proposal to reduce to zero the number of white fish that are caught there must be defeated. I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary's robust views on that. The proposal would have a particularly bad impact on prawn boats. As Jamie McGrigor said, they would require to be fitted with <place-holder colnum=\"12835\"/> a special plastic grid to retain prawns and allow white fish to escape.</p><p>The proposal would affect about 350 vessels and cause severe financial hardship to hard-pressed fishing communities, which have already suffered because of high fuel prices in the summer. Such grids are not even usable on many west coast vessels, which tend to be 10m to 15m long and to operate with low engine power and small crews. If grids were adopted, such boats would be unable to fish.</p><p>The grids become easily blocked with weeds and debris, which leads to a loss of catch. They have serious safety issues&#8212;Danish fishermen stopped using them after they became stuck in power blocks. According to fishermen, a better solution to the problem is square-mesh panels in place of grids&#8212;that has been mentioned&#8212;and spatial closure of fisheries at spawning times, to reduce discards of juvenile cod, haddock and whiting.</p><p>The market situation is dire, because the credit crunch is affecting consumers on the continent.

I am happy to take part in this debate about the development of Gaelic. I congratulate Alasdair Allan on bringing the debate to the Parliament. I have a lot of <place-holder colnum=\"12707\"/> Gaelic, but I am not yet fluent or confident in it. Where I fall short is that I do not have much opportunity to use Gaelic and therefore I lose it. Although my Gaelic goes forward, then back again, I am still much better at it than I was 35 years ago when I started learning it. I believe that what stops the learner from continuing with Gaelic is lack of time and lack of opportunity to use the language in a natural environment.</p><p>I was born into a family in Lossiemouth that had no Gaelic, although my father said that his grandmother spoke Gaelic in Lossiemouth around 1900. He did not remember many of the Gaelic sayings that she would use other than something like, \"Where is my clay pipe?\" It looks like my great-grandmother was speaking Gaelic and smoking a clay pipe just three generations away from me. I am sure that Gaelic is in my blood in the same way that it is in the blood of many other people who do not know Gaelic.</p><p>When I moved to Stornoway in 1973, I wanted and expected to learn Gaelic. I went to the library to borrow the book \"Teach Yourself Gaelic\". There was a smirk on the assistant's face when she said, \"Here's another one.\" She was not at all confident in me. To tell the truth, I did not have a very good accent when I was trying to learn Gaelic in Stornoway in the 1970s. Many people in the town were without Gaelic, and those who had Gaelic did not want to speak the language. They called it the language of the \"Maws\", or the country people. People could not speak Gaelic if they wanted to be promoted&#8212;or that was the opinion at the time. People were liable to make fun of us for speaking Gaelic, although one or two special people were not like that. I am glad to say that opinions of Gaelic are much better now, although many are still against anything that is Highland.</p><p>I left Lewis in 1983 with quite a bit of Gaelic, but I was still far from being fluent. Back on the mainland in Inverness, I carried on with the night classes and a week here and there at Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig until I got higher Gaelic in 1994. However, I did not do much for 10 years after that. It was not until my granddaughter Yasmin went to the play group and then the Gaelic unit in Central primary school in Inverness that I started again. I did the c&#249;rsa comais full-time in Inverness College when I retired in 2002. That was really good because it was the first time that I had had the time to do a full-time immersion course. I am sure that that is the only way to progress to a great extent. I now try to do the Gaelic in the home and ulpan courses. They are both very good and much better than the old traditional ways.</p><p>My daughter also took the c&#249;rsa comais in order to help Yasmin with her homework. She is now working as an assistant in the new Gaelic school in Inverness. I am also happy that Ella and Jude, <place-holder colnum=\"12708\"/> the children of my other daughter, are going through Gaelic-medium education and that we are playing a little part in the future of Gaelic. I hope that the granny from Lossiemouth who smoked a pipe would be happy with that.</p><p>If we want to save Gaelic, we must expand Gaelic-medium education. I am very happy that Highland Council has just agreed to build other Gaelic schools in Portree and Fort William. We must develop the Gaelic in the home and ulpan courses as ways of learning, along with full-time immersion courses for learners, so that they will learn in a much shorter time than the 35 years that it took me.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246915", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tapadh leibhse, Oifigeir-riaghlaidh.

It is worth repeating and constantly reminding ourselves of those facts.</p><p>We are responsible for 80 per cent of the UK's entire aquaculture production. According to the latest figures this year from the Fisheries Research Services, there are more than 450 registered active fin-fish sites and more than 330 registered active shellfish sites in Scotland. Although employment levels in the industry tend to fluctuate, the latest figures suggest that more than 6,300 jobs are dependent on salmon farming alone. The vast majority of those jobs and others in the shellfish area of the industry are in the Highlands and Islands, and a great many are based in some of our most fragile coastal and rural communities, both on the mainland and on our islands.</p><p>Since its inception in the Highlands and Islands in the 1960s, the aquaculture industry has brought important socioeconomic benefits to these areas. However, the communities that serve it have also experienced something of a socioeconomic rollercoaster ride as the industry has matured to its current form.<place-holder colnum=\"12665\"/></p><p>A sector profile published by Highlands and Islands Enterprise last year makes for interesting reading. Focusing on cultivation rather than the processing of fish and shellfish, it shows that while the industry is still dominated by salmon, other species of fish grown include rainbow trout; moreover, as we have heard, the output of cod and halibut is rising. Shellfish cultivation, the main products of which are mussels and oysters, is also expanding steadily.</p><p>The report highlights some of the key factors affecting the overall expanding global market, including environmental and food safety regulations, technological advances and rising consumer demand for farmed fish. It also underlines the on-going trend of consolidation of the major salmon companies and the continuing potential for job rationalisation that that entails.</p><p>The report states that, at the time of writing, 1,325 jobs or 1,215 full-time equivalent posts, including 1,105 full-time and 220 part-time jobs, were involved in the production of salmon, salmon smolts and trout in the Highlands and Islands. As the report says, these figures exclude</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the very significant indirect employment impact throughout businesses in the supply chain to the aquaculture sector\".</p><p>Indeed, it is estimated that indirect employment could account for as many as 2,100 more jobs in Scotland, the majority of which are in the Highlands and Islands. The report also states that shellfish production supports 401 jobs in Scotland, around 90 per cent of which are located in the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>Just this month there was some very welcome news from the aquaculture industry. One of Scotland's principal salmon farming firms, Loch Duart, which is based in north-west Sutherland, embarked on an ambitious &#163;3.7 million development plan, starting with a major upgrade of its hatchery. The company is expanding to keep pace with demand for its high quality fish from caterers and retailers, at home and abroad. The development programme, which includes the acquisition and infrastructure for three sea loch sites in the Uists, has been supported with &#163;740,000 funding from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Loch Duart, which currently has nine farm sites near Scourie and operates to high environmental standards, intends to increase production by 50 per cent and create 19 new jobs over the next three years.</p><p>It is heartening, particularly in the current extremely challenging economic climate, to see a company such as Loch Duart expanding and offering fresh opportunities in fragile communities where alternative employment opportunities are scarce. I sincerely hope that there will be more of this to come from the aquaculture industry.<place-holder colnum=\"12666\"/></p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that our aquaculture sector is highly successful as an industry, while remaining sensitive to the needs of the environment. This is where the issue of escapees comes in. My first experience of wild salmon was watching them being netted, legally, on the beach at Lossie, and being illegally ripped out of deep pools in the river Lossie. I have also seen wild salmon being netted illegally on the west side of Lewis, and have witnessed the burning of confiscated nets at the back of my office in the old prison cells in the courthouse in Stornoway. In those days, wild salmon were plentiful, and it was almost a civic duty to get one for the pot or the freezer. Times have probably changed, however.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In many ways, aquaculture might have become one of Scotland's forgotten industries.

The debate gives me an opportunity to welcome the launch of Community Energy Scotland and to bring the work of that excellent new organisation to wider attention. Members who were able to attend the Community Energy Scotland reception in the garden lobby last month to hear the presentation by the team led by Nicholas Gubbins, who was also at this morning's meeting of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, and people involved in projects around the country will know of the organisation's work. I will fill in the background for those who were not able to make it.</p><p>What is now Community Energy Scotland began life in 2002 as the community energy unit&#8212;a handful of Highlands and Islands Enterprise staff charged with the task of helping communities throughout the Highlands and Islands to benefit from small-scale renewable energy projects. The team's success led to the formation in 2004 of the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company&#8212;HICEC. With funding from HIE and the Scottish Government, HICEC subsequently helped hundreds of community groups throughout the Highlands and Islands to benefit from renewable energy. It soon became obvious to staff that there was much greater demand for their help from groups around Scotland than had previously been envisaged. For that reason, they established Community Energy Scotland, a Scotland-wide charity. Although the team has grown considerably to meet its new remit, I am delighted and proud <place-holder colnum=\"12297\"/> that its headquarters remain in the Highlands&#8212;in fact, just down the road from my regional office in Dingwall.</p><p>Membership costs just &#163;10. For that, community groups gain up-to-date information on project development and funding, and the opportunity to join a network that includes many other like-minded groups. Membership also brings voting rights, which ensures that communities have real influence on the activities and future direction of the new network. Community Energy Scotland aims over the coming year to develop throughout Scotland a free advice service to enable a face-to-face approach, which is important in confidence building.</p><p>Capacity building in communities is central to the work and ethos of Community Energy Scotland. Rightly, the organisation sees that as being crucial to building skills and abilities in the communities in which it works. Only by building capacity in those communities, wherever they happen to be, can we provide them with the ability and resources to manage renewable energy projects. Most projects are run voluntarily by community members, who have great need of support and help along the way to develop the range of skills that they need.</p><p>Great examples of how the approach can succeed in practice were given by members of community groups who spoke at last month's reception. First, Jacqui MacLeod of the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust told us how Gigha has been able to develop the first community-owned wind farm in the United Kingdom. That landmark project, with just three turbines, meets all Gigha's energy needs and exports the surplus to the mainland, which will provide the community with an annual net income of around &#163;80,000. Community members were at each stage consulted through a series of meetings that were throughout the development of the project. The Gigha community has named the turbines Creideas, D&#242;chas and Carthannas&#8212;Gaelic for Faith, Hope and Charity. Collectively, they call them the dancing ladies. The financial model around the project was based on a combination of grant funding, loan funding and equity, including an &#163;80,000 shareholding from HIE.</p><p>Secondly, Ian Leaver of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust told people at the reception of the recent electrification of the island and the difference that has made to the lives of islanders. The isle of Eigg electrification scheme is now commissioned and operational, with 100 per cent take-up. All 37 households and five commercial properties on the island are connected&#8212;they now have their very own supply of renewable electricity. The effect of the electrification project on the Eigg community has been significant. In a number of ways, it is <place-holder colnum=\"12298\"/> leading to greater self-sufficiency. The electrification scheme is the first island electrical grid network in the UK that is powered by an integrated mix of microscale renewable energy technologies. The island harnesses solar and kinetic energy by generating electricity using a mix of renewable technologies, including a new 10kW solar photovoltaic array, a new 100kW run-of-river hydro facility, wind power from four new 6kW wind turbines and the inclusion of two existing 6kW hydros.</p><p>Finally, Angela Williams of the Knoydart Foundation spoke of that community's off-grid hydro scheme, which supplies householders and businesses in Knoydart. Although it is on the mainland, Knoydart is accessible only by sea. To all intents and purposes, it is an island community, and it is not grid-connected. One of the first projects for the foundation was the upgrade of the 280kW hydroelectric scheme that supplied electricity to the local community. It was viewed as a key project with social and economic benefits for the community. Since then, the foundation has increased the number of connections from 42 to 65 properties&#8212;residential, business and community; upgraded the distribution network; put in place a monitoring system; undertaken training for board members and staff; and undertaken phase 1 of a study into hydrogen production using spare capacity from the hydro station.</p><p>Just this month, it was announced that two groups that Community Energy Scotland had been working with in Orkney have secured planning consent for wind-turbine projects. That will allow the Stronsay community and the Rousay, Egilsay and Wyre Development Trust to develop single turbines, which have the potential to bring enormous social and economic benefits to their island communities.</p><p>Community Energy Scotland is already working with communities in other parts of Scotland, but it is realistic in understanding that it faces a major task to replicate in other areas the success that it has achieved in the Highlands and Islands. Its vision and ambition was clearly set out by the chairman, Alan Hobbett, who was here in the Parliament last month. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Over the next ten years, we want to see thousands of community-owned renewable energy projects across Scotland, from small 'micro-renewable' energy plants to larger scale wind farms, wood-fuelled district heating plants, anaerobic digesters and even wind-powered electric transport, all owned by communities at a local level.</p><p class=\"indent\">These projects can bring real benefits to communities, helping to reduce energy costs and even to bring much needed cash into the community&#8212;while helping reduce Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions and establish Scotland as a leader in renewable energy development.\"</p><p>I believe that he is right on all those counts. I hope that members will join me not only in <place-holder colnum=\"12299\"/> welcoming the launch of Community Energy Scotland, but in lending their support to its work by spreading the word in their areas.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14225220", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Energy Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members whose support for my motion has enabled this debate to take place.

As such, I was put in charge of the council's response to the outbreak that year.</p><p>I was a leading player in the multi-agency emergency group, which was established to co-ordinate the Highland response. That group included representatives from many bodies, such as council departments, the police, the NFUS, the Scottish Executive's Environment and Rural Affairs Department and Highland Health Board.</p><p>One controversial measure that we introduced was disinfectant baths on the roads that led into the Highlands, so that every vehicle that entered the region was disinfected to prevent its carrying in the disease. Other concerns were the closure of <place-holder colnum=\"11507\"/> countryside paths and the movement of animals into and around the Highlands, which caused us several severe headaches. That time was difficult and stressful for everyone, but we were ultimately successful. The key to our success was that we acted quickly and decisively, just as the Scottish Government did last year.</p><p>I welcome the Scudamore report's conclusions on Scotland's handling of the 2007 foot-and-mouth outbreak in Surrey. I also welcome the Scottish Government's commitment to take forward the report's recommendations.</p><p>As has been said, although the disease came nowhere near Scotland, the impact of the outbreak and of the UK Government's reaction was keenly felt by Scotland's hard-pressed farmers&#8212;even farmers and crofters in Shetland, who are many miles from Surrey. I am sure that the farmers of Surrey would agree that that was ridiculous in the circumstances. As Peter Peacock said, some parts of Scotland are further from the border than Surrey is, which reinforces the need for regionalisation.</p><p>The Scudamore report makes key points in support of the Scottish Government's reaction to the outbreak and its subsequent actions. For example, Professor Scudamore said that the Scottish Government's actions were</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in the best interests of the Scottish industry\".</p><p>He also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As soon as FMD was confirmed in August and again in September the Scottish Government acted quickly and decisively\".</p><p>Professor Scudamore said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There has been a perception in England that a number of the actions taken by the Scottish Government were purely for political reasons and not related to best scientific and veterinary advice. From the evidence available this does not appear to be the case. The Scottish Government took appropriate action\".</p><p>I hesitate to mention Peter Peacock again, but his comments on the matter were bizarre and probably related more to Labour paranoia than to anything else.</p><p>The source of last year's outbreak was a UK Government-owned laboratory in Pirbright, in Surrey. There is no doubt that the UK Government badly let down Scotland's farmers and the 67,000 people who are employed in the industry in Scotland when it refused to accept responsibility for the impact of the crisis. When news of the FMD outbreak and its implications for Scotland became clear, the Scottish Government reacted quickly and effectively, despite the fact that it had a limited remit. The Scottish Government's actions were supported by the NFUS. The report commends stakeholders for their work with the Government during the crisis.<place-holder colnum=\"11508\"/></p><p>However, Labour and the Lib Dems, who had just been thrown out of power by the Scottish electorate, accused the SNP of using the crisis as an opportunity to pick a fight with Westminster. That was hardly a constructive contribution at a time when Scotland's farmers were facing potential financial ruin and there was a real possibility that animals would starve.</p><p>Our farmers, who faced the loss of their livelihoods as a result of a crisis that flowed from a Government hundreds of miles away, had every right to seek compensation there and then. After all, &#163;24 million was paid in compensation as a result of the 2001 outbreak, as Alasdair Allan said. However, our farmers' pleas fell on deaf ears. Hilary Benn was going to announce a fast-track compensation programme for Scotland's affected industries, but when he made his speech in the House of Commons no offer was made to Scotland's livestock industry&#8212;I make no apology for repeating what Alasdair Allan said in that regard. However, &#163;12.5 million was made available to farmers in England. That confirmed beyond doubt the belief in the Scottish industry that the UK Government was playing politics with Scottish farmers' livelihoods and our vital livestock industry, just as it is playing politics with the Scottish council tax benefits system.</p><p>The Scudamore report underlines the fact that as a small nation Scotland was better able to use its communication channels with industry stakeholders during the crisis. That clearly demonstrates the advantages of handling such matters ourselves, to the benefit of the industry and affected communities. The Scottish Government's swift response helped to keep Scotland free of foot-and-mouth disease. I am pleased that the report backs the Government's desire to devolve animal health budgets. It is vital that that should happen before DEFRA reduces expenditure on animal health.</p><p>I whole-heartedly welcome the report and the Scottish Government's commitment to taking forward the recommendations that it contains.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have experience of dealing with a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.

However, the alcohol problem is not confined to the ned scourge that was highlighted by the <em>Highland News</em>. A local alcohol worker who commented on the figures highlighted the change in the kind of people that services are working with. In particular, services are seeing increasing numbers of professionals, young people and women who have alcohol problems.</p><p>The conclusion that has been drawn by Highland NHS Board's director of public health, Dr Eric Baijal, was clear and unequivocal. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The figures underscore the need for Scotland to change its relationship with alcohol ... Despite ample evidence of the negative impact of drink on our health, our families and our society, we have begun to accept high levels of alcohol consumption as normal and I believe it will take bold steps to change this pattern.\"</p><p>His view is backed up by BMA Scotland, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Alcohol kills six people every day in Scotland\".</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Whilst drinking in moderation can be a source of pleasure, the effect of excessive alcohol consumption on our health and the related social and economic impact is significant.\"<place-holder colnum=\"11427\"/></p><p>The BMA Scotland briefing also states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is a clear health and social impact of alcohol misuse in Scotland. It is evident that no single approach can tackle Scotland's drink problem. A comprehensive strategy that encompasses pricing, availability and access to alcohol will be the most effective approach by Government.\"</p><p>I strongly believe that raising the age at which people can buy alcohol from shops will play a significant part in such a comprehensive strategy, but it will be just one part. Never before has alcohol been promoted more relentlessly and ruthlessly to our young people. Corner-shop store wars, supermarket loss leaders and commercially backed pub crawls are just some of the methods. Excess has become the norm in our young people's relationship with alcohol, and getting tanked up on cheap booze at home before heading out for the evening has become a routine part of a night out. Is that what the Tories want to encourage by what they see as a cheap political hit? Where is their sense of responsibility?</p><p>I believe that a ban on the sale of alcohol in off-sales to under-21s would have a positive impact in tackling the kind of underage drinking problems to which I referred earlier. There is no doubt that people in the 18 to 20 age group often help younger people by buying drink for them. The proposed ban would serve to cut off that supply. It would not limit the freedom of people aged between 18 and 20 to enjoy a drink in a pub or restaurant, but would have a significant impact on the hugely damaging excesses of our burgeoning drinking culture.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038047", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol Sales (Age Limits)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I quote a recent headline in the Inverness weekly newspaper, the Highland News : \"Price war fuels ned scourge?\" Sadly, the story is an all-too-familiar tale of modern Scottish life, in which \"two local shops\" are \"selling cut-price deals on Buckfast Tonic Wine - knocking \u00a32 off the price if they buy two bottles instead of one.\" As a result, an area that already had a problem with...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Dave", "last_name": "Thompson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80398", "house": "4", "member_id": "80398", "person_id": "14107", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, "section_id": "14038047", "hpos": "121", "gid": "2008-10-02.11426.3", "epobject_id": "14038096", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2008-10-02.11409.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14107+section%3Asp#g11426.3", "minor": "0", "htime": "11:11:00", "speaker_id": "80398"}, {"body": "<p>I welcome the minister's statement, which outlined a positive approach.

I thank the clerks, my fellow committee members, the previous convener and the previous deputy convener for their positive contributions throughout the inquiry.</p><p>There is no question about the importance of the tourism industry to the Scottish economy&#8212;the statistics have been bandied about already. We have been doing tourism for years, and the unique attractions of our rural and urban areas are rightly renowned within the United Kingdom and around the world. Over the years, our tourism industry has received significant amounts of public funding and undergone numerous relaunches, reorganisations and rebrandings. However, despite all our experience in the sector, standards of accommodation, catering and service still vary wildly. The best is excellent and rivals anything that is on offer in countries with which we compete; the worst can be truly dreadful.</p><p>That is hardly surprising when, as the committee's report highlighted, there are numerous hospitality training courses in Scotland, many of which appear not to produce the skills that hotel and restaurant businesses require. Although I am sure that they all have the best intentions, the plethora of public sector bodies and initiatives seems to duplicate and confuse rather than improve matters.</p><p>The report contains many good recommendations. I look forward to swift progress on two that are particularly important to addressing the issues that face the tourism industry in <place-holder colnum=\"11032\"/> Scotland. First, I was delighted to learn from the Scottish Government's response to the report that the industry, working with officials, has taken the lead in developing proposals for an industry-led and funded hotel school and that a business plan is expected to be ready soon for presentation to potential investors. However, I hope that we will have more than one hotel school.</p><p>During the committee's fact-finding trip to Austria earlier this year, I had a first-hand insight into the hugely positive impact that hotel schools can have on skills levels and professionalism in the industry. I am convinced that the development of such schools along the high-quality lines of the Austrian model would be of real and lasting benefit to the Scottish industry. It would be a huge step forward towards bridging the skills gap that has bedevilled the industry for years.</p><p>The ideal location for one such centre of excellence would be the Highlands, where tourism is a particularly vital element of the economy. If there is to be only one centre, we must have it. In the proposed development of a new campus for the UHI Millennium Institute in Inverness there exists the ideal opportunity to develop that much-needed facility on the scale required, although there are a number of other options.</p><p>Secondly, raising skill levels and investment in the industry must be reflected in pay rates for tourism workers. According to a report by Futureskills Scotland, our hospitality, travel and tourism sector is characterised by part-time working, a younger workforce, high labour turnover and low pay. Most folk agree that low pay means that pay is less than two thirds of the median hourly earnings. In 2006, that equated to &#163;6.50 an hour. Peter Kenway of the New Policy Institute think-tank estimates that no less than 75 per cent of Scottish hotel workers receive low pay. That hardly makes hospitality an attractive career choice. Efforts to grow the revenue of the industry must not be made at the expense of its workforce.</p><p>The demise of area tourist boards has seen the emergence of a growing number of private sector-led destination management organisations around Scotland. The first DMO was set up in the Cairngorms area in 2006 and many areas have since followed that lead. The fact that their arrival on the scene has evidently not been universally welcomed in the industry serves to highlight one of the long-standing and damaging problems within it. As a recent newspaper article put it:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The effective retreat from top-down centralisation that the rise of DMOs represents points to a still-unresolved power struggle at the centre of Scotland's tourism\".</p><p>If the industry is to grow in the way that it must, there can be no room for such turf wars. Partnership rather than power struggles between those who promote Scotland is the only <place-holder colnum=\"11033\"/> constructive way forward. I believe that the main promotion should be done at a Scottish level, while DMOs should concentrate on driving up standards.</p><p>Another basic question that we face if we are to grow Scotland's tourism industry is: how do we get people about? Perhaps that is not the most important issue in our cities, but it is certainly significant in the Highlands and Islands. I am a wee bit disappointed that the Government response does not refer to improvements to the transport links between the central belt, Aberdeen and Inverness.</p><p>In the area that is served by the Highlands and Islands transport partnership, there are 63 railway stations and 8,664 miles of roads. Unfortunately, getting off the train and on to the road is not always as straightforward as it should be. Difficulties in integrating train timetables with other transport types and a lack of interchange hubs for bus and rail services outwith the main centres present real obstacles to tourists using public transport.</p><p>Despite all the complex issues facing the Scottish tourist industry, I believe that it has the potential to achieve real and sustainable growth, despite the current economic crisis, and that it can reach the target of 50 per cent growth by 2015.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14005179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome Iain Smith to his first debate as the committee's convener.

He was getting ready for his annual trip to the Royal Highland show when his two sons called him to come and sit down in the kitchen because they had something important to say. They told him not to buy any animals at the show, because they would not be there to help him look after them. They said that they had no intention of staying on the croft and working as slaves for no income. Although their words saddened him, they came as no surprise. In recent years, he has seen the decline in crofting accelerate to the point at which he now believes that his generation of crofters will be the last. His vision of the future for areas such as the one in <place-holder colnum=\"10944\"/> which he has worked all his life is bleak: land without livestock or proper management, and dwindling, ageing and poor communities with few young people, schools or other services.</p><p>My friend is not alone in believing that our fragile hill and island areas have reached crisis point as the agricultural activities that have traditionally sustained and nurtured them become increasingly less viable. A recent headline in <em>The Scotsman </em>read, \"Highland clearances, pt 2&#8212;sheep's turn to be ousted from hills\". The story highlighted the dramatic drop in sheep numbers in some of our most vulnerable areas&#8212;up to 60 per cent in some parts&#8212;and warned that an exodus of people will follow.</p><p>The problems facing those areas have also recently been brought sharply into focus&#8212;as members have stated&#8212;by the RSE report, NFU Scotland's manifesto and other documents. From all that, it is clear that in London, where decisions are made that impact directly on the survival of our crofters and hill farmers, their activities are undervalued and there is little understanding of the problems that they face. The decline of hill farming and crofting is so much more than&#8212;to use George Bush's terminology in relation to American banking&#8212;an agricultural adjustment. For the areas that it affects&#8212;there are few parts of Scotland that it does not affect&#8212;there are serious social, economic and environmental implications.</p><p>There is no doubt that our fragile areas need support, and not just the kind of lifeline support that barely enables them to cling on. Without proper readily accessible support, they will cease to exist. We need to keep people on the land, and those people&#8212;as Alan Macrae of Assynt pointed out at last week's meeting of the cross-party group on crofting&#8212;need to be able to make a decent living. The UK Government has let us down on that front by failing to fight hard enough to secure the level of European support that we need.</p><p>One section of the RSE report starkly sets out just how badly the UK Government has let us down. The report's comparison of rural development funding between selected European Union states shows that between 2007 and 2013&#8212;I will repeat what has already been said, because it is worth repeating&#8212;Scotland's share is &#163;7.4 per hectare of utilised agricultural area per year. That is the lowest share by a long way, out of the 14 countries that were considered.</p><p>In Ireland, for example, the less favoured areas are provided with around &#163;178 million in support compared with the &#163;61 million that is spent on the LFASS in Scotland. Irish agri-environment schemes provide a further &#163;250 million, compared with some &#163;52 million in Scotland. In addition, Ireland provides &#8364;50 million to assist early retirement. Even so, compared to what is spent in <place-holder colnum=\"10945\"/> other countries, Irish support arrangements are not particularly generous.</p><p>An increase in the EU allocation is vital if we are to tackle our farming and crofting problems. If there is to be any hope of levelling the EU playing field and allowing our crofters and farmers to compete on level terms, it does not lie in the UK Government's proposal to end support in the 2013 CAP review, but Sarah Boyack thinks that it is nothing to do with the UK Government.

As the cabinet secretary has made clear, they will now provide at least minimum core services, including out-patient, day-case, in-patient and rehabilitation services; nurse-led care for urgent cases; initial management of broken bones; routine and emergency surgery; management of acute medical conditions; management of patients who have suffered a stroke; management of long-term conditions; midwife-led maternity care; and the management of patients with more complicated problems before their transfer.</p><p>On top of all that, there is more good news.

Our job and that of the cabinet secretary is to ensure that all views are given a fair hearing and that a revised CAP that enhances Scottish agriculture and our precious environment comes out of the process.</p><p>Of course, the CAP is not just for the benefit of the environment and people in agriculture; it is also for the benefit of the wider public. We must link it into our national food policy. The first steps towards that policy were taken in January. They were designed to boost jobs and business, help make food healthier and minimise the environmental impact of food production. The policy aims to join up Government policies on every part of the food chain, from the farm gate to the plate. The operation of the CAP will have a major effect on it.</p><p>Scotland produces some of the finest food in the world. Food is about much more than what we eat: it is about jobs, the environment, tourism and the health of our nation. It is therefore vital that we get all our food policies right to secure a healthier, wealthier and greener Scotland.</p><p>Adjusting the CAP is by no means the only problem that rural businesses and communities face. One of the primary causes of pressure on agriculture and current price inflation is the ever-rising cost of fuel, especially in the Highlands and Islands. We heard much about that in last night's parliamentary debate. In the past ten years, standard road fuel duty has increased by around 33 per cent; in the same period, the level of duty on red diesel has increased by 275 per cent, which is shocking. The NFU has clearly illustrated the effect of that on farmers and crofters. On 20 May, it said that the cost of filling one farmer's combine had gone up from &#163;267 last year to &#163;560 this year and that the cost of filling a tractor has gone up from &#163;89 to &#163;186. That was around 10 days ago; the cost will be even higher today. In the light of that real increase in costs, the chancellor must reduce fuel taxation if he is to have any credibility at all.

As members will know, the main advantage of crofting tenure is that it provides security of tenure. There was a time when landlords could easily get rid of tenants, who could be summarily evicted, but that all changed with the 1886 act. The act allowed landlords to remain landlords and collect rent, but it gave crofters security of tenure <place-holder colnum=\"8648\"/> and meant that crofters could pass their crofts on to their children in perpetuity. That approach had the advantage of allowing crofters to develop land safe in the knowledge that they and their descendants would reap the benefits. Such an approach is all the more important nowadays, when we need to encourage people to stay on and work the land. The free-for-all that was proposed in the Crofting Reform etc Bill would have changed all that and killed crofting stone dead in a generation.</p><p>To explain further the situation that led to the formation of the Shucksmith committee, I can do no better than quote the <em>West Highland Free Press</em>, which is not a Scottish National Party broadsheet and not a paper that contains opinions with which I usually agree, although I have done so more often recently&#8212;I think that it is mellowing.

Chief among those are the proposals to abolish the Crofters Commission, which would be replaced by locally elected bodies, and to simplify the legislation.</p><p>I want to highlight an issue that Shucksmith identified as a major concern for crofting communities and a root cause of their current difficulties: the availability, or lack of it, of affordable housing in crofting areas. Several members have already mentioned that issue, and it looks like we might get cross-party support in dealing with it. The housing problem is highlighted by the estimate that has been made that property <place-holder colnum=\"8649\"/> prices in crofting communities increased by up to 85 per cent between 2001 and 2005&#8212;a period of just four years. That increase is much higher than increases in the rest of the country. Some 88 per cent of people who were surveyed for the report regarded housing in their area as unaffordable.</p><p>The report seeks to address that fundamental problem, primarily by enhancing the croft house grant scheme to create a new croft house grant and loan scheme. That approach appears eminently sensible, as the minister acknowledged. The proposed croft house grant and loan scheme would be made up of a combination of a means-tested grant of up to &#163;30,000&#8212;up from the current maximum of &#163;22,000&#8212;and the reintroduction of non-means-tested loans at commercial rates that would be guaranteed by the Scottish Government or in some other way. Crucially, such a move is designed to permit house building without decrofting, as the enhanced croft house grant and loan scheme should not be available to those who decroft. The aim is to allow houses to be built or renovated without land being removed from crofting.</p><p>The report highlights the lack of logic in the current croft house grant scheme, which is pitched at too low a level to assist crofters, unless they decroft. That defeats the purpose of assisting crofters to build houses, as they have to cease being crofters to be eligible. As Jamie McGrigor said, the previous crofters building grants and loans scheme was regarded as one of the cornerstones of crofting support; indeed, an evaluation by DTZ Pieda Consulting in 1994 concluded that without the scheme, there would have been a substantial fall in crofting numbers. One must therefore wonder why it was subsequently replaced by an inferior scheme that has had a much poorer take-up. Let us hope that that was done for financial reasons. If so, it succeeded, because the croft house grant scheme now costs &#163;800,000 net annually, compared with the initial budget of &#163;3.6 million, which has recently been reduced to &#163;2.6 million because of a lack of take-up.</p><p>However, that is history. We must get behind the Shucksmith report and help to create a greener, fairer, smarter, safer, stronger, healthier and wealthier future for our crofting communities.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Surely the member can let me have a little bit of fun with the West Highland Free Press  and the Labour Party.

I remain optimistic that we can craft legislation that respects those diverse interests. The example of our two national parks is helpful in that regard.</p><p>I was sceptical at first. I worried that the national parks would stifle development and be detrimental to our local communities. The national park boards are not perfect, and questions over planning issues still need to be resolved, but, in general, planning controls have been applied in such a way as not to threaten the diverse interests in and around the national parks. That should give us all confidence that a marine bill can achieve the same balance between economic use of the seas and protection of our marine environment. The success of the national parks is in no small measure due to the locally elected elements on the boards&#8212;there is a strong case for having wholly elected boards. In that respect, I cannot emphasise enough the importance of taking local communities with us in developing the marine bill.</p><p>The potential benefits of a consolidated marine bill are clear, but at the top of the list must be simpler rules and regulations for the benefit of all, and a stronger, more sustainable marine environment to hand on to future generations. I am <place-holder colnum=\"7236\"/> confident that, with appropriate protections, the industries that share the waters&#8212;fishing, shipping, tourism, leisure, renewable energy, oil and gas&#8212;can remain rich and robust. I am hopeful that we will be able to get even more out of our seas than we do at present without detriment to them. It is essential that the bill does not place one interest above another. It would be remiss of us to save the fish while killing the local economy or to support the economy at the expense of our marine life.</p><p>Should the marine bill make provision for marine parks, it must not impose them on communities that do not want them. For instance, there is strong opposition to the imposition of a marine park on the west coast. Community interest must be the paramount consideration, because marine parks will work only where they are wanted. I was, therefore, interested to hear John Scott suggest that there is local support for such a park in the Solway Firth.</p><p>Local communities have a great deal at stake. More than 70 per cent of Scots live within 10km of the coast, and an estimated &#163;4.5 billion in revenue is provided by marine activities on or immediately near our shores. We must, therefore, secure the support of our coastal communities for the proposed bill and show them that responsible legislation can provide a net benefit to them by supplementing instead of subtracting, protecting instead of pillaging, and building instead of breaking. In addressing our objectives for a marine bill, we must include safeguards for fishermen and others who rely on their trade to feed their families, as well as safeguards to protect our marine environment. There is no doubt that many people will be worried about the effects of a marine bill. We must reassure them not only that they will not be harmed, but that more work can and will be created.</p><p>Let us take the Highlands and Islands as an example. Highlands and Islands Enterprise estimates that 2,800 jobs are directly supported by sea fishing and that another 2,200 are indirectly linked. Many more people are employed in fish farming, tourism, sea angling and so on. Those are all important jobs that sustain our local communities, and we must build on them in a marine bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401333", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The marine bill debate raises a number of issues, including the need for enhanced environmental protection that respects the rich diversity of our marine life; the need to protect local workers and economies from heavy-handed and intrusive legislation that threatens their livelihoods; and the need for us to respect the communities that a marine bill will affect.

However, the key is not to undermine the entire purpose of the parks. That is what we would do if we responded to the review too harshly or too irrationally by making sweeping changes without the slightest regard for the consequences. Any potential changes to the parks must be thoroughly investigated to ensure that we do not lose more than we gain.</p><p>Much of the debate has centred on the size of the national park authority boards and the breadth of their jurisdiction in relation to other authorities. Of course, the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority and the Cairngorms National Park Authority differ in those respects. Any review must examine whether there is still justification for such differences.</p><p>Both parks have done a commendable job in responding to the needs of those within their boundaries and are developing an expertise that is representative of the wide range of perspectives and experience within their bounds. With the <place-holder colnum=\"6999\"/> proper structure and support, there is no doubt that the national parks can provide the most complete and comprehensive services for our communities. However, the review can succeed in improving the parks to make them even stronger and more efficient, if it is carried out sensibly and not in a knee-jerk way. If we overreact negligently and irrationally, we will condemn our national parks to substandard services and an unnecessary fate.</p><p>During the review, we must remember the four aims that were set out in the 2000 act: first, to conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage; secondly, to promote the sustainable use of the natural resources of the area; thirdly, to promote understanding and enjoyment by the public of the special qualities of the area; and fourthly, to promote sustainable social and economic development of the communities of the area. The fourth aim is the most important, as without thriving communities there is no point in having a national park.</p><p>Handing the keys to an agency that would not meet all four aims would be negligence and a breach of our responsibility. I am glad that today the minister has made it clear that he does not favour that option, but I fear that the suggestion may gain ground in some areas. Even if the option were pursued with the best of intentions, the result for the parks and surrounding communities would be regrettable. Other authorities, already burdened by their current responsibilities, would not be able to give the national parks the attention that they require. Other leaders, already burdened with policy areas and duties, would not be able to focus on the environmental, economic and tourism-related issues that the parks consider and support. Other priorities that were created and are already valued by those with different duties might be given more importance and attention than the priorities that have been set for the parks.</p><p>We should allow the parks the authority to manage what is within their boundaries.

Both of those measures are necessary if we are to cut the death toll on our roads. I just hope that cabinet secretary MacAskill does not have to wait three months only to receive a negative reply from Ruth Kelly, as I had to do last year.</p><p>Last August, Northern Constabulary ran a campaign to crack down on drink-driving, and in two weeks it caught more than two dozen drink-drivers. As I examined the matter further, I found that throughout Scotland one in six road deaths is caused by drink-driving, and that in the Highlands and Islands we suffer from a drink-driving rate that is 27 per cent higher than the national average. That is what spurred me on to start my campaign. I believe that a reduction to 50mg, coupled with the introduction of random breath-testing, would send a strong message that drink-driving is not acceptable.</p><p>There is a huge cost to drink-driving&#8212;on average, each road death costs the Scottish taxpayer an estimated &#163;1.4 million, which is money that could be far better spent on other things. Injuries add to that, and the emotional burden takes an even greater toll. If, by reducing the drink-driving limit, we were to save just one person from an untimely death, one family from <place-holder colnum=\"6874\"/> untold grief, and one community from undue suffering, it would be worth it.</p><p>A reduction in the limit from 80mg to 50mg has wide support in Scotland, from prominent people such as Cardinal Keith O'Brien and from organisations such as the Automobile Association; the British Medical Association; the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents; the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland; the Scottish Police Federation; a number of councils; and the west of Scotland road safety forum, which incorporates all 12 councils in the west of Scotland and a number of other bodies. There is huge support in Scotland for change and for a reduction in our drink-driving limit.</p><p>On top of that, and for more than six years, the European Commission has lobbied the United Kingdom Government to reduce the limit. The UK is now one of only four European Union countries with an 80mg limit&#8212;the other three are Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta. Despite the evidence of massive support in Scotland for a reduction in the limit, Westminster's response to date on this reserved issue has been to twiddle its thumbs and mumble excuses. The UK Government cites a need for better enforcement before it will consider a change in the law and, despite acknowledging the broad support for a lower limit, it ignores the will of the people and takes a pass on the issue.</p><p>Why should drivers who would be prosecuted in 23 other European countries be deemed safe enough for Scotland's streets? According to the Institute of Alcohol Studies, 23 per cent of road deaths in 2004 involved alcohol levels over 50mg, and nearly one in 10 of those deaths occurred when the driver had an alcohol level of between 50mg and 79mg. Above 50mg, drivers face decreased alertness, slower reactions and impaired co-ordination. The UK Government's research paper for the Road Safety Bill in 2006 found that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"at levels between 50mg and 80mg an average driver is around 2 or 2.5 times as likely to be involved in an accident.\"</p><p>The figure is even worse for young or inexperienced drivers, whose risk may be increased fivefold. We all know of the many accidents in recent times that have involved young drivers, especially on country roads.</p><p>Having published its own research, the Westminster Government either did not read it or did not like it, because it did not implement a reduced limit. Our duty is never to hide behind a wall of stubbornness, and never to accept looser regulations simply because it has always been that way. The science has spoken, and we have its support. Drink-drivers with a level between 50mg and 79mg are threatening our roads, our <place-holder colnum=\"6875\"/> families and our communities. We cannot let that continue.</p><p>Des Browne, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said recently:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For those who want to make the argument about halving the drink-driving limit, there will be an opportunity for them to do that, and if that's the right thing to do, then it should be the right thing across the UK.\"</p><p>He is absolutely right, but the Labour debate has been going on for 10 years. How long does Des Browne want?</p><p>The debate in Scotland has come to a conclusion. We want a reduced drink-driving limit, and if Labour will not act for the UK, it should at least act for Scotland, with a pilot scheme to test the success of a reduced limit. If Westminster will not do that, it must give us the power to act. Either way, it needs to step up to the plate. We have endured the delays and listened to its double-speak. How many more deaths must we endure before Westminster acts? At present, it is driving the wrong way down a one-way street. People are being killed.

The point is, of course, to bring the full spectrum of ideas and backgrounds to the table for the benefit of all.</p><p>Parliament is challenged to fix the obvious inequalities. There is a vast amount of work left to do before the boards of our public bodies reflect the society around them.</p><p>Using the usual parameters, which are the only measure available to us, we see, as Marlyn Glen said, that just 35 per cent of board members and 17 per cent of conveners are women, even though women comprise 52 per cent of the overall population. Even more startling is the fact that disabled persons and those with long-term illnesses are represented by just 2.5 per cent of members and conveners of public bodies, despite their accounting for 20 per cent of Scotland's population. Indeed, only ethnic minorities are represented at a rate similar to the proportion of the population for which they account. However, that is the overall figure; it is not shown city by city or region by region.</p><p>There are no figures to tell us how diverse the appointments to our public bodies are in respect of background, education, location, upbringing and other life experience, to which the report refers. How many non-graduates, working class people or Gaelic or Scots speakers get appointed? We know that all Scotland's citizens, of every race, gender and background, have much to give our great nation. I believe that, so far, we have seen only a glimpse of their gifts and a small part of their potential. The enormous talent, wisdom and sense of purpose shown by our public bodies can only <place-holder colnum=\"6780\"/> grow stronger and more representative through the efforts of this Parliament and initiatives such as those that are suggested in the report.</p><p>We face challenges with our public appointments, but the recommendations in the report are the right response: recognise our shortcomings, make plans to ensure improvement and promote the principles of the Scotland Act 1998 through the actions of this Parliament.

That allowed anyone who was interested to do sampling and mental calculations. It was an unintended bonus of the shambles that made up for the fact that we could not do our normal ballot box sampling. Over a few hours, I worked out that the SNP was likely to get around 35 per cent of the list vote in the Highlands and Islands, so we should expect to gain a total of at least five seats, if not six. As I would be returned for the sixth of those seats, I began to think that I might just become an MSP.</p><p>So it was with some hope that I returned to the Inverness aquadome on that fateful Friday morning, having had only a couple of hours to freshen up since the night before. It was not until 5.30 in the afternoon that I would be announced as the SNP's 47<sup>th</sup> member of the Scottish Parliament, thereby giving us a majority of one over Labour and making us the largest party in the Scottish Parliament. At that time, I became the SNP's slim majority&#8212;the majority that allowed us to form the first ever SNP Government and take a huge stride towards independence.</p><p>The delay in announcing the Highlands and Islands regional list result was the result of a decision to count and announce all 80 of the Highland Council results first, even though very little work remained to be done on the regional list result. That is another good example of why we should decouple the elections&#8212;to avoid such problems in future.<place-holder colnum=\"4990\"/></p><p>It was at around 5 o'clock that the returning officer called the Scottish Parliament regional list candidates together to give them the result. We all crowded around, eager for a glimpse of the figures. Imagine our shock and horror when the returning officer showed us a sheet with four seats for Labour, two for the Tories and one for the Greens. The Labour candidates ran off screaming that they had four seats and had won the election; the Tories were speechless that they had two, as they expected to get only one; and the Greens could not believe that they had got one at all. The returning officer asked us whether we were all happy with the result, and headed for the podium to announce the results.</p><p>I looked heavenward and asked the Lord how he could have done that to me, and immediately realised that the figures must be wrong. I had a quick exchange with my election agent and we leapt into action. I moved in front of the returning officer, while my agent took the rear. The weary&#8212;nay, exhausted&#8212;returning officer's face was a picture, as he was confronted by what were, in his mind, two disaffected bad losers. He asked whether we wanted to challenge the results, and we said yes. He asked whether we wanted to see the calculations, and we said yes. So off he went, and returned with his A4 Excel spreadsheet&#8212;which, by the way, is not recommended for use in such circumstances.</p><p>The returning officer kindly explained the d'Hondt PR system to me, with its calculation of total regional vote one, divided by total constituency seats one, plus one, with the party that ended up with the greatest remaining figure getting the first additional seat, and so on. It was clear as mud, but I am sure that members all understand. He went through each individual calculation, until I pointed out that he was not including the SNP column in his calculations. He left in a hurry and came back after 25 minutes with a revised calculation, which gave Labour three seats, the Tories two and the SNP two. I was an SNP MSP, and we had won the election&#8212;the rest is history. The returning officer's exhaustion, however, after around 36 hours with little or no sleep, nearly negated that historic moment, and is another reason why the system must change to ensure that we get it right next time.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395562", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gould Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are all too well aware of the comedy of errors that was the Scottish election on 3 May last year, when more than 146,000 votes&#8212;almost 3.5 per cent of the total votes cast&#8212;were rejected.

Tourism therefore plays an extremely important role in the Scottish economy.</p><p>Tourism is even more important in the Highlands and Islands, which is comparatively more dependent on tourism than the rest of Scotland. Tourism contributes &#163;750 million a year to the Highlands and Islands economy and sustains more than 2,600 individual businesses and 23,800 jobs, or roughly 13 per cent of total employment. In a sense, therefore, the Highlands and Islands has already reached the target that has been set, as it is 50 per cent ahead of the rest of Scotland, but that does not mean that we can rest on our <place-holder colnum=\"3897\"/> laurels; indeed, we must strive even harder to build on what we already have. To do so not only in the Highlands and Islands but in the rest of Scotland, we must do two things: improve the visitor experience with a higher-value product and market effectively. Any development in the Scottish tourism industry needs effective marketing and national and international research. It is right that VisitScotland should devote the bulk of its budget to visitor engagement. Some &#163;45 million of its &#163;71 million budget is put to that purpose.</p><p>In total, some &#163;90 million of Government money is being provided this year for the tourism sector&#8212;through VisitScotland, the enterprise agencies, Scottish Natural Heritage, Historic Scotland and local authorities. There has also been a firm commitment by the SNP Government to improve infrastructure in Scotland, with work already under way on the A9 and improvements set for rail links between Edinburgh and Inverness.</p><p>It is a pity that more was not done over the past eight years. Inverness airport terminal is in need of expansion to support increasing demand, as it is nearing capacity. Now that airline operators such as Flybe offer cheap deals to various locations in England, this is the perfect time to capitalise on an already flourishing airport. I am hopeful that the minister will give the go-ahead to expansion of the terminal at Inverness airport&#8212;I will keep pressing him hard on that.</p><p>Realistically, if we want to meet the 50 per cent target, we cannot simply rely on traditional tourist attractions to facilitate that growth. Although we enjoy a swathe of such tourist attractions, the Scottish tourism industry must continue to grab the attention of different types of tourists, and we must learn from other countries. Places such as Kitzb&#252;hel in Austria and the Whistler mountain range in Canada have successfully implemented the destination management concept, which is based on the notion of improving the visitor experience, providing jobs locally and nurturing the tourism market. Those places are flourishing, and they give the visitor a tremendous experience. We need to emulate that.</p><p>Destination management organisations are already being set up in the Cairngorms and Loch Ness. Destination Loch Ness is a good example of what we need to do, although it is in its early stages, having been set up only in May 2006. Destination Loch Ness is a group of tourism businesses that operate around Loch Ness, and it is actively engaged in applying a collaborative destination development approach to improving the visitor experience in that area. The members of Destination Loch Ness are working hard to engage with a wider group of businesses and community groups, and they have embarked on a <place-holder colnum=\"3898\"/> number of activities that will support their long-term, sustainable ambitions. Destination Loch Ness has already made progress towards securing world heritage status from the United Nations Educational, Scientific &amp; Cultural Organization. It is leading by example, and I hope that members will encourage tourism businesses in their own areas to follow that example.</p><p>Finally, it is crucial that we encourage the millions of visitors who flock to Edinburgh and Glasgow to venture that bit further north.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the member for that information, but it remains the target that we are all aiming to achieve.

Peter Peacock says that the science is inexact, but the fishermen have been telling us that for many years.</p><p>The UK fisheries minister, Jonathan Shaw, now agrees with Joe Borg that discards are immoral and that the quota system leads to discards. The answer is obviously to increase the quotas and control fishing effort in other ways. We should close areas, have observers on boats to watch what is going on and use selective gear.

As Rhoda Grant said, in the most recent HM inspectorate of prisons report, from 2004, the staff at Porterfield prison in Inverness were highly praised. Considering the outdated infrastructure and high levels of overcrowding, that is true testament to Scottish Prison Service staff. Of course, Inverness is not alone. Prisons throughout Scotland have had excellent reports on their staff but lacklustre evaluations of facilities and infrastructure.</p><p>Porterfield prison is a good example of the problem that we face after years of neglect by the Executive of Rhoda Grant's party. Labour, along with the Liberals, had almost 3,000 days to solve the problem, compared with our SNP Government's 100-odd days so far, yet this Government has already announced &#163;120 million a year for prison improvements, which will include a new prison at Peterhead&#8212;the current prison would have been closed if nothing had been done.</p><p>The long-standing problem at Porterfield was highlighted recently by Alastair MacDonald, a former governor of the prison, who stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Recently, Porterfield Prison has been bursting at the seams and something may give soon. Despite the ongoing forced transportation of Highland prisoners of all ages and genders to overcrowded prisons in the central belt numbers have frequently exceeded 170.\"<place-holder colnum=\"2029\"/></p><p>On his retirement, which was not that long ago, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The prison population has gone up by 40% in 30 years and it is accelerating. How soon are we going to see 10,000 people locked up in Scotland? What is driving us as a nation to lock up so many people?\"</p><p>He also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"When I started in the prison service, 96 in every 100,000 of the population in Scotland were in prison. It is now 135 per 100,000. Overcrowding is getting worse and nothing has been put in place to help the situation.\"</p><p>Finally, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There has been practically no investment in Inverness Prison since the early 90s.\"</p><p>Labour and the Libs have a lot to answer for.</p><p>The answer is not simply to build new prisons; we must also strive to reduce the prison population. It is important that jail is reserved for dangerous offenders and for the punishment of serious offences. A clear line must be drawn between serious criminals and minor offenders. We must realise that prison is not necessarily the best solution for all offenders. Lesser wrongdoings should merit tougher community penalties rather than short stints in prison, which achieve little and can exacerbate existing problems. In many cases, community punishments are far more effective and help offenders to re-engage with their communities.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, I am pleased that the Government has announced a new prison at Peterhead to replace the prisons at Peterhead and Aberdeen. I am also pleased by the announcement that the replacement prison at Bishopbriggs will now be publicly run. There is no doubt that public money is better spent on public projects. If we are to deal with the overcrowding in and poor infrastructure of our prisons, it is important that we ensure that public money is spent in the most effective way. We do not need new buildings that create an environment of resentment; we must create an environment of rehabilitation. Why should taxpayers' money go towards keeping criminals under lock and key when they will reoffend the second that they get out?</p><p>Year after year, the Scottish Prison Service sees the same faces, with a reoffending rate of epidemic proportions. Too little has been done in the past to address that revolving-door effect. Latest Government figures show that about 60 per cent of the current inmate population are reoffenders. That is neither acceptable nor sensible. Given the strain caused by overcrowding in prisons such as Porterfield in Inverness, there needs to be a focus on ensuring the success of rehabilitation, to ease the problem. As has been said, many prisoners have poor literacy skills, <place-holder colnum=\"2030\"/> which holds them back from gaining useful employment and reintegrating into society. Alastair MacDonald said that in Porterfield</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a third of inmates ... could not read or write their own name, with 50% not even at the academic level of a primary 6 child.\"</p><p>That is shocking. If those offenders are given the ability to contribute to society through better education while in prison, we will all gain.</p><p>We need to maintain strong relationships between local police officers and residents in our communities. Local bobbies should be trusted and well-known figures. Their role is not only to fight crime but to build a relationship that breeds confidence in and co-operation and comradeship with their communities.</p><p>Despite a rise in crime in the past year, Inverness remains one of the safest cities in Scotland, because Northern Constabulary has a positive bond with its community. Officers in the Highlands and Islands are a visible, trusted and dependable force. Residents feel that they can talk to the police about their concerns&#8212;whether vandalism, knife crime or drug abuse&#8212;and the police are perceived positively, in the main. Of course, all is not perfect. More needs to be done to allow police officers to stay in their communities for longer, to help them to build local bonds.</p><p>Our culture of drink, drugs and deprivation needs to be replaced by a culture of hope, responsibility and respect. Offenders should come out of prison positively changed by the experience. We need to give prisoners the ability to go on and make something out of their lives. Prison needs to become constructive and to have a more practical purpose than just keeping criminals off the streets. I hope that the cabinet secretary and the Government will continue the good progress that has been made, and that they will take into account some of the more practical solutions that have been offered today.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13388206", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Penal Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are all too aware of the overcrowded, overstretched and underresourced state of our Scottish prisons, which are kept afloat only by the sterling work of their staff.

The pressure on buyers means that they are in no position to defend themselves against unscrupulous builders. It is disturbing to find that some builders are reducing snagging periods on new houses to a matter of months.

I welcome her earlier announcement of increased funding for free personal care. I also congratulate the Minister for Public Health on her appointment. I wish them both well as they tackle the difficult issues that will confront them over the next four years.</p><p>I have never spoken in the chamber before and it gives me great pleasure to stand here today and make my maiden speech. I have dreamed of this since I was 16&#8212;although the chamber did not exist then. What did exist was the dream of many people such as me of a Parliament for Scotland. Now we have that Parliament and it is growing and developing. Now, I dream of making a speech in a fully independent, grown-up Scottish Parliament. I know that my dream will come true.</p><p>I have the great honour of representing the Highlands and Islands, which includes Moray, where I was born and brought up&#8212;although Moravians dinna really see themselves as Highlanders. As a Lossie loon who has lived and worked in the Highlands for 24 years and who has also lived and worked in Na h-Eileanan an Iar&#8212;the Western Isles&#8212;for 10 years, I hope that I have learned a little about the challenges that we face in this most beautiful and diverse region.</p><p>We have much going for us in the Highlands and Islands in terms of our natural resources. We have fishing, farming, forestry, rocks and gravel, water, oil, gas, aquaculture and renewables coming out of our ears. We also of course have whisky. However, all is not well. Many of our young folk still leave, which is why we have 10,000 missing <place-holder colnum=\"804\"/> 16 to 29-year-olds and low wages. Much of our work is seasonal and part-time. We educate our young for export, which is why our unemployment rate is low. Many of those who stay have little hope of a bright future and virtually no hope of a home of their own.</p><p>We also have an increasingly elderly population because we are all living longer and because many choose to retire to the Highlands and Islands. That brings its own problems. There is an increasing demand for more care in the community to allow our older folk to stay in their own homes for as long as possible&#8212;if only to stop the state getting its hands on that prized asset. It is right to help people to maintain their independence for as long as possible, but we must also ensure that adequate residential care is available in their local communities for those who need it.</p><p>The Government is committed to delivering free personal and nursing care for the elderly, but it must be available to all, equally, including those in rural and remote areas. The right to such care in all communities is important. The elderly must have the comfort and confidence of knowing that their needs will be catered for in their locality, even after they are no longer able to stay in their own home and have to enter a residential care home. For many, that will not be a problem, as there will be plenty of choice in their local community, either in the private sector or in local authority facilities. That is not the case for everyone, however, as rural and remote areas with sparse populations will not attract the private sector. Public sector residential care homes are so important because they will be the only choice. That is why I am so pleased that Highland Council, which is run by an SNP and independent administration, has decided to look again at the privatisation of a number of care homes across the region with a view to keeping them in-house.</p><p>It is great that the new council has moved so quickly on the privatisation of care homes. I hope that it will also reconsider the decision by the previous administration to close Graham House, a residential care home in Dornie on the west coast, and replace it with a facility that will have no residential or respite care capability. Should that go ahead, there will be no residential care facility in Lochalsh&#8212;public or private&#8212;for local elderly folk who need such care. That is not acceptable. If the closure goes ahead, it will mean that many of the elderly who need residential care may be placed in Broadford hospital on Skye, when they need not be there, or may be placed many miles from their home, their friends and their family. I ask members to imagine that they were born, brought up and spent their whole life in Lochalsh and were told in their 80s that they were to be sent nearly 100 miles away to Invergordon, on the <place-holder colnum=\"805\"/> other side of the country, to live in a residential home where they know no one and where their friends and family would find it impossible to visit them regularly. They would end their days far from all that they know and love, in lonely isolation. Is that how we want to treat our old folk? How does that square with our equal opportunities obligations? Homes such as Graham House must be kept open. There is a proven need for Graham House, as there are six elderly people currently in residence, a further six who have already been sent elsewhere and another 12 coming to the age when they will need residential care. What we need to do in Lochalsh is to replace Graham House with a larger and better residential home as our population gradually ages.</p><p>Of course, Graham House also provides valuable respite care, so that carers can get a short break from the stress and strain of caring. Carers do a wonderful job. They save the country a fortune and they deserve all the help that we can give them. At lunch time today I attended the launch of the carers guide and the cross-party group on carers. I look forward to working in that group over the coming years.</p><p>Of course, keeping homes such as Graham House open comes at a cost, but if we are to live up to our promise that health care is provided as locally as possible, we must support councils such as Highland Council that have problems in providing such facilities in rural and remote areas. At the end of the day, it is all about equality. The elderly in Lochalsh deserve treatment equal to that of the elderly anywhere else in Scotland. As the cabinet secretary said, it should not depend on where someone stays: personal care must be available everywhere in Scotland. The closure of Graham House will be a disaster for the community in Lochalsh. I am pressing Highland Council to reconsider its decision. I also hope that the cabinet secretary and the minister will respond sympathetically to the needs of councils such as Highland Council in their efforts to provide local residential care in rural and remote areas in the absence of the private sector.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385202", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Free Personal Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I have not yet spoken in a debate led by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, I congratulate her on her recent appointment.
