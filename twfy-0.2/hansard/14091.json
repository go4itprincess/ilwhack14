Regrettably, little has changed: the issue of world hunger is still one of the most serious development challenges that the world faces.</p><p>As Sarah Boyack&#8217;s motion states, nearly a billion people around the world do not get enough food, and undernutrition holds back the growth and development of millions of children. As has already been said, each year 2.3 million children die from malnutrition and 14 per cent of all women, men and children go to bed hungry every night&#8212;a truly shocking statistic.</p><p>Food prices have recently been at their highest in decades and are increasingly volatile. The high prices affect not only developing countries: even in the UK, many hard-working people struggle to find the money to feed their families, as highlighted this week in north Ayr, in my constituency, where 33 per cent of children&#8212;or one in three&#8212;are born into and reared in poverty. As anyone who visits a supermarket can see, there is enough food for everyone, but people cannot afford to buy it. The rising number of food banks in South Ayrshire and across Scotland is further testimony to that, if one was needed.</p><p>There is little doubt that climate change is having an impact on global food production, and extreme weather events are also causing food price spikes as well as concerns over security of supply. Last year, the Scottish Government announced that it would set up the climate justice fund, and the first funding commitments were announced in June of last year&#8212;well done.</p><p>The UN summit at Doha this year was a key opportunity to promote the work that is already being done in Scotland and in the UK, and I encourage all countries, particularly those in the EU as they deliberate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, to understand the importance of food security and the implications of climate change and to join us in taking steps to mitigate its impacts.</p><p>The motion calls on the UK Government to do more to tackle food poverty and to protect land from abuse. I will outline briefly what is already being done on a UK level. Under the coalition Government, UK annual spend on nutrition has almost doubled from &#163;19.3 million in 2009-10 to &#163;37.5 million in 2011-12. Last year, during the London Olympics, ministers used the international exposure to hold a global hunger summit, which led to the commitment to develop and deliver drought-resistant and vitamin-enriched crops that could help to feed millions of people. As has already been mentioned, women and children are often worst affected by hunger and poverty. By 2015, the UK will have reached 20 million pregnant women and children under five with nutrition programmes.</p><p>The if campaign calls for the UK Government to meet its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product on development spending and to take full advantage of the UK presidency of the G8. This year, the UK Government will become the first G8 country to meet that commitment, and ministers plan to use a major event before the G8 summit to drive further global action to reduce hunger and malnutrition.</p><p>The UK Government will also drive forward progress on the G8 new alliance for food security and nutrition, which aims to lift 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years through sustainable agricultural growth.</p><p>Another concern relating to the provision of food and sustainability of crops is the issue of large companies avoiding paying taxes, thus depriving developing countries of the funds that are necessary to implement food security measures. The Prime Minister has put tackling tax avoidance at the top of the G8 agenda, but this is a global issue that needs to be tackled on a global scale. In the Prime Minister&#8217;s recent letter to G8 leaders, he highlighted that they can lead the way in information sharing to tackle abuses of the system, including in developing countries, so that Governments can collect the taxes that are due to them.</p><p>This is a matter of enormous importance to those who are less fortunate than ourselves and to my constituents at Riverside church in Ayr, who have drawn the if campaign to my attention. I look forward to hearing from the minister what further help the Scottish Government is able to give in support of the enormously worth while if campaign.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Enough Food for Everyone If Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Sarah Boyack for bringing this campaign to the Scottish Parliament and for securing a debate on her motion, which I am delighted to support.

It is my privilege to open this debate in my capacity as leader of the Scottish Parliament delegation to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</p><p>As members may be aware, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly&#8212;BIPA&#8212;was initially established as the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Its first meeting was held in London in 1990, when the constitution was agreed and the first plenary session was held. Originally the body consisted of 25 members of the United Kingdom Parliament and 25 members of the Irish Parliament.</p><p>In 2001, following the 1998 Good Friday agreement and the establishment of the British-Irish Council to foster further dialogue between Governments in the British isles, the membership of the body was enlarged to include representatives of the legislatures in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey, with Scotland having five members of the enlarged 68-member assembly. In 2008, the name British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly was adopted to reflect the new era of relations between Britain and Ireland, following the signing of the St Andrew&#8217;s day agreement in 2006.</p><p>Although the connections between the peoples of the British isles are clearly close and long-standing, sadly it has not always been possible to say the same of relations between their political representatives. The creation of BIPA has provided not only an arena for parliamentarians to pursue a peaceful political dialogue on issues in the north of Ireland, building on the foundations laid by the peace process, but a forum for parliamentarians from across the British isles to discuss topics of mutual concern and to promote co-operation among us all.</p><p>The recent BIPA plenary session in Glasgow was only the second occasion on which the plenary has been held in Scotland. It was a great pleasure to welcome colleagues from across the British isles and to showcase the quality of hospitality that the city of Glasgow and, indeed, Scotland offer.</p><p>The plenary session focused on the topics of the Scottish economy and Scottish-Irish relations. A wide range of speakers addressed the plenary, including Fergus Ewing, our own Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism; Teresa Villiers MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; Graeme Smith from the Scottish Trades Union Congress; Graham Riddell from VisitScotland; and Iain McMillan of the Confederation of British Industry Scotland.</p><p>The plenary session provided an opportunity to engage with the Irish diaspora organisations in Scotland, who also attended the dinner that was hosted by the deputy lord provost of Glasgow City Council, Gerald Leonard, and addressed by the Presiding Officer. I should say what a wonderful setting Glasgow City Chambers was for that occasion and, on behalf of the Scottish parliamentary delegation, I thank the deputy lord provost for the generous welcome and hospitality that he provided.</p><p>Looking around the chamber, I see members who have had involvement in BIPA in previous sessions of Parliament, as well as my colleagues in BIPA in the current parliamentary session, who are Willie Coffey, Alison McInnes, Michael McMahon and Mary Scanlon. Past members from all parties include Iain Smith, Bruce Crawford, Hugh Henry, Robin Harper and Murray Tosh, to name but a few. At the Glasgow plenary we were very pleased to welcome James Dornan, who is currently one of our associates.</p><p>During the debate, I look forward to hearing from colleagues about their experiences of involvement in BIPA and their views on how the assembly can develop. Although the initial impetus for the establishment of BIPA arose from the Northern Ireland peace process and encouraging dialogue between parliamentarians who previously had little contact&#8212;and little in common&#8212;my view is that BIPA has moved on from those beginnings to focus on issues that can bring tangible benefits to all our constituents, notably in the fields of transport connections, energy and economic development.</p><p>In addition to my role on the BIPA steering committee, members of the Scottish Parliament delegation are involved in three of the four BIPA committees&#8212;those dealing with European issues, economic affairs, and environmental and social affairs. Those committees have been working on a range of reports recently, including on the small and medium enterprise sector, the Irish community in Britain and human trafficking. The committees meet at different times from the plenary session, as well as during plenary sessions on occasion.</p><p>The BIPA committee reports are sent by the BIPA secretariat to the Governments that are represented on the British-Irish Council and are invaluable in providing a short and focused analysis of a particular issue. We in BIPA are increasingly looking to disseminate the findings of those committee reports to our own Parliaments and parliamentary committees to supplement the work that is carried out in all the Parliaments and Assemblies across the British Isles.</p><p>The location of the British-Irish Council offices in Edinburgh is emblematic of the key role that MSPs can play in fostering greater co-operation not only between parliamentarians across the British isles but with the British-Irish Council itself.</p><p>Following the BIPA plenary in Dublin, in May this year both the D&#225;il and the House of Commons held debates in their respective chambers to discuss the outcomes of the plenary session. Therefore, I am delighted that we are having this debate following the Glasgow plenary, and I look forward to future debates in the chamber following BIPA plenary sessions.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly (Autumn Plenary 2012)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Deputy Presiding Officer.

The timing of the debate could not be more appropriate.</p><p>James Watt, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Babbage are names that are commonly associated with the industrial revolution, but today it is important to recognise the contributions of William Murdoch, who would have turned 258 this year, had he been still alive.</p><p>As I am sure all members are aware, the great Murdoch was born and bred in Ayrshire in almost the same time and place as Robert Burns and within sight of Boswell&#8217;s home at Auchinleck. Although much of his professional career was spent in Birmingham and Cornwall, his formative years were spent in Lugar, Cumnock and Auchinleck, where my ancestors came from&#8212;my mother always maintained that his family and ours were distantly related.</p><p>But back to Murdoch. He is known for his innovations to the steam engine and for creating a prototype steam locomotive in 1784. However, as has been said, he is probably better known for discovering the ability of gas to create light. He first lit his own house in Redruth in Cornwall in 1792, and six years later he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry in Birmingham, where he worked with Matthew Boulton and James Watt. His skill was such that he also worked on one of the first British paddle-steamers to cross the English Channel&#8212;the Caledonia&#8212;and made a number of discoveries in chemistry. It is also reported that, through his father, Murdoch was involved in the construction of one of the bridges over the River Nith.</p><p>Boulton described Murdoch as</p><p>&#8220;the most active man and best engine erector I ever saw&#8221;</p><p>and while there is no questioning his ability, Murdoch is undoubtedly&#8212;as Adam Ingram said&#8212;one of the unsung heroes of the industrial revolution. His employers Boulton and Watt are credited with many of his inventions, but correspondence from Boulton in particular indicates the vital contribution that Murdoch made to many&#8212;if not all&#8212;the Boulton-Watt inventions. Despite his pioneering work with gas, Murdoch derived no significant financial benefit from his invention due to his failure to obtain a patent in his own name.</p><p>As is often the case with engineers, Murdoch frequently experimented with technology, and that led him also to devise the first pneumatic message system, which was later developed by the London Pneumatic Dispatch Company and was reportedly adopted by Harrod&#8217;s. In my childhood, the same system was still in use in Glasgow and Edinburgh shops.</p><p>However, it is fair to say that the steam engine was Murdoch&#8217;s first love, with most of his best work being associated with it. In 1817, after James Watt junior bought the Caledonia, Murdoch began on work to make her seaworthy by building and installing new engines and boilers. His engineering genius extended to marine engineering and his work was so successful that Boulton and Watt even received an order from their competitors for a new steamboat engine. Orders soon followed from commercial customers and the Royal Navy. It is estimated that, from 1813 until 1825, more than 3,000 horsepower of marine engines were made by Boulton and Watt, which powered between 40 and 60 vessels. That was all achieved by a young Ayrshire man with his brilliant mind.</p><p>Today, in noting Murdoch&#8217;s contribution to the industrial revolution and the Scottish enlightenment, the Scottish Parliament gives Murdoch a little more credit for his pioneering work, which he so richly deserves. Well done, Adam Ingram, for drawing Murdoch&#8217;s contribution to our attention today.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675979", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: William Murdoch"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Adam Ingram on securing the debate, as 2012 marks the 200th anniversary of the Scottish gas industry.

It is one that is national and international in its delivery, supporting third-world producers and providing retail outlets for them.</p><p>Before I go any further, I should say that Annabel Goldie told me to say that she is sorry not to be able to speak in this debate as she has a prior commitment in Glasgow. However, she supports the motion and has a particular interest in fair trade, as her home village of Bishopton apparently was the first village in Renfrewshire to achieve Fairtrade village status, which it did in 2007. Miss Goldie feels that bringing fair trade down to that local, community level helped to educate people and heighten awareness.</p><p>Fairtrade is growing into a universally recognised brand, and nowhere more so than in Ayrshire, in my constituency, where a Fairtrade partnership was set up in 2004. Indeed, Ayr was awarded Fairtrade town status on 26 February 2007, almost five years ago today. This debate could in effect be regarded as celebrating the fifth anniversary of that status.</p><p>I want to pay tribute to the many volunteers, representing all aspects of our community, who support fair trade in Ayr and Ayrshire. James Kelly also referred to volunteers. A large number of organisations are involved, including South Ayrshire Council, our churches, our community organisations and many local businesses, including retailers and caterers.</p><p>It is particularly important that our schools play a significant role in supporting fair trade. The time, effort and money that is given by our school children in selfless support of people in developing countries, who are less well-off than ourselves, is an excellent introduction to volunteering and charitable giving, and is very much part of the educational awareness raising.</p><p>The Ayrshire farmers market, with which I have been so much involved, offers our Fairtrade friends a stall, which gives the local farming community the opportunity to support in a modest way disadvantaged farmers and food producers elsewhere in the world. They have been loyal stallholders at our markets for many years.</p><p>One of the real benefits of the Fairtrade movement, quite apart from the provision of retail outlets for fairly traded products, is the binding together of various parts of local communities into the common cause of physically supporting disadvantaged communities in foreign lands. The consensual support that is evident in the Parliament tonight demonstrates that politicians of all parties, churches of all faiths and businesses that normally compete with each other can and do unite in support of a demonstrably good cause. That unity of purpose and expression of support is what makes this celebration today important.</p><p>I commend the motion, and congratulate George Adam on bringing it to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate George Adam on securing this debate on the Fairtrade campaign, take a step in 2012, which launches Fairtrade fortnight.

I hope that the Parliament, having survived the trauma of the collapse of the voting and sound system on 27 October, which was largely reinstated and restored yesterday, will welcome and take note of this debate.</p><p>I also thank the Parliament for its power and influence because, since the motion was lodged, NHS Ayrshire and Arran has withdrawn its proposal to move trauma orthopaedics from Ayr hospital, as announced recently in the local press. I should also thank the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy for her influence and for the discussions that I know she had with NHS Ayrshire and Arran executives. I ask Parliament to take note that, once again, the wishes of the people have been respected.</p><p>Today, I want to reaffirm the need for a two-centre approach to hospital care and, particularly, accident and emergency services in Ayrshire, of which trauma orthopaedics is an integral part. I know that that view is shared by other colleagues such as Adam Ingram and Chic Brodie.</p><p>Centralisation of services has been a long-term agenda of NHS Ayrshire and Arran and, although we have stopped the process with trauma orthopaedics, it comes as no surprise that the intention existed following the desire of NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the then Labour Government to close the A and E department at Ayr hospital&#8212;a plan first disclosed to me in August 2005 at the NHS Ayrshire and Arran annual review, presided over by the then Labour minister Andy Kerr. Perhaps that is why no Labour members are taking part in this debate.</p><p>As members will recall, that plan provoked outrage in southern Ayrshire, with 55,000 people signing a petition against the proposals and 5,000 marching through the streets of Ayr in February 2006 in protest. I put on record my thanks to all those who helped in the campaign between 2005 and 2007. It is worth noting how correct that campaign was: the A and E units at Ayr and Crosshouse are both now busier than they have ever been. Attendances at Ayr hospital are peaking at 140 to 150 per day. On average, 30 medical patients, 11 of whom require surgery, are admitted daily.</p><p>In 2007, the need for a two-centre approach to be taken to A and E services because of Ayrshire&#8217;s geography was pointed out to NHS Ayrshire and Arran, as it has been since. The argument was, and still is, driven by the need to be within an hour&#8217;s distance of an A and E unit by ambulance or car.</p><p>That need will remain and grow with the ageing profile of Ayrshire&#8217;s community and the increase in admissions of elderly people, particularly those suffering from falls and, as a result, broken limbs. The growing incidence of osteoporosis, osteoporotic fractures and heart attacks demands that as little time as possible be spent in ambulances on Ayrshire&#8217;s far-from-perfect road surfaces.</p><p>The same arguments apply for trauma and orthopaedics. That is why I and others were so opposed to the most recent proposals.</p><p>It is self-evident that I am not a doctor, but doctors have advised me that the proposals to locate trauma and orthopaedics on one site at Crosshouse would have led to a loss of capacity and capability in the A and E department at Ayr hospital and may ultimately have posed a threat to the long-term viability of the A and E services there. That is why, once again, I found myself taking issue with NHS Ayrshire and Arran&#8217;s centralising agenda.</p><p>Where time is not of the essence for the treatment and survivability of an illness, there is a place for concentrating resources on one site. Over the years, services such as maternity and paediatric care have moved to one site at Crosshouse. On the other hand, urology and ophthalmology are located at Ayr. I welcome the fact that the new cardioverter defibrillator fitting service, which was previously provided in Glasgow, was located at Ayr hospital in July this year.</p><p>However, I am also aware that the centralisation of patient records at Crosshouse has not been a huge success thus far. Medical staff have expressed to me concerns about faults that have emerged in the TrakCare system, which is apparently being rolled out across Scotland before those faults have been fully ironed out. Perhaps, in his closing speech, the Minister for Public Health might make the Parliament aware of what is being done to make that system work better.</p><p>Again, I thank those who helped to see off the latest threat to A and E services at Ayr. However, I note that elected members of all parties will need to remain vigilant and protective of the facility if it is not to be placed under threat in future. After all, as Benjamin Franklin noted more than 200 years ago:</p><p>&#8220;A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.&#8221;</p><p>That applies to the decision makers at NHS Ayrshire and Arran, who were convinced against their will to adopt a two-centre approach to the provision of A and E services in Ayrshire following the election in 2007. I, and others, remain unconvinced that their view has changed, notwithstanding the clear instruction of the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy.

I thank her for her hard work and her shared sense of purpose, and indeed her friendship, in seeking the best for southern Ayrshire, as she and I have both done over the past 12 years.</p><p>Today, co-operative and collaborative working, which was first formally established in 1761, has developed into a worldwide business model. Some co-operatives now exist to make profit for their members; others exist and benefit their members on a not-for-profit basis. Mutualisation is a further type of co-operative. It is fascinating and important to note that all that began in Ayrshire, in Fenwick&#8212;only about 10 miles from the place where Robert Burns was born two years earlier.</p><p>The date of 1761 tells us that the concept was yet another example of the development of social and economic ideas that was taking place in Scotland at that time&#8212;it was very much part of the Scottish enlightenment. Those ideas are now worldwide in their application, nowhere more so than in Scotland&#8212;SAOS and co-operative development Scotland being the principle advocates of co-operation in Scotland today.</p><p>For my part, I was a founder member of a lamb marketing co-operative that was established in the 1980s, and more recently I created the Ayrshire Farmers Market co-operative. Both those co-operatives are still working well today. I helped to create and chair the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets to further the development of farmers markets across Scotland, and I am very proud that about 80 free-standing farmers markets are now operating across Scotland. Many of them are co-operatives, built on the founding principles of 250 years ago, and they have supported the creation of at least 300 to 400 new jobs in rural Scotland over the past 10 years.</p><p>Much food production and marketing throughout Scotland is carried out by co-operatives, with significant amounts of milk, pork, beef and lamb being dealt with in that way. The model is also used in Europe. Many people would argue that greater co-operation is still the way forward for giving primary producers more negotiating power when dealing with supermarkets, which are perhaps the modern-day equivalent of the early landowners who, by their actions, inspired the Fenwick weavers to work together.</p><p>I, too, shall be going to Fenwick on Monday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the formation of the Fenwick Weavers Society, and I am very much looking forward to the event.

That is a matter that I, coincidentally, expect to come to later, but I nonetheless welcome his intervention.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives welcome the bill, which seeks primarily to make Scotland a safer place in terms of reservoir safety. Given the age of our Scottish reservoirs, many of which are more than 100 years old, and the recent incident at the Maich fishery in Renfrewshire, the bill is certainly necessary and timeous. It will place some new burdens on owners who had none before and, in a few cases, it will reduce the burden on other owners.</p><p>In particular, the bill will introduce, for the first time, reservoirs of 10,000m3 capacity and move them into the regulations. However, limited users of the reservoirs, such as fishermen and angling clubs, will be exempt from the burden of regulation unless they are owners or lessees of reservoirs. I know that many fishermen and angling clubs will welcome that exemption.</p><p>Registration of reservoirs will now be mandatory to allow SEPA to maintain a register of controlled reservoirs. I urge those who are required to register to do so within the six-month period of grace after the bill is passed, when no charge will be incurred.</p><p>Like other members, I welcome the move towards a risk and consequences-based assessment of reservoirs. The six-year periodic review will keep the evaluation fresh and current. I welcome, too, the recent dialogue between ICE and the Government on how best to assess the risk of failure of essentially inert structures that are more than 100 years old and the inclusion of ICE, along with panel engineers, on the reservoir safety stakeholder group. That is perhaps a belt-and-braces approach, but it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>However, one concern that I have is the possible emerging threat of extreme weather events caused by climate change. Combinations of high rainfall and high winds, perhaps combined with a landslip, which could perhaps be caused by a Mohr&#8217;s slip circle, could lead to overtopping, and a combination of some or all of those events could threaten the stability of older reservoirs. A weather eye, so to speak, must be kept open for new combinations of dangerous events, perhaps not previously experienced and not individually threatening but which, if taken together, could be dangerous to some of our older structures.</p><p>On the risk category of established reservoirs being raised due to downstream development or the reduction in capacity from 25,000m3 to 10,000m3, I welcome the Government&#8217;s clarification and recognition of the cost implications for reservoir owners. The Government&#8217;s entirely correct intention to treat reservoir managers fairly and proportionately in such cases, and the provision of grants to address funding issues in those or other circumstances, are welcome. Furthermore, the issuing of guidance on the subject, which was agreed to today at Peter Peacock&#8217;s request, is welcome. It is important that the guidance should cover the widest range of reasonable circumstances. It is just as important that such grant aid is adequately funded. I know that that may well be difficult in the financially straitened times in which we find ourselves. Elaine Murray raised a concern, which I share, about SEPA&#8217;s funding to carry out the work.</p><p>This is a vital and necessary piece of legislation, which will reduce risk to human life, heritage and property and which Scottish Conservatives will support at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Naturally I welcome, as ever, Peter Peacock&#8217;s well-thought-out intervention.

The chief purpose of the amendments is to seek to extend the period for catching up for pheasants and partridges from 14 days, as is currently proposed, to 28 days. Catching up is the practice of collecting male and female pheasants and partridges to use as breeding stock. It is traditionally carried out by gamekeepers and game rearers immediately after the end of the shooting season, usually during the whole of February.</p><p>The extension of the period from 14 days to 28 days would give greater flexibility, particularly if there is severe weather, such as the snow that we have experienced during the past two winters. Furthermore, shoots, particularly commercial ones, shoot right up until the end of the season, which means that staff are usually very busy and preparations for catching up cannot begin until the shooting season has ended. Commercial shoots and game rearers often catch up a large number of birds during a sustained period, and a 14-day period is not sufficient to allow that to take place.</p><p>I acknowledge concerns about the possible catching up of grouse and mallard, which is why amendment 39 would remove those species from the provisions.</p><p>After discussions with the British Association for Shooting and Conservation Scotland and RSPB Scotland, I understand that the amendments in group 1 offer an acceptable approach and deal with the concerns that both sides raised at stage 2. Because of that, I trust that the amendments will find members&#8217; support.</p><p>Amendment 42 would permit the catching up of red grouse for disease control during the close season. The practice is well established and thousands of red grouse are caught each year for direct dosing and worm monitoring. The practice ensures the effective monitoring and treatment of grouse disease and helps to deliver a healthy, productive and stable red grouse population, which, in turn, boosts the rural economy, given that a great deal of income and employment depends on grouse shooting.</p><p>Some people have suggested that the practice might have environmental implications, but the same drug, delivered in the same way, is used to reduce disease in Scotland&#8217;s hill populations of sheep and cattle, with no perceptible effects. The activities that amendment 42 would enable are important and uncontroversial and are undertaken by the Langholm Moor demonstration project, with Scottish Natural Heritage, the RSPB, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and Buccleuch Estates as partners.</p><p>I commend all the amendments in the group.

I say a huge thank you, too, to the clerks to our committee, to Tom Edwards from the Scottish Parliament information centre, to the bill team and of course to colleagues on the committee, with whom the bill has been much debated and argued over, for what from my perspective has been the largely good-natured way in which the work and effort has been carried out by all involved. I also thank the minister, particularly for her sympathetic consideration of my amendments.</p><p>Today we will pass into law the WANE bill, which is in essence a tidying-up bill. By and large, the bill is welcome and much needed, amending most notably the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996, the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Hill Farming Act 1946. In addition, it repeals 18th and 19th century game acts, so its scope is wide ranging.</p><p>There is one key element of the bill with which I disagree: the introduction of vicarious liability in part 2. Although I understand and agree with the minister&#8217;s motives for introducing vicarious liability&#8212;namely, the need to stop raptor persecution&#8212;I do not believe that that is the correct way of resolving the problem, especially as it introduces the concept that an individual is assumed to be guilty of a crime or crimes of another individual unless and until he or she can prove him or herself innocent. Notwithstanding the defences offered in the bill, I believe that to be a disproportionate response to the crime of raptor persecution.</p><p>However, we are where we are. I look forward to guidance being issued this autumn, before that part of the bill is commenced, and I hope that all those who are directly involved and affected by it will be fully consulted. Perhaps the minister might give us her views on that, particularly on who will be consulted, in her closing remarks.</p><p>On a more positive note, I welcome the retention of snaring as a useful tool in the box for the control of foxes, although like Liam McArthur I am somewhat surprised at the apparent divergence of views between&#8212;[Interruption.]&#8212;on the Labour front benches. I also agree with others that more needs to be done to ensure that snares continue to be developed into an easily monitored restraining device, and I welcome the adoption of Bill Wilson&#8217;s amendment to ensure quinquennial reviews of snaring.</p><p>Forgive me, I meant to refer to the divergence of views on the Labour front bench between Sarah Boyack and her colleagues in the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee. I was having a senior moment. [Laughter.]</p><p>Turning now to the protection of hares, I believe that the Parliament has taken a valuable step forward by introducing a close season for brown and mountain hares, and I for one will be very interested to see what effect that has on hare numbers across Scotland.</p><p>With regard to deer management, I hope that we have struck the right balance in inviting SNH to introduce a code of practice on 1 September 2011&#8212;a code of practice that will be subject to the affirmative procedure and therefore widely consulted on. I ask the minister, notwithstanding her announcement today, whether that timetable is technically feasible given that, I suspect, the summer recess will not have ended by that date.</p><p>The rules on competency to shoot deer have been further tightened up, with an enabling power introduced to deal with the situation if voluntary training schemes are subsequently regarded as inadequate. That, too, is to be welcomed.</p><p>Finally, muirburning provision and practice has been altered for the better.

In case that sets too flippant an opening tone, let me add that it is undoubtedly a very important bill that one day might save lives. It is also a bill with possible drawbacks, including the challenging financial implications that it might have for some individuals. That is a serious business, to which I will return later.</p><p>I can sincerely declare that I enjoyed the stage 1 scrutiny, in part because of the illuminating testimony of our expert witnesses and in part because I am a civil engineer by training and find such matters fascinating anyway. I got the impression, though, that other committee members perhaps enjoyed themselves more than they had expected to, tapping into hitherto unexploited reserves of enthusiasm on issues such as the relative merits of concrete and puddle-clay dams, and the statistical probability of a peat slide. I expect that some members will wish to refer to such issues in more detail, and we all look forward to that.</p><p>The committee has produced a thorough report, and I thank my colleagues for their diligence. I thank Maureen Watt, who chaired proceedings in her usual efficient and good-humoured way. As she is away on parliamentary business this week, I have stepped into her shoes, as it were. I also thank the Scottish Parliament information centre and the clerks, who, as usual, have done a sterling job.</p><p>The committee took evidence from SEPA, Scottish Water, the Institution of Civil Engineers, an energy company, an angling club operator, an insurer and the Minister for the Environment and Climate Change and her officials. We received more than 20 written submissions from councils, charities, landowners and large and small businesses, for which I thank them all. I reiterate that our scrutiny of what is a long and technical bill has been thorough.</p><p>In evidence, engineers, in particular, raised concerns about various technical issues. I did not sense that any of them was hugely important, but they underline a key recommendation of the committee, which is that the Government must maintain a dialogue with the ICE during the amending stages and, if the bill is passed, in the lead-up to implementation. It is crucial that the technical provisions&#8212;the nuts and bolts of the legislation&#8212;appear to be workable to the people who rely on them. It is only fair to add that the Government has so far demonstrated a willingness to listen, which is encouraging.</p><p>It is also important for the Government to maintain a dialogue with reservoir managers. I appreciate that there is a stakeholder working group that serves as a forum for stakeholders to air their views and as a conduit for the Government to relay information. I suggest that the information-relaying role needs to be stepped up, particularly in relation to the cost implications for reservoir managers, because there are some worried people out there.</p><p>One of our witnesses was a gentleman who runs an angling business. He ended up owning a reservoir as an indirect result of water authorities selling off redundant reservoirs to the public some years ago. He raised the prospect of the bill leaving people like him unable to meet the maintenance costs that will arise under the new regime, and equally unable to afford the eye-watering one-off cost of reservoir decommissioning. Our report described that as a catch-22 situation. We might also have said that such people are damned if they do and damned if they don&#8217;t. I hope that the minister will be able to address that issue. It is to be hoped that only a tiny minority of reservoir owners will be in that position, in which case the way might be open for the Government to provide help, as the minister hinted in the committee and&#8212;if I heard him correctly&#8212;commented this morning. I would certainly welcome that.</p><p>As the minister was keen to stress, most reservoir managers might not incur significant extra costs and, in some cases, bills might go down. I certainly hope so, but the stage 1 evidence was contradictory on the point. An example is the annual subsistence fees that SEPA proposed to charge reservoir managers. It emerged that the authority to charge those fees is missing from the bill. There is also uncertainty about the level of fees. SEPA indicated the low hundreds of pounds, but the financial memorandum suggested a far greater range. There is a slight sense of policy being made on the hoof, which also concerned the committee.</p><p>I conclude by noting that Scotland has a good reservoir safety record, with no fatalities in almost a century. That is despite having some of the oldest working dams in the world&#8212;splendid feats of engineering such as Loch Thom and the Greenock Cut above the Firth of Clyde. That is a tribute to generations of Scottish engineers and, I suppose, an indication that the current legislation has not served us too badly. However, the committee has been persuaded that the bill should proceed on the basis that it will take a more flexible approach, with the level of risk matching the level of inspection. As our report says, we expect SEPA&#8217;s overall regulatory regime to be</p><p>&#8220;as light touch as possible without compromising safety&#8221;,</p><p>so that costs to managers are driven down.</p><p>I note that the minister expressed an interest in lodging stage 2 amendments. I restate the importance of on-going Government dialogue with the experts in order to improve the bill. I hope that that leads to a steady trickle of Government amendments rather than an uncontrolled dam burst but, either way, the committee looks forward to reconsidering the bill at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Every so often, a committee of the Parliament has the privilege of considering a bill that captures the imagination of the Scottish people and provokes excited debate across the land but, on other occasions, a committee considers a bill such as the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill.

The freight facilities grants have had a very beneficial effect on the whole of Scotland, from Thurso to Galloway, and their importance in keeping freight off our roads and in developing freight modal shift should be regarded as a success. I support Cathy Jamieson's comments about the benefits of the scheme.</p><p>In Ayr, Associated British Ports, which is known locally as ABP, received one of the biggest awards in the scheme&#8212;more than &#163;4 million&#8212;to bring in timber, which has had a positive economic impact on the ports of Ayr and Troon as well as on rural communities in Argyll. The grant award kick-started timber shipping on the west coast of Scotland and brought timber from Campbeltown, Ardrishaig, Portavadie and Sandbank mainly to Troon for onward transmission to Wilson's sawmills in Troon, the Caledonian paper mill in Irene Oldfather's constituency and the Egger chipboard plant in Cathy Jamieson's constituency.</p><p>That investment has played a vital role in sustaining jobs at those facilities, which must be recognised. However, the withdrawal of the <place-holder colnum=\"32280\"/> scheme is now threatening economic development at the Ayrshire ports in my constituency, which is a matter of great concern to me. Indeed, a project has been threatened by the abrupt withdrawal of the freight facilities grant, with meetings with Government transport teams being cancelled recently at very short notice. That is a matter of the utmost concern to me. Commercial confidentiality does not allow me to give more details, in this most public place, of the proposal that has been put in jeopardy, but Government officials and, I am certain, the minister will be aware of the project to which I am alluding, and of the meeting that was scheduled for 15 November to discuss the project that was cancelled by Government officials.</p><p>I acknowledge the historical benefit of the scheme but greatly regret its withdrawal, in effect, because the economic benefit that its further application would have brought to my constituency will not now be enjoyed by my constituents. Further, the jeopardising of the proposal at Grangeton, in Cathy Jamieson's constituency, has an impact on my constituents as well, as many people travel from Ayr, Prestwick and Troon to take up employment in her constituency. Like her, I would like the grants to be reinstated.</p><p>I understand that the Government must make savings in its budgets. However, the obvious benefits of the scheme throughout Scotland, in terms of economic development, greenhouse gas reductions and, therefore, the meeting of climate change targets, mean that it is not a scheme to cut. In addition, given the fact that the roads maintenance budget is already a headache for the minister and councils throughout Scotland&#8212;particularly South Ayrshire Council&#8212;it is vital that other modes of transport be used for freight transfer.</p><p>In summary, the multiple benefits that the scheme supports and provides should not be put at risk by the proposed reduction in funding from &#163;10.3 million to &#163;2.9 million in this year's budget. Such a proposal is truly short-sighted and goes counter to many of the Government's and the Parliament's stated aims and agreed targets. Considering the relatively modest sums that are involved, in the context of the overall budget, I ask the minister to discuss the matter further with the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth with a view to restoring the freight facilities grant in full in this year's budget and thereafter.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178263", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freight Facilities Grants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Cathy Jamieson on securing the debate, which is relevant to Ayrshire and South Ayrshire, in particular, which we both represent.

After today's debate, she might wish that she was once again dealing with the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill rather than responsible for climate change on the Scottish Government's behalf&#8212;had she been listening, she might have heard that.</p><p>The debate has been interesting and informative, particularly for me, as I am a member not of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee but of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee. One always ventures cautiously on to another committee's subject area, and I acknowledge the huge amount of work that members put into the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill and the report on proposals and policies for a low-carbon Scotland.</p><p>Our committee&#8212;the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee&#8212;has played only a small part in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's deliberations on the subject, but I will begin by addressing the land use strategy and by raising with the minister my concerns about the lack of definition and focus that are associated with the strategy. The debate provides an <place-holder colnum=\"32064\"/> appropriate opportunity to do that, as the cabinet secretary is here.</p><p>Of course I and others support the three strategic directions of establishing a low-carbon economy, better consideration of the natural environment and connecting people with the land, but the detailed questions remain, such as where trees should be planted, how prime agricultural land can be protected, how land can be conserved and accessed for tourism, how carbon emissions can continue to be reduced, how biodiversity can be enhanced and protected and how&#8212;in all that mix&#8212;land-based businesses can prosper and contribute to a thriving rural economy.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary has the answers to those problems, I and other land users would certainly like to hear them. If we assume that he has the answers, a big communication job must be undertaken, because many people&#8212;and, indeed, witnesses to our committee&#8212;are still unclear about the strategy's purpose.</p><p>The strategy should at least start to reconcile competing land uses and deal with how those competing interests will be prioritised across the country&#8212;for example, how do we reconcile a target of 35,000 new houses per year with protecting prime agricultural land? How do we sustain a planting target of 25 per cent cover by 2050 and yet maintain our ability to produce food from our land? It will come as no surprise to the cabinet secretary to hear again my view that food production should be the primary&#8212;the fundamental&#8212;use of land in Scotland, particularly given that food price inflation is running at 4 per cent. The figure is for the month of December. A hierarchy of other uses should be established thereafter. If the land use strategy is not to be a spatial strategy, national priorities must at least be clearly established with the reasons for choices being made and explained clearly to a currently expectant public. In addition, the strategy should provide incentives as well as the regulation that has been much talked about in today's debate.</p><p>That takes me to a key theme in today's debate: how will the promised land be reached, given the reduced funding that is available? Obviously, a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emission by 2020 is both laudable and headline grabbing. The more important question is whether it can be achieved and afforded. Charlie Gordon referred to that. It was surprising&#8212;to me, at any rate&#8212;to hear him say that private funding needs to be levered in, too. There is also the question whether the reduction can be achieved and afforded without damaging or destroying existing businesses and jobs. Of course, I want these objectives and targets as much as anyone else in the Parliament, but I also need and want to be shown the route map of how we will get there. Patrick Harvie <place-holder colnum=\"32065\"/> referred to that in his opening remarks, as did the minister in her appeal to the UK Government for funding. In fairness, it should be noted that the 42 per cent figure was set by the Scottish Parliament. The minister is now asking the UK Government to fund it.</p><p>In addition, there is the missed opportunity of the Government providing not a three-year spending review but a one-year election budget. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee pointed that out and Iain Smith referred to it in his speech. It gives further grounds for concern about how these and other targets will be met and monitored. In our rightful enthusiasm for delivering these emissions targets, in addition to appealing to the UK Government, perhaps we should also refer the matter to John Swinney with a view to sourcing future funding.</p><p>Like Jackson Carlaw, I believe in a voluntary approach that is incentivised by Government. That is essential for the successful delivery of the RPP. I remain to be convinced that this Government is prepared&#8212;or, to be fair&#8212;able to finance the aspiration to which the Parliament signed up in 2009.</p><p>As Iain Smith said, investment in education and training will be necessary to fill the emerging skills gaps in the renewables industries and other low-carbon employment industries. Will there also be funding to provide that in the future?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, like Rob Gibson and Jackson Carlaw, I support peat wetting. I hope that funding can be found for that, albeit that I might find another way of describing it.</p><p>I must stop posing questions to the minister that she may be unable to answer, particularly given that this is her first public day in her new role. I do, however, largely support the report. In the main, the Scottish Conservatives will support the proposals in the report and, where possible, the delivery of its reasonable aims and objectives.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer, by apologising to Patrick Harvie and the chamber for missing his opening speech and by welcoming the minister to her new post.

We support most of the bill, while recognising that there is a need for consolidating legislation at some future date.</p><p>However, there will still be much to debate at stage 2, and the principle concern that I have is the Government's intention to introduce vicarious liability into the bill by amendment at stage 2 in an attempt to stop raptor persecution.</p><p>Let me state categorically that Scottish Conservatives utterly condemn those who carry out raptor persecution, in the same way that we condemn deer poaching and other wildlife crimes, and we want to make every attempt to stamp out these abominable crimes.</p><p>However, the scale of raptor persecution is the unanswered question. The case that is being made for the introduction of vicarious liability is largely predicated on the alleged disappearance of approximately 50 golden eagles in the north-east of Scotland each year, with the suggestion being that they have been poisoned or otherwise killed. However, that suggestion is simply not entirely credible, as Sheriff Drummond pointed out in evidence to the committee when he noted that<place-holder colnum=\"31229\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 15 September 2010; c 3092.]</p><p>Everyone who has lived and worked with livestock and wildlife in rural Scotland knows that if birds and animals are conceived in the first place and survive until birth, they can regrettably die for 101 reasons and from various combinations of circumstances that can include hunger, weather conditions and misadventure. That sad fact is worse in the wild and in wilderness conditions. We should look at this week's weather, for example. The unusual early snowfall will reduce raptor food supply and affect the success of next year's breeding of golden eagles. Those are simple but well-known issues that relate to the effect of available food supply on body conditions and, ultimately, on fertility.</p><p>It is simple animal husbandry, but those very real issues affect successful breeding patterns in all animals and birds; the science is well documented in that regard. We do not believe that poisoning and persecution is widespread. The great proportion of disappeared birds are simply not born, or else they die of natural causes.</p><p>We do not believe that the case has been made for the introduction of vicarious liability, as it is neither a proportionate nor reasonable response to a partly real and partly imagined crime. We do not view it as a positive way forward, especially given that it may be an active disincentive to land and estate ownership in Scotland.</p><p>Much more reasonably, we believe that police forces throughout Scotland should be strengthened by the creation of more dedicated wildlife crime officers to investigate all forms of wildlife crime, including raptor persecution, and by using existing legislation if and when evidence can be found to demonstrate that a crime has been committed. We also believe that police forces should be strengthened, where it is appropriate in remote and rural areas, by increasing the number of special constables.</p><p>On estate licensing, I welcome the wildlife estates Scotland initiative that the SRPBA has developed in conjunction with SNH, RSPB Scotland, the Scottish Estates Business Group, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and others. It will raise the level of sustainable management of estates throughout Scotland and help to meet targets in biodiversity, sustainability and climate change, as well as delivering socioeconomic objectives. I agree with the minister that now is not the time&#8212;and nor is there a need&#8212;for estate licensing.</p><p>On deer management, we largely welcome the revised provisions in the bill. However, we still have concerns about how best to make deer management groups work successfully, given the <place-holder colnum=\"31230\"/> different priorities that different estates have in relation to managing a transient deer population that now&#8212;as Maureen Watt mentioned&#8212;numbers around 750,000. I welcome the minister's intention to consider that further.</p><p>I support the Government's intention to allow the continued use of snaring in a much more humane way than it has been practised in the past. I share members' concerns about catching wildlife other than foxes or rabbits, but I believe that snaring is still a very necessary tool for the control of foxes in particular. In that regard, I look forward to the further development of snares, which we should aim to use in the future as restraining devices with breaking strain releases and individual identities so that ownership of each snare can be established.</p><p>Finally, I will say a word on geese and the emerging problem of species that are now overwintering as a result of climate change in Orkney, other islands and northern mainland areas. I am sure that Liam McArthur will want to draw attention to that problem too, and he will perhaps support me in asking the Government to at least think about the issue before stage 2.</p><p>I also welcome the more relaxed provisions on muirburn and the greater flexibility that is proposed.

Forty-one boats are to be tied up, the Icelanders and the Faroese are catching our mackerel, the Isle of Man has restricted access to its scallop fisheries, and we are still discarding more cod into our seas annually than we actually land. I note the cabinet secretary's analysis. I support much of what he is doing and I wish him and Richard Benyon every success in the forthcoming negotiations, but the question is where we go from here.<place-holder colnum=\"31020\"/></p><p>In the longer term, we have to start addressing some of the structural weaknesses in our fishing industry that are holding back its development and preventing it from being a much stronger industry than it is at present. Notwithstanding the problems of the pelagic and nephrops sectors, the biggest problem area appears to be our mixed white-fish sector. It seems to me that we should start in the sector where the problem is the most obvious, and I venture to suggest that part of the solution to the various problems lies in the hands of the fishermen themselves.</p><p>In real terms, the Government's four-pillar plan is a good starting point. The key element is catching for the market. The lack of trust, collaboration and communication in the supply chain is hugely damaging the end price that fishermen receive for the fish that they catch, as are the lack of standard box weights and the lack of co-ordination of landings. Our fishermen are weak sellers as primary producers in a buyers' market. I say that not from a theoretical perspective but from a viewpoint of bitter experience. I have seen at first hand the self-same problems in agriculture, and that allows me to see the same problems in our white-fish industry.</p><p>Building cohesion and trust in the industry and controlling and delivering for the market would add value to our fisheries product and, importantly, reduce discards. If all that was caught was landed, the industry could again hold its head high. We all agree that the current discarding and high-grading practices cannot continue if our fishing industry is to be regarded as truly sustainable in the future. Catch quotas alone are not the answer. Better and more sustainable fishing practices might encourage UK buyers and supermarkets back as mainstream buyers of our Scottish products. What a prize it would be if European buyers were competing on real terms with our major UK retailers for the same product.</p><p>There is much to be done. The Governments in the UK, Scotland and Europe must get the policy right this year and reform the CFP for the years ahead. That said, our fishermen need to be brave and bold not just, as Karen Gillon pointed out, in their work and the hardship that they face on our seas but in the business initiatives that they take. If, as seems likely, we have more regional control, with producer organisations ultimately given more responsibility for the management of our seas, integrated and collaborative supply-chain management will provide a real opportunity for POs to work together better in the new post-2012 climate not only to deliver but to add value to basic quayside landings. Such models already exist. In the farming industry, for example, the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society has developed and delivered for those who wish them models of collaborative supply-chain marketing and <place-holder colnum=\"31021\"/> management through large-scale co-operative ventures.</p><p>I passionately believe that the current difficulties present an opportunity for our fishermen, if they have the courage and skill to grasp it. They can rest assured that our party will help in whatever way it can.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7498.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the fishing industry to develop better supply chain management.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you.

However, it is a different story for our fishermen who are facing threats from Iceland and the Faroes in the pelagic sector as well as reduced quotas, days at sea and rising costs in the demersal sector.</p><p>That said, today's debate is about celebrating Scottish food and drink fortnight, which was <place-holder colnum=\"28688\"/> launched by the Scottish Countryside Alliance in 2007. There is much to celebrate this year with over 130 events taking place. Some key facts&#8212;for example that our food and drink sector generates &#163;9.5 billion annually, making it the largest business sector by far in Scotland&#8212;are to be applauded. Our food and drink supply chain employs more than 360,000 people in Scotland and we export more than &#163;800 million of food annually. That is dwarfed by our drinks industry, particularly our whisky industry, which exports more than &#163;3 billion worldwide&#8212;our congratulations go to it. Fish and shellfish exports provide 55 per cent of our food exports and the sector is also to be applauded for growing that market over recent years.</p><p>Further, it is important to note that of the 75,000 businesses involved in the food supply chain, over three quarters employ fewer than 10 people and therefore have the potential and capacity to grow. Skills development organisations, such as Lantra, and our colleges must be congratulated and supported in the future. As we fight our way through Labour's recession&#8212;I apologise to Elaine Murray&#8212;our future recovery will undoubtedly come from small businesses such as those, which is why we must do all we can to support them. Food networks, farm shops and farmers markets will be vital building platforms in the future, particularly in developing public procurement contracts, which, notwithstanding the minister's enthusiasm, is not happening as quickly as it should. Perhaps Robin Gourlay's secondment to the Government will help in that regard.</p><p>What does all that mean? First, I know that all politicians of all parties say this, but we must start cutting back on regulation and red tape. Every year our Parliaments in Edinburgh, Westminster and Brussels push out more legislation. Businesses, especially small businesses, are being overwhelmed by the tsunami of regulation and forms that keep coming into their in-boxes. Of course Parliaments exist to create legislation, but we also have a duty of care to the recipients of the legislation that we produce, given the cost that goes with it, and we must reflect on the cumulative disincentive that it creates to starting and maintaining new businesses. Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Scotland at present; we must address the lack of business start-ups.</p><p>However, we also have to remember that food production is a function of nature. This year's massive reduction in the worldwide wheat harvest is another wake-up call in terms of what the future holds and the dangers of food insecurity if we do not maintain and support primary production here in Scotland, in the UK and, particularly, in Europe.</p><p>Alyn Smith MEP raised that important point in last week's edition of <em>The Scottish Farmer</em>. I <place-holder colnum=\"28689\"/> welcome him to the cause of trying to change mindsets in the European Commission and getting our officials in Brussels to realise that food security is a real and emerging problem that must be factored into reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013.</p><p>I turn to food production itself. Input costs, such as fuel and fertiliser costs, are rising dramatically for our terrestrial and marine food-producing industries. That in turn might lead to food-price inflation. Indeed, Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson Global Investors, has already warned that food-price inflation could reach 7 per cent later this year, which could push up the consumer price index to around 4 per cent, which is certainly not to be welcomed.</p><p>In this first debate on the subject in the parliamentary year, although we note and applaud the success of Scottish food and drink fortnight, we must not lose sight of the many problems that our food and drink producers face as we move into the next decade of the century.</p><p>A sea-fishing industry in decline is a problem that must be confronted now. Livestock and human depopulation of our hills and glens is an unwelcome socioeconomic fact of life, which has environmental consequences as livestock production decreases in our remote and fragile areas. The issue of succession&#8212;carrying on family businesses&#8212;in the primary industries of agriculture and fishing has not been adequately addressed. There is the potential for that to lead to further long-term decline in food production and harvesting capability.</p><p>European support coming to Scotland is reducing as we give back single farm payments in an attempt to stop slipper farming, which cannot be in Scotland's overall best interests. Volatility in food production in world markets is growing&#8212;speculators in commodities are exacerbating the problem of shortages when they occur.</p><p>Many problems remain to be addressed. Although we welcome and support this debate on the growth of the Scottish food and drink sector on the day of the papal visit to Scotland, difficult years lie ahead if growth is to be maintained and developed. However, Conservatives in Scotland and the UK are prepared for the challenge and will work constructively with all parties and stakeholders to chart the best way forward.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997464", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer, a food producer and a past chairman of the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets, as well as a member of the Ayrshire food network.

Crofting is a way of life that I have admired and supported for many years. It keeps people living in communities in our most remote and fragile areas. In other circumstances, most families would have left those areas generations ago.<place-holder colnum=\"28187\"/></p><p>Until 10 years ago, I lived and worked on a remote hill farm. I admire the sheer tenacity of crofters in supplementing their living from their croft, and know that what they do is about cherishing family connections with the land, often for little or no financial gain. I understand the passion that runs in their blood. I understand their pride in what they do, in how they support their families and in how they preserve their communities in the face of remoteness and extreme weather conditions. I support what they do and hope that the bill that we pass today will secure the future of crofting for generations to come. I do not, I regret to say, share Sarah Boyack's downbeat assessment of the bill; nor do I welcome the threat of another crofting bill without allowing the provisions in the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill to bed in.</p><p>We have shaped the new crofting commission into a much more democratic regulatory body and have given it significant powers to address positively almost any situation that crofting faces now or in the future. We have given it as much discretion as possible, and have always borne in mind the need to modernise crofting and make the legislation fit for purpose in the 21st century. That approach was singularly lacking in the piece of legislation that the previous Government introduced.</p><p>Map-based registration will provide owner-occupiers with certainty about what they own and tenants with certainty about what they croft as tenants. The register will be held by the keeper of the registers of Scotland, and will, over time, provide accurate titles to all crofts in Scotland and bring crofting into line with property in every other property register in Scotland.</p><p>We have equalised the grant structure, which will encourage owner-occupation of crofts throughout Scotland and be in the best interests of crofters in the long term. We have sought to address the problem of absenteeism and neglect in what I hope is as fair a way as possible, doubling the distance criterion to 32km, with ultimate discretion on absenteeism resting with the commission. We have tried hard to address neglect in as fair a way as possible and I am optimistic that the self-certification process introduced by an amendment in my name today will encourage better maintenance of crofts in Scotland.</p><p>From my farming experience I know that making and signing an annual declaration that one is farming in a good agricultural and environmental condition scheme-compliant way certainly encourages one to do that. I hope that the annual declaration that crofters will be obliged to make in future&#8212;that they are putting their crofts to purposeful use&#8212;will also encourage other crofters <place-holder colnum=\"28188\"/> to do that. The amendments lodged by Elaine Murray and Rob Gibson that were agreed to today will also encourage crofters to put their holdings to purposeful use. We have also closed the Whitbread v Macdonald loophole and extended from five to 10 years the period in which a consideration is payable in respect of a disposal of croft land.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most dramatically of all, the new crofting commission will in large part have a democratically elected board, which will introduce accountability to an extent hitherto unknown for the commission. That democratic accountability will revitalise and reinvigorate the crofting commission in its newly defined role and I for one look forward to the outcome of the first election to the commission.</p><p>Given the time, commitment and passion that we have put into the bill, which we all hope will secure the future of crofting, all that remains is for it to be passed at decision time this afternoon. Thereafter, I hope that crofters will take up the opportunities offered to them in the new act and I look forward to seeing a positive transformation of the crofting communities over time.</p>", "hdate": "2010-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20876951", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and a member of NFU Scotland.

I congratulate Liam McArthur on securing this debate on a hot topic that is of huge concern to farmers and crofters throughout Scotland, nowhere more so than in the livestock sector.</p><p>Today's debate has been precipitated by the growing anger in the industry about the growing unfairness of the penalty system. The fivefold increase in deductions between 2008 and 2009 demonstrates the argument and makes the case that something needs to be done. It is unacceptable for &#163;1,394,409 to have been deducted from our industry's receipts. The retrospective nature of some deductions is particularly disturbing.</p><p>Of course, penalties must be imposed if fraud is being perpetrated. However, if genuine mistakes have been made that are rectifiable, by correcting paperwork errors, and no harm has been done to livestock, the land or the environment, surely the time has come to take a fresh look at a system that can&#8212;and does&#8212;impose disproportionate deductions.</p><p>With the advent of sheep electronic identification, which means that so many more numbers will have to be recorded, it is even more important that a test of reasonableness be applied in imposing deductions. At the moment, numbers are not always accurately recorded by scanning systems. The scanning process will improve over time, and it is to be hoped that a completely accurate and paperless system of movement traceability for all livestock can be developed, but at the moment we are some way from developing, implementing or even being able to afford the holy grail of a movement system for livestock producers.</p><p>I turn to the issue of land use under integrated administration and control system rules and penalties. It is even more unfair for farmers to be penalised for mistakes by Government than for recording errors and mistakes by individuals. When inadequate guidance is issued, as has happened in the past, and new guidance is not issued timeously, as appears to have been the case this year, it is not acceptable for farmers to run the risk of being penalised for not being <place-holder colnum=\"27638\"/> adequately aware of the rules. That is why it is in the interests both of farmers and crofters and of Government to find and promote a different system that can recognise genuine mistakes and apply more reasonable penalties. The NFUS's suggestion that a fixed penalty&#8212;similar in style, if not in amount, to a parking ticket&#8212;be introduced would be a much more proportionate and reasonable response, and could be backed up by throwing the book at those who deliberately set out to defraud.</p><p>Peter Peacock defined neatly the grazing capability of land on which gorse and bracken are growing. As he said, early in the spring, grass grows on bracken and gorse-carrying ground, and grazing can and does take place. That is an odd and anomalous situation. We must clear up the issue of when grazing ground stops being grazing ground.</p><p>I congratulate Liam McArthur on bringing this matter to the Parliament's attention and look forward, as does he, to the minister's response.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20861237", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Farm Payments (Penalties)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, as a farmer who is in receipt of agricultural support payments and has had penalties levied on his business because of a simple mistake.

It will provide the necessary certainty in future when used with the register that the commission will also hold. For example, in time it will reduce the iniquity of ransom strips and allow neglect to be addressed more directly, particularly where neglected fences are boundaries. Like others, I welcome and support the concept of voluntary and community-based mapping and registration, and I support giving a limited amount of time for this exercise to be carried out&#8212;I note the minister's intention to make that one year only. I welcome the amendments that the minister mentioned, particularly with regard to common grazings, and the fact that she will lodge them at stage 2.</p><p>Part 3 of the bill addresses absenteeism and neglect. Let me deal first with absenteeism. Crofting is a way of life that I support and champion&#8212;and championed in a previous life in the National Farmers Union&#8212;as it has sustained and supported remote and fragile communities in areas that people would otherwise have long since abandoned. For that reason alone crofting is worth cherishing further, but to do that it is essential that people live in and sustain the communities.</p><p>The committee debated for hours the appropriate distance to use in defining an absentee, and I came to the conclusion that the appropriate distance for triggering an inquiry from the commission would be different in different areas and communities and that it would best be left to the new commission to decide for each <place-holder colnum=\"26145\"/> area&#8212;although I note the minister's pragmatic intention to make the distance 32km.</p><p>We all acknowledge that extenuating circumstances will, and must, be taken into account for those who are not ordinarily resident on their croft, but it is important to recognise that, if people do not wish to live on their croft and work the land in these remote communities, there are, in some areas at least, many people who would. To me, coming from a remote rural area myself, the sustainability of the community is the fundamental issue, and from that perspective all else flows. Of course, neglect must also be addressed but, at the end of the day, having people living in thriving communities is more important than the problems of broken-down fences, dykes and bulrushes.</p><p>To that end, there is an opportunity for the self-monitoring of crofts by developing and building on the agricultural census forms that are completed by all landholders in Scotland. An additional declaration on that form could invite the respondee to declare that their croft was well maintained, that land that might appear to be neglected was in fact being put to purposeful conservation use and that crofters were living in, and were active members of a community. In addition, it could be used for electoral registration. Anyone who was found to have made a false declaration could be investigated by the commission, which would perhaps also randomly inspect a small number of crofts each year, as well as those whose returns raised questions within the commission.</p><p>My proposal would reduce the costs of the commission, which some of us feel might be inadequately funded to address all the tasks that are set out in the bill, and I strongly urge the Government to consider my suggestion. I welcome the Government's cautious welcome of the idea, which must, of course, avoid duplication.</p><p>The committee had concerns that the provision on landlord's clawback is far from clear. That must be cleared up by the Government before stage 2. In addition, although we all agreed that speculative development should be discouraged, there is an argument about whether the clawback period should be extended from five years to 10.

Currently, around 30 per cent of food purchased in supermarkets is not consumed, but thrown out. With food security becoming an issue, household budgets under increasing pressure and greenhouse gas emissions increasing, the waste of 30 per cent of consumable food is almost criminal. I am certain that most people are not aware of how much food they leave on the side of their plate or throw out of their fridge and vegetable rack in the kitchen. That so much more could be done in our homes and kitchens to reduce waste, and therefore greenhouse gases, is a message that is not yet fully understood. In pursuing its zero waste policy, the Government should address food waste in future public education programmes.</p><p>The elephant in the room, to which my amendment refers, is non-municipal waste and what is to be done with it. As the Federation of Small Businesses asks in its briefing, what can be done to give small businesses greater access to kerbside recycling? I say to the minister that that is perhaps an easy win. Although we have made huge strides in reusing and recycling municipal waste, we have not as yet tackled head on the problem that 40 per cent of all our waste is industrial and commercial waste. Historically, we have had access to cheap landfill. Infrastructure has not been put in place and investment has not been made to deal with trade waste.

Although, of course, more must be done to reuse and recycle and to design out waste in packaging, the broad direction of travel in relation to the resolution of municipal waste issues has been established.

Over the past three years, the number of incidents of violence and abuse towards Scottish shopkeepers has risen by 78 per <place-holder colnum=\"25279\"/> cent. Every minute of the working day, a shopkeeper or shop worker is threatened physically, attacked or verbally abused. There are about 13,000 incidents a year, which is simply unacceptable.</p><p>Those citizens&#8212;our people&#8212;are simply trying to get on with a day's work, and more must be done to help them. No employee should have to feel intimidated just for doing his or her job. I welcome the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Worker's freedom from fear campaign and its work to raise awareness among shoppers and workers alike, that the antisocial behaviour that is exhibited towards them is not only unacceptable but against the law. I hope that, through our support, we can give shop workers the fortitude to speak out against such abusive behaviour, rather than accept it as part of the job, particularly&#8212;as Hugh Henry mentioned&#8212;at Christmas or during the Christmas sales.</p><p>The freedom from fear campaign has rightly recognised that the origin of most attacks is rooted in the sale of alcohol. The conflict that arises from shopkeepers and shop workers policing the sale of age-restricted products is frequently the starting point of the abuse that they receive. It leaves shopkeepers and shop workers in a vulnerable situation, in which they must choose between potentially causing conflict or risking prosecution in the event that a mistake is made.</p><p>The think 25 policy, which the motion highlights, can help hugely, by insisting that people who are aged below 25 but above 18 will be required to produce photographic identification when purchasing alcoholic drinks. The introduction of the challenge 21 initiative proved to be successful in reducing the number of underage sales. By raising the identification age, we can expect even more improvement. Large firms such as Asda are already enforcing the scheme and are helping to address the stigma that surrounds age checking, and to reduce the conflict that it can cause. With nine out of 10 underage drinkers believing that local convenience stores offer them the best chance to be served alcohol, we must promote the think 25 initiative throughout all stores. That will help to cut down underage drinking and to reduce the level of offence that might be caused by asking for identification and, with that, the incidence of aggression that is shown to shopkeepers.</p><p>By reducing the incidence of those unwarranted attacks we will be doing a great service to all those Scots who, on a day-to-day basis, face isolation and threats to which no one in the workplace should be subjected. In doing that, we will help to create not just a safer working environment but a safer shopping experience for customers.

She eloquently identified the problems in her constituency&#8212;Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. My constituency&#8212;Ayr&#8212;suffers from similar problems, as does much of west and central Scotland.</p><p>The case study in the report on East Ayrshire, which Cathy Jamieson mentioned, and the recent job losses that have been caused by Diageo withdrawing from Kilmarnock highlight the problems of post-industrial decline and the long-term unemployment that is left in the wake of industrial job losses. Everyone in Ayrshire deplores the unemployment level in East Ayrshire&#8212;12.6 per cent&#8212;which has come about as a result of the Diageo withdrawal. From taking part in the march through Kilmarnock and attending the rallies, like Cathy Jamieson, I am aware of the impact in human terms that the closure has had on people's lives, not just in Kilmarnock but throughout Ayrshire and the west of Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"24681\"/></p><p>In my constituency, particularly in north Ayr, long-term unemployment is a huge issue. The problems seem almost intractable. The telling feature in our areas of high deprivation is the effect on people's health generally and on their life expectancy in particular. The level of incapacity benefits is an indication of the effects of unemployment, and possibly a better indication than the raw figures on the number of unemployed people. I have been struck many times by the heartbreaking situation of the many people who, through absolutely no fault of their own, are unable to find work. Cathy Jamieson correctly highlighted the loss of dignity and the spiral of decline that can flow from that.</p><p>That is enough analysis and hand-wringing; we need to find solutions to the problem. I and other Ayrshire members were pleased to welcome Jim Mather to Ayrshire on Monday to discuss the problem and find a sensible way forward. Although I was unable to be present to hear the conclusions that were reached that day, it is self-evident to me that there are many ways of starting to address the problem.</p><p>First, notwithstanding the foregoing debate, it is important to say that the glass is half full rather than half empty, in that Ayrshire still has a great deal going for it. By that I mean that we must build on what is already in place. The reality is that it is often easier to expand and grow existing businesses than to attract or build new ones. Therefore, we must build on the aerospace cluster around Prestwick airport, which has a world-class reputation for maintenance, repair and overhaul, that has recently been boosted by Ryanair's welcome decision to create a further 200 jobs there.</p><p>As Cathy Jamieson said, we must provide more and better targeted training and apprenticeships for the likely growth sectors in the economy of Ayrshire and the west of Scotland. We must continue to put in place infrastructure that increases Ayrshire's connectivity to central Scotland and England. That means giving the A70 trunk road status and upgrading the strategic link to the M74. We must create and brand Ayrshire as a location and destination of choice for business and tourism alike so that Ayrshire receives more consideration from those who are contemplating inward investment and inbound tourism than it has had in the past.</p><p>My view is that, notwithstanding our problems, we must aspire to a branding image that shouts from the rooftops what a terrific and favoured place Ayrshire is. For that reason we should call ourselves the riviera of Scotland, perhaps taking in the whole of south-west Scotland, because we have a fantastic area to promote and sell&#8212;but that is not happening sufficiently well at the moment. <place-holder colnum=\"24682\"/></p><p>We all agree on that. We must position ourselves to take advantage of renewable energy developments onshore and offshore. We should note the availability and sustainability of the ports of Ayr, Troon and Hunterston for those developments, given that land and skills are available in and around Prestwick airport and elsewhere to develop and build wind turbines&#8212;all of which gives us a huge potential to sustain jobs and create new ones.</p><p>It is self-evident that, if we are to reduce unemployment, we must create employment. Ayrshire must work coherently and collaboratively to support and create new jobs and new businesses. In turn, that will have a positive impact on health and standards of living. Although Cathy Jamieson and I might have slightly different route maps on how best to achieve that goal, I am certain that she and other MSPs share that goal, and I am happy to support her motion today.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20700123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Industrial Communities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Cathy Jamieson on securing the debate and on raising the important issue of unemployment in our former industrial communities.

I note at the outset the missed opportunity to do that in the Marine (Scotland) Bill, which we passed recently.

It is an industry with an enormous future and with the potential to grow massively in coming years, with 400 new jobs in prospect in the near future.</p><p>At the moment, Scottish salmon is the best farmed salmon product in the world and represents the major part of our aquaculture industry. Ninety per cent of United Kingdom aquaculture is based in Scotland and our Scottish salmon has attracted the label rouge award from France because of the quality of our product and the high welfare standard to which it is reared.</p><p>As you will be aware, Presiding Officer, because of infectious salmon anaemia in Chile, Scotland and Norway have an enormous opportunity to supply a growing world market for farmed fish.

It is fair to say that the transfer of that planning responsibility to local authorities has been less than successful, consistent or widely acclaimed by the fish farming industry. Each local authority that is involved has&#8212;willingly or unwillingly&#8212;had to develop expertise in that new responsibility, and some authorities have responded more enthusiastically than others.</p><p>Consistency throughout Scotland in dealing with planning applications has been lacking and the Government missed a huge opportunity to standardise the approach when it did not give Marine Scotland planning control for aquaculture.

We all understand the difficulties of providing affordable housing in the peripheral and island areas of northern and western Scotland but, if the minister is serious about growing the industry&#8212;as I know that she is&#8212;hand wringing alone will not solve the problem. Her Government must find a way of addressing the housing shortage soon.</p><p>The industry must put its own house further in order by better containing fish and reducing escapes. I wish the closed containment sub-group every success in its work to protect the environment. Like the common cold, sea lice are likely to remain a problem for the foreseeable future, but that does not mean that further research into treating the problem should not be conducted. Perhaps research institutes such as the Moredun Research Institute could look into that when they develop vaccines to treat parasites in sheep, for example. Who knows? Transferable technology might be available to be built on.</p><p>A further growth inhibitor in the industry's development is the apparent inability to raise capital to finance fish farming companies in Scotland and the UK. That is why our very Scottish industry is owned largely by Norwegian companies that are financed by capital that is raised on the Oslo stock exchange. We need venture capitalists, Scottish entrepreneurs, Scottish Enterprise and others to wake up to the huge opportunity that exists here to invest in a growing and sustainable industry that will play a huge part in delivering food security in future.</p><p>The output of land-based agriculture will grow only by percentages in the years ahead, but fish farming has the potential to grow in multiples as it moves offshore and as we develop the technology perhaps to create integrated platform structures that combine renewable energy harvesting with harvesting fish from our seas.</p><p>Before that happens, we need to free up our planning and licensing system and develop our potential closer to home. In addition, we need to train and encourage more planners to move to planning departments and local authorities in the north and west of Scotland, where the demand for such expertise now lies.

I congratulate Brian Pack on his report and commend him on his bravery in being the messenger who is telling the industry about the probability of fundamental change and, indeed, making us all think about the support structure that is likely to be in place after 2013.</p><p>The reform of the CAP is our starting point in today's debate, and the Government is sensible in thinking about that reform early. The interim report is about the beginning of a process that will deliver <place-holder colnum=\"24064\"/> change, possibly in three to four years, or preferably over a longer time. It has certainly sparked an industry-wide debate about how future support should be delivered in Scotland, where 85 per cent of the land is classified as less favoured area. One has only to look at the massive snow cover in Scotland as we speak to get an understanding of our disadvantage, with 200-day winters being the norm. I returned from Caithness yesterday, and I recognise the difficulties and costs that are attached to peripheral agricultural production in Scotland, on the north-western tip of Europe.</p><p>The Pack report notes that Europe recognises that there will still be a need for a common agricultural policy to ensure future food production and regulate common standards in the environment, welfare, and animal health. It further notes that, notwithstanding likely reductions in European Union budgets, support will have to remain in place, and acknowledges that it will have to be more targeted than in the past. Unsurprisingly, the Scottish Government's objectives are broadly similar and, as we move cautiously towards area-based payments, the problem becomes about how best to equitably achieve the goals within available budgets.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives believe that future support must go to those who are actively involved in the delivery of public goods, including food production and environmental enhancement. Secondly, those new entrants who were not farming in the 2000 to 2002 reference period must be recognised and supported after 2013. If a way can reasonably be found, they should be supported before then, as Sarah Boyack suggested.</p><p>The Pack report proposes a four-part model for the delivery of future agricultural support: the continuation of direct payments; the creation and use of top-up funds; the continuation of the rural development programme; and the continuation of less favoured area support. I will deal with a couple of those headings.</p><p>First, the industry in Scotland would like the continuation of direct payments through the single farm payment for as long as possible. Although it is recognised that, ultimately, that support will have to be delivered through an area-based system, the industry wants the historical system that is based on the 2000 to 2002 reference period to continue in some shape or form for as long as possible. Of course, that is naked self-interest, but when intensive livestock producers, such as those in the south-west of Scotland, the Borders and the north-east, hear college advisers predicting that returns per hectare will fall by more than 50 per cent when we move to an area-based system, it is no wonder that alarm bells are ringing and heels <place-holder colnum=\"24065\"/> are being dug in. That is why NFU Scotland and the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association&#8212;although for different reasons&#8212;are calling for the current support to be re-based on active farming. Provided that that can be achieved within the EU rules and regulations, that must at least be considered as an interim measure in tandem with the development of an area-based system.</p><p>The intensive livestock sector, which forms the backbone of Scotland's agricultural output, cannot be put at risk unnecessarily. Every effort must be made to maintain the status quo for as long as possible and until a satisfactory area-based system can be worked out. Given the fact that only two member states out of the original 15 have moved to an area-based system, re-basing makes sense. In addition, taking a recent year as a reference year and basing support on active farming could create a reserve entitlement pool for new entrants to access. Such a refinement of the historical model, if achievable, would give the industry some breathing space.</p><p>Secondly, I understand Brian Pack's recommendation to create a top-up fund post-2013, but we do not yet know whether the EU or the WTO would regard that as being within the rules. Although we may have to consider the use of such a fund in the longer term, a lot of work will have to be done to find an equitable way of redistributing funds through that method. My view is that, should such a fund be created, the top-up amount should be moved from pillar 1 into pillar 2 and be distributed largely through the current LFAS scheme. That would have the benefit of causing the minimum upset while focusing on maintaining and compensating for farming in disadvantaged areas. I suspect, too, that the EU would regard that more favourably. Such a mechanism for redistribution could and should be targeted appropriately to deliver not only sustainable farming and socioeconomic objectives, but continued environmental enhancement, thereby delivering several types of necessary public benefits for each pound that is spent.</p><p>Scotland has started on the journey of considering CAP reform, which is to be welcomed. The interim report has, unsurprisingly, opened a can of worms that we all knew had to be looked into sooner or later. I hope that, by adding a political dimension, today's debate will give Brian Pack and his team further pointers on the shape of the final report that will be produced later in the year and I, too, wish him luck in the enormous task that he has undertaken on the Government's behalf.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5807.2, to insert at end:<place-holder colnum=\"24066\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\", while noting that as Scotland moves to an area-based payment scheme there will be redistribution of existing support, and therefore encourages the Scottish Government to ensure that the process of redistribution is as equitable as possible and takes particular account of the Less Favoured Areas.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice and Law Officers: \"Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest as a hill farmer whose interests are very much affected by the contents of the report and the forthcoming reform of the CAP, and by welcoming the announcement of the \u00a33 million storm damage fund.

I am certain that what we have delivered is better than what existed before. Marine Scotland now has a huge task ahead of it to implement the bill. An ecosystem approach to the development of national marine plans will take a huge amount of studying and information-gathering, and I wish Marine Scotland well in that task.</p><p>We have also dealt specifically with fish-farming and seal protection in section 5, and I hope that we achieved a compromise that allows and encourages the development of aquaculture, while protecting our internationally important seal colonies.

Indeed, as John Beddington has recently pointed out, by 2030&#8212;only 20 years from now&#8212;we will need to produce 50 per cent more food worldwide using less land, less water, less energy and less pesticide while producing no more carbon than we currently do. That means that Scotland, the UK and Europe must again consider genetically modified crops if we are to be considered serious in our intention to feed future generations without increasing our carbon output.</p><p>In addition, we in Scotland have to consider ways of protecting ourselves from the increased risk of sea level rise and storm surges, which pose a real threat to the upper Forth and Clyde. At the moment, an opportunity exists&#8212;as the minister is aware&#8212;to protect the upper Forth by creating a barrage across the Forth instead of building a new bridge. A barrage would protect Grangemouth oil refinery and Longannet from tidal surges and sea level rise, as well as protecting Bo'ness, Grangemouth and Kincardine. In addition, it could take all the traffic, and more, that a new bridge could carry and, given the tidal rise and fall in the Forth, it could also generate electricity, which would enable it to pay for itself in the long term.</p><p>A Forth barrage would provide several bangs for the one buck: storm surge protection for towns and key installations, the provision of a new Forth crossing and the generation of renewable electricity. Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy might consider offering to develop and finance that idea, as it would, in the long run, provide renewable base-load generating capacity and free up &#163;2 billion in a shrunken Scottish Government budget while providing a market solution to some of the above problems.</p><p>We wish Stewart Stevenson well at Copenhagen, and we regret that he has not been properly included as part of a UK delegation, as Shirley-Anne Somerville noted.

I welcome this debate and the Government motion on the central Scotland green network.</p><p>The recently launched green network offers a chance to regenerate and reinvigorate a large area of our central belt, and, as we have heard, it could benefit the substantial proportion of Scotland's population who live within the project's boundary. It is certainly an ambitious project, stretching from Ayrshire in the west right through to East Lothian and Fife, and including 19 local authority areas. It is very satisfying to see this concept&#8212;which was initially instigated by Ian Lang when he was the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland&#8212;coming to fruition.</p><p>The network is currently at a fairly early and formative stage, and it is vital that we seize the chance to ensure that it reaches its full potential for the sake of the environment and the Scottish people. I am sure that the minister will agree that we have a lot of work ahead to make the network a success, but there is a great appetite to achieve that. The economic, environmental and social benefits of the network will be wide ranging, and as part of a well-managed and focused initiative, <place-holder colnum=\"21124\"/> those benefits will improve lives and livelihoods across the central belt and the whole of Scotland.</p><p>The concept of strong, sustainable growth, which is a key aim of the central Scotland green network, is one that the Conservatives have always supported. We believe that preserving the environment must not be seen as something that conflicts with economic growth. Ultimately, only sustainable growth will guarantee prosperity for ourselves and for future generations. Further, in terms of supporting economic growth, it can only be of benefit to central Scotland to make the area a more attractive place in which to live and do business. Making the most of derelict land and regenerating urban areas will also help to reinvigorate local areas and complement improvements in transport and infrastructure, which will ensure that central Scotland builds on its reputation as a competitive and sought-after place in which to do business.</p><p>The network could aid in strengthening and supporting existing regeneration programmes in central Scotland by securing a sustainable, long-term future for disadvantaged areas and by better meeting the needs of the existing community, attracting new residents and helping to improve people's quality of life.</p><p>In addition, the network can bring a range of health benefits, with more opportunities to access high-quality green spaces across the central belt for recreation purposes. I am sure that members will welcome the fact that that will offer people more chances for increased outdoor physical activity, particularly as we try to tackle problems such as childhood obesity and mental health issues, as well as trying generally to improve wellbeing.</p><p>Of course, numerous existing local green networks, such as the Ayrshire green network, offer residents and visitors a chance to explore outdoor areas of interest and enjoy the natural environment on a more local scale. Projects such as the raised bogs habitat action plan and East Ayrshire woodlands initiative to expand and enhance native and amenity woodlands in Ayrshire already provide opportunities to expand habitat for wildlife, reduce or reverse biodiversity decline and facilitate adaptation to the effects of climate change.</p><p>I believe that the whole of Ayrshire should be part of the central Scotland green network, and that the remaining part of South Ayrshire that is not already in the area should be included. I know that South Ayrshire Council would welcome further discussions with Ms Cunningham or Mr Neil in that regard.</p><p>However, first, we must make full use of our existing local green networks. One of the benefits <place-holder colnum=\"21125\"/> of the central Scotland green network is that it can help to identify current gaps in local provision. Where needs and pressures are greatest, it will be possible to suggest opportunities and priorities for improvement.</p><p>To ensure the success of the central Scotland green network, it is vital that it is managed in a joined-up and coherent way. It is essential that it has strong and focused leadership in order to achieve its crucial aims, such as sustainable growth and economic regeneration. We therefore urge the minister to ensure that the process of setting up a new board and appointing a chair is completed as soon as possible.</p><p>Conservatives welcome the chance to create the network but&#8212;particularly at a time of recession&#8212;we are aware of the cost implications and of the need to ensure that the project delivers its returns, which will only be achievable if it is operated as a tightly run ship.</p><p>Conservatives note the concerns that were raised by Simon Rennie, the chief executive of the Central Scotland Forest Trust, when he stated at the \"Green Networks: Potential for Central Scotland\" conference on 30 September that local action and networks can help to deliver the wider aims of the central Scotland green network, but local action and networks alone are not enough to run a truly successful larger scheme, as we have a situation where action is occurring in \"discrete boxes\". He suggested that we need a more co-ordinated approach across the whole network area to allow the network to realise its full potential. I urge the minister to take those points on board, and I endorse Sarah Boyack's comments in that regard.</p><p>As the interim steering group moves towards the creation of a first-draft work plan for the network, which it is likely to produce in the coming year, I wish its members every success in their task, and I look forward to scrutinising the plan when it comes before the Parliament for consultation.</p><p>Conservatives believe that quality of life and environmental issues must be at the heart of politics, and the central Scotland green network offers us a tremendous opportunity to put that vision into action.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20375795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Central Scotland Green Network"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As ever, I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer.

It is becoming clearer daily that many of the problems that our industry and Governments face arise from the now-acknowledged structural failings of the CFP.</p><p>Brussels now recognises that it is&#8212;and has been for many years&#8212;part of the problem and not the solution. That is to be welcomed, but we are where we are. Fish stocks in Scottish waters are particularly under threat, and we have to chart a way forward from here for our industry.</p><p>Before I turn to this year's negotiations and reform of the CFP, I say to the business managers that far too little time was made available today for me to do justice to both.</p><p>In this year's negotiations, the Government must build on what has been achieved in the past. I understand the attraction for the cabinet secretary of introducing closed-circuit television in an attempt to reduce discards to an acceptable level but, sadly, CCTV cameras will not of themselves stop the problem of discards in a mixed fishery. More fundamentally and conceptually, fishermen must be encouraged and rewarded for catching less but landing more. I share the cabinet secretary's distaste for wasting good-quality and valuable fish.</p><p>The problem of dealing with mixed fisheries remains; we can and must deal with it now. We <place-holder colnum=\"20974\"/> must work harder and faster to develop selective gear and perhaps to get some of our university research and development departments on board to help further reduce cod mortality.</p><p>Real-time closures must continue to be used to reduce catches of cod and protect spawning grounds. All of that must be achieved against a background of reduced TACs in almost every stock except cod and west coast herring.</p><p>Innovative ways of supporting the industry during this period of fishing austerity and declining TACs will need to be found. As Sarah Boyack indicated, fleet survivability is of paramount importance. In the meantime, the Commission, politicians and others must get to work on reforming the CFP.</p><p>I share the cabinet secretary's concern that there is little time left to secure a sustainable future for some of our fish stocks and our fishing industry, given the parlous state of some fish stocks, especially on the west coast. Reform of the CFP must happen and be implemented very quickly after 2012. Most pundits and speakers at the interregional advisory council conference agreed on the barriers to creating sustainable fisheries, which include too much micromanagement, a lack of political will to set and keep to long-term objectives, imprecise policy objectives in the first instance, a lack of transparency in decision making, a lack of participation and ownership in decision making at local and regional level, and a lack of structure to avoid discards. For all of those reasons, and many others, there is an accepted need for reform.</p><p>Regionalisation is now accepted as the best way forward and has been supported by Conservatives for many years. CFP reform must take us to regional co-management, with shared responsibilities and ownership of the problem replacing an outdated, top-down, centralised approach. Of course, policy objectives will still need to be set by the European Commission&#8212;and now, following the ratification of the Lisbon treaty, the European Parliament. RACs will need to be made to work better and given a clearer role in linking policy implementation and development, as well as overseeing on the ground. Now that we have defined the problem, we must look for the detail of the structure that is applicable to the Scottish fishing industry. I welcome the cabinet secretary's remarks on the four-point action plan that he intends to develop, which will, I hope, take us from now to the point at which CFP reforms kick in.</p><p>Member state delivery of high-level objectives set by the Commission will be the new way forward. Self-evidently, different regional sea areas will need to have different aims and objectives, with different fish stocks, different types <place-holder colnum=\"20975\"/> of fisheries and now different climate change problems to manage. However, we must consider a new approach, and quickly, given that the old CFP is now regarded universally as being part of the problem rather than the solution, while in the meantime fishermen and fisheries are struggling.</p><p>We need more time to discuss CFP reform another day. In the meantime, Conservatives commend our amendment to Parliament and wish our Scottish and UK Government ministers every success in securing the best sustainable deal possible for our Scottish fishing industry on 14 and 15 December.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5119.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and believes that, in that context, a more regionally responsible approach to fisheries management is required and that, in order to achieve this, the Scottish Government and HM Government must work together in the interests of a sustainable Scottish fishing industry.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. I have too little time.

It is important to record the progress that we have made since our previous debate on national parks in 2008. I turn first to Sarah Boyack's points and the most contentious issues.</p><p>In March 2008, I called for a reduction in the size of the boards of our two esteemed national park authorities&#8212;to protests, as I recall, from both the Liberals and the Labour Party. I commend the authors of the national parks review for their recommendation that the boards should be reduced in size. As I said in 2008, provided that local democracy can be delivered, I believe that even smaller boards would still achieve the same purposes, but nonetheless I wish the new boards every success in the future and welcome the direction of travel as well as the development of local democracy in governance terms.</p><p>In the interest of continuing to reduce costs, I welcome the progress that the national park authorities are making in relation to the report's proposals on the sharing of corporate services and <place-holder colnum=\"20784\"/> joint working. In the current economic climate, the boards' willingness to develop joint working is greatly to be welcomed.</p><p>I also welcome the minister's intention to create a short-life national parks strategy group to examine the further strategic development of our national parks. I again commend to the Parliament the model of the Banff national park in the Canadian Rockies, which was established in 1885 and which first led me to see the enormous benefits of national parks to local ecosystems and economies. The environmental, social and economic benefits that are beginning to accrue for the residents of our national parks and others make the expansion of the parks' boundaries worthy of further consideration.</p><p>The possibility of developing other national parks should also be considered. I know that the Presiding Officer has campaigned for a national park to be established in and around the Galloway forest park, and that idea is certainly worthy of support. Indeed, I understand that the Scottish Council for National Parks recently showed interest in pursuing the prospect of a Galloway national park and flagged up the potential of the geography in that part of south-west Scotland as highly conducive to the creation of a joint marine and land-based national park. I am sure that the minister will agree that that idea is worthy of consideration.</p><p>Perhaps the short-life working group will also consider the further development and protection of our regional parks in recognition of the important role that they play in protecting and enhancing unique landscapes and their proximity to two of our major cities. As the lungs of Glasgow and Edinburgh, the Clyde Muirshiel regional park and the Pentland hills regional park in particular only have a greater role to play in future in protecting and enhancing the immediate environs of those cities while delivering tourist destinations of choice and complementing our two national parks.</p><p>As more UK residents are likely to holiday at home rather than abroad in the foreseeable future&#8212;given Labour's recession and the resulting weakness of the pound&#8212;it makes good sense to deliver more activity and eco-based tourism opportunities. Having visited the Clyde Muirshiel regional park during the summer, and having spent much of my teenage years tramping over the Pentlands, I know at first hand about the amazing scenery and fine views over the Clyde and the Forth of the parks. In marketing terms, they could easily be used to complement our truly unique and magnificent national parks at Loch Lomond and the Cairngorms.</p><p>Turning to other governance issues, I note the report's recommendation that the convener and deputy convener of the national park authorities <place-holder colnum=\"20785\"/> should be appointed by the Scottish ministers to ensure the delivery of national policies and objectives. I would have thought that such a position was not unreasonable, but I also note that the majority of consultees felt that the conveners and deputy conveners of the national park authority boards should be elected from the ranks of board members. It is a brave Government decision to accept that view.</p><p>Given that the majority of national parks funding comes from Government, the approach recommended in the report would certainly be consistent with regard to accountability and the need to streamline park authorities to ensure value for money. The appointment of the conveners should have been in the gift of the Scottish Government and the fact that they are not might in future raise questions about the wisdom of the Government's decision. That said, I wish the conveners and deputy conveners every success.</p><p>I welcome the progress that the minister has made in the past months. Although the Conservatives believe that yet more could have been done to increase accountability and reduce costs, we nevertheless welcome the progress that has been made towards our shared goal of turning our national parks into destinations of choice for all those who visit Scotland in future and those of us in Scotland who have time on our hands and want to explore our native landscapes and habitats.</p><p>I move and commend to Parliament amendment S3M-5110.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"while also welcoming the reduction in the size of the boards of the National Park Authorities, thereby producing greater efficiencies by way of reducing running costs, and emphasising that the proposed National Parks Strategy group must have a clear timescale of operation and well defined sense of purpose in its objectives.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20287305", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer.

I note the cabinet secretary's intention to be flexible in that regard.</p><p>Wherever possible, marine region boundaries should match up and tie in with inshore fisheries group boundaries as well as river basin <place-holder colnum=\"20639\"/> management plans, to provide an intelligent and coherent unified approach to terrestrial and marine environmental improvement in the designated areas, using Scotland's well-known firths as the starting point. As the minister has said, the Solway Firth will require special attention, including some adaptations to the UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill. I welcome his determination to address that by drawing up a concordat, as well as the remarks that Hilary Benn made in that regard in Westminster on Tuesday 27 October.</p><p>In overseeing the development of a national marine plan and several regional plans, Marine Scotland and Scottish ministers will need to do all that they can to address and simplify the current complexity of legislation governing marine areas. Of course we accept that there will, of necessity, be limitations in what can be achieved, but determination must be shown to streamline and simplify the proposals, perhaps by consolidation or by the codification of legal rights and duties.</p><p>As the minister will be aware, concerns remain that part 3 of the bill will not lead to the much-needed simplification of the marine licensing system. Although the minister's brochure \"Scotland's First Marine Bill\" diagrammatically and dramatically shows the creation of a one-stop-shop approach, industry stakeholders are having difficulty seeing how that will work in practice. The most likely effect could be a huge expansion of the function of Marine Scotland and in the tasks that it will be expected to undertake. The question must be asked whether that expansion will be either sensible or affordable. The threshold between the licensing and registering of marine activities also needs to be made clearer in the bill, as does the development of an appeals procedure. I welcome the Government's response on the establishment of an independent appeals process.</p><p>The committee believes that the bill should impose a duty to create a network of MPAs, and I welcome the Government's intention to lodge an amendment on that at stage 2, but it is vital to recognise that, however desirable MPAs may be in environmental terms, they could threaten people's existing and traditional livelihoods. Such designations must of course be achieved by the appliance of science, must integrate with the national marine plan, and should wherever possible seek to mitigate the effects of climate change, which is a growing daily threat. I am pleased that the minister proposes to lodge a stage 2 amendment on that, too. It appears that, unless climate change is addressed, we will, for instance, lose many of our native corals in the next 100 years as sea acidification rises. The concern is that, notwithstanding our best intentions, dramatic and irreversible change could be about to take place in our seas and oceans because of climate change. The report from Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"20640\"/> Environment LINK highlights the challenges that face us.</p><p>Conservatives believe that a balance must be struck between encouraging fish farming and the preservation of grey and, in particular, common seals, both of which are protected species. I appreciate the unwelcome cost to fish farmers of installing and maintaining anti-predator nets or other deterrents. There is a danger of rendering fish farming uneconomic internationally; getting the balance wrong between protecting seals from their own instincts and protecting fish farms from predatory attack could mean exporting the industry and jobs to other parts of the world. For that reason, more research must be done to find out why common seal numbers are declining, and also to develop better and cheaper methods of protecting fish farms from seal attack. Conservatives believe that seals should be destroyed only when \"no satisfactory alternative\" exists, but a clearer definition of that term is needed.</p><p>Conservatives welcome the advent of the bill. We will work constructively with the Government, other parties and stakeholders to improve it further at stage 2.

I declare an interest as a farmer.</p><p>Like Peter Peacock and Bill Wilson, I am a veteran of the report. It has been an interesting debate. I thank members on all sides for their contributions; the clerks, for their enormous efforts in bringing the report to fruition in difficult circumstances; those who gave evidence; and those who hosted us on our various visits. All the <place-holder colnum=\"20344\"/> key themes that are identified in the report have been discussed, but in my summing up I will focus on three of them.</p><p>The first key theme is planning. We rely on the planning system to ensure that the right land is zoned for the right purposes. In this age of global food security concerns, that means protecting good farming land, which is in short supply in Scotland, from unnecessary development. Members would expect me to say that. We also rely on the planning system to protect our countryside from suburban sprawl and inappropriate design. It is only fair to make it clear that the committee saw first-hand evidence of planners working effectively within those constraints to help to get affordable houses built.</p><p>Unfortunately, that is not the story overall, as Maureen Watt indicated in her opening speech. Over the course of the inquiry, committee members picked up anecdotal evidence of developments in the middle of the countryside not being allowed because the developer would not put in streetlights and pavements; because the road was too narrow to let a refuse van pass a school bus; or because the proposal was for an eco-home, and it could not be an eco-home if it could not be reached by public transport.</p><p>Nevertheless, I stress that it was not the committee's experience that the blame lies with particular planners or particular planning departments. The trouble is that, over the years, an entire system seems to have built up with a built-in presumption against development in the countryside. The report refers to that as an overconservative planning culture. Although, in my view, there is little wrong with being overconservative, we took the view that our planning culture has become overcautious. A change in attitude is needed, and it must come from the top down. Nanette Milne, Elaine Murray and Rob Gibson all referred to that. I put it to the minister that the implementation of the Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 and the revision of planning guidance affords us a once-in-a-generation chance, which must be grasped, to change the culture. As Peter Peacock said, we must no longer rely on section 75 agreements to fund affordable urban and rural housing. Different and additional ways must be found to create and access future funding.</p><p>Land supply is another key theme in the report. The committee's convener, in her opening speech, and then Peter Peacock referred to the very Scottish paradox that much of the countryside lies empty, yet there is very little land on which to build new homes. Of course, as the debate has made clear, it is not quite that simple. For one thing, there is much less suitable land than there might appear to be. Geography plays its part in that, <place-holder colnum=\"20345\"/> through sloping sites, poor drainage and so on, although some witnesses warned the committee that we were in danger of missing a trick if we did not apply the latest technology and engineering techniques to bring some of that land into circulation. As other members have said, however, the fundamental problem with land supply is that not enough land is being made available at a realistic price. There will always be a debate over which of the carrot or the stick would be most useful in rectifying that situation, and that debate has been rehearsed again this afternoon in the context of CPOs.</p><p>I stress two points. First, there are a great many landowners out there who are keen to be part of the solution and who are working in partnership with planners, developers and housing associations to bring decent, affordable and sustainable housing into circulation in areas that are under high housing pressure. I saw that for myself in highland Perthshire last May, when I visited Atholl Estates, where exemplary and innovative work was being carried out in partnership with the local housing association.</p><p>However, as that visit made clear, there are a lot of practical and financial obstacles in people's way, such as the planning system, the cost of infrastructure and the difficulty of arranging a long-term lease. Our report highlighted a fairly depressing lack of awareness of the available schemes and the feeling among landowners that, try as they might, they simply cannot get the figures to work for them. I welcome the minister's comments on the need to attract more funding into the affordable rural housing sector.</p><p>My second point on the issue of land is that, in as much as there is a problem with availability, the burden of rectifying it does not rest solely with private landowners. The public sector, including the Scottish Government, also has a role to play. During its inquiry, the committee noted that some predominantly rural councils, such as Highland Council, have a policy of considering whether any redundant land or property that they hold can be put to use as affordable housing. It seems to the committee that all rural councils should apply that best practice.</p><p>My final point is on what councils can do to address the rural housing problem, particularly in what our report referred to as the \"hotspots\", where housing pressures are acute.</p><p>Our inquiry examined the constraints that are imposed on councils and the factors that prevent them from dealing with rural housing, and we uncovered some difficult home truths, such as the effect of homelessness legislation&#8212;however well meant it might have been&#8212;and the loss of the local connection, which was referred to passionately by Liam McArthur, Elaine Murray, <place-holder colnum=\"20346\"/> Karen Gillon and Christine Grahame. I note that the minister recognised the extent of the problem and stated his intention to address it, if he can. I know that the committee would welcome that.</p><p>We also examined what has worked, a good example of which is the land bank for affordable housing in the Highlands and Islands that is operated with great success by Highland Housing Alliance.</p><p>In the end, however, the committee was left with the strong impression that, in special cases, more powers might be needed in those hot spot areas. That is what led us to float the more radical proposal of allowing councils, on a case-by-case basis, to access what we called a \"toolbox of measures\" to help them address housing pressures. However, as a Conservative, I should make it clear that my party is against ending the principle of the right to buy, which has served Scotland well in the past. What is needed now is that more houses be built. That is, perhaps, the key point in the whole debate.</p><p>I know that some of the committee's suggestions were quite contentious, such as the suggestion that councils might, exceptionally, wish to levy an enhanced council tax charge to finance an affordable housing fund. However, it is sometimes the role of a committee report to provoke, and it has been interesting to note members' views on that suggestion.</p><p>I am grateful for all contributions to this afternoon's debate. These closing words of mine formally end the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's lengthy inquiry into rural housing, but much work still remains to be done. Our report suggests that the aim of any rural housing policy should be to ensure that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no one who wishes to belong to a local community and has something to contribute to it should be excluded simply because of a lack of housing.\"</p><p>I urge the Minister and the Parliament to continue working to ensure that that aim is met.</p><p>If the minister takes away one thought from this debate, it must be that the lack of affordable housing is holding back the development of rural Scotland and ways must be found of building more affordable homes so that we can enable rural Scotland to fulfil its potential.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20206413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to close the debate on behalf of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee.

Although it is overshadowed in popular imagination by Columba and his church at Iona, Whithorn's claim to be the first church in Scotland was substantiated as early as 731 AD by the venerable Bede.</p><p>The story of St Ninian brought pilgrims and prosperity to Whithorn for 1,000 years but, after the banning of pilgrimages at the time of the reformation, the town and the area went into decline.</p><p>In modern times, Whithorn's ancient status as the original site of Christian influence in northern Britain has been forgotten by many; the memory of its greatness has been eclipsed by the popular fame of Iona. However, the date 397 AD is generally celebrated as the beginning of Ninian's mission, although no written references to St Ninian from the period when he was alive have been found. We can refer only to works that were written many years after his death. Nevertheless, Whithorn's history as an early Christian centre cannot be doubted. Archaeologists have uncovered clues from the earliest settlement in the fifth century.

We all support efforts to achieve a zero waste society, but the immediate barrier to achieving that is a lack of infrastructure. Several witnesses highlighted that fact in evidence to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, most notably Dirk Hazell of the Scottish Environmental Services Association, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is nowhere near enough waste infrastructure anywhere in the United Kingdom to comply with existing European obligations ... we need to accelerate our transition from a disposal to a recycling society, but to do so requires more infrastructure.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 28 January 2009; c 1361.]</p><p>I say to Elaine Murray that I identify myself with those sentiments. It will not only be a financial challenge, as John Ferguson of SEPA noted, but a challenge to our planning system. There is an urgent need for Government to encourage the public and private sectors to create more of the infrastructure that is needed if we are to reduce the amount of commercial and industrial waste that is sent to landfill. There is a real opportunity for the private sector to deliver such needed infrastructure.</p><p>I turn to another opportunity: the need for temporary storage and stockpiling of recyclates, particularly plastics, until such time as markets&#8212;the Chinese market in particular&#8212;return for those products. It makes little difference whether the storage of recyclable products is carried out by local authorities or the private sector&#8212;the indisputable fact is that many of those products represent future resources. They must not be consigned to landfill simply because of a temporary lack of demand due to the recession.</p><p>I turn to food and farm waste, which is another area in which waste products can be turned into an asset&#8212;in this case, energy. The methane that is produced by anaerobic digestion could and must be used to supplement our dwindling natural gas reserves and lessen our dependency on imports from Russia. Jeremy Purvis referred to that.<place-holder colnum=\"18383\"/></p><p>In addition, heat and energy must also be derived from other types of waste product.

I, too, congratulate Liam McArthur on securing this debate on sheep EID. We should remember at the outset that the alternative to EID is manual recording. However, we are where we are, and the derogations that were sought in the 1990s in relation to tagging, which I helped to negotiate, have now been lost to the UK. However, that was not because Scottish farm recording was found wanting on inspection.</p><p>As things stand, the Government is committed to the introduction of electronic sheep identification if it is possible, while 9,000 farmers&#8212;led by the Teviotdale Farmers Club, NFU Scotland and <em>The Scottish Farmer</em>&#8212;are opposed to it. The minister will concede that that represents significant opposition.</p><p>Implementing regulation 21/2004 will give rise to significant challenges for the sheep sector. Among those challenges will be the maintaining of individual identities within large flocks, and the identification and recording of individual sheep in extensive systems. Concerns have arisen to do with tag losses, training and workability on farms, and also to do with the cost relative to the profitability of sheep production. Much of the cost will fall on the primary producer, with the benefits, such as they are, being secured by others&#8212;at the very time when the Government acknowledges the problems that face a diminishing sheep industry.</p><p>Many farmers and farmers' wives have told me that they will either reduce or completely disperse their flocks if individual recording is introduced. If the minister is to proceed with this project, she will have to make it work, and quickly, or she will face further huge reductions in Scottish sheep-breeding numbers.</p><p>In the first instance, if sheep EID is to be introduced, it must work and be able to replace a paper system that everyone dreads. In favour of EID is the fact that paper-based systems that are manually inputted always have an error rate of 10 <place-holder colnum=\"17896\"/> per cent, and the longer the paper trail, the larger the error becomes. EID, on the other hand, gives more than 95 per cent accuracy on each reading in trials and, if batches are read twice, the accuracy rate rises to 99.9 per cent, which is statistically significant enough for animal disease traceability purposes.</p><p>If EID is to be introduced, that must be done at a reasonable cost. It would be pointless to tag breeding ewes or ewe lambs at birth that will not leave the holding until they are five years old or older. Identifying how and where costs can be minimised and made affordable, and where the benefits to the industry can be maximised, is a prerequisite, assuming that EID can be made to work in the first place.</p><p>The minister has pledged financial support for the introduction of EID. That money must, at least in part, go towards the establishment of critical control points where readings can be taken to keep producer costs to a minimum. Those will be at markets, abattoirs and larger farms that report their own and, perhaps, others' movements and on docksides. They will also be provided by hauliers and approved agents. Government support must go towards further developing the technology to levels at which producers' fears are allayed and costs are acceptable. Unless and until that is the case, the proposal will encounter only hostility from sheep producers. Derogations must therefore be sought in line with the NFUS proposals and, to be acceptable, they must remove or reduce to a minimum on-farm scanning and recording costs.</p><p>If introduced, EID must work easily and effectively, and adequate training will need to be provided. Problems associated with different types of tags, the incompatibility of systems and data transfer will need to be overcome. I understand that the SAOS believes that, in time, the system can be made to work. However, today, the ball is in the minister's court. She must persuade producers not only that EID can be made to work but that it can be made to work in producers' best interests. Outright hostility to EID proposals as they stand remain, so a lot of work still needs to be done for that to be overcome.

Our aquaculture industry is one of our biggest success stories in Scotland. As other members have said, it produces economic benefits through the sale of farmed salmon and shellfish worth over &#163;500 million annually, and has a retail value of well over &#163;1 billion. In addition, it supports 1,579 direct jobs and a further 4,700 downstream jobs, which makes a total of almost 6,300 jobs. However, those jobs&#8212;which would be valuable in any community&#8212;are lifeline jobs, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, which contains some of the most remote and fragile areas in Scotland. Those key jobs, 77 per cent of which are based in the Highlands and Islands, put &#163;33 million into local pay packets and 92 per cent of them are in recognised rural communities. In my view, that makes them doubly valuable because jobs in those areas are so difficult to create and sustain.<place-holder colnum=\"17769\"/></p><p>We have an industry that has a worldwide reputation of which we should be justifiably proud, and which I have admired for many years. Our fish-farming industry, with 454 registered finfish sites and 332 registered active shellfish sites, is ideally placed to grow further. Of course, we in Scotland have to compete with Chile and Norway to do so, but the potential for growth is huge. We in this Parliament and the Government must do all that we can to encourage the appropriately and sympathetically sited growth of the industry. However, in order to achieve that, barriers need to be overcome. They are, in the framework document that has been published today, identified under five headings: healthier fish and shellfish, improved systems for licensing aquaculture developments, improved containment, better marketing and improved image and improved access to finance. I will try to address a few of those issues in the time that is available to me.</p><p>It is self-evident that fish farming has to be a good neighbour to other users of the seas, as well as a custodian of the environment. That means that future development has, whenever possible, to be achieved with wild-fish interests in mind and with due regard having been given to the marine environment in which it operates. As a specific example, we must make every effort to control escapes&#8212;my colleague Jamie McGrigor will say more about that later. We need to deal with the problem of seals attacking cages and we need do more to develop deterrents to keep them from doing so. I appreciate that that is more easily said than done, but it has to be achieved. With wild stocks under pressure and fish farming trying to keep its costs to a minimum, there has to be a cool-headed approach to the problem. I suspect that in order to take matters forward, the industry will have to continue to invest in increased cage protection measures.</p><p>On the health of farmed fish, I noted with regret last night that the fourth outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia has taken place in Shetland. Again, I ask the minister to reassure Parliament in more detail that all that can be done is being done to contain that outbreak. The dangers are not just to our farmed salmon, but to our wild salmon, which makes resolution of the problem all the more important. Sea lice are a problem, and will remain so in the foreseeable future, but with the likely worldwide growth of the industry it will be important that research and development continues to develop the next generation of treatments and best-practice fish-farming techniques, in order that we can protect farmed fish and keep to a minimum the transfer of sea lice to wild fish.</p><p>I turn to development of the industry. Recently, the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee <place-holder colnum=\"17770\"/> visited the seafood fisheries trade fair in Brussels. I was hugely proud of Scotland's part in that event and I offer my congratulations to all those involved. It is important to support the fantastic image of our seafood industry. For farmed salmon in particular, that means that we must continue to support the cherished label rouge status, which the French gave our salmon producers some years ago. It means, however, that we must continue to support the industry in other ways, now that the minimum input price has been abolished, and that efforts must be made to retain and attract young people in and to the aquaculture industry.</p><p>We should encourage further public and private sector investment in the industry which&#8212;as the minister has said&#8212;has a huge future, albeit that it has to operate in competitive circumstances. However, 'twas ever thus, and the size of the industry in that competitive marketplace is a tribute to the people who have already grown this unique Scottish industry. Every encouragement and succour should be given to those risk takers who want to take the industry on from its already dominant market position. In that context, the ministerial working group must drive forward progress and innovation in order to sustain this world-class business. The Scottish Conservatives will certainly give that every support.</p><p>We welcome the production of the strategic framework document, which we will now study in detail. It is a pity that it was not available earlier, which might have meant that the debate was more focused on its contents. However, the fundamental issues have not changed overnight, and nor will they. The Scottish Conservatives will consistently do all they can to support this vital and vibrant Scottish industry.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-4186.3, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and notes the importance of the 6,200 Scottish jobs supported by the aquaculture industry in maintaining the environmental, economic and social fabric in communities often located in Scotland's most remote and fragile areas.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15014382", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate my party with the condolences that have been expressed by the minister to the families of those who recently lost their lives.

Clothianidin has already been banned in Germany and Imidacloprid has been banned as a sunflower seed dressing in France since 1999. As Rob Gibson said, here in the UK the Co-op supermarket group has also banned the use of neonicotinoid sprays, arguing that they damage the neurological and immune system of honey-bees. The Soil Association has written to Hilary Benn to ask him to prohibit the use of the neonicotinoids that have already been withdrawn in France, Germany and Italy.</p><p>Of course I welcome the fact that DEFRA has invested &#163;4.3 million to investigate the impact of the increased prevalence of the varroa mite, poor weather and the management of disease on declining bee numbers, but such research might well miss the point if the effect of pesticides on bee populations is not investigated too.</p><p>Peter Melchett of the Soil Association notes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"While new funding and new research is welcome, it will not help if the government ignores existing scientific evidence that has led other countries to ban chemicals known to kill bees.\"</p><p>Given that approximately 35 per cent of the food we eat is dependent on honey-bee pollination, there are huge implications for food production in the worldwide decline of the honey-bee.</p><p>Not only do we have to look into better control of the varroa mite as resistance develops to existing treatments of it, we have to evaluate comprehensively the role of insecticides in the decline of bee populations.</p><p>In addition, we have to re-establish more bee-friendly habitats and suitable crops and clover-rich swards to help reduce stress levels in bee populations, given that stress is also a factor in bees succumbing to varroa mite and pesticide challenge.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15010321", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Peter Peacock on securing this important debate in Scottish biodiversity week.

However, the concept and spirit behind the committee's work&#8212;to deliver a bill that is fit for purpose, to tidy up existing legislation, to develop natural flood prevention techniques and to contribute to the social, economic and environmental development of Scotland&#8212;have been constant throughout.</p><p>Today we must thank our clerks, who have delivered two reports on flooding in Scotland and who have, on occasion, worked long into the night to sort out amendments for stages 2 and 3 of the bill. We must also thank all those who gave evidence to the committee during both inquiries, especially those who invited members of the committee to see for themselves the problems and solutions that we are addressing today.

Increased rainfall since the 1960s is a fact of life in Scotland and, as the minister indicated, it is likely to increase further. Sea-level rises and coastal inundation are not yet immediate problems, but they are likely to become greater problems in the future. If I have a concern about the bill, it is that we may not have addressed sufficiently the problems that are likely to be associated with sea-level rises and storm and tidal surges. Storminess and semi-tropical storms, producing huge deluges of rain, are likely to increase. Those events pose the biggest threat to at-risk communities in Scotland.</p><p>In response to the threats that have been identified, we have developed the approach that is set out in the bill. At its simplest, the bill changes the emphasis of flood management from hard to soft engineering practices, as well as tidying up other areas of legislation. Although funding has not been discussed at length today, it will be a key to delivering the protection of communities that we all seek. Given the cuts in the Scottish budget that are likely as a result of the recession, I hope that lack of funding will not prove to be an insurmountable problem in the future.</p><p>I welcome, especially in the light of recent tragedies, the Government's commitment to a review of inland waterway search and rescue provision and I look forward to the emergence, within a reasonable timescale, of better and clearer contingency planning as a result.</p><p>Finally, I thank colleagues on the committee, who have been great fun to work with.

I will quote Robert Burns, rather than Voltaire, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Facts are chiels that winna ding\".</p><p>Today&#8212;and not before time&#8212;we must face the facts of climate change. Temperatures are rising, sea levels are rising, Arctic summer ice is disappearing and summer heat waves are increasing, as is the intensity of localised tropical storms. Essentially, that is being brought about by <place-holder colnum=\"17255\"/> the greenhouse effect and the emission of greenhouse gases. We will all&#8212;individually and collectively&#8212;have to start to address the problem. That is why Conservatives welcome the bill.</p><p>However, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee have expressed concern that the bill creates only a framework when we should be producing a strategy with details of solutions and costings. The challenge is to produce such a budgeted strategy as soon as possible, to pull together into a coherent policy the diverse and competing demands of energy production, food production and economic and social development in the face of fast-moving climate change.</p><p>The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee dealt with part 5 of the bill, on which my colleague Nanette Milne spoke yesterday. It is fair to say that Conservatives believe that that part could be stronger and that its introduction could have been better managed. When she was the committee's convener, the Minister for Environment condemned the fact that the consultation on forestry was not undertaken timeously. Perhaps that contributed to the Government's eventual withdrawal of its poorly thought-through leasing proposal. However, that is in the past, and lessons will be learned, but we must find out soon what further forestry proposals&#8212;if any&#8212;the Government will produce.</p><p>It is unquestionable that increased afforestation&#8212;perhaps funded by joint ventures&#8212;will reduce our carbon footprint, but only if trees are planted on land that is capable of food production. That is a key point. Planting on peat soils appears no longer to be good practice for carbon reduction, so planting on mineral soils is the alternative. In the face of climate change, a growing world population and crop substitution, a strategic decision needs to be taken about our food-producing capability here in the UK and in Scotland. From a UK perspective, it is unwise to reduce still further our strategic ability to feed ourselves and to increase daily&#8212;as we are doing&#8212;our dependence on importing food from elsewhere in the world, so I say to the minister that we need an integrated land use policy soon, as that will have a huge impact on climate change.</p><p>Waste reduction and recycling have been mentioned. Scottish Conservatives fully understand and support the Government's intention and measures to drive towards a zero-waste position and reduce our dependence on landfill. However, the Federation of Small Businesses and other respected witnesses expressed serious concern to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee about the lack of infrastructure to achieve a zero-waste position or anything approaching it, or even to comply with <place-holder colnum=\"17256\"/> existing European obligations. Dirk Hazell of the Scottish Environmental Services Association noted that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we need to accelerate our transition from a disposal to a recycling society, but to do so requires more infrastructure\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 28 January 2009; c 1361.]</p><p>and John Ferguson of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said that the required infrastructure development would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a challenge to the planning system.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Rural Affairs and Environment Committee</em>, 4 February 2009; c 1389.]</p><p>None of those statements takes account of the costs to already cash-strapped local authorities.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14967296", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As ever, I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer in this important debate on climate change.

I welcome the tone of Labour's motion, which is a deal more positive and reasonable than the views that Labour previously expressed. I also welcome the Government's decision to drop its controversial leasing proposals and its new focus on finding different ways of raising funds to increase planting throughout Scotland.</p><p>We all want to find ways of reducing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. To that end, all members support the principles of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. In principle, we all support expanding the forest estate and raising money to do so through joint ventures, such as appropriately sited wind farms and hydro schemes, in which the Forestry Commission is involved in South Ayrshire.<place-holder colnum=\"15943\"/></p><p>Diversification of our forest estate to create extra income is not a new concept, merely one that should be pursued more vigorously. Given the rising cost of energy and the returns that can be made now and in the future from wind farming, raising significant amounts of money should not be a problem in the long term. I appreciate that the Forestry Commission has a short-term gap in funding to start land acquisition for extra planting, but that shortfall could be met if the commission sold some of its non-core assets, such as its nurseries or holiday cabins, and concentrated on its core business of growing trees. However, deciding which assets to realise is a matter for the commission.</p><p>Security of supply is essential in the forestry industry, which contributes &#163;1 billion a year to the Scottish economy. The abandonment of the policy of blanket afforestation of Sitka spruce was appropriate, but it means that timber production is reducing by about 1 million tonnes per year. That needs to be replaced, and we need to plant about another 7,000 hectares every year to maintain existing supply, but that is a different goal from the Government's target of increasing planting cover from 17 to 25 per cent by 2050. It is important that further planting on such a scale is undertaken in the framework of an integrated land use strategy, because more competing demands are being placed on the finite resources of Scottish land than our Scottish landmass can cope with.</p><p>My well-known view is that, in this recession and afterwards, we in Scotland and the United Kingdom must retain our strategic ability to feed ourselves in as much as we can. That is why the first public benefit of land must be food production; other priorities should follow. The necessary housing target of building 35,000 new homes annually must be met, but it will swallow huge tracts of good and productive agricultural land. A target of 25 per cent forest cover by 2050 might be valuable for carbon sequestration, but increasing cover from 17 to 25 per cent will represent a 50 per cent increase and will come at a cost to food production at a time when the amount of land for producing food is reducing worldwide because of climate change.</p><p>I merely pose a question that must be asked: does a further huge expansion of our forestry industry still make sense? We must ask whether huge further afforestation is the most effective way of reducing through absorption our carbon footprint, especially if that reduces our food-producing capability. Do more obvious ways of reducing carbon emissions exist? If we are serious about carbon sequestration and reduction, we must create an integrated carbon sequestration and reduction strategy as well as an integrated land use policy.<place-holder colnum=\"15944\"/></p><p>Scottish Conservatives want a strong, growing and sustainable forestry sector that maintains the 30,000 jobs that it provides in rural Scotland. However, further massive expansion must be delivered in the context of a thought-through and fully developed integrated land use strategy. More work needs to be done to establish beyond doubt the true value to carbon reduction and sequestration of growing trees for timber on Scotland's hills and uplands. The science must be better; at the moment, it is not good enough.</p><p>Our party will work positively in and around the subject, which we look forward to debating in the future and at greater length.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-3727.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and considers that all forestry proposals in future must be part of an integrated land-use strategy.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14859140", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forestry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As ever, as a farmer I begin by declaring an interest in the subject, which is particularly important in your constituency, Presiding Officer.

Indeed, as Sarah Boyack said, the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee wrote to the minister expressing its</p><p class=\"indent\">\"dismay and frustration\"</p><p>at being</p><p class=\"indent\">\"asked to commence scrutiny of the proposals without any awareness of how consultees have responded to them\".</p><p>The Parliament finds itself in that position today.</p><p>Of course, as one would expect, the Scottish Conservatives approach the proposal with an open mind, unlike the Liberals who, in their uniquely childish way, memorably claimed that Christmas trees and Christmas cards would be a thing of the past if the Scottish Government pressed on with its plans to sell off Scottish forests.</p><p>I have sympathy with the concerns that Sarah Boyack raises in her motion, although it is tempered by the knowledge that she and her party voted down the budget yesterday, which will reduce the Forestry Commission budget this year by &#163;3.5 million. Calling on the Government to drop the leasing proposals today without even taking note of the responses to the consultation smacks a little of a knee-jerk response and shows little respect for the consultees. I would have expected a more reflective and open-minded approach from her of all people.</p><p>What is needed is not a poorly thought-through scheme from the Government, a knee-jerk response from Labour or scaremongering from the Liberals, but a joined-up, thought-through proposal, to be put on the table and set in the context of an integrated and strategic land use policy. A spatial planning exercise and full land use review needs to be conducted and should, if possible, reconcile all of Scotland's competing land uses.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14648945", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forestry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and a member of NFU Scotland.

We believe that climate change is now happening and that it will most probably result in increasing precipitation and rising sea levels. With 3.6 per cent of Scotland's 2.5 million properties currently at risk, now is the time to act.</p><p>I will speak to some of the recommendations in the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's stage 1 report. Recommendation 3 notes the need</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to strengthen the link between the duty to reduce flood risk and the implementation of flood risk management plans\".</p><p>It is self-evident that action must follow the production of plans. We do not believe that that is clear enough in the bill, as Sarah Boyack has already noted.</p><p>On recommendation 6, Scottish Conservatives very much support the view that assessments of human and social costs must be used in the production of flood risk maps. Such assessments must be carried out as a matter of urgency to allow SEPA to take account of them in the production of its flood risk assessment, which is due in December 2011.</p><p>Recommendation 7 notes the need for the Government to resolve conflicts of interest between SEPA's existing role and its future role under the bill. We believe that the issue needs to be addressed urgently and that the Government should produce guidance to avoid slippage in the production of flood risk maps by December 2011.<place-holder colnum=\"14346\"/></p><p>Recommendation 8 notes the self-evident need to align funding streams, while recommendation 36 rightly draws further attention to Conservative concerns that despite the production of flood risk maps and management plans, and the minister's assurances today, sufficient funding might not be available to implement those plans. Dangerously, the lack of a clear and binding duty in the bill to implement plans once they have been produced&#8212;although it may be that that issue is to be addressed&#8212;combined with a lack of targeted funding to carry out the work, puts at risk the effective implementation of the bill and, in doing so, also puts at risk householders and landowners. The Government must clarify its position during stage 2.</p><p>Recommendation 32 deals with coastal flooding&#8212;a topic that Bill Wilson was keen on&#8212;which will, for the foreseeable future, present a greater risk to property and people than will fluvial flooding. Although the incidence of fluvial and pluvial flooding events will increase, with the result that property and the lives of individuals might suffer damaging effects unless appropriate action is taken, coastal flooding is on a different scale of risk, in that it could have catastrophic consequences. Combined with sea level rise, tidal surges have the potential to inflict huge damage on property and infrastructure in the east and west of Scotland. The Government and SEPA must examine those existing but growing threats extremely carefully.</p><p>Turning to less apocalyptic matters, the Conservatives welcome and believe in the need to move to a more sustainable and natural approach to upstream and downstream flood risk management. I am intrigued by the possibility of taking the tops off floods by using natural flood management techniques and by developing the concept of hydraulic roughness, wherever possible.</p><p>The strategic placing of forestry along watercourses and flood plains would create leaky dams that could hold back floods. If such defences were intelligently sited, they would also enhance biodiversity. In my view, the placing across flood plains of strips of woodland as narrow as 25m wide would produce a damming effect and enhance the environment without significantly reducing agricultural output. The Forestry Commission's evidence in that regard was extremely valuable. However, such land use, especially if it became more extensive, could reduce the viability of farming and other enterprises. It is therefore important that individual businesses are not damaged or disadvantaged by contributing to the public good in that way, so adequate compensation must be paid to reflect any loss of land.<place-holder colnum=\"14347\"/></p><p>The Conservatives also believe that recommendation 27, which invites the Government to retain the obligation on local authorities to cleanse, repair and maintain watercourses, is important and should be addressed. I welcome the minister's comments on the matter.</p><p>The Conservatives believe that much more needs to be done to gather information about potential flooding risks and to disseminate it to the public. Ways must also be found to allow the emergency services to be more proactive in managing flood risk, as well as floods that occur.</p><p>We welcome the bill, which offers a route map to the provision of greater protection against flooding of all types in Scotland. The bill's aim to reduce the risk of flooding will need to be adequately funded: its purpose must not be thwarted as a result of inadequate funding. However, those are matters for future budgets and debates.

Support payments should no longer be made to those who carry little or no stock, or to those whose land is left lying fallow or uncultivated. Stock levels should at least match the historical levels that existed prior to the introduction of quotas in the 1990s.</p><p>Most farmers would be able, by using records such as farm accounts or census figures, to demonstrate the traditional or historical carrying capacity of their land in 1990, for example. That could provide, with sensible variation around the figures, a baseline production figure to return to&#8212;or at least to work towards&#8212;over, for example, a five-year period. I hope that members will <place-holder colnum=\"14187\"/> recognise that the thrust of my speech is about returning to maximising food production from our farms and crofts, and doing so as quickly as possible.</p><p>Almost 15 months ago, I gave a speech at Ingliston to the National Sheep Association, in which I urged sheep farmers not to go out of production because I believed that there was a bright future for lamb and mutton production. Today, that prediction is coming to pass, and there are better returns from the marketplace. It breaks my heart to note how many farmers and livestock producers have gone out of business in the past 18 months, at the very time when the market was turning and about to become more profitable. That has come about because&#8212;notwithstanding the financial crisis that has rightly grabbed the headlines in the past year&#8212;self-sufficiency in food production in the United Kingdom has fallen from 78 per cent to 57 per cent in the past 12 years and prices are beginning to rise as food commodity shortages materialise.</p><p>The UK economy, which that is overly dependent on selling financial services, has ignored the fact that we have lost much of our energy, manufacturing and food-producing capability. Those trends already threaten our national security. We in Scotland can do something about our reduced food-producing capability, particularly in relation to the matter of today's debate. I urge the minister to take steps to address the strategic shortfall about which he spoke so eloquently at the Oxford farming conference.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives believe that in the national interest, the Government must reprioritise the objectives of the SRDP to return to food production while&#8212;if possible&#8212;protecting recent environmental gains. Until recent times, the first public benefit from land was food production. We must return to that concept, as we cannot afford to lose any more farmers and crofters from our fields and farms.</p><p>The wake-up call has been the three major reports over the summer from the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Scottish Agricultural College and NFU Scotland. It is time for the Scottish Government, the UK Government and the EU to wake up and smell the coffee and once again to focus on food production. Here in Scotland, we must stop families leaving the land, because history has shown that when that happens they never return and the animal husbandry and countryside skills base, which has been acquired through generations of toil and passed from one generation to the next, is lost for ever. Stopping families and their stock leaving their farms and crofts can and will only be achieved by returning food production to profitability. In my view, food <place-holder colnum=\"14188\"/> scarcity will eventually restore food production to profitability; indeed, that is already happening.</p><p>In the meantime, our Government must refocus the SRDP on sustaining families and our food-producing land, because without farming and crofting families on the land we can have neither food production nor environmental enhancement. I welcome the minister's positives comments on that earlier today. Now is the time to refocus the SRDP in that way. I call on the Government to do that before it is too late and we lose still more of our food-producing capability from Scotland.</p><p>I urge members to support my amendment.

Sadly, only Rob Gibson <place-holder colnum=\"14154\"/> is in the chamber, and I have to say that I was disappointed by his remarks and change of tone.</p><p>The bull hire scheme is vital for a number of reasons. First, as Rhoda Grant noted, it aids the improvement of store and breeding cattle in the Highlands and Islands. Store and breeding cattle off the superior sires that are available under the scheme fetch higher prices for producers, and the price differential between good and poor-quality stock might mean the difference between profit and loss for and the viability and non-viability of small farming and crofting enterprises.</p><p>In environmental terms, keeping cattle on the hills and uplands significantly supports biodiversity in general and upland bird life in particular. In that respect, I note the RSPB's well founded concern about the loss of the bull hire scheme and the danger that it will lead to further destocking in those areas.</p><p>However, the concerns that have been expressed by the RSPB and me relate to more than the bull hire scheme. Not for nothing are these remote areas of Scotland designated by Europe as fragile areas. Peripherality, high rainfall levels, distance from markets and cost of production make it harder to produce food there than elsewhere in Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe. At stake is the viability of communities that produce food and support the environment and biodiversity.</p><p>For me, the food production aspect of farming and crofting in the Highlands and Islands is most important. As far as food production, food security and self-sufficiency are concerned, we must stop the exodus of farmers and crofters, their families and their animals from large parts of rural Scotland. In the past year alone, we have lost thousands of cattle and tens of thousands of sheep from Scotland's fragile food-producing areas. We have all seen the Royal Society of Edinburgh's report on the future of Scotland's hills and islands and the Scottish Agricultural College's report \"Farming's Retreat from the Hills\", and we in the Parliament must take action now to stop this dangerous loss of food-producing capability.</p><p>That is why the scheme is, in a way, iconic. Keeping it would send out the message that our Government cares about people, food production and food security. Although the alternative of allowing the scheme to end will not stop beef production in these remote and fragile areas, it will be another nail in the coffin of quality food production in them.</p><p>Today, the minister must either reverse his decision to scrap the bull hire scheme or at least put something similar in its place.

Notwithstanding that, I welcome the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment's statement that agreement has been reached on marine planning out to 200 miles. Such a move is, on the face of it, a step forward.</p><p>However, I regret to say that many issues that have dominated fishing discussions in years past remain. The most important of those issues&#8212;which include finding enough fish to catch in the first place, rising costs and the CFP itself&#8212;is how to reduce discards effectively. It has been calculated that, between 1992 and 2001, 50,000 to 80,000 tonnes of fish were discarded annually into the North Sea. Taking the upper limit of 80,000 tonnes&#8212;and bearing in mind that, regrettably, practices have not changed that much&#8212;we might conclude that in the past 12 years we have caught, killed and wasted almost 1 million tonnes of fish. That is a massive problem.</p><p>As a result, we must start to address this issue seriously. The time for talking about this kind of wastage has long gone and serious effort must be put into developing and using better, more effective and more efficient selective gear. To that end, the Scottish Conservatives welcome <place-holder colnum=\"12820\"/> September's discards summit as a means of beginning to tackle the problem seriously. Moreover, I welcome the cabinet secretary's comments on the issue and his commitment to a land more, catch less policy.</p><p>Although that is an enduring problem that still has to be solved, of more immediate concern to the livelihood of west coast fishermen is the Commission's proposal virtually to close the west coast fisheries this year to assist the recovery of demersal stocks, which have apparently reached critically low levels.

However, the fact that a suggested closure of this size and scale has crept up unexpectedly on fishermen and Government alike is shocking, and the threatened loss of livelihoods as a result is worse. The displacement of boats from the west to the east coast, where stocks are under pressure, will put at risk the viability of many other fishing businesses and communities, as there will simply not be enough fish to go round. The knowledge gap must be plugged first if we are to safeguard livelihoods.</p><p>We must also find ways not only of keeping west coast boats in west coast fisheries but of allowing them to catch at least prawns and scallops in addition to monkfish while keeping to a minimum the bycatch of demersal species, particularly young cod, haddock and whiting. Principles and techniques employed in other fisheries for conserving stock, namely the use of separation grids and increased mesh sizes, might be able to be adapted for use in the traditionally smaller west coast trawler but, as we know, time is of the essence if any practical measures are to be put in place for this year.</p><p>Another problem is west coast herring. A 52 per cent cut has been proposed in stocks, which appear to have reached a critical level. How has <place-holder colnum=\"12821\"/> that critical situation developed? Is it a surprise to everyone? I am also concerned that herring stocks are not growing. More research should be carried out into the disappearance of plankton on the west coast and the possibility that climate change is reducing the viability of that precious stock.</p><p>I welcome the modest recovery in cod stocks. However, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea's proposal of a complete ban on landing North Sea cod in 2009 is unrealistic and unwelcome. Fish should be permitted to be caught and landed, without allowing them to be specifically targeted. If we believe that ending the wasteful discards policy is at least a primary concern&#8212;if not the primary concern&#8212;we must believe that caught fish must be landed. However, we need to strike a balance between allowing fish to be landed as a bycatch and discouraging the targeting of at-risk species. As a result, the price paid to fishermen has to be enough not just to discourage targeting but to encourage landing. That is what happens in Norway, and more work needs to be carried out in the UK and the EU to allow us to reach that position.</p><p>Of course, the situation is more complicated in our warmer waters because the fisheries are more mixed. However, that does not mean that we should not try to find our own formula for achieving a balance and we welcome the conservation credits scheme pioneered in Scotland as a way of dealing with the issue. We are also hugely encouraged that the European Commission is keen for similar methods to be rolled out EU-wide. It is a tremendous tribute to the work of our fishermen.</p><p>The cabinet secretary will know that the Commission has proposed a zero TAC for another under-threat species, the spurdog. Although the proposal is well intentioned, it will have the unwelcome effect of guaranteeing the discarding of any spurdog caught as bycatch. That said, the fact remains that Scotland's once-thriving spurdog stocks have been decimated in recent years and are in dire need of recovery.</p><p>We welcome the Government's motion, commend our amendment to Parliament and wish the cabinet secretary, his team and the UK Government every success in representing Scotland's best interests in the forthcoming negotiations.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2966.1, to insert at end</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; notes with concern the European Commission's proposals for west coast stocks that, if implemented, could especially damage the viability of the west coast langoustine sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work towards a settlement that successfully balances the need to conserve depleted west coast whitefish stocks with a thriving langoustine fishery.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271355", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sea Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do, of course, accept the cabinet secretary's explanation.

I hope that all parties will feel able to support the amendment at decision time. The first issue is the serious one of escaped farmed fish, and I was pleased that that problem was acknowledged in the consultation document. Escaped fish are a problem for fish farms, which obviously suffer lost revenue, and for anglers, who are gravely concerned about the damage that farmed fish can inflict on wild stock, such as disease and the dilution of the gene pool.</p><p>Recreational angling, particularly salmon angling, is worth a huge amount of money to the Scottish economy, and it would be nothing short of a tragedy if our reputation for excellence in that <place-holder colnum=\"12654\"/> field was to be damaged by question marks arising over the integrity of our wild fish. I therefore ask the minister to ensure both that efforts are redoubled to reduce the risk of escapes and that, as my amendment says, traceability mechanisms are improved to deal with escapes that occur. Those steps must be at the heart of the updated strategic framework.</p><p>The second issue that our amendment deals with is the threat posed by the salmon parasite Gyrodactylus salaris. The virus, which has devastated salmon stocks in Norway, could cause incalculable damage to our fish farms and wild stocks. As the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment recently warned, an outbreak of GS could result in the collapse of what he called our \"iconic ... salmon angling heritage\". Similarly, experts have suggested that a GS outbreak would cost the Scottish economy hundreds of millions of pounds.</p><p>As members will recall, the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 deals with the GS threat, but it remains the view of the Scottish Conservatives that the act does not go far enough. It provides ministers with the power to treat infected waters with the chemical rotenone, which is effective in tackling the parasite but has the unfortunate side-effect of wiping out every living thing in the river system. Obviously, that is not a scenario that any of us wishes to contemplate, which is why we must do everything in our power to prevent GS from arriving in the first place.</p><p>I remind the minister that, during the passage of the 2007 act, my colleague Ted Brocklebank moved an amendment that would have required people to declare any fishing gear that they brought into Scotland from a country that was potentially affected by GS. That amendment would also have obliged ministers to ensure that appropriate decontamination facilities were in place at points of entry. Such a plan was proposed in the previous Executive's document on GS, which was produced by experts at the University of Stirling's institute of aquaculture and Glasgow Caledonian University's business school.</p><p>The proposal was enthusiastically endorsed by the Environment and Rural Development Committee when Sarah Boyack&#8212;who I regret is absent today&#8212;was the committee's convener. Therefore, it was a great pity that, in her subsequent role as Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development, Ms Boyack marshalled her troops from the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties to vote down Mr Brocklebank's amendment. Thankfully, the amendment was supported by Scottish National Party members, including the now Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, Richard Lochhead. I trust that the minister will give a firm commitment <place-holder colnum=\"12655\"/> to reopen the 2007 act in order to insert into it Mr Brocklebank's amendment, given that the dangers from importing GS are now much greater than they were in 2007.</p><p>I also draw the minister's attention to concerns about the possibility of well boats bringing fish directly from Norway that might be contaminated by GS or other diseases. I know that at least three major fish farming companies have made a commitment not to support live smolts from Norway, but I would appreciate further clarity from the minister on what is being done to ensure that the dangers of importing contaminated fish are eliminated. I ask him to keep a close eye on the situation.</p><p>On a more positive note, we need to consider the development of the industry and how we can help the growth of the halibut and turbot sector&#8212;a subject that I know is close to the minister's heart. To facilitate such growth, we need to make it easier for young fish to be brought in from outside the European Union. We need a border inspection post in Scotland. Having spoken this morning to the chief executive of Prestwick airport, Mark Rodwell, I believe that the airport would be more than happy to consider creating such a facility to allow young fish to be flown into Scotland&#8212;perhaps that is a new way of looking at flying fish&#8212;to help develop the aquaculture industry.</p><p>I welcome the approach that is outlined in the consultation document but reiterate that more concrete action is required if we are serious about combating the concerns that are outlined in my amendment. I have pleasure in moving the amendment in my name and am happy to intimate that we will support all the other amendments.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2921.1, to insert after \"competitor nations\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"further supports efforts to advance the enviable international reputation of Scotland's wild salmon stocks and, in light of the potential damage to the health and integrity of wild stocks caused by escaped farmed fish, believes that a robust commitment to reducing escapes and improved traceability must be a central element of the new Strategic Framework; recognises the continued threat posed by Gyrodactylus salaris to farmed and wild salmon stocks alike and, in light of the economic and ecological damage that an outbreak could cause, considers that further serious consideration must be given to measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of the parasite entering Scotland\".</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps flying fish were buzzing over there.

The Scottish Conservatives recognise the importance of controlling the <place-holder colnum=\"11978\"/> invasive non-native species that threaten biodiversity in Scotland and the UK.</p><p>As our uniquely and identifiably Scottish biodiversity is a cornerstone of our natural and cultural heritage that supports and enhances not just our tourism industry but our daily quality of life, any threat to it must be taken seriously. I have to confess that, until recently, I was unaware of the startling fact that, after habitat loss, invasive non-native species are considered the largest threat to biodiversity worldwide. As Scottish Natural Heritage has identified 988 non-native species in Scotland, the issue certainly demands concerted action. As Nanette Milne said, today's debate is a welcome first step in that direction.</p><p>Not all non-native species are a threat to biodiversity, although well documented examples such as the Japanese knotweed, which the cabinet secretary and Elaine Murray referred to, the grey squirrel, which Jamie McGrigor mentioned, and the introduction of sparrows and starlings into north America, have had a disproportionately damaging effect, usually as a result of completely unforeseen circumstances and probably, as Kenneth Gibson noted, exacerbated by climate change. That is why we have to be much more careful about moving species around the world.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham, herself a non-native species, made a passionate speech about the problem of cane toads in Australia and&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;about amateur gardening. Jamie McGrigor rightly highlighted the importance of taking preventive measures against Gyrodactylus salaris and of keeping Scotland free of the parasite. Escapees from fish and mink farms have inflicted huge damage on our wildlife, our biodiversity and our economy and we must continue our efforts to control the situation in both areas.</p><p>Jim Hume mentioned the need to contain signal crayfish, although Jamie McGrigor has told me that they are very good with mayonnaise, so we might be able to eat our way through the problem. John Farquhar Munro was right to draw our attention to the proposal to introduce wolves into Scotland. The measure, which has long been considered, must be resisted, given its potential impact on wildlife.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome the publication of the invasive non-native species framework strategy, which is intended to strike a better balance between reactive management and a more preventive approach. As Peter Peacock made clear, its three-stage hierarchical approach of prevention, early detection and rapid eradication, and long-term control and containment seems to provide a sensible way of dealing with the problem, but the fact remains that <place-holder colnum=\"11979\"/> it is only a strategy, not a commitment to action. If we are to address the problem seriously, the strategy might well need to be underpinned by education, legislation and budgets. That will be the acid test for Governments in Scotland and the UK, as Ian McKee helpfully noted.</p><p>Although controlling non-native invasive species is absolutely desirable, the question is whether it is affordable and who will pay for the new long-term commitment. That is why it is important to recognise that the debate is not an end in itself but only the beginning of a potentially expensive process.</p><p>If legislation is to be introduced to protect our most vulnerable environments, it cannot be done in the UK or Scotland in isolation from the rest of Europe. Cleaning up existing problems and future enforcement will come at a cost. I would be interested to know whether the minister has looked into the possibility of introducing legislation and, if so, whether he has costed such a proposal. For that reason, we are attracted to Elaine Murray's amendment and we agree with Liam McArthur's comments on the matter.</p><p>Of course, much can be achieved simply by raising awareness of the problem, and today's debate is useful in that context. Perhaps a simple way to reinforce the message and address the issue would be to use existing schemes, such as the Scottish rural development programme, and to invite farmers and landowners not to introduce non-native invasive species on to their land as part of cross-compliance. That would not be a problem for most farmers and landowners.</p><p>The establishment of a working group to consider the matter, which the cabinet secretary announced today, is a welcome step forward.

Indeed, routine maintenance of the secure drainage system at the research establishment, documented by DEFRA as far back as 2003, was all that would have been required to stop the outbreak happening, and the Labour Government stands condemned in the eyes of rural Scotland for its negligence. As documented in the report, the outbreak happened at absolutely the worst time of the year for sheep producers, and did economic damage to pig and cattle farming as well as to hauliers, processors and exporters. That the outbreak could have been avoided is little short of criminal. The Labour Government has still to accept responsibility for its actions or, in this case, inaction.<place-holder colnum=\"11485\"/></p><p>However, we are where we are, and today Scottish Conservatives welcome the report and its conclusions. We welcome the categorisation of the priorities in the report as high, medium and low, and agree that among the 55 recommendations, recommendations 20, 23, 28, 54 and 55 should be high priority. Scottish Conservatives believe that it is vital that a fully developed UK risk hierarchy is created&#8212;recommendation 23&#8212;based on veterinary assessments, but that as much flexibility as possible should be built into the system.</p><p>Common sense dictated that Scottish islands would be less at risk than Scottish border areas from the spread of FMD from England, yet for too long they were treated similarly. We agree with recommendation 20 that priority movements and scenarios with appropriate timetables should be created as part of future contingency planning. Of course, different strains of FMD and their respective virulence make contingency planning and a one-size-fits-all approach almost impossible, but different scenario planning for a future event can only be beneficial. I welcome the minister's comment that he will consult further on that in November. In that regard, I would suggest that recommendation 53 be raised to a high priority and that a formal review and regular updating of UK plans is vital, as the most up-to-date science and methodology of dealing with the disease worldwide must be noted and learned from. Although it goes without saying that Scottish contingency plans must be updated and kept under review, I acknowledge the sterling work of Charles Milne and his team, the stakeholder group and the minister during the recent crisis.</p><p>On regionalisation, Scottish Conservatives would support the recommendation that our Government should work with DEFRA and the EU to produce a standardised set of terms for regionalisation in the event of an FMD outbreak. The establishment of detailed rules for the movement of livestock and associated products between different risk areas and zones is essential. If such plans had been in place in 2007, Scotland might have escaped much of the devastating impact of the outbreak.</p><p>Protocols need to be developed between DEFRA and our devolved Government, and existing concordats should be reviewed to deliver a more coherent and fit-for-purpose vehicle to deliver a response to a future outbreak of FMD. Areas of financial responsibility should be more clearly defined to allow better contingency budget planning and to deliver a greater sense of accountability. While we believe that that should be part of the Calman inquiry, I welcome the minister's work in that area so far.<place-holder colnum=\"11486\"/></p><p>As I said earlier, we are where we are, and today&#8212;as our amendment notes&#8212;our food producers, processors and crofters are still coming to terms with the financial impact of the most recent outbreak. Indeed, I warned at the time that the full financial effect of the outbreak would be felt only in June and July this year&#8212;a time of year when farming overdrafts are at their highest. It is no coincidence that the exodus of sheep and cattle from our hills in Scotland is accelerating. For some farmers&#8212;particularly tenant farmers&#8212;and crofters in our most fragile areas, FMD was the straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back. The 5 per cent reduction in breeding sow numbers since June last year bears witness to that.</p><p>I will be fair: the Government, by paying &#163;6 per head per ewe, acknowledged the seriousness of the case at the time. Our pig producers were less fortunate: many of them suffered crippling financial losses and remain uncompensated to this day. They are vital in keeping abattoirs open throughout the country, and I endorse Sarah Boyack's remarks in that regard. With breeding sow numbers at a record low, one has to fear for the critical mass of the industry&#8212;which is concentrated in the north-east of Scotland&#8212;notwithstanding the current better market returns for producers.</p><p>We welcome the Scudamore report's analysis and recommendations. However, we believe that the Scottish Government must now do what it can to plan for any such future event.

I am a farmer and food producer. I am also a member of NFU Scotland and I served as hill farming convener for that organisation from 1993 to 1999.</p><p>I thank the cabinet secretary for the advance copy of the consultation document. However, it would have been helpful if the document had been made available earlier, as Sarah Boyack said.</p><p>I ask members to consider the following statistics. Self-sufficiency in UK food production has fallen from 78 per cent in 1995 to 57 per cent in 2006. Global food prices have risen by 83 per cent during the past three years, and the annual food price inflation rate is between 12 and 25 per cent&#8212;probably averaging at about 20 per cent. However, our livestock farmers cannot make a living, as the Scottish Conservatives' food security task force noted in its recent report.</p><p>In addition, the recent SAC report, \"Farming's Retreat from the Hills\", notes that the Scottish national sheep flock has fallen by 2.3 million animals since 1998 and that cattle numbers have fallen by 12 per cent since 1998, because of a lack of profitability in the industry. According to the report, the net margin per ewe in LFA breeding stocks is a loss of &#163;25.85 per ewe and the net margin per suckler cow is a loss of &#163;284 per cow. Such a situation is unsustainable.</p><p>The figures tell us not only that we have lost a significant part of our food producing capability in Scotland but that we are in danger of losing a great deal more, because livestock farmers who want to continue to farm cannot do so while making such losses. If further proof is needed that the situation is desperate, members should consider Scottish agriculture's collective borrowing from the banks, which is approaching &#163;1.4 billion&#8212;that represents individual farmers' overdrafts.</p><p>The Royal Society of Edinburgh noted in its excellent report that average net farm income for sheep farmers in our less favoured areas has fallen from &#163;9,800 in 2003-04 to an estimated &#163;1,500 in 2006-07. The figures include subsidies that farmers receive.</p><p>If farming is to continue at all in Scotland, the continuation of support is vital, because the marketplace is simply not providing a sufficient return to ensure the continuation of farming as we know it. That is why our amendment condemns the Labour Government's policy of ending direct support to our farmers after 2013, as is noted in the SAC report. I have no issue with Labour's <place-holder colnum=\"10933\"/> front-bench team in Scotland; my issue is in particular with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the UK Government. It is extraordinary that DEFRA and the UK Treasury could have come to a view apparently without consulting the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The situation demonstrates how completely out of touch the current UK Government is on matters that concern farming and food security.</p><p>In addition, the RSE report noted that rural development funding in Scotland is, as Sarah Boyack mentioned, among the lowest in Europe at &#163;7 per hectare. In Ireland, it is &#163;54 per hectare per year; in Finland, it is &#163;94 per hectare per year; and in Austria, it is &#163;122 per hectare per year. Even if it was the Conservatives who did not negotiate hard enough for that funding, we have had 10 years of a Labour Government to retrieve the situation; yet, that has not happened. Our farmers are farming at a competitive disadvantage with farmers in the rest of Europe and our UK Government wants to make the situation worse by withdrawing direct support as well. That is why the Scottish Conservatives' food security task force recommends that every encouragement be given to Scottish, UK and EU farmers to increase production, whereas the Government at Westminster is still doing all that it can to discourage food production in the UK.</p><p>We all know, sadly, how out of touch the UK Government is with rural life and food production. Until recently, that could be swept under the carpet. However, the loss of our food-producing capability in the UK in the past 10 years has now become an issue of national security, especially in the current financial climate&#8212;indeed, it is a scandal of our times. In Scotland, we are seeing the manifestation of the effects of that policy.</p><p>To address the issues in Scotland, the Government must consider reopening and reprioritising the current Scottish rural development programme, if that is possible, to encourage food production once more. We also need to ensure that active farming is part of any new LFAS scheme. The Scottish Government must remove the barriers to farming and food production, and it must introduce proposals to reduce the burden of red tape and legislation that weighs heavily on our farmers. The report from Scotland's environmental and rural services initiative cannot come soon enough, and we expect action to follow.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14004885", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Less Favoured Areas"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest.

The double tagging of sheep and pesticide regulations are all part of the picture that is driving people out of business right across the agricultural spectrum in Scotland. An adequately funded new entrants scheme must be introduced, and LFASS payments must be made as early as possible this year. I know that the payments were made in February and March last year and that new EU requirements and checks mean that the payments cannot be made before January 2009. Nevertheless, I urge the minister to re-examine those requirements, to see whether a way can be found legitimately to bring forward this year's LFASS payments.</p><p>We must not forget that our dairy industry is struggling to make ends meet; that our unsupported pig producers are still losing money; that our soft fruit growers are leaving fruit to rot in the fields; and that our grain and potato producers are struggling with flooded fields and prices that have fallen to loss-making levels, given the costs of fertiliser and fuel.</p><p>The LFASS consultation is welcome. As LFAs account for 85 per cent of our land in Scotland, all the foregoing industry situations and statistics must be taken into account in the review.

I welcome the First Minister's acknowledgment that food pricing is now right at the top of the political agenda. With food prices continuing to climb at an alarming rate, I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Conservatives' food security task force, which was launched at the time of our debate in June, will be publishing its report imminently, following its summer consultation.</p><p>I welcome the Government's intention to conduct a review of land use, which the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment announced last week. That is an important step, as there is a desperate need to ensure that the multiple pressures on our land&#8212;food, renewable energy, biofuel production, forestry, housing, flood management and so on&#8212;are properly planned and managed. The bluetongue vaccination programme must also be rolled out this autumn. The recent scare in the south of England has again focused minds on that ever-present danger. Achieving a high uptake of the vaccination programme this autumn will be vital.</p><p>I was less impressed with the confirmation during the summer that the Government's manifesto pledge on funding a new entrants scheme has been watered down, and that the application process for the flagship rural development programme has, thus far, been so poorly handled.</p><p>The farming industry was also upset with the terms of the cabinet secretary's aid package for the pig industry, which, at first glance, appeared <place-holder colnum=\"10394\"/> welcome&#8212;indeed, I welcomed it&#8212;but which, on further inspection, proved to be misleading and far less generous than it seemed.</p><p>On the legislative programme that was announced today, the wet summer that we have had has reminded us again of the need for us to be better prepared for the dangers of flooding. I look forward to seeing the details of the Government's flood risk management bill, which, frankly, cannot come soon enough. The adequate funding of that piece of legislation will be crucial to its success. The flooding in Ayrshire and Fife affected many families and home owners who will quite literally still be counting the cost of the damage that was caused. Our sympathies are with those families who are still restoring their homes.</p><p>Similarly, we welcome the Government's plans for a Scottish climate change bill. Although the 2050 target is good, it is to be regretted that the First Minister failed to mention annual targets for emission reductions. Would that not make more sense, as Sarah Boyack and Patrick Harvie said? For Patrick Harvie's information, I point out that that has been Conservative policy for some considerable time.</p><p>In addition, we look forward to seeing the content of the forthcoming marine bill. Although there is no doubt that that legislation is to be welcomed, I hope that the Government will not allow its obsession with extending its reach to the 200-mile nautical limit to distract it from the issues that are really important, namely marine spatial planning and biodiversity.</p><p>On fishing, the quota plans that were announced before the summer generated mixed feelings, to put it mildly. Although I whole-heartedly endorse the call for more national and local control of fisheries management, I question whether the Government's policy has been developed in the interests of our fishing communities as opposed to the interests of creating further tensions with Westminster.</p><p>From an Ayrshire perspective, and as a member of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, I welcome the announcement of a rural schools bill, which will introduce a presumption against closure. Rural schools are the heart of our rural communities, and their continuation is vital. From an Ayrshire perspective, again, the need to maximise the tourism benefit from the homecoming year of 2009 cannot be overstated. Ayrshire, the birthplace of Burns and the riviera of Scotland, is always ready and willing to play its part in welcoming tourists.</p><p>Rural Scotland continues to face massive pressures, including those from high fuel prices. Those pressures affect tourism and all rural dwellers; they are leading to low returns for <place-holder colnum=\"10395\"/> farmers; and they continue to present challenges to commercial and recreational fishermen.</p><p>We in the Scottish Conservatives will continue to do all that we can to represent the best interests of our rural and maritime communities, and we will work constructively with the Government over the coming year to develop policies to address issues on which there is common ground.</p><p>We will also do our utmost to hold ministers to account, ensuring that sensible pledges that were made by the SNP in its manifesto last year are fulfilled.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and food producer.

The debate has been valuable and largely consensual in nature, notwithstanding Mike Rumbles's contribution. That augurs well for the passage of the bill that will be introduced in the autumn.</p><p>When the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee launched its inquiry last year, it did so in the full knowledge that the Scottish Government intended to introduce legislation to update and transform the way in which Scotland manages its flood risk. We recognised that in the past Scotland has had a better approach to flood risk management than England, but that that was absolutely no reason to rest on our laurels, as future challenges are significant. As the minister suggested, we recognised that the experience of the National Flood Forum would help us in Scotland to address the issue. The intention was that the committee's report should inform constructively the Scottish Government's thinking; I hope that it has achieved that aim.</p><p>Reform of the legislative framework for flood management is long overdue. The current statute appears to have driven a piecemeal approach to the issue, but what is required is an holistic approach, with all the bodies and organisations that contribute to flood risk management working together coherently. I note the minister's view, which will be reflected in the bill, that the process should be local authority led. I accept that, provided that major and contentious plans remain subject to ministerial approval and that SEPA is the central co-ordinating body.</p><p>Several key themes have emerged. Climate change means that flooding is likely to become more common in future. We are likely to get wetter winters&#8212;the data tell us that that is already happening. Intense rainfall events are likely to become more common, especially in the summer time, which means that the risk of fluvial and pluvial flooding will increase. Areas of Scotland that may have seen themselves as immune from flooding in the past will have to learn to understand flood risk and to adapt to it.</p><p>Increased storminess may generate greater coastal flooding and inundation. I welcome Bill Wilson's thoughtful contribution on that issue. The debate appears to have shifted from arguing about the reality of climate change to discussing how to adapt to it; I welcome that shift. We know that at present around 77,000 homes are at risk of fluvial <place-holder colnum=\"10239\"/> flooding and 94,000 homes are at risk of coastal flooding, but we do not know how many are at risk of pluvial flooding&#8212;those data do not seem to exist. Many of the witnesses from whom we heard said that the issue ought to be a priority; the committee agrees whole-heartedly with that position. David Stewart and Des McNulty also made that point.</p><p>To address the situation, it is essential that we take a long-term view of planning for flood management. The committee suggested a period of 25 years and I argued for an even longer timescale because we need to make investment decisions over that timescale or longer. The departing Jamie Hepburn referred to that, as did Peter Peacock. Certainly, investing now will be more cost effective than waiting for flooding to happen and then dealing with it.</p><p>The Stern report on the economic impacts of climate change estimated that annual losses due to flooding in the UK could increase from around 0.1 per cent of GDP today to 0.2 per cent and then 0.4 per cent of GDP once global temperatures increase by 3&#730;C to 4&#730;C. Therefore, at a purely economic level, we cannot afford not to get better at flood management.</p><p>However, this is not just about economic impacts, as the devastating social and human costs of flooding must be factored in. The committee's recommendation on incorporating non-economic factors in the assessment of flood prevention measures is essential. Many members, such as Nanette Milne, referred to that specifically.</p><p>I turn to how flooding can be coped with physically. In the past, the emphasis has tended to be on hard flood defences. There is no doubt that those will continue to be needed, but they are only one element of the toolkit that flood managers will need to draw on to achieve sustainable flood management in the future. In order to deliver sustainable flood management, the catchment must be the unit for flood management and an holistic approach must be taken to the management of flood risk throughout a catchment. I note that the minister shares that view.</p><p>The precise needs of catchments vary, and that variation will determine which elements of the flood management toolkit will need to be used. The funding required will also vary. We expect the minister to honour his pledges on making available adequate funding in future. I endorse Karen Gillon's comments in that regard.</p><p>Land use management within a catchment will be critical. Compelling evidence was presented by the Forestry Commission about the potential of afforestation, to which Sarah Boyack and Robin Harper referred, to increase hydraulic roughness, slow the speed at which rainfall enters <place-holder colnum=\"10240\"/> watercourses and act as a physical barrier on flood plains, thereby taking the peaks off floods.</p><p>Peter Peacock referred to the fact that systems will need to be established to allow agricultural land to be flooded deliberately in order to protect areas both upstream and downstream. Obviously, such systems would need to be supported by adequate compensation for farmers and landowners. We need to think sensibly about that when costing projects in future, as Des McNulty said.</p><p>Similarly, incentives, perhaps through land management grants, to reduce land drainage, recreate former wetlands and reinstate natural meandering river channels might need to be considered, too. The progressive spread of hard surfaces, in the form of roads, driveways, car parks or whatever, has an impact on hydrological behaviour, resulting in more rapid run-off. That must be addressed, as Robin Harper mentioned.</p><p>I turn now to the planning system, which has a vital role to play in future. The committee was told that the situation in Scotland is significantly better than that in England, with less building on flood plains. However, with Government-driven targets, there is demand for more housing, although it might be slowing at the moment. The conflict between that demand, the desire for economic development and the need to avoid development in areas of flood risk needs to be resolved&#8212;or at the very least managed.</p><p>Land use management and planning are but two elements of the sustainable flood management toolkit; natural flood management techniques and effective building standards and regulations are others. All those need to be brought to bear, as we cannot simply rely on building bigger and bigger defences and drainage systems, which would be wholly unsustainable.</p><p>The committee looks forward to scrutinising the Government's legislative proposals later in the year. We hope that many of the recommendations contained in our report will be taken forward.</p><p>The timescale for achieving effective flood management stretches far into the future&#8212;way beyond this parliamentary session. Getting the legislation right now is vital for future generations who will have to live with the consequences of climate change and the bill that is to be introduced.</p><p>I hope that the committee's report has been a valuable contribution to the overall effort. We all look forward to receiving and reviewing the proposed legislation in the autumn.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13780521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flooding and Flood Management"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In closing today's debate on flooding and flood management, I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer.

I welcome the minister's assurance on that. It is vital that we remember that, historically, every 5 per cent increase in modulation has reduced farm profitability by 20 per cent. Given that farm incomes are subject to enormous volatility because of rising costs and variable end prices, the importance of a steadying and constant single farm payment cannot be overstated.</p><p>That brings me to progressive modulation. That, too, is an area in which the minister will have to stand up for Scottish farmers, many of whom have larger farm sizes than the European norm. Many of our largest units have been built up by the most efficient and visionary farmers and food producers, who must not now be penalised for their entrepreneurial flair, given that they support many high-quality jobs in our rural areas. Progressive modulation would be a tax on efficiency. It would discriminate against our most efficient producers and encourage property splitting. At the very least, it would affect Scottish food producers disproportionately. We believe that it is a complete non-starter.</p><p>On a more positive note, we welcome the proposal to abolish set-aside, which will allow farmers to get back to doing what they do best: growing food for a daily more hungry world. Given that world grain reserves are now at 52 days supply&#8212;the lowest since the second world war&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"9112\"/> we are only one bad harvest in one country away from a world shortage of grain. Further, if last year's oil price of around $100 a barrel encouraged a massive shift towards growing biofuel crops instead of grain, we can be certain that the current price of $125 to $135 a barrel will reduce grain production across the world even further this year.</p><p>Before I leave the issue of set-aside, it is important to note that efforts must be made to hold on to the gains that were made in biodiversity during the set-aside years. That will require ingenuity from farmers, policy makers and Government alike. I support the view that the minister expressed in that regard this morning.</p><p>The abolition of milk quotas by 2015 will be widely welcomed by our remaining producers in Scotland, who have had an extraordinarily difficult time since the quota was first introduced in 1983. Indeed, that 25-year spell has seen many dairy farmers go out of milk production; that is a matter of the greatest regret in Ayrshire and south-west Scotland, which are uniquely suited to milk production.</p><p>Article 69&#8212;now renamed article 58&#8212;proposals are to be cautiously welcomed, in as much as they recognise that a problem exists for beef and sheep production in our most fragile areas. Tavish Scott mentioned that. However, we should perhaps look more closely at schemes such as the Irish suckler cow welfare scheme, which is supported from pillar 2 funding, to see whether that model could be applied to beef and sheep production in our less favoured areas, rather than the top slicing of pillar 1 funding.</p><p>I believe that we should not yet move towards an area-based payment for single farm payments, and that the historic basis for payments should not be phased out until around 2013 at the earliest, if even then.</p><p>We must consider all those proposals in the face of the gathering storm that food security and food price inflation represent.

Regrettably, that bill failed to address many of the problems that face crofting in the 21 <sup>st</sup> century. Sarah Boyack generously recognised that in her thoughtful and positive speech.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank and the Environment and Rural Development Committee were rightly condemnatory of the Crofting Reform etc Bill. The report that we are discussing today should have been available to influence and drive the legislation in 2006 but, sadly, it was not. However, we are where we are. It has often been said that a croft is an island surrounded by a sea of legislation, and the more one looks into it, the more that becomes apparent. At the very least, simplification and rationalisation of the legislation are long overdue. Professor Shucksmith's report is <place-holder colnum=\"8629\"/> a welcome precursor to that, although, like others, I have yet to fully absorb the report.</p><p>Many of the recommendations in the report are to be welcomed. In particular, the Scottish Conservatives welcome the determination to address the absenteeism and neglect that have sadly affected much crofting land in the past. To that end, we welcome the idea of the election of local crofting boards. If such boards can work together in a federation and be given powers to suspend the right to buy when that serves the best interests of the community, that will be progress. For example, good inby land should not be built on, especially as food security rises up the political agenda daily.</p><p>The transfer of powers from the Crofting Commission to HIE is a positive suggestion. I appreciate that not everyone in the chamber takes that view, but the idea is worthy of further consideration. I note the report's suggestion that the crofting counties agricultural grants scheme should be retained. I support that, and I know that the issue is dear to the heart of Norman Leask, who is in the gallery today. The suggestions to give extra support to young entrants and to support diversification through the CCAGS are measures for which I have long campaigned. My track record of support for CCAGS goes back to the early 1990s, when I was convener of NFU Scotland's hill farming committee.</p><p>I am less enthusiastic about moving towards an area basis for the single farm payment or reclassifying the less favoured area support scheme to introduce a mountain classification, but that is a Scotland-wide issue and is perhaps a debate for another day.</p><p>I do, however, want to consider carefully and positively the idea of reintroducing national envelopes and the possibility of reintroducing bull and ram hire schemes for crofting areas. That is essential if neglected land is to be returned to agricultural production. My colleague Jamie McGrigor will expand on that.</p><p>In the context of good agricultural practice, I welcome the suggestion that, if crofting land is sold, it must be retained in agricultural use. Our general thrust is that of following good agricultural practice and sustaining and enhancing the environment as we do so. The simplification of dispute resolution is another welcome recommendation. I wish whoever will be responsible for doing that more success than some of the grazings committees enjoyed in the past.</p><p>What is particularly positive about the debate is the fact that the Scottish Crofting Foundation has welcomed the report too&#8212;including the proposal to tie all croft houses to residency. The proposal to <place-holder colnum=\"8630\"/> backdate a residency burden to 12 May 2008, which would tie a new owner to occupancy and working the land, is also to be welcomed.</p><p>The introduction of an enhanced croft house grant and loan scheme, which would allow for house building without the need to decroft, is very welcome too. It will help in encouraging population retention and migration into the crofting counties. Proposals to support the development of affordable housing are essential in sustaining fragile communities. Those proposals should be looked at in a positive light.</p><p>In the governance of crofting, it makes sense to separate the function of crofting regulation and enforcement from the function of crofting development. The maintenance of a register of crofts, to be administered by the Registers of Scotland, also seems to be a sensible idea.</p><p>However, I sound a cautionary note. There is a danger of too many cooks spoiling the broth if Highlands and Islands Enterprise is to be responsible for a new crofting and community development body, local crofting boards are to be tied into a federation of crofting boards, and grazings committees are to be transformed into crofting township development committees. I acknowledge the need for separation of functions from a governance point of view, but there is still a danger that all those proposed structures&#8212;all with their own ideas, input and secretariats&#8212;will make the situation just as complicated as it was before. The need for all those administrative functions has to be very well discussed before legislation is introduced.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives very much welcome this hugely comprehensive and solution-driven report. We have still to digest much of it, but it is obvious that it provides a springboard for the creation of new legislation. If the minister decides to introduce a bill, we hope that it will rationalise and simplify the various pieces of legislation that go back into the mists of time. I hope that one piece of legislation will be able to cope with the enormousness and complexity of such a task.

His motion</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes with concern the dominance of large-scale supermarkets in Scottish retailing\".</p><p>I have to agree. Of course, supermarkets have been hugely successful in respect of shareholder value and have made available to the Scottish public an unsurpassed range of good quality and well-presented food products, of which previous generations could only have dreamed. Supermarkets are here to stay and, to be fair, if we did not have them we would probably be trying to invent them. I agree with Christine Grahame in that regard.</p><p>However, their success has come at a cost, particularly to town centres, many of which have as a result lost their bustling local food shops and their character. That is why the Scottish Conservative manifesto proposed a &#163;20 million town-centre regeneration fund.</p><p>A cost has also been borne by food producers. Their margins have been squeezed so much that many livestock farmers have moved out of farming and, sadly, many more are considering doing so. For that reason, our party has long supported the introduction of an ombudsman, which cannot happen soon enough.</p><p>As I said, we live in changing times. It is regrettable that food security, high oil prices, global warming and a growing world population all, for different reasons, contribute to driving up the price of food. Higher fuel costs and peak oil <place-holder colnum=\"8596\"/> suggest that more food will need to be produced and consumed locally. It may become socially unacceptable to fly out-of-season vegetables half way round the world as a result of the need to conserve oil supplies for future generations and because of peak oil.</p><p>Farmers markets have taken the lead by reintroducing seasonality into shopping patterns. In-season produce may be all that consumers can afford in the future if oil rises further in price, so I believe that a renewed opportunity exists for farmers markets, for farm shops and for all local food retailers to further develop their businesses.</p><p>In Scotland, that means developing better food and drink supply chains. It also means more co-operation between individual food producers and it means taking the specialist advice of organisations such as the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd on how best to achieve those aims by, for example, creating distribution hubs and funding new routes to market. That will also give local food, which is by definition often less processed and has less salt and fewer fats added, the opportunity to be used in supporting the healthy eating agenda. The encouragement of more public procurement of locally produced fresh food will benefit the environment, people's health and the primary producers of food. \"Buy local, eat local\" should be the order of the day.</p><p>The new ombudsman, when it is in place, must ensure fairer returns from the marketplace for fruit producers. Scottish Conservatives look forward to the creation of a new and extended grocery supply code of practice, as well as to the end of abuses of power, such as the demand for lump-sum payments and enforced promotional costs.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Patrick Harvie on bringing the motion to Parliament.

The second world war is perhaps the best starting point. As we all know, Britain was almost starved out of the war by German U-boats, so \"Dig for victory\" and rationing became the order of the day. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, huge increases in food production were achieved in Scotland and throughout Europe, as politicians of all countries feared that Europe would have insufficient food to feed its then 350 million population. Milk lakes, butter mountains and wine lakes followed in the mid-1980s, which resulted in common agricultural policy reforms being introduced. Essentially, the reforms reined in food production by encouraging alternative land use policies, particularly environmental enhancement.</p><p>From 1988 to 2008, we have had, in an almost biblical way, 20 years of plenty, but the situation has now changed. Once again, the spectre of food shortages has emerged, with world grain prices rising by 60 per cent in the first three months of this year and China buying land in Russia and South America to feed its growing population.</p><p>The problems that we are contemplating today have come about for three main reasons. First, oil has&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;reached $120 a barrel, largely because of the growing awareness that oil is a finite resource and because of concerns about peak oil. That has encouraged farmers worldwide to grow crops for biofuel production on land that was previously used for food. In Brazil, for example, 90 per cent of new cars can now run on ethanol.</p><p>Secondly&#8212;and, again, unexpectedly&#8212;global warming is taking more and more land out of agricultural production both north and south of the equator. Australia has suffered a seven-year drought and much of southern Europe and north Africa is a virtual desert in terms of food production. Sea levels are beginning to rise, too. Although no one can tell us by how much they will rise, we know that a 1m rise in sea levels&#8212;a distinct possibility within the next 100 years&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"8132\"/> would reduce by a third the land that is available to feed an already hungry world.</p><p>The third reason for the problems that we are examining today is population growth and rising standards of living. Man has been the most successful species since the dinosaurs, and the world's population is heading towards 9 billion by 2050. Increased living standards, especially in China, India and Japan, have resulted in those countries moving to western styles of food consumption, based on consumption of meat rather than rice or grain. That has put still more pressure on grain growing, so that animals can be raised for human food consumption.</p><p>The perfect storm is emerging, due to rising oil prices, global warming and world population growth. Today, we must acknowledge those facts and start to consider what we in Scotland can do to help to feed a daily more hungry world.</p><p>It is self-evident that we must encourage our farmers to do all that they can to grow more food. That will have to be done in a sustainable and environmentally sensitive way, but&#8212;to use a metaphor&#8212;growing two blades of grass where one grew before will again become important in food protection terms, as now Europe must not only start to feed itself for the first time but feed other, less favoured, parts of the world as well. Europe, the United Kingdom and Scotland are not even self-sufficient in food production at the moment.</p><p>Increasing production will require investment in research and development, to increase crop and animal production. Research into enhanced food techniques, some of which could take place in Scotland, will need to be carried out on behalf of developing countries, as they have neither the expertise nor the finance to carry out research to bring into production the huge swathes of potentially fertile land in, for example, sub-Saharan Africa. Land that is serviced by rainfall will become even more precious and water storage and irrigation systems will need to be further developed in Europe. That is the case even here in Britain, especially in England, as predictions suggest that Kent will have little agricultural value in 25 years' time unless irrigation systems are in place by then.</p><p>In Scotland, we can all help by wasting less food. At the moment, 40 per cent of food that is put into the supply chain is wasted, lost or thrown out unused, with 30 per cent of our shopping baskets thrown out weekly and 10 per cent of food damaged or lost before it reaches the point of sale. It is vital that we play our part in avoiding food shortages by addressing food wastage in the home and in the catering trade.</p><p>\"Dig for victory\", the slogan that encapsulated <place-holder colnum=\"8133\"/> our wartime need to maximise food production from our own resources, may again become the order of the day. In our back gardens and allotments, recycling domestic waste and grass cuttings into growing vegetables could again become important, as food price inflation reaches almost 12 per cent. On average, families are paying &#163;750 more this year for their staple diet than they paid last year. Conservatives have long advocated a policy of buy local, eat local where reasonably practical, to increase sustainable and socially responsible food consumption. Greater public procurement of local food and drink must be encouraged, as must greater collaboration in the development of the food supply chain. Agricultural support systems, which were recently agreed until 2013, may have to be revisited before then, as the Scotland rural development programme already looks out of date and is the product of thinking that did not anticipate oil prices of $120 a barrel, peak oil or the consequences of global warming.</p><p>The issues to be addressed are now stark. I have given the Conservative party's thoughts on how we might proceed. I hope that others will bring ideas and suggestions to the debate to help to inform the Government on how we in Scotland can best move forward from here. As Annabel Goldie announced yesterday, Scottish Conservatives will work with colleagues in the UK and Europe to produce a report over the summer that will try to chart the way forward. We will also be happy to work with other parties to find the right sustainable solutions. In that spirit of co-operation, we will be happy to accept the amendments that have been lodged by other parties today, to allow the Parliament to speak with one voice on this matter.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament expresses its concern at the potential for global food shortages; notes the recent cost increases in many basic food products here in Scotland, with food price inflation now exceeding 6%; further notes that many developing countries are experiencing growing social unrest as a result of food pressures, and calls on the Scottish Government, Her Majesty's Government, the European Union and other relevant bodies to work closely, and with the appropriate urgency, to seek solutions.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Security"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and I refer members to the register of interests for my other farming-related interests.

Like Sarah Boyack, I had assumed that today's debate would launch the consultation on the marine bill. This proactive engagement tells us that the bill is long overdue. Although the bill will be a complex piece of legislation, it is certainly time that we made a start on it.</p><p>The need for a Scottish marine bill is well documented. We welcome the Scottish Government's intention to tidy up the legislation soon, on the basis that the present legislation is too fragmented. Given the forthcoming UK legislation, Scotland must also try to bring together the various disparate pieces of legislation into a single coherent framework for the management and protection of our seas and coastal waters. An important point is that the legislation must dovetail with the proposed UK marine bill, which must in turn take account of existing European and UK legislation.</p><p>Apparently, Scotland's seas are currently regulated by more than 80 pieces of legislation, as the minister said. The list of issues covered is huge, and ranges from shipping and navigation to defence, oil and gas extraction, nature conservation, renewable energy, fishing, pollution control, ports and planning. Relevant EU legislation includes the common fisheries policy, the birds directive and the water framework directive. International law includes the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as several other international agreements. Pulling together all those pieces of legislation will be a Herculean task, so it is easy to see why addressing the issue was previously put into the tray marked \"too difficult\".</p><p>A start must be made by examining which actions are most needed. First, we need to protect the interests of those who make their living from the seas, especially our commercial fishermen and seamen. The legislation must be balanced and proportionate. We must also protect and enhance our marine environment to sustain marine biodiversity, tourism and&#8212;importantly&#8212;sea angling. With 40,000 species to be found in our seas and coastal waters, it is vital that we strike the right balance.</p><p>The AGMACS group that was set up by the previous Executive reported in March 2007 that we need new powers to extend Scotland's responsibilities in the seas. It noted that we need a statutory marine spatial planning system and an integrated system of coastal zone management, and it advocated the creation of a new Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"7234\"/> marine management organisation with responsibilities out to the 200-nautical-mile limit.</p><p>Our own former Environment and Rural Development Committee stated that the governance of the marine environment should be simplified, and that a single integrated regulatory system for all marine activities in Scotland is essential. It is self-evident that that has to be properly integrated with the regulation at UK Government level to avoid overlaps and division between jurisdictions. Gaps in legislation must be filled, for example the recently exposed inadequacies in Scotland's ability to protect its marine environment from ship-to-ship oil transfer in the Firth of Forth. In addition, all parties appear to agree that we need to consider the creation of an integrated network of marine protected areas. Scottish Environment LINK and the RSPB have pressed strongly for that for some time.</p><p>Today's debate paves the way for the consultation on our own Scottish marine bill, and that must begin with a close look at developing the concept of marine spatial planning. For example, the Pentland Firth should be noted as the future area of choice for tidal power, which is the most reliable source of renewable energy if a cost effective way can be found to harness it. The Solway Firth should be designated as our first marine national park for the simple reason that there appears to be a desire for it in the area, to protect that unique part of Scottish inshore waters. I know that the Presiding Officer&#8212;indeed, perhaps even the Deputy Presiding Officer&#8212;campaigned vigorously for that in the previous session of Parliament. I might be taking the Deputy Presiding Officer's name in vain, so forgive me.</p><p>A strategic overview of what goes where should be established as soon as possible, as that will simplify the future planning process. The complexity of jurisdiction within and without the 12-nautical-mile limit, and out to 200 miles, needs to be simplified and rationalised. At the very least, Scotland must not give up control of areas that it already controls. AGMACS has suggested that a three-tier structure would facilitate effective spatial planning, which seems to be eminently sensible.</p><p>Developing the concept of ecosystem resilience and enhancement within marine national parks should be a key priority&#8212;it already works well in Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Marine ecosystem objectives, or MEOs, should be considered as part of the legislation, assuming that community buy-in can be achieved. Commercial and recreational fishing interests must be reasonably respected. The Government will need to be proactive and positive about that if a whole-ecosystem approach is to be established.</p><p>In order to facilitate that, the concept of a Scottish marine management organisation&#8212;an <place-holder colnum=\"7235\"/> SMMO&#8212;could, and should, be considered. Such an organisation could have wide-ranging co-ordinating powers, and could be responsible for planning and the enforcement of devolved activities in Scottish waters. It could be answerable to the Scottish ministers and be responsible for licensing, co-ordinating with a UK MMO and providing a central point of marine expertise.</p><p>Much good work has been done by various organisations over the past 16 years, which has brought us to this point today. The sustainable seas task force will meet for the first the time in April and report thereafter, and it will, I hope, support existing proposals and further develop the concepts that are being explored in today's debate. I note the minister's remarks in that regard. Thereafter, we can start getting this long-overdue legislation onto the statute books, and consider which legislation within the current plethora we can repeal. Scottish Conservatives look forward to that work, and we will play an active and constructive part in the process.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401333", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate on Scotland's marine environment is welcome and has been surprisingly consensual thus far, notwithstanding the best efforts of Mike Rumbles to make it otherwise.

I welcome the fact that in accessible rural Scotland, people apparently enjoy better health, safer neighbourhoods, a higher rate of home ownership and higher incomes, although the suggestion is that that is in spite of, rather than because of, Government policy.</p><p>On the negative side, the report says that in remoter areas, serious challenges need to be addressed in relation to ageing, out-migration, poor economic performance and a lack of access to modern services. For good measure, the report notes multiple indices of deprivation in our most fragile areas because of low incomes&#8212;for example, the gross domestic product per capita in the Western Isles is 60 per cent of the European Union average&#8212;as well as net out-migration, low enterprise formation and poor health.

The report gets that one wrong. Now is not the time to divert the meagre support away from land in rural Scotland, because that would put Scottish farmers and managers at an even greater competitive disadvantage compared with our European neighbours.</p><p>The December agriculture census figures that were released yesterday show a continuing trend of reducing beef, sheep and pig numbers on Scottish farms. That points out starkly the historic and long-term lack of profitability in those sectors and heralds likely further job losses in the most fragile sector in rural Scotland, because it is the labour-intensive sector in Scottish agriculture. Only when profitability returns to agriculture will people and staff also return. That is a key factor in today's debate, which focuses in part on deprivation in rural Scotland.</p><p>However, although the report is essentially an audit of recent times, the future is much brighter for rural Scotland, as food security is emerging as a key issue that politicians worldwide have to address. The World Bank has warned that, by 2030, food demand will double as world population rises. However, because of oil prices hitting $100 a barrel, land is moving from wheat production to biofuel production, while global warming is reducing the food-producing capability of land north and south of the equator. Droughts have destroyed Australia's agriculture output in the past seven years and are now starting to affect New Zealand. To say that food security is an emerging issue is a gentle way of saying that food scarcity is just round the corner. The sooner politicians worldwide wake up and smell the coffee and start <place-holder colnum=\"6747\"/> to deal with that, the better. The OECD has also suggested&#8212;conservatively, in my view&#8212;that food prices will rise between 20 per cent and 50 per cent in the next decade. That will have huge implications for people on fixed incomes, particularly the elderly, as the era of cheap food comes to an end.</p><p>According to the United Nations, drought, deforestation and climate instability are responsible for the loss of 250 million acres of fertile soil each year and global warming is causing sea levels to rise dramatically. Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that a 1m sea-level rise will cause one third of the world's total crop land to be swamped and rendered unusable. At the current rate of sea-level rise, that will happen in the next 100 years.</p><p>The scenario is stark. Fertile land will have to return to being farmed to its full capability. Set-aside will become a memory of the 20 years of plenty that we have enjoyed since 1986. We are debating the OECD report, but I urge the minister to consider devoting parliamentary time to a debate on food security and how to start addressing the problem. The issue cannot be ignored any longer. I know that the minister raised it at the NFU Scotland council meeting Dunblane a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>In the meantime, more must be done to correct the underlying structural and infrastructural issues that are highlighted in the OECD report. For that reason, I will move the amendment in my name and urge Parliament to support it.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-1489.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"providing that the Scottish Government takes action to address the specific policy delivery concerns identified by the OECD including 'centralisation and the lack of adequate bottom-up participation', 'weak integration', 'an overlap of different approaches and agencies' and 'the extreme complexity of both the design and the delivery system linked with rural policy'.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400135", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I share Mr Purvis's concern, but I trust that other ways will be found to address it.

I welcome the various sea angling organisations that are represented in the public gallery and the other interested individuals who have joined us, many of whom attended the event in the Parliament at lunch time, for which thanks are especially due to Steve Bastiman, Ian Burrett and their colleagues from the Scottish Sea Angling Conservation Network.</p><p>Before this begins to sound like an Oscar acceptance speech, I will turn to the subject. As my motion notes&#8212;and as we heard at lunch time today&#8212;recreational sea angling is hugely important to Scotland. It supports not only boat hire companies and tackle shops, but a plethora of other businesses such as hotels, cafes and pubs in often fragile coastal communities. As the motion states, an estimated 225,000 people participate in sea angling each year, not including the many tourists who also come to fish.</p><p>Research by Highlands and Islands Enterprise estimates that almost 80,000 United Kingdom residents visited the Highlands in 2003 to take part in sea angling, which it says supports more than <place-holder colnum=\"6374\"/> 400 full-time equivalent jobs. Furthermore, Scottish Natural Heritage has suggested that boat anglers spend an average &#163;1,375 each and that the equivalent figure for shore anglers is a not inconsiderable &#163;861. As to the overall economic value of the sector, we await the Glasgow Caledonian University study with interest&#8212;indeed, with bated breath. It is worth noting that a similar study that was published by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs calculated the total worth of the sector in England and Wales to be a possible &#163;1.3 billion.</p><p>Despite its significance to many of the communities that we represent&#8212;including those in my constituency&#8212;angling is, I believe, a subject that has been surprisingly overlooked by politicians. As the Scottish Estates Business Group has said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland still has considerable opportunities to develop sea fishing which remain largely untapped\",</p><p>yet I cannot recall a debate on recreational fishing in my eight years in Parliament. I am glad that we have been able to put that right with two events today. I hope, however, that the debate will not end here. I urge the minister to consider whether a full debate on the subject might be possible when the economic impact study is eventually published, later this year.</p><p>As the minister knows, I asked recently whether the Government intends to develop a sea angling strategy. He replied that the starting point must be the forthcoming study. I wonder whether, in his closing remarks, he will confirm whether the strategy forms part of his plans. Governments of all colours are good at publishing strategies, but not always to great effect. It may be that an alternative course is open to us. Either way, I trust that the minister will touch on how the Government might take things forward from here.</p><p>Recreational sea angling is an activity that we should all welcome, not simply because of its economic importance but because it represents the ultimate in sustainable, environmentally sound fishing. It causes no damage to the seabed and the number of fish that are taken bears no threat to the viability of stocks. Indeed, the sea angling community needs take a back seat to no one in its approach to conservation and is actively promoting minimum catch sizes to ensure that fish that are yet to breed are returned to the water.</p><p>In the light of the sea angling community's commitment to conservation, it is especially troubling&#8212;to all of us, I trust&#8212;that many of the species that are of interest to anglers and were once regarded as abundant are either extinct locally or reduced to the point at which only juvenile specimens are being landed. For example, in days gone by, the European cod <place-holder colnum=\"6375\"/> festival was held on the Clyde on more than one occasion. The idea that such an event should be held there today would be laughable if the matter were not so serious.</p><p>Many of the sea angling tourists who come to Scotland do so to fish for some of our most spectacular species, for example&#8212;in your constituency, Presiding Officer&#8212;the enormous and erroneously named common skate, which is caught each year off the west coast.

I thank the minister for honouring his commitment to hold the debate.</p><p>Notwithstanding that Scotland is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, with only 17 per cent of the land covered by trees, the Forestry Commission estimates that around &#163;800 million of the Scottish economy is linked to forestry, with 6.6 million cubic metres of timber produced annually. Wood production and processing employ around 12,000 people in our fragile rural areas directly and 14,000 in downstream industries. In the hills and uplands of many parts of Scotland, forestry has replaced sheep farming.</p><p>In a debate on commercial forestry, it is worth remembering why the Forestry Commission was established and why it continues to be relevant today. First, in both the great wars of the last century, the strategic need for timber left much of Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom denuded of timber, much of which had been grown over centuries. The Forestry Commission was established in 1919 to reafforest Britain in recognition of the strategic and commercial need for timber. Certainly, the commercial need for timber remains to this day. That is why the Conservatives welcome the Government's planting target of 25 per cent, although that target is a reduction on the historical planting target of 33 per cent that was aimed for in recent times past.</p><p>Commercial timber production delivers more than just timber. For example, forest tourism is worth &#163;160 million annually to the Scottish economy. In addition, Scotland's 1.3 million hectares of forestry lock up 70 million tonnes of carbon, as well as supporting much of our significant and varied biodiversity. Those benefits will only increase as we move towards the 25 per cent planting target.</p><p>It is also interesting to note the willingness of the private sector to get involved in delivering the annual planting target of an additional 10,000 hectares that will need to be planted if we are to achieve the 25 per cent target. I understand that 8,000 of those hectares will be planted by the private sector, which is prepared to take the long view in its investment strategies.

For that reason alone, I welcome today's debate.</p><p>I join the minister in welcoming the progress that has been made towards the biodiversity strategy and congratulate the many voluntary and public agencies that have achieved so much in that regard. However, I sense a real danger of <place-holder colnum=\"5519\"/> complacency. For example, it is deeply worrying that only five of the 22 biodiversity indicators show any improvement, while three show deterioration. As RSPB Scotland has pointed out, some of the indicators that are listed as stable remain in a perilous state. Furthermore, I am concerned to see that, according to the progress report, only half the habitats in Scotland's designated protected areas are deemed to be in favourable condition. That is a desperately low proportion considering the fact that they are within apparently protected areas.</p><p>The minister will not be surprised that I want to touch on the importance of farmers and land managers because, arguably, it is they who are the biggest players when it comes to enhancement and preservation of the natural environment. In the vast majority of cases, they do a good job. The many agri-environment schemes underline the crucial role that farmers play, and it is vital that they remain at the heart of the biodiversity agenda to reduce habitat destruction and the spread of invasive non-indigenous species. Indeed, I lodged a parliamentary question only this week, asking the minister about the spread of bracken especially in the west Highlands.</p><p>That said, conflicts can arise over land management issues&#8212;it is vital that they be managed sensitively. Too often, bodies such as SNH are accused&#8212;rightly or wrongly&#8212;of taking a top-down approach that irks local communities. For that reason, a review should be undertaken of SNH, SEPA and the Forestry Commission to ensure that they always work in the best interests of the communities that they serve and of biodiversity. The SNP pledged a review of the possible merging of SNH and SEPA. I would like to hear from the minister what progress has been made on that.</p><p>I turn to one of the most compelling reasons for redoubling our efforts to conserve biodiversity&#8212;the importance of tourism and eco-tourism. Huge numbers of people come here to enjoy our unrivalled scenery and wildlife, which is why the prioritisation of resources towards the protection of Scotland's most iconic species&#8212;many of which are in serious trouble but which wildlife tourists come here to see&#8212;is essential. A good example is the capercaillie, which is a magnificent game bird that is found nowhere else in Britain. The destruction and near-disappearance of Scotland's once widespread Caledonian pine forest led to the bird's extinction more than 200 years ago. Although it was successfully reintroduced to Perthshire in 1837, numbers have again plummeted from around 20,000 in the early 1970s to perhaps 2,000 or fewer today. I am aware of the work that is being done by the Forestry Commission, SNH and RSPB Scotland to turn things around&#8212;with some success. Yet, the <place-holder colnum=\"5520\"/> history of the capercaillie is a sober reminder of what can happen if we neglect our biodiversity treasures. Although its reintroduction shows that the damage can sometimes be undone, the fact that it remains in such a perilous state underlines the need to accelerate efforts to aid the recovery of this iconic species and others such as the red squirrel and the wildcat&#8212;which was mentioned by Roseanna Cunningham&#8212;for future generations.</p><p>I look forward to supporting the Government's motion and both the Labour and Liberal Democrat amendments this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13396925", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Biodiversity Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin, as ever, by declaring my interest as a farmer.

I welcome Sarah Boyack's approach in that regard.</p><p>We consider the issue against a backdrop of slow and steady decline in Scotland's once-proud fishing industry. Almost 3,000 fishermen left the industry and more than 1,000 vessels were deregistered in the past 10 years. It would be churlish to deny that some sectors are doing reasonably well, but that is at a cost of brutal reductions in the size of the fleet.</p><p>The sad truth is that Scotland's fishermen have become used to getting a raw deal from Brussels. No one knows that better than the cabinet secretary, who when he was in opposition left us in no doubt that under a Scottish National Party Government things would be different and better. I remind him that he has set the bar extremely high on what we and our fishermen expect him to deliver in Brussels. I noted what he said, which I assume means that he will seek a 15 per cent increase in the cod quota this year. We will support him when he fights our corner next month.</p><p>The Government's motion contains a factual inaccuracy. The UK Government ultimately negotiates the deal, working with and alongside the Scottish ministers. I hope that all members can support the Conservative amendment, which is technical in essence.</p><p>What do Conservatives expect from Government ministers in conjunction with their UK colleagues at the Brussels discussions? First, on cod, it is essential that the European Commission be made to understand the sterling measures that Scottish fishermen have implemented to further the conservation effort, through the recently expanded voluntary closure scheme and the observation initiative. The measures are welcome and stand in marked contrast to what Bertie Armstrong described as the \"blunt instruments\" of quotas and days at sea, on which the discredited EU cod recovery plan relies. The on-going review of the plan is, therefore, welcome, and I offer the cabinet secretary the strongest possible support in the pursuit of his blueprint for the species.</p><p>On the wider issue of cod stocks and other species, it is evident that fishermen and scientists agree that recovery is essential but that they differ on the rate of recovery that is needed. It is <place-holder colnum=\"3651\"/> heartening that the North Sea cod stocks are recovering, despite being fished when the scientists said that the fisheries should be closed. It is, therefore, vital to strike a sensible balance between the recovery of all our fish stocks and the preservation of our fishermen's livelihoods, bearing in mind that, if we get it wrong, the consequences could be dire for fishermen and fish alike.</p><p>That brings me to what must be the overriding priority for Scottish and UK ministers in December: tackling the disgraceful scandal of discards. From a layperson's point of view, that has to be one of the most wasteful practices on the planet and defies all reason and talk of sustainability. I am both amazed and appalled that a new approach to resolving the issue has not been taken before now. Indeed, the blas&#233; attitude that was taken by the UK minister with responsibility for fisheries and Commissioner Borg when asked about this utterly repugnant practice on Tuesday was utterly depressing. Between 40 and 60 per cent of North Sea cod are being thrown back into the sea dead or dying, and that is no longer acceptable. Now is the time to muster the political will in this country and across Europe to tackle the problem head on.</p><p>One option that should be explored further is the Norwegian approach, which makes it an offence to catch, rather than land, undersized fish and has resulted in a huge improvement in gear selectivity, which has reduced the capture of juvenile fish. A modest bycatch of juvenile fish is permitted, for which the fishermen receive 20 per cent of their value and which are not included in their quota. Another option would be to permit fishermen to land everything that they catch, with over-quota species being sold for a nominal amount. Alternatively, fishermen could be allowed to keep their full catch, policed by reduced days at sea and temporary closures of zones with large numbers of young fish.</p><p>All those options must be considered as ways forward. Such serious anti-discard measures, combined with the voluntary conservation measures that are being pioneered in Scotland, give us the tools to create a workable way forward.</p><p>Our recreational sea anglers, whose interests are far too often overlooked, share our concerns about preserving the fragile marine environment close to our shores. To that end, a further additional measure that the cabinet secretary might wish to explore is the idea of a golden mile in which only recreational anglers could fish.

It is taking place at the right time, as rural Scotland starts to pick up the pieces following the foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks and chart a way forward for food production again.<place-holder colnum=\"3097\"/></p><p>The consideration of a national food policy must be set in the context of worldwide food security. Having been an issue in Europe until 1986, food security is becoming a major concern once again. Europe and Britain have enjoyed 20 years of plenty and surpluses since the mid-1980s. However, although the doubling of the price of grain and massive increases in milk prices over the past year have been welcome from a farming perspective, they are also indicative of a tightening of supply in those commodities.</p><p>The high worldwide price of oil, which approaches $100 a barrel today, is encouraging farmers throughout the world to grow crops for biofuels. That development, coupled with increasing demand for western food from China and India, means that plentiful and cheap food may shortly become a thing of the past. Few people had foreseen that a high price for oil would also drive up the price of food but, with peak oil either upon us or past, it is unlikely that oil will reduce significantly in price again. The European Union has recognised that fact and has already reduced set-aside to zero.</p><p>We are on the cusp of a new era of demand for global food production and Scotland must play its part. Notwithstanding the dreadful year that producers of sheep, pig and poultry are experiencing, we must support and maintain food production capacity. That is why it was important to support the breeding flocks in the sheep industry post the foot-and-mouth outbreak. The industry has welcomed that support, and I hope that the minister will also support the pig industry if he can. It is important that we sustain a critical mass in both those sectors to maintain slaughtering capacity as well as a level of self-sufficiency in food production in Scotland.</p><p>In addition, in the short and medium term, we must support the use of more locally produced food in our school, hospital, council and prison canteens. We must stop paying lip service to enhanced public procurement, as has happened in the past, and start making it happen now. Indeed, in 2002, Morgan and Marley made clear the many ways in which local sourcing can be legitimately specified within existing procurement rules. Perhaps the Government should consider issuing guidelines on that, if some are not already in place.</p><p>The terms \"protected geographical indication\" and \"protected designation of origin\" have been widely adopted elsewhere in Europe and must be used more in Scotland to give our producers a marketing edge and add value to their product. That is another matter that the Government could helpfully drive forward at little or no cost and was one of the conclusions of the DTZ Pieda report.<place-holder colnum=\"3098\"/></p><p>The benefits of increasing consumption of locally produced food have already been well rehearsed, but they are worth repeating. By and large, buying locally produced food both reduces one's individual carbon footprint and supports our local farming and processing industries. Local food is fresher, tastier and usually healthier because it has higher vitamin levels&#8212;vitamin levels decrease over time in food that is imported from abroad. In addition, locally produced food is often less processed, has lower fat and salt levels and is less likely to cause obesity and diabetes.</p><p>We must recognise the health problem that our current diet is creating, particularly for our young people. Nowhere is that more clearly stated than in the document \"Review of The Scottish Diet Action Plan: Progress and Impacts 1996-2005\". The Parliament should consider ways of implementing many of the recommendations in that report. Perhaps my colleagues Mary Scanlon and Nanette Milne will address that point and talk about minimum nutritional standards in school meals, which Elaine Smith mentioned.</p><p>Government departments must take a more cross-cutting and joined-up approach. For example, the health department should not only recognise the benefit of using fresh, local food in local schools but acknowledge the additional value-added benefit to the environment and the local economy. I welcome the fact that Shona Robison is closing the debate.</p><p>Similarly, the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change must consider not only the carbon footprints of farmers markets but all their other benefits, including the regeneration and rebuilding of communities and town centres and the education and reconnection of urban and rural communities.</p><p>Positive evidence has recently been published about the health benefits of organic food production. That should be taken note of and reconsidered in a new light&#8212;and I might be the first convert. Proper labelling must remain a cherished goal, too.</p><p>Much enthusiasm exists to develop a coherent national food policy, as we have seen already during the debate, with the greatest potential for improvement lying in the local food sector. We all know that the sector is growing like a mushroom at the moment, but that is happening in a haphazard and random way. Helpful Government support in terms of guidance, targeted funding, further research into ways of adding value and developing co-operation and collaboration can make a difference. I urge Parliament to push the agenda forward with all speed and to support the amendment in my name.<place-holder colnum=\"3099\"/></p><p>I move amendment S3M-784.1, to insert after \"factors\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; believes that a national policy must include more assistance for public procurement of home-grown Scottish food to be achieved by improved co-operation between Scotland's local food producers and government,\".</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391060", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare my interest as a farmer and refer members to the register of members' interests for my other farming-related interests.

Regrettably, my memory takes me back through the BSE crisis of 1996, the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak, the E coli 0157 disaster and, now in 2007, foot-and-mouth again. Sadly, however, one of the things that sets this crisis apart is that it appears to have been completely avoidable. If only a laboratory that was inspected, licensed and financed by Government had looked after its biosecurity&#8212;or, to put it plainly, had maintained its drains&#8212;the outbreak would not have happened. Indeed, as far back as 2003, the Spratt report <place-holder colnum=\"2603\"/> made DEFRA aware of the problem at Pirbright. The report stated that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"pipes were old and needed replacing, but after much discussion between the Institute, Merial and DEFRA, money had not been made available.\"</p><p>What also sets this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease apart from the 2001 outbreak is that, whereas the cost of the 2001 outbreak&#8212;&#163;3.5 billion&#8212;fell largely on the taxpayer through animal slaughterings, this time the cost of the outbreak has fallen largely on the livestock industry, affecting hauliers, auctioneers, abattoirs, exporters and farmers alike.</p><p>The Scottish livestock industry has to start rebuilding itself again after this Government-induced crisis. In the meantime, sheep farmers are going to the wall, pig farmers are going out of business and banks are refusing to lend more money to some of those already deep in debt.</p><p>A welfare scheme is now in place. I and others campaigned for that, and although it was introduced too late to help some farmers, it is now helping others. However, the scheme will probably end up attracting only approximately 100,000 lambs. The remainder of this year's lamb crop is either stuck on farms or being sold for a poor price. Hundreds of thousands of draft ewes at the end of their working life also have nowhere to go and have little or no value. The welfare scheme should be extended to include them. Notwithstanding the minister's remarks today, I still ask him to discuss the issue further with the industry stakeholder group.</p><p>Thousands of cast sows need to be culled and included in the welfare disposal scheme, and so too do dairy bull calves. Those animals are stuck on farms, incurring feeding costs. They previously had a value but now have none. I welcome the minister's commitment to meet pig industry representatives next week to chart a way forward. Until normal export markets resume for lambs, calves and pigs, they all represent both a welfare problem and a huge drain on profitability.</p><p>Minister, we welcome the measures that you have announced today to help this beleaguered industry and provide it with some hope for the future, and I particularly welcome the increased support for QMS and the educational and charitable organisations. You have recognised that, to secure a future for Scotland's sheep industry, it is essential to try and maintain viable breeding flocks. However, for many businesses, the compensation package simply will not be enough. Indeed, with the likely underspend in the present welfare disposal scheme of &#163;3 million, it is hardly a generous offer when compared with the actual losses being faced by the sheep industry as a whole, through no fault of its own.<place-holder colnum=\"2604\"/></p><p>The payment of approximately &#163;6 per ewe, when added to the LFASS payment that is due in late December and to the single farm payment that is also due in December, will tide farmers over, but the real crisis will become apparent next spring and summer&#8212;in April, May, June and July&#8212;when cash flows are at their lowest and overdrafts are at their highest. For many sheep farming businesses in the most fragile areas, the battle to survive may well be finally lost. Already I am told that land abandonment is happening in the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area. Tenant farmers in particular are going out of business.

It is rare for all the briefings that we receive from lobbying bodies to agree, but the debate appears to have united the RSPB, the SRPBA, the Countryside Alliance, the Scottish Estates Business Group, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and Advocates for Animals in condemnation of wildlife crimes. That is no easy task.</p><p>However, the Parliament uniting against and recoiling from such crimes will not of itself reduce them, despite our having some of the strongest wildlife protection law in Europe, according to the RSPB. Indeed, it appears that 2006 may have been one of the worst years for raptor poisoning <place-holder colnum=\"2504\"/> for 25 years. In a civilised society, that is simply not acceptable.</p><p>I believe that the minister met stakeholder groups this morning. I welcome that upfront approach. This afternoon, the Solicitor General for Scotland proposed a thematic review of the problem, to be carried out by Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary and Her Majesty's chief inspector of prosecution in Scotland and report by 31 March. That is a sensible way to try to get a handle on the problem.</p><p>Wildlife crime takes place in many different ways. Badger baiting, hare coursing, illegal seal shooting, and illegal poisoning and trapping all take place in Scotland. Regrettably, there are many other forms of wildlife crime, but the one that most outrages everyone is the poisoning of raptors, and I congratulate <em>The Scotsman </em>on its expos&#233; of those issues in today's edition.</p><p>Although I endorse the minister's intention to carry out a review and not immediately rush to create a new piece of legislation, it is important that he gets the terms of that review right. Sarah Boyack raised an important point about producing guidance, and I too would welcome that. Joe O'Donnell and Paddy Tomkins must first recognise the scale of the task, the difficulty of enforcement and the apparent inconsistency of approach across Scotland. The review team must then separate out the different types of crime and why they are committed. Hare coursing and badger baiting offences are perpetrated for different reasons from raptor poisonings, and the review group really needs to examine why those crimes are committed before solutions can be found. I welcome the Solicitor General's recognition of that point.</p><p>Individuals who try to protect their grouse or their pheasants&#8212;and their own livelihood&#8212;from raptors do so for different reasons from those who carry out badger baiting or collect birds' eggs. Illegal seal culling to protect river salmon stocks and livelihoods is a different crime from hare coursing and is carried out for different reasons. Although I condemn all those crimes, I urge the review group to look behind the offences at why they are committed, with a view to coming up with solutions. Worldwide best practice should be examined for its applicability to Scotland's raptor habitats and proactive suggestions should be made.</p><p>There is much talk of the need for spatial planning for wind farming versus other types of land use and of marine spatial planning in our seas. In the same way, perhaps the zoning of areas and habitats for protected bird species is a concept that should be examined. For example, notwithstanding the good intentions of the second Langholm project&#8212;which I wish every success&#8212;it <place-holder colnum=\"2505\"/> may be that commercial grouse moors and hen harriers will never be compatible. Perhaps areas should be set aside for commercial grouse moors and wildlife reserves, with trapping and release programmes put in place. I do not know whether that is practical, but it should be considered.</p><p>Increasing demand for access to and use of our countryside is putting ever growing pressure on landowners. The potential for conflict between the people who wish to use our countryside for recreation and those who need to make a living from it has never been greater, and wildlife and protected species&#8212;including the raptor population&#8212;are caught in between. That is why understanding is needed in carrying out the review, although the moorland forum might be a more appropriate place for those discussions to take place.</p><p>Of course, a crime is a crime and the law must be upheld&#8212;I am utterly behind that. But in addition to applying the law more consistently&#8212;the Solicitor General noted the need for that&#8212;the Parliament and others must take a more holistic approach in trying to address the causes of those crimes. To adapt a well-known phrase, we must be tough on crime and, in this instance, understanding of the causes of crime. I see Cathy Jamieson smiling at that.</p><p>The RSPB has suggested that a full-time wildlife crime officer should be put in place in each Scottish police force area. That makes sense, and I welcome the Solicitor General's comments on that. There must be more procurators fiscal with special training in wildlife crime. That is a constructive suggestion, although the minister might not want his hands to be tied absolutely at this point with respect to any pre-emption of the review's recommendations.</p><p>The minister has suggested the loss of firearms licences for those found guilty of poisoning, and the cutting of single farm payments for those who have been implicated in poisoning. Although I understand his reasons for escalating the penalties for those who are convicted of such crimes, the burden of proof must also become greater, as either of those measures could cause people to lose their jobs and their livelihoods.</p><p> The managers and tenders of grouse moors and pheasant shoots might lose their jobs if there are no grouse or pheasants. They could now lose their jobs for killing raptors. That would be a real lose-lose situation for the individuals involved, and I feel that those proposals might just be a step too far. Balances must be struck, and the view of those at the sharp end must be taken into account.</p><p>I wish the review every success. I know that it will be carried out sympathetically, given the reputations of the individuals involved, and I hope <place-holder colnum=\"2506\"/> that conclusions can be reached that will cut wildlife crime consistently across the whole of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring an interest in the debate as a farmer and, indeed, as an active conservationist.

I welcome FIAC's conclusions&#8212;in particular the recommendations of the alleviation sub-committee.</p><p>I welcome the Government's proposal to introduce a flood prevention bill. Scottish Conservatives think that such a bill is vital and will provide an opportunity to update and integrate the legislation on flood management in Scotland. Almost 100,000 homes and more than 7,000 businesses are under threat of flooding, including homes and businesses in the Ayr constituency, so the bill is urgently needed, particularly given the <place-holder colnum=\"1922\"/> increased rainfall that is predicted for Scotland as a result of climate change.</p><p>The human cost of flooding, which was evident during the recent floods in Tewkesbury and Hull, is a further compelling driver for action. Members of the Parliament have a duty of care to remove or reduce, if at all possible, the threat that flooding increasingly presents to our fellow citizens, which the cabinet secretary and Sarah Boyack mentioned. We must make a start on assessing and evaluating the best way forward, which is a daunting, but exciting, responsibility.</p><p>As members know, a flooding summit was held in Perth to inform the debate. Like other members, I am grateful to the people who took the time to attend the summit and highlight the seriousness and complexity of flooding issues in Scotland. Yesterday, the Parliament's Rural Affairs and Environment Committee initiated an inquiry into flooding. I welcome the Government's intention to conduct an inquiry into the subject later this year. I hope that the two pieces of work will not overlap. The inquiries must grapple with many huge issues.</p><p>The differences between river, coastal, surface and groundwater flooding are self-evident. Different and unique solutions will be required to address various types of flooding. The committee's inquiry and work on the bill will need to start with an attempt to evaluate the risks that are associated with greatly increased rainfall in Scotland during the past 40 years, which were evidenced in the study by the Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research&#8212;SNIFFER&#8212;and the risks that are associated with increasing storminess and rising sea levels, which lead to surges in coastal areas.</p><p>The bill will build on and update earlier legislation and should propose more sustainable and long-term solutions than were previously thought necessary. A combination of soft and hard engineering solutions must be found for each river basin or catchment area, and each solution or plan will be unique to the defined flooding problem. The concept of integrated flood management will need to be developed, particularly to reduce peaks of flooding, which usually&#8212;but not always&#8212;pass quickly.</p><p>I am a farmer, so the tops of the hills are familiar to me&#8212;I declare an interest in that regard. It will be important not to markedly increase drainage on open moorland. Afforestation, particularly with native woodland, should be encouraged, to create rainfall sponges that retain water in the hills and uplands. Upland valleys, which are naturally occurring flood plains and are often the best and most productive agricultural land, might have to be used for the public good, to hold water temporarily and accommodate peak flooding. However, if that involves breaching existing flood defences, it <place-holder colnum=\"1923\"/> should happen only with the consent of affected farmers and landowners. If prime land is occasionally to be used for the public good in that way, it is vital that long-term compensation packages should be negotiated with affected farmers and landowners. Long-term commitments between landowners and public agencies, perhaps for up to 20 or 30 years, need to be considered and could perhaps be integrated into agri-environment schemes. A balance will need to be struck between using land for flood prevention and using it to grow food, given that food security is becoming an issue.</p><p>Environmental and wildlife issues will also need to be considered and balanced. All such issues will need to be integrated into an agreed plan for each river basin and married to the river basin management plans that have been and are being developed as a requirement of the water framework directive.</p><p>Best practice throughout the world should be studied and copied, to deliver soft and hard engineering solutions. The lessons learned from the experiences in Hull, Tewkesbury and elsewhere should help to inform the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's inquiry and the bill.</p><p>Coastal defences will require individual analysis and multi-agency working will be necessary to develop sustainable long-term protection. I agree with Sarah Boyack's comments in that regard.</p><p>If possible, efforts must be made to separate sewage from rainwater, but we all know that that is easier said than done, given the current infrastructure. However, a direction of travel should be established in the context of planning for the future, and longer timescales should be envisaged, to accommodate the anticipated threat of increased river and coastal flooding.</p><p>The creation of flood management schemes such as the Glasgow strategic drainage plan needs to be streamlined and simplified, and local authorities should incur less funding risk before seeking approval for plans. The bill should consider the process for putting in place demountable, temporary and householder flood defences. Planning timescales should be extended&#8212;to 40, 60, 80, or even 100 years&#8212;if research into global warming predicts rising river and sea levels. The bill will provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put the right solutions in place. Of course, some people think that global warming can still be stopped or reversed, so the advice that we receive will be crucial.</p><p>Local authorities, police and fire services might need new powers, so that they can act in the best public interest when extreme flooding events loom. The insurance industry, which so far has largely picked up the bill for flooding in the United <place-holder colnum=\"1924\"/> Kingdom, will have to be persuaded to continue to insure our homes and businesses. It will do so only if the Government does more to reduce the risk of flooding. We should not forget that the UK insurance industry is almost unique in Europe in insuring against flooding risk. The industry will not continue to do that in the long term if the risks and payouts are too great.</p><p>Adequate funding will need to be found. I welcome the commitment that the First Minister made last week in response to a question that I asked him about flooding.

I ask Parliament to note how much his response to the situation contrasts with the position of the Labour Government at Westminster and the previous Lib-Lab administration, and to recognise the sense of urgency in the cabinet secretary's reference to Douglas Alexander's inability even to arrange a meeting on the subject, and his failure to reply to the cabinet secretary until Monday. I hope that Ruth Kelly can do a little better.</p><p>I ask Parliament to compare and contrast the cabinet secretary's determination to introduce legislation within his competence to the refusal by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Trade and Industry even to use existing legislation. That leads us to whether the Labour Government in London is listening to its colleagues in the Labour opposition in Scotland. If Labour in London is listening to Labour in Scotland, either the Labour opposition in Scotland has no influence over its colleagues down south or they do not care about an issue that, on the face of it, has united the whole Parliament. However, that does not mean that we have to accept the cabinet secretary's view without question.</p><p>The Conservative party here and in London needs to be reassured once and for all that the Parliament is competent to amend part IV of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c) Regulations <place-holder colnum=\"1302\"/> 1994 in this way. Parliament cannot afford to get this wrong and to be on the wrong side of an argument with a competent authority&#8212;an argument that might, ultimately, if Parliament gets it wrong, end up being decided in court.</p><p>Make no mistake, as the competent authority, Forth Ports is not the villain in this piece, and it is disingenuous of others to suggest or imply that it is. We need to know what effect the regulations would have on ship-to-ship oil transfer currently taking place at Scapa Flow, Nigg and Sullom Voe. I welcome the minister's clarification on that. The obvious difference is that ship-to-ship oil transfers appear to be welcome in those northern waters, while here in the Firth of Forth, Fife, East Lothian and Edinburgh councils appear to be utterly opposed to the proposals.</p><p>We must all be aware that the regulations do only what they say on the tin: ensure compliance with the directive, provide the power to issue directions and provide the power to suspend proposals until ministers are satisfied that an appropriate assessment has been carried out. As the minister said, they cannot stop ship-to-ship transfer of oil taking place. That is why we have lodged the amendment in David McLetchie's name.</p><p>Without complementary legislation from Westminster, the Scottish ministers&#8212;notwithstanding the will of Parliament&#8212;are powerless to stop ship-to-ship oil transfer. Complementary regulations under section 130 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to regulate the ship-to-ship transfer of oil within the 12 nautical mile limit of United Kingdom territorial seas is now essential, particularly where there is a higher risk to precious habitats. As the minister said, that would fill a legislative gap.</p><p>That is why I urge Parliament to support our amendment and send the clearest possible message to the Government at Westminster that it is time to act on this matter. The sooner it does so, the better.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-252.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and, in so doing, requests the Scottish Government to invite Her Majesty's Government to consider complementary legislative measures to protect environmentally sensitive sites such as the Firth of Forth.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386501", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Point of Order: Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c) Amendment (No 2) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (SSI 2007/80)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the cabinet secretary's remarks on the rather complicated subject of ship-to-ship oil transfer and thank him for the briefing he provided for all parliamentary colleagues and the reasonable way in which he has responded to the problem.

I congratulate Jim Hume on lodging his first motion for a members' business debate in the Parliament on local food and, like Christine Grahame, welcome him to the growing band of parliamentarians who are enthusiastic about the concept. I also welcome Cathy Jamieson's new-found enthusiasm for the issue.</p><p>It is entirely appropriate that the debate is happening today, on the first day of the Royal Highland show. Having seen the minister at breakfast and at lunch, I am glad to see him here this evening, too. I welcome the good turnout of other members at the show and their interest in this debate.</p><p>This motion, and similar motions in the past, catches the growing public mood in favour of buying local, eating local. Nowhere is that mood more prevalent than in the food hall of the Royal Highland show, which both the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and I visited <place-holder colnum=\"1110\"/> today. A sense of enthusiasm and awakening for the potential of local food production, local processing and local consumption is in the air&#8212;one can almost reach out and touch it. Rural Scotland has again found a cause that excites it and that brings out the best can-do attitude in our farmers, our food producers and processors and our restaurateurs. For me, as a pioneer of farmers markets and local food, that is a cause for celebration.</p><p>I have always supported our industry-led organisations&#8212;the Fatstock Marketing Corporation, the Scottish Quality Beef and Lamb Association and its successor, Quality Meat Scotland&#8212;in the promotional work that they have done. QMS, which kindly gave me breakfast this morning, must be encouraged and supported under Donald Biggar's steady, sensible leadership, as must its dedicated staff. We must applaud QMS's work in promoting local beef, lamb and pork. We must also welcome the supermarkets' increasing enthusiasm for the local food concept. At the moment Tesco may be leading the way in that regard but, having met Stuart Rose of Marks and Spencer and Justin King of Sainsbury's today, I know that they, too, are embracing the concept.</p><p>Local food also supports our tourism industry, with Scotland becoming a destination of choice for discerning gourmets. David Whiteford and his team are helping to lead that charge, through EatScotland. I understand that food tourism as an industry now brings almost &#163;1 billion a year into our economy and is a growing market, although sadly not enough of it is based on local produce. The good work of Walter Spiers and the Scottish Shellfish Marketing Group is an example of best practice, through co-operation and seizing the initiative. The Mussel Inn restaurants in Glasgow and Edinburgh are now supplying prime Scottish seafood to the discerning, who would normally have to go to Spain or the south of France to sample Scotland's finest seafood.</p><p>The Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society deserves both a mention and increased support for the work that it does in spawning rural co-operative development. I must also mention the growing importance of farmers markets and farm shops&#8212;supported by SAOS&#8212;which are the very embodiment of the local food concept and have done so much to raise local food up the political agenda. I hope that representatives of the farmers markets will visit us again in Parliament in September, during Scottish food fortnight.</p><p>Consumption of local food is also good for our environment, as it reduces our carbon footprint. As other members have pointed out, we must take note of that issue, which relates to sustainability, <place-holder colnum=\"1111\"/> when contemplating the future of public procurement contracts.</p><p>The Scottish diet action plan suggests that consumption of more local, less processed, fresher food is likely to lead to a healthier population. With childhood obesity such a concern in clinicians' minds at the moment, the Government must look to local food to provide some of the solutions in the public health area.</p><p>Jim Hume mentioned the East Ayrshire schools project&#8212;I know that similar schemes are being considered in Perth and Kinross. Perhaps they should now be rolled out across the country.</p><p>All the above ideas chime with the NFUS's campaign to promote local food, and I welcome its initiative on misleading labelling of food, which highlights a major concern that we all share. I know that the minister heard all about the practice today, and I am certain that he shares my view that it must stop. If he can achieve greater clarity of labelling, particularly with regard to country of origin, he will have the support of producers and consumers alike. As well as giving consumers a real choice, such a move will give Scotland's food the chance to be promoted as such.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this worthwhile debate. I intend to return to the Royal Highland show tomorrow and urge any member who has not been before to visit it either tomorrow or over the weekend and experience for themselves the optimism about and enthusiasm for the idea of local food. They will see some of Scotland's finest livestock&#8212;much of it is of world-class quality and is a tribute to Scotland's breeders and stockmen.

I welcome today's debate because it gives each party the opportunity to tell Government its priorities in the debate about climate change, energy, transport and the use and care of the rural and marine environments. What makes the debate important and gives it a sense of urgency is undoubtedly climate change, which is one of the most compelling reasons for reconsideration of policy and changes in policy direction.</p><p>The minister outlined his proposals and the need for a climate change bill. The Scottish Conservatives would welcome such legislation in the Scottish Parliament as well as at Westminster, and although we appreciate that the separation of powers in respect of climate change between Westminster and Holyrood will be complex, given the interplay of reserved and devolved issues, that is not a reason for not making a start. Perhaps the sooner we get started, the better. I welcome the announcement of the minister's intention to make early progress with a bill.</p><p>We would also support in principle the creation of a coastal and marine national park, provided that it was appropriately sited and implemented only after proper consultation of local people. Such <place-holder colnum=\"651\"/> a park will only work if local communities want it to succeed and if they can see benefits from it&#8212;community buy-in is essential. I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary could tell us what stage he is at with that proposal.</p><p>We would also like to see the extension of a scheme to boost the microrenewables sector and to incentivise householders, communities and small businesses to install energy creating and saving technologies. Will the cabinet secretary tell us what progress the SNP is making on its similar proposals? I welcome his comments about creating public sector environmental efficiencies.</p><p>It is essential that we reduce our carbon footprint. If we accept that as a key parameter, our policies will flow naturally from that position. We would have encouraged the development of carbon capture and storage at the Miller oil field off Peterhead, and we deplore the Labour Government's lack of leadership and direction in failing to grasp a unique opportunity to give Scotland and the United Kingdom a world lead in the technology through the proposals of BP and Scottish and Southern Energy. Although I know that Scottish and Southern Energy took the decision to withdraw from the scheme on economic grounds, I urge the First Minister, if it is within his power, and even at this late stage, to do all that he can to resurrect the project.</p><p>Sustainable, secure energy supplies that deliver adequate base-load capacity are essential, but they must be delivered economically. Although we support wind farms in principle, we believe that a moratorium should be placed on their development until the renewables obligation certificate scheme has been reviewed and a national location strategy for siting wind farms has been developed.</p><p>Wave and tidal energy will be vital and must be developed in the future, as must clean-coal technology. We will support anything that the Government does in that regard. Biomass, too, has a future if the economics can be made to stack up. Also, if the Westminster Government were to decide to replace existing nuclear power stations in Scotland on a new-for-old basis, we would not oppose that.</p><p>Energy savings and efficiencies in the home must be encouraged because UK electricity demand is rising by 2.1 per cent a year and 25 per cent of our carbon emissions are generated in the home. Every man, woman, boy and girl in Scotland can help to reduce our carbon footprint. We support awareness-raising campaigns to show how individuals can help in their own way. I welcome the minister's comments today on the voluntary sector.<place-holder colnum=\"652\"/></p><p>I turn to transport. There is a case for investigating the costs and environmental impacts of high-speed rail links between Glasgow and Edinburgh and between Scotland and London. More frequent modern rail links&#8212;such as a 20-minute service between Ayr in my constituency and Glasgow&#8212;would encourage people on to trains and reduce traffic congestion in Glasgow, especially on the Kingston bridge. Support for Stagecoach and other bus operators in their drive for better, quicker and cleaner travel by coach is essential if we are to reduce congestion, particularly by encouraging local authorities to find appropriate spaces for park-and-ride facilities in and around town centres.</p><p>I turn briefly to our rural and marine environment. Again, our objective in delivering a greener Scotland should be to reduce, where possible, our carbon footprint. Local farm food and local fish and shellfish should be supplied locally, which would reduce food miles. I welcome the NFU Scotland campaign&#8212;what's on your plate?&#8212;which was launched today and supports the call for people to buy local and eat local. Movement of shellfish around the world and back is not sustainable in the long term, in the same way that importation of beef of doubtful provenance from Brazil makes no sense. The alleged lack of traceability, the alleged illegal use of hormones and the potential for bringing foot and mouth disease into Scotland begs the question, why is the European Union not doing more to provide EU and UK farmers in respect of the level playing field that they deserve in supplying food to consumers, who believe that all that they find on supermarket shelves is produced to EU standards of traceability and welfare? I would welcome any comments that the minister feels able to make on that difficult subject. In short, if we are to support our farming industries, we must develop country-of-origin labelling, with the food production standard of each country clearly documented, and with greater transparency about the provenance of the food on our supermarket shelves.</p><p>Our fishermen, too, deserve a better deal than they have had in the past. The Scottish Conservatives want more national, regional and local control over fisheries.</p><p>Finally, I offer a word on waste. Even greater efforts must be made to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill. I welcome the positive start that the previous Administration made, but it is essential that we work harder and faster to reduce the 1.7 million tons of biodegradable waste that go to landfill every year.</p><p>I have outlined some of the Conservative party ideas that we will press to have delivered in this session. We believe that those ideas will create a <place-holder colnum=\"653\"/> cleaner and greener Scotland.

In a nutshell, we want to maintain and develop rural Scotland's primary industries, including farming, fishing, forestry and tourism, as they have historically been the main drivers of our rural economy and will remain so in future. We want to encourage new entrants into farming and create a one-stop shop to bring new blood into the industry. We share that manifesto commitment with the SNP and therefore welcome the minister's announcement on that. We want to relax planning guidelines in rural areas and support farmers, particularly through co-operation, to become price makers rather than price takers. We want to strengthen the supermarket code of conduct and introduce meaningful labelling, particularly to identify home-produced Scottish food. We want more national, regional and local control over fishing and, above all, we need to reduce the <place-holder colnum=\"259\"/> burden of red tape in all those industries&#8212;if we can.</p><p>In addition, we must further develop the delivery of local food to schools&#8212;as happens in East Ayrshire and Perthshire&#8212;hospitals and prisons. That would deliver health benefits, environmental benefits&#8212;by reducing our carbon footprint&#8212;and benefits to our local food producers.</p><p>The main subject under discussion today is funding for Scotland's rural development programme, and I acknowledge the way in which Richard Lochhead has approached the future funding of the programme, even if I share Rhona Brankin's disappointment that he was unable to produce the draft programme until 8.45 this morning. Although it may be the minister's first major decision on the future of Scottish agriculture, it is probably the most important one that he will make for many years to come&#8212;that is, assuming that he keeps the job for several years.</p><p>I will take a minute to set the scene from an historical perspective. Rural development programmes were first introduced by the EU in an attempt to start to deliver multiple benefits from land-based industries other than by encouraging food production. However, those pillar 2 schemes have regrettably been underfunded in the UK, and modulation was introduced to top-slice money from direct farm support to make up the funding gap in rural development measures. In other words, money was initially taken from farmers' headage and arable aid payments to make up the shortfall in funding caused by Government parsimony, thereby immediately putting Scottish and UK farmers at a competitive disadvantage with EU farmers. First, 5 per cent compulsory modulation was introduced. Thereafter, because funding did not match Government plans and ambitions, a further option of voluntary modulation was introduced, which is set this year at 5 per cent.</p><p>Currently, we have a total of a 10 per cent reduction in support for Scottish farmers through modulation. However, the minister has decided to increase modulation, and he will have borne in mind the fact that the more he increases the level of voluntary modulation, the more he reduces the profitability of Scottish farmers. Indeed, the NFUS has calculated that every 5 per cent increase in modulation reduces net farm incomes by 20 per cent and, with net farm income averaging only &#163;10,100 in 2005-06, there is a real danger that the most likely effect of significant increases in voluntary modulation will be to put farmers' businesses under further threat.</p><p>According to the Government's figures, 6,000 people have left full-time employment in farming in Scotland since 1999 and one dairy farmer in four has gone out of business in the past four years. <place-holder colnum=\"260\"/></p><p>Farming is not an industry in robust financial health, but it appears that, in the face of that evidence, the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department argued for a 16 per cent rate of voluntary modulation, which could have been disastrous and would have reduced farm income by a further 44 per cent to just over &#163;5,600. That would not have been sustainable.</p><p>Today's announcement, however, will bring about an increase of, effectively, 5 per cent in voluntary modulation, which will reduce net farm incomes by 20 per cent, bringing them down to just over &#163;8,000. That is still too great an increase in voluntary modulation.</p><p>We all want to have a thriving, beautiful, dynamic, environmentally enhanced countryside; we all want to give ramblers the right to roam and wildlife enthusiasts the opportunity to observe the species of their choice; and we all want to support our growing tourism industry. The findings of the two public consultations on Scotland's rural development programme emphasise those demands and the need to consider ways of rolling out and developing the existing plans.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383803", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Development Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and a member of NFU Scotland.

However, today, Richard Lochhead has set voluntary modulation at levels that, although they are not as high as the ones that were trailed, are still too high. In reality, from 2014, modulation levels will be 14 per cent. Further, as I understand it, Herr Fischler intends to increase compulsory modulation by another 1 per cent, which means that the level of modulation in 2010, 2011 and 2012 will be 15 per cent, which will reduce farm incomes significantly.

Conservatives feel that more could and should be done, particularly for small businesses in Scotland, to reduce the red tape in the process and to give them greater ability to tender for contracts. Donald Gorrie noted that too.</p><p>The McClelland report noted the well-intentioned Executive progress in public procurement, including the e-procurement Scotland service, but concluded that collaboration within organisations and across sectors had not been completely effective and had to improve. Patrick Harvie, George Lyon, Richard Lochhead and Murdo Fraser all referred to that. Nowhere is that more true than in public food procurement.</p><p>Going back to May 2004, Andy Kerr announced the sustainable food and catering procurement guidelines at the \"Delivering Change\" conference. The guidelines essentially instruct public purchasers, including schools, hospitals and prisons, to buy fresh, seasonal, quality-assured produce when negotiating for catering contracts.</p><p>In Shiona Baird's debate on supporting local producers on 4 May 2005, I raised public food procurement and the minister Lewis Macdonald responded positively. He highlighted research that the Government appeared to accept would help to break down barriers to local food procurement but, sadly, nothing much has happened since then, <place-holder colnum=\"31676\"/> notwithstanding George Lyon's claims and Christine May's peninsula of excellence. I say to the minister that guidance is not delivering as well as it could.</p><p>In June 2006, the Environment and Rural Development Committee emphasised in its report on the food supply chain the need for the Executive to provide more encouragement in the area. Robin Harper referred to that. However, progress has been glacial. In autumn 2006, I raised local food procurement through motion S2M-4590 at a members' business debate. The motion was supported by 35 members throughout the chamber, who acknowledged that farmers markets are just the starting point in local food procurement.</p><p>Consensus exists in the Parliament to do something, as the minister acknowledged. There is consensus that local food procurement for local people must happen as it does in the East Ayrshire project. I hope that today's debate will bring that a stage nearer, as Richard Baker reflected. A way needs to be found to bring suppliers and purchasers together for the benefit of consumers and producers alike. One way to achieve that lies in proposals that have been lodged by the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society with the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</p><p>The minister knows that I had extensive discussions with SEERAD staff on how to enhance food networks to match up businesses of all sizes with the demands of different consumers. In addition, the cross-party group on food produced a paper on local food procurement, particularly through local food co-operatives. That model could be adopted and expanded into a national procurement network that supplies many more customers.</p><p>If we are really serious about local food procurement, centralised warehousing and distribution systems will be required in the long term with suitable transport capability. That should progress on a co-operative basis, using the SAOS as an adviser, because it has the established expertise to deliver such a national scheme. Christine May apparently supported that.</p><p>Local food procurement is an idea whose time has come&#8212;indeed, it came some time ago.

about the need to stop hospital closures. I regret that an opportunity has been missed by the Scottish Executive to take the Kerr report and develop its ideas into a flexible blueprint for the delivery of health care in this country.</p><p>As members would expect, I will address NHS Ayrshire and Arran's decision, which was endorsed by the minister, to close the accident and emergency department at Ayr hospital. My colleague Margaret Mitchell will debate the issues surrounding Monklands hospital and Wishaw general hospital, and Bill Aitken will debate the issues of the Glasgow hospitals.</p><p>I thank the minister for contacting me on the day on which he announced his decision to close the A and E unit at Ayr to explain his reasons; I very much appreciated that courtesy.</p><p>Although I acknowledge that there is much in the Kerr report with which I and my party agree, that does not mean that we accept it in its entirety or every decision made in its name. Indeed, given Scotland's population, one could not reasonably argue against the inevitable focus of a measure of specialisation in our major cities. Although I would prefer all services to be delivered locally if there is no time-critical element to their delivery, it makes sense in the west of Scotland to deal with heart problems at Clydebank, head injuries at the Southern general and cancer care at the Beatson oncology centre.</p><p>The trade-off for me and my constituents is that time-critical accident and emergency care should be delivered locally. This is where, regrettably, the minister and NHS Ayrshire and Arran part company with me and my constituents. It would not be unreasonable to ask why there is so much disagreement about the changes after so much consultation. There is disagreement because NHS Ayrshire and Arran has not made the case convincingly that its proposals to centralise A and E care for Ayrshire at Crosshouse hospital will be an improvement. It is entirely correct that communities and politicians question such fundamental and far-reaching proposals, and it is important that those who make the case for change convince service users that the proposed changes will be for the better.<place-holder colnum=\"30956\"/></p><p>That has not happened in this case. Neither NHS Ayrshire and Arran nor the minister has made a compelling case for the proposed closure of the A and E unit at Ayr hospital. The consultation simply emphasised the existing problems with A and E provision in Ayrshire without offering adequate solutions to the new problems that the proposals will create.</p><p>I say to the minister quite simply that we need two A and E units in Ayrshire, notwithstanding the Kerr report or the views of Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board.</p><p>It is a matter of capacity. Since the new year, I have been informed by local health professionals that demand for A and E services has exceeded capacity in Ayrshire hospitals. As recently as Monday night, I heard that, despite the best efforts of hospital staff, around 20 people were lying on trolleys at Crosshouse, waiting for beds to empty so that they could be admitted to the hospital through the A and E unit. On Tuesday night, 135 people were admitted to Crosshouse through the A and E unit between 8 pm and 2 am, while on Tuesday 2 January, the A and E unit at Crosshouse was completely closed, even to ambulance admissions, because of its inability to cope with demand.</p><p>Currently, 16,000 people a year are admitted to Ayr hospital following presentation at the A and E unit at Ayr. In future, all those people will need to be accommodated at Crosshouse, which cannot cope with current demand. More than 300 people a week will need to travel the extra 18 miles to Crosshouse from Ayr to find a hospital bed, and some of those people will be in a life-threatening state. Consultants at Ayr hospital have warned that lives will be lost. Ambulance provision for the task is currently inadequate and I have grave concerns that it will remain inadequate in the future. There are insufficient numbers of paramedics to meet current demand, never mind the extra and longer journeys that are envisaged.</p><p>Journey times to Crosshouse for visitors from the southern part of Ayrshire are horrific. Having spent a significant part of the Christmas recess taking my blind father from Ballantrae to visit my mother in Crosshouse, I can tell the minister and colleagues that the 100-mile round trip is not enjoyable for the able-bodied&#8212;by car&#8212;never mind the disabled, many of whom are restricted to the use of public transport because of their disability or age.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13375835", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Accident and Emergency Units"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with real regret that I speak in today's debate about the need to stop hospital closures.

I also welcome the report's recommendations, which will greatly assist the corporate body in its governance arrangements with the office-holders. We welcome today's debate, as it gives us an opportunity to inform the Parliament of what we are doing and thinking in respect of the report. The SPCB will deal in an open and transparent way with office-holders in future.</p><p>First, I take the opportunity to assure Parliament that the SPCB is committed to working effectively with office-holders to ensure that they provide a quality, functionally independent service to the public, underpinned by value-for-money principles, which are of prime concern to the public and to Parliament, as the minister and Mark Ballard said.</p><p>We will also work to ensure that the office-holders, working with parliamentary committees, have the opportunity to input into the development of legislation and, where appropriate, the improvement of legislation, based on the work that they do. I will explain that a little further. Hand in hand with that, and based on the recommendations of the Procedures Committee, which have been endorsed by the Finance Committee report that we are discussing today, we are also introducing an independent annual appraisal mechanism for office-holders. Those appraisals will not only feed into the reappointment process, but will also provide a further opportunity for discussions between the SPCB and the office-holders on any issues arising from the appraiser's report. We consider that such scrutiny will add value to the governance of office-holders and will give reassurance, particularly to Andrew Arbuckle, who raised that point.</p><p>The Finance Committee has recommended scrutiny of office-holders from the various parliamentary committees, and we whole-<place-holder colnum=\"30610\"/> heartedly endorse that proposal. I am aware that many committees already discuss with office-holders various issues within their subject remit. Indeed, the Education Committee took evidence from Kathleen Marshall only last week, and the ombudsman has also given evidence to committees. The scrutiny of office-holders' annual reports can bring into a debating forum various trends that the office-holders may consider to be of concern and which committees may wish to examine. Ultimately, that has the potential to inform proposals for legislative change&#8212;again, adding value to the process. That is something that John Swinney referred to.</p><p>Having established those offices, the Parliament has a duty to the public to ensure not only that they provide a good service to the public, but that they add value by suggesting improvements to how the public sector operates.

We can monitor and discuss such matters more regularly with office-holders.</p><p>We have made considerable progress on a number of governance issues. For some time, we have encouraged office-holders to establish audit committees to assist and advise them on governance and budgetary issues and we have made available to office-holders access to the independent members of the SPCB's audit advisory board. We also agreed with each office-holder a memorandum of understanding on access to the central contingency fund, which is held by the SPCB and can meet exceptional expenditure.

Of course, that will cost money, and my colleagues have dealt with the funding of the scheme. However, the proposal is a direct response to the failure of Government to provide adequately for our pensioners, which, despite the promises of the Labour-Liberal coalition, it is becoming clearer by the day that they have no real intention of doing.</p><p>It therefore falls to the Conservatives to come up with real solutions to help our elderly people. Nowhere are those solutions more required than in my own area of South Ayrshire, which has a significantly greater number of older people than the national average.</p><p>With larger-than-average numbers of elderly in our local population, the fact that pension funds are unable to reclaim tax on dividends&#8212;costing those funds &#163;5 billion annually since Gordon Brown introduced the measure&#8212;hits harder in South Ayrshire than elsewhere in Scotland. The fact that council tax benefits are so difficult to claim, with low uptake among the elderly&#8212;to which John Swinney, I think, referred&#8212;hits harder in South Ayrshire than elsewhere in Scotland. The fact that the number of pensioner households that spend more than 10 per cent of their gross income on council tax bills rose by 37.5 per cent between 2000 and 2005 hits harder in South Ayrshire than elsewhere in Scotland. The fact that the cost of living for pensioners is rising 50 per cent faster than the Government inflation figure hits harder in South Ayrshire.</p><p>I could go on and give further examples of how Government policy is failing our elderly, but I would like to highlight the Executive's underfunding of free personal care in South Ayrshire. Specifically, and most quantifiably, when free personal care was introduced, the Executive provided funding for 233 people in care homes, but South Ayrshire Council had to fund 283 clients. The funding has now been increased to provide for 276 clients, which is still below what the figure was on the very day that the scheme started. However, South Ayrshire Council has this year been required to fund 358 care home places at a cost of &#163;895,000 to the local council tax payer, who has had to fund the gap between the budget provided by the Executive and that which is needed to deliver the policy as it was intended. In addition, there is a list of 17 clients awaiting placements in care homes.</p><p>That issue has been raised with the Executive since day 1 of the scheme because of South Ayrshire's demographics, but nothing has been done. South Ayrshire Council raised the issue through COSLA, and Pat Watters has taken up the case. It is a prima facie case of long-term direct <place-holder colnum=\"28236\"/> underfunding of the scheme that penalises not just the pensioners of South Ayrshire but local council tax payers, many of whom are elderly themselves, as I have already outlined.</p><p>Further, the number of home care hours that are provided each week has increased from 7,172 when the free personal care policy started to 12,419 at the end of 2005-06. Although we cannot quantify how much of that increase is due to the introduction of free personal care, it is clear that the increased cost of home-based care packages has been huge.</p><p>Furthermore, prior to the introduction of free personal care, the service that South Ayrshire Council provided comprised 80 per cent personal care and 20 per cent non-personal care. That is still the case but, since the introduction of free personal care, South Ayrshire Council has lost the ability to charge for the 80 per cent of care for which it would previously have charged. Because of a Scotland-wide misallocation of free personal care funding that took no account of the age profile of the different local authorities, South Ayrshire Council, which was originally in the forefront of providing care for the elderly, has been penalised by the inflexibility of a scheme that assumed a much lower split of chargeable care.</p><p>The minister can see the problem but, as I am sure he is aware, the problem does not stop there. Infrastructure costs have also increased markedly, due to the need to allocate a caseworker to self-funding clients, whose needs must be regularly reviewed. Like other hard-pressed councils, South Ayrshire Council has appointed reviewing officers from outwith the free personal care allocation to allow all possible funding to be used for the provision of free personal care. Generally, ministers have claimed that free personal care is fully funded across Scotland, including in South Ayrshire&#8212;such claims have been made specifically to me whenever I have raised the matter in the Parliament&#8212;but that is far from being the case. In South Ayrshire, the underfunding of the social work budget is &#163;2.36 million for this year alone. In large part, that is due to the inadequate funding of free personal care. For South Ayrshire Council, the cumulative cost over the past five years of providing for self-funding clients in care homes is &#163;3.664 million over and above the grant-aided expenditure allocation. That cost has had to be funded by South Ayrshire's council tax payers.</p><p>The specifics of the situation in South Ayrshire illustrate why the Health Committee took the view that a full review of each local authority's position is required to justify either an across-the-board increase in funding or a reallocation of existing funding on a more equitable basis among local authorities. A mechanism should be developed to predict the long-term levels of financing that will be <place-holder colnum=\"28237\"/> required to provide free personal care in each local authority. Such financing must, at the very least, be linked to inflation. Adequately funding free personal care would also reduce bedblocking throughout Scotland. That would be a much more humane and cost-effective way of looking after the 1,200 or so of our elderly who are languishing in hospital when they could and should be looked after elsewhere.</p><p>The problem has been building up over many years. It has been highlighted to the Scottish Executive on numerous occasions but, regrettably, no action has resulted. Further delays and underfunding are no longer acceptable. It is time for action to give our elderly people the standard of care to which they are entitled.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368423", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Senior Citizens"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, it will come as no surprise to you or to the minister that I   congratulate our leader Annabel Goldie on her bold initiative to cut annually council tax for pensioners by 50 per cent across Scotland.

I thank the members who have taken the time to attend the debate and the 38 members who supported the motion on the <em>Farmers Weekly</em> local food is miles better campaign. It is appropriate to debate the motion as we approach the end of what has been a hugely successful Scottish food fortnight. The Scottish Countryside Alliance Educational Trust is to be warmly congratulated on its fortnight's work, which has involved a huge number of events in the Parliament and elsewhere, all of which were designed to raise the profile of Scottish food.</p><p>The farmers market event in the garden lobby last week brought to the Parliament a flavour of what is possible when local producers combine to take their product to an event, creating a memorable experience. In conjunction with the farmers market accreditation event that Christine Grahame hosted last night, the event demonstrated that local food production for local people is now a significant and growing market.</p><p>The reasons for that are plain to see. First, local food is better because it is fresher and has higher vitamin levels as a result. Local food is often less processed, so it is less likely to have high salt and fat levels and is healthier as a result. Local food is also more sustainable, in that it has travelled less distance from farm gate to plate, which is increasingly important in a world that is becoming more environmentally conscious by the day. Shipping fruit and vegetables halfway round the world does not make environmental sense when they could be grown in Scotland or the rest of the <place-holder colnum=\"27620\"/> United Kingdom, if not in the open air, then certainly under polythene. Indeed, the agriculture and rural development directorate-general in Brussels is looking into research that suggests that fruit and vegetables grown under polythene near to metropolitan areas across Europe will be one of the next significant developmental areas, as sophisticated consumers demand fresh, local and sustainably grown fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Interestingly, research carried out for WWF by the Stockholm Environment Institute concluded that buying British food could reduce the ecological footprint by up to 54 per cent compared with a diet based on imported food. When one considers that food miles pump approximately 20 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere annually in the United Kingdom, accounting for 1.8 per cent of the total UK carbon dioxide emissions, one can really see the benefits of buying local food, and the more local it is, the better.</p><p>Local food sold at farmers markets and farm shops is also providing an enhanced tourist experience for people from all over the world. That is important as we seek to attract more tourists to rural Scotland. EatScotland, ably chaired by David Whiteford, is also helping to develop Scotland as a gourmet eating destination, much of which is based on local food.</p><p>Some of the bricks that we can build on are already in place, but we have to march on more quickly. We have to make our healthier local food more available to local children, as has been successfully piloted in East Ayrshire. Local food must also be made more available through the further development of food co-operatives in high deprivation areas, and the cross-party group on food is already looking into that.</p><p>Networks must be put in place and contracts negotiated to make local food more available to help improve our national diet, for example in our hospitals, schools and prisons. Our Parliament must start using and showcasing Scottish food, demonstrating our belief in Scottish food to the many visitors to our building. Local food should also be labelled as such, perhaps with information on the food miles travelled shown on the label.</p><p>Scottish food should be marketed as an eating experience. Indeed, Microsoft vice-president, Bob McDowell, highlighted that as a unique Scottish opportunity when he addressed the cross-party group on the Scottish economy earlier this year. Food tourism is already worth more than &#163;900 million to Scotland's tourism industry, a figure that could increase significantly given encouragement. Perhaps that is something that the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Patricia Ferguson, might want to consider as the homecoming in 2009 approaches.<place-holder colnum=\"27621\"/></p><p>Local food is perhaps the fastest-growing part of the food retail market, and a huge opportunity exists to develop it further with benefits to our health, environment and economy. We must seize that opportunity with both hands. It is potentially a huge win-win situation for health, the environment and the economy, but Government departments must start talking to one another in a more joined-up way.</p><p>The Scottish food and health council appears to have the right idea, but all Government agencies must start acting together to realise the potential of local food, as the total benefit to Scotland could be so much greater than the sum of the parts.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367063", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Food is Miles Better Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, as a farmer and the president of the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets.

When the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 was passed, the SPCB determined that three part-time deputy ombudsmen should be appointed to assist the ombudsman and that their initial appointment should be for four years. Their initial role was to assist the ombudsman with the merger of the former ombudsmen's offices into a new one-stop shop for handling complaints about public services in Scotland. They were appointed for their knowledge and expertise in particular sectors covered by the ombudsman's office.</p><p>As the deputies' role is to assist the ombudsman, in considering the deputies for reappointment we considered it prudent to seek the ombudsman's views on whether having three part-time deputies to support her continued to be appropriate. We accepted the ombudsman's view that, although the existing structure had worked well during the transition to a one-stop shop, having four Crown appointees in a relatively small office appeared to be disproportionate and that a better model would be for the ombudsman to be supported by salaried employees in senior posts, which would provide the necessary flexibility for the office to respond to changing circumstances and demands. We therefore determined that the deputies' reappointment should be for 12 months from 30 September 2006.</p><p>The deputies were considered for reappointment by a selection panel made up of SPCB members. The Presiding Officer chaired the panel. The other members were Kenny MacAskill, Duncan McNeil and me. An independent assessor was appointed to oversee the process. I am pleased to say that the assessor, Dr Bernard Kingston, has provided a validation certificate to confirm that the process conformed to good practice and that the deputy ombudsmen are being nominated on merit. On behalf of the SPCB, I thank Dr Bernard Kingston. <place-holder colnum=\"27402\"/></p><p>He brought a wealth of appointment experience and was of enormous assistance to us in ensuring that we complied with good practice and that the process was both robust and fair.</p><p>I believe that the deputy ombudsmen will continue to be committed and effective in their support of the ombudsman in the next 12 months, in what will undoubtedly be a challenging transitional year for the office.

The House of Lords report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe that the construction of new reservoirs, and the enlargement of existing ones, for the purposes of public water supply are likely to be necessary in order to meet long-term water demand.\"</p><p>I believe that we in Scotland must also take note of that recommendation. We need to start looking again at creating new reservoirs in Scotland.</p><p>In addition, we need to use such stored water as an energy resource with a view to having schemes that offer a combined energy and water supply solution. Apart from the benefit of using increased hydro-electric power to provide a stable carbon-free energy source, we can play our part in securing water supplies in the UK and worldwide context.</p><p>Although a national water grid is perhaps not currently feasible, I believe that a spot market in water will emerge in the near future. As water becomes scarcer and even more valuable, such a market would enable boatloads of water to be delivered worldwide.</p><p>In spatial planning terms, we should note the climate change predictions that suggest that the north and west of Scotland will be the only areas of the UK where annual rainfall will be maintained, or even increased. I believe that, as of now, we should be looking at river basin management plans for the north and west of Scotland, with a view to developing increased water storage capacity.</p><p>In renewable energy terms, most people acknowledge that onshore wind farming, quite apart from its problems of back-up and intermittency, is on the verge of being over-developed as a sustainable resource. That is particularly the case as we seek to develop our tourism industry. At the moment, Government gives excessive support to wind farming through the renewables obligation certificates. A change of emphasis is required; Government needs to invest <place-holder colnum=\"26567\"/> more in other reliable energy sources, of which combined energy and water schemes could be a part.</p><p>Of course, problems will need to be overcome in terms of finding sites where energy can be extracted from water and sites that are close enough to coastlines to allow the piping of water from shore to ship. There will also be problems in changing existing legislation and in providing connections to the grid. However, I believe that the proposal is worthy of Government investigation and support in terms of helping to resolve in a sustainable way the security of water and energy supplies. Given that Scottish Water's investment plans are already all but stretched to breaking point, the proposal offers a development opportunity for the private sector. Certainly, if one of the diversified utility companies were to invest in such a project in the north and west of Scotland, perhaps to supplement its own dwindling resources, it would do so in the knowledge that Government-funded and cash-strapped Scottish Water would be unable and unlikely to compete with it in the foreseeable future. The private sector would have no competition in this emerging combined energy and water niche market.</p><p>A feasibility study could be carried out to evaluate such a project and to make certain that the economics stack up; a pilot scheme could also be developed. Much work would need to be done before the proposal would be brought to fruition and the support and political will of the Executive would be required. However, I believe that combined energy and water projects could benefit Scotland economically and socially. In addition, they could also support areas of the UK and elsewhere in the world that are less well-off than Scotland is in terms of the already scarce commodity that is water.</p><p>I welcome the debate today and the Executive's commitment to addressing the problems of climate change and carbon emissions. I hope that my proposal for a new and different way of resolving some of the problems that we face in this regard provides further food for thought.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If Mark Ruskell will forgive me, I would rather not give way as I have a lot to get through.

Those are issues of concern in Ayrshire.</p><p>It is important that the bill simplifies matters. I hope that that criterion will be applied wherever possible throughout its passage through Parliament.</p><p>I welcome and echo the views of Professor Greg Lloyd: people currently get involved in the planning process only when it appears to affect them and their interests adversely. To overcome that weakness, we will need to front load the process, as the bill proposes. I believe that to be key.</p><p>Community councils, tenants and residents groups, local church groups and so on should all be made aware of and given the opportunity to comment on proposals at the earliest opportunity. Community buy-in is important at any stage, but an ability to help formulate strategic priorities early in the process is vital. For that reason, I welcome pre-application consultation on certain types of development, as is outlined in the bill. I would also welcome predetermination hearings, which would statutorily oblige planning authorities to hold a hearing into certain types of application. Those proposals, taken in conjunction, should be beneficial to those involved.</p><p>Of course, such measures assume that communities will want to be involved in the process. That might be problematic but, through time, local communities&#8212;perhaps following educational planning seminars or, more probably, bitter experience&#8212;will become aware of the value of early consultation. Early and proactive input has to be of greater value to the process and the communities themselves than an end-of-process reactive input.<place-holder colnum=\"25691\"/></p><p>However, as the Scottish Community Development Centre noted, communities will not become involved unless they can see a genuine purpose for their involvement and the prospect of concrete benefits in return for their investment of time and energy. In my view, that is the rub. If local authorities invite participation in the planning process, it has to be meaningful and taken note of thereafter. If communities' views are sought at an early stage, they must be taken note of. If they are not, the process will fail and the doubters of this bill will be shown to be correct.</p><p>How will a community council's views on, say, the local development plan be reconciled with the planning committee's perhaps different perspective some years later? That will take a great deal of sorting out. It will perhaps require the wisdom of Solomon, as Christine May said. The proposed process will have to be clearly defined in the planning advice notes and the subordinate legislation. A further problem with the additional consultation is the need for more planners, who are currently thin on the ground. They will be in huge demand if 70 per cent of local plans need updating at the starting point in the process.</p><p>My second point is that, in effect, planning decisions are being made by Scottish Water. I hope that the bill&#8212;or, more probably, the Government&#8212;can address that. Dave Petrie has alluded to the matter. It is all very well to have an all-singing, all-dancing, shiny, new local plan, but it will be of little or no use if Scottish Water cannot supply water and sewerage connections. Much-needed new housing must be built and connected to water and sewerage infrastructure in designated areas and Scottish Water, in whatever shape or form, must be able to do that.</p><p>The current development brake that has been imposed due to the underfunding of Scottish Water is a planning blight in itself. Scottish Water should be allowed to raise capital in the marketplace to meet the current unsatisfied demand for new infrastructure. However, that is perhaps a matter for another day and, indeed, another minister.</p><p>With those remarks, I wish the minister every success in taking the bill on to the statute book</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361873", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse the largely consensual approach to the bill that has been taken by all parties today, with the notable and entertaining exception of John Swinburne.

On 24 August 2005, the board of NHS Ayrshire and Arran voted by 20 votes to two to consult publicly on two models for the future delivery of accident and emergency services, both of which recommended the closure of the A and E unit at Ayr hospital. At that time, the board chose specifically to exclude from the public consultation a further proposed model, which in essence recommended the maintenance of the status quo of two A and E units&#8212;one at Ayr hospital and one at Crosshouse hospital&#8212;and the creation of community casualty units at Girvan, Cumnock and Irvine.</p><p>The effect of restricting public consultation to just two models was to narrow the choice to a pair of options, both of which were predicated on the closure of Ayr hospital's A and E unit and the centralisation of emergency and unscheduled care at Crosshouse hospital, near Kilmarnock. That was not a reasonable choice to give local people, and the approach was unworthy of being described as a consultation.</p><p>Since that decision was taken, 19 public meetings have been held throughout Ayrshire, at which an overwhelming majority of people have spoken in favour of the retention of a full A and E service at Ayr hospital. In addition, as part of the consultation process, some 58,000 local people <place-holder colnum=\"24904\"/> signed a petition that calls for the retention of the A and E units at Ayr and Crosshouse hospitals, and an estimated 5,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Ayr on 25 February against the proposal to close their local A and E unit.</p><p>Members may wonder why there is such local opposition to the proposal when it had the support of most, although not all, of NHS Ayrshire and Arran's board members, who claim that centralisation of accident and emergency services will lead to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"better, quicker, closer and safer\"</p><p>provision of emergency care. The simple answer is geography. Journey times by car or ambulance&#8212;after an ambulance arrives&#8212;from the south of the county can be up to an hour to Ayr hospital. Crosshouse hospital is 18 miles further north, which will add 25 minutes to what is already a long journey. We are all familiar with the concept of the golden hour. Accident and emergency consultants based in Ayr and local ambulance staff maintain that survival of a major accident or emergency is dependent on the time that is taken to reach hospital. Quite simply, the addition of nearly half an hour to the patient journey will cost lives. That is not my view, but that of the consultants, ambulance drivers and paramedics who run the service. I am inclined to take their professional advice on the matter. As one accident and emergency consultant observed during the consultation process, if outcomes are not time dependent, why bother to have a blue-light service at all?</p><p>That is the key question in the public's mind. The answer seems obvious: time and distance are critical factors. Therefore, notwithstanding the amended proposals that were tabled at yesterday's board meeting, a credible case has not been made for the closure of Ayr hospital's accident and emergency unit and the centralisation of the service at a single site at Crosshouse. The proposals will not deliver</p><p class=\"indent\">\"better, quicker, closer and safer\"</p><p>care to the 42,000 people a year who use the service at Ayr.</p><p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran carried out the review of emergency and unscheduled care in isolation from the review of elective care in Ayrshire, when the two should have been carried out in tandem. For that reason, the process is further flawed. The board now accepts that point, which was made cogently by Sandra Osborne MP at a public meeting in Girvan on 25 November last year. To consider the matter strategically, if Ayr's accident and emergency unit closes, there will be no unit between Kilmarnock and Dumfries, which will leave many people in south-west Scotland much <place-holder colnum=\"24905\"/> further from their nearest accident and emergency service than they are at present.</p><p>I am not against changes to the delivery of health care in my area simply for the sake of it or as a knee-jerk reaction to an unpopular proposal. I appreciate the need for change to improve service delivery and I see the logic in centralising some specialist services. However, I do not accept that the same principle should be extended to the provision of accident and emergency services&#8212;that should certainly not happen in the case that is under consideration in Ayrshire. That is why I welcome NHS Ayrshire and Arran's decision yesterday to delay deciding on the matter until 4 October. However, I want to know that that is more than simply a six-month stay of execution for Ayr hospital's accident and emergency unit. The delay must herald the start of a review process that takes into consideration the enhanced status quo model that was excluded from the health board's public consultation and which would keep accident and emergency units at both Ayr and Crosshouse. The majority of local people clearly favour that option, which is the one that I have argued for from the outset and which has the support of local front-line health workers and parliamentary colleagues.</p><p>It is time for NHS Ayrshire and Arran to think again and to accept that its handling of the exercise has, regrettably, been little short of disastrous. Health board officials have claimed repeatedly that they have taken no decisions on the future of Ayr's accident and emergency unit. Whether or not that is the case could be debated endlessly, but what matters is that local people do not believe it to be true; they believe that the board has already taken a decision, as it consulted only on options that were based on the loss of Ayr's accident and emergency unit. Against that background, it is impossible to see how anyone can have confidence in the process unless the range of models is broadened. Most people in my constituency and thousands more in the rest of Ayrshire believe that NHS Ayrshire and Arran's consultation process was fatally flawed. Notwithstanding the assurances that no decisions have been taken, local residents feel that they are being force fed a predetermined position by the board. It is hard to see how that matches the required standard of genuine public engagement and consultation.</p><p>I hope that colleagues will join me in urging NHS Ayrshire and Arran to think again, to use the coming six months genuinely to re-examine all the options and to regain the public's trust, which I am afraid has been all but destroyed in the past nine months.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359946", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Emergency and Unscheduled Care (Ayrshire and Arran)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members who supported motion S2M-4008, in my name, on the future of emergency and unscheduled care in Ayrshire.

The price of fat cattle with market-ready beef has not returned to its 1995-96 levels in that time. I ask the minister what other industry in Scotland could survive in the face of constantly rising costs and regulation with incomes that are lower than they were 10 years ago. The answer is that no industry could and none has done so in that time. Regrettably, prices are not depressed only in the beef sector; dairy farmers are being forced from the industry in droves and sheep farming incomes are horrifically low. What is to be done?</p><p>First, the Government must note that, as a result of declining agricultural production, self-sufficiency in United Kingdom food production is now heading back to a level of 70 per cent, having peaked in 1984 at 82.6 per cent&#8212;I am sure that the minister is aware that it peaked at that level. That is making the country strategically vulnerable. Recently, we have seen what will happen to gas prices when the ability to produce our own gas runs out. I have huge concerns about the UK's declining ability to sustain the self-sufficiency in food production that there last was in the 1930s&#8212;I suspect that the minister is not quite old enough to remember that.<place-holder colnum=\"23930\"/></p><p>That said, I welcome in principle the Government's next steps strategy and its 22-point action plan. I accept that if all the action points were implemented, the industry would thrive and be prosperous. However, it is regrettable that many of the action points form little more than a well-intentioned wish list. Again, I ask the minister what is to be done. It is regrettable that the industry is slowly disintegrating, on his watch and before his eyes, and that he is apparently powerless to help significantly from the sidelines, notwithstanding the upbeat and optimistic tone of \"A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture: Next Steps\".</p><p>Before the minister makes a possibly good-natured intervention, it is only fair to say what should be done and to talk about what is already happening to some extent. First, farmers and landowners must take a critical look at the likely ability of their businesses to continue with declining incomes. Such evaluation needs to assess methodically all the unused attributes of the land, the geographical location, the family that is involved and the people who farm the land. Self-sufficiency&#8212;which is ever the expected way of life of the farming and rural communities&#8212;must increase while Governments casually reduce support. That means finding other sources of income to sustain businesses that are currently subsisting on an average net farm income of &#163;13,000 per holding.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13357566", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agriculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Ross Finnie.

Is he aware that net farm incomes are no higher today than they were 10 years ago?</p><p>Farmers markets, catering and, indeed, politics have helped me to diversify. Every family that is left in mainstream farming has a duty to future generations to see now where other income streams can be found. In these times of adversity, co-operation has a huge role to play in supporting people with entrepreneurial and business ideas, so that they can take them further, initially often in a part-time way, with neighbours and other like-minded people. Farmers markets are the best and most recent example of such co-operation. We now need to consider the next step in developing such markets. In Ayrshire, a farm shop has just been opened at Auchincruive. I understand that it is the first farm shop to be operated and run by a farmers market co-operative.</p><p>Although farmers markets have been a huge success, as yet they are only a small part of the answer. Each farming business must work out for itself, perhaps with the help of advisers, what the <place-holder colnum=\"23931\"/> critical path to sustainability will be. A different solution will be arrived at for each farming unit. Such solutions will range from direct selling, adding value locally and environmental enhancement to moving off the farm for part-time work. There is no point in my taking time to enumerate more of the possible opportunities, because they are infinite. However, it is important that the minister plays a role in facilitating the realisation of those ideas, which will need to be developed to allow future generations of farmers to survive.</p><p>At the same time, it is important that the unique skill set of farmers and farm workers is maintained, should the country again need to increase food production from its own resources. We must not lose that strategic capability, as we are currently in danger of doing because of the exodus of young people from the land and the aging profile of those who remain. In the meantime, Government must support unique and tailor-made diversification packages. I hope that the minister will consider putting further appropriate mechanisms and resources in place to do so. If the minister actively sells his willingness to help in that regard, farmers will respond positively. Active engagement in the process by farmers and Government is vital. The minister is uniquely placed to drive forward an enhanced diversification agenda, which is the best way of describing what I see as one of the critical paths to industry survival.</p><p>Local food procurement, which Maureen Macmillan discussed, needs to be developed further.

The date 20 March 1996 will be forever etched on my memory, when the catastrophic news was broken to the NFU at Ingliston and the full implications of the disaster became apparent. It was immediately evident that, despite the best advice and efforts of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee &#8212;the SEAC committee&#8212;and the Swan committee, no one saw the problem coming. Consequently, the Government had no plans in place because, until it was announced on 20 March 1996, the best scientific advice stated that there was no problem. Having no plans in place to deal with the threat to human or animal health and welfare was a nightmare. That is why the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill is to be welcomed.</p><p>It is essential that the lessons of the past 10 years are taken on board. In those 10 years, both human and bovine life has been tragically lost to E coli 0157:H7, foot-and-mouth disease has devastated the countryside and we are now on the cusp of an outbreak of avian flu. Without wanting to sound too downbeat, I know from bitter experience that in farming, where livestock are concerned, if it can go wrong, it will go wrong. The need for contingency planning is paramount. I urge the minister to ask poultry producers to put their birds indoors before it becomes too late for some unfortunate flock.</p><p>As Ted Brocklebank said, the Conservatives welcome the bill's general principles. However, much clarification will be needed at stage 2. Although I do not envy the Environment and Rural Development Committee its job, I wish it well in making the bill's provisions as exact and as tight <place-holder colnum=\"23471\"/> as possible for the subsequent avoidance of doubt. For example, as Alex Fergusson, Nora Radcliffe and Richard Lochhead said, supplementary slaughter powers must be defined on the face of the bill. I agree that, ultimately, such decisions must rest with the minister of the day, but the term \"if they think fit\", while perhaps intentionally loosely drafted, is not sufficient for those whose livestock and livelihoods depend on it. One does not expect a minister to be whimsical about such a situation, and I know that Ross Finnie would not be. However, the decision would need to be taken on the basis of best scientific advice. Consequently, in relation to such a life-and-death provision, that must be clearly stated on the face of the bill, especially since the bill also covers the mental welfare of animals. Given Sarah Boyack's apparent support for that position, it might be a point worth conceding, for a quiet life.</p><p>Alex Johnstone mentioned the provisions on vaccination, and Mark Ruskell endorsed them less than whole-heartedly. They need further thought. Guidance in that area will require constant upgrading.</p><p>I have already highlighted the need for contingency planning. I agree with the Environment and Rural Development Committee and the minister that the need for transparent and well-researched contingency plans has never been greater. The threat of importing foot-and-mouth disease from countries where it is endemic is both large and constant. The spread of bovine tuberculosis to Scotland is inevitable as Government in England fails to take appropriate action to halt its relentless spread north. That is why Scotland must plan to prevent its arrival.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer and member of the National Farmers Union.

I welcome the practical approach of excluding farm animals when what are regarded as the codes of <place-holder colnum=\"23472\"/> best practice are followed. Like Alex Fergusson, Mike Rumbles and John Farquhar Munro, I believe that that pragmatic, commonsense approach should also apply to working dogs.

They would be expected to tend that livestock, although they would not be able to own it.</p><p>I am certain that, as Ted Brocklebank noted, the concept of abandonment will give rise to much more heated discussion at stage 2.</p><p>I regret that the bill will abolish couping shoes for Clydesdale horses. I have spoken to people with a lifetime's experience of Clydesdales&#8212;farriers, owners and vets. The best veterinary advice in the country that I can access, which is at the highest level, indicates that the practice is cosmetic and is utterly harmless. Because Clydesdales are not performance animals, they do not move at speed and inflict no damage on themselves when they have couping shoes.</p><p>With the reservations that I have expressed, I welcome the bill.

As expected, <place-holder colnum=\"22535\"/> we heard the minister extol the virtues and benefits of the air route development fund. Perhaps surprisingly, the Conservatives largely agree with him. Of course, as Murdo Fraser and Fergus Ewing said, the fund must not be used improperly to undermine existing flights and routes or distort the air fares market. Murdo Fraser and David McLetchie pointed out that much of the current growth in air travel is the result of the deregulation of the air travel market in the 1980s and 1990s. However, as Phil Gallie noted, that is only part of the story.</p><p>Tavish Scott and Alasdair Morrison drew attention to the really significant point, which is that air traffic is growing worldwide. European low-cost airlines in particular, as Kenny MacAskill said, have identified an opportunity and have grown point-to-point air passenger travel enormously in Europe in the past five to 10 years, cutting out the need, in an environmentally helpful way, to use the London and European hubs. EasyJet and Ryanair have led the way in low-cost routes and their share prices demonstrate that that model is here to stay. Indeed, talk of an impending bid for easyJet by the FL Group emphasises the point that the conventional carriers are trying hard to get into the low-cost market.</p><p>One must view the route development fund in the context of the market capitalisations, annual turnover and profits of companies such as British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet. Of course, &#163;14.4 million from the route development fund over the next three years is important, but it is only an incentive for carriers perhaps to try out a new route. New routes, in turn, help to encourage overseas travel, which helps our businesses and businessmen and our tourism industry. That is particularly the case at Glasgow Prestwick airport in my constituency, to which Charlie Gordon referred when he spoke affectionately of Matthew Hudson, who developed the airport in the 1990s. Indeed, the ARDF has helped to establish eight of the Ryanair routes that operate from Prestwick. Another carrier, Wizz Air, announced this week that it, too, will operate from Prestwick, flying to three destinations in Poland.</p><p>The ARDF supports such routes, but the major beneficiary is perhaps our tourism industry. Prestwick is Scotland's fastest growing airport, with almost 2.4 million passengers a year passing through its doors. That passenger traffic gives tourism in Ayrshire and south-west Scotland a huge opportunity. The Ayrshire economy alone benefits by between &#163;13 million and &#163;18 million annually from that tourism trade. Scottish Enterprise has calculated that 700 jobs will be created Scotland-wide because of the ARDF and that the ARDF will generate &#163;300 million of inward investment over 10 years. Despite Mark Ruskell's comments, those two statistics suggest to me that <place-holder colnum=\"22536\"/> the modest &#163;14.4 million investment is worth while. Kenny MacAskill passionately noted that point, too.</p><p>An area in which route development funding has yet to be introduced is air freight, as Adam Ingram mentioned. I believe that that is an important area to be looked at. Indeed, I inform the minister that I put that suggestion to the First Minister nearly two years ago and I had hoped that funding for air freight might have been introduced by now. I understand that the Local Government and Transport Committee is carrying out a freight transport inquiry and I very much hope that it will examine the potential for increasing air freight using air route development funding. I state unashamedly that a fog-free Prestwick, with its 3000m runway and high-speed rail link, is the best-placed Scottish airport for the air freight market. I seriously hope that that possibility will be considered in the committee's inquiry. The fly in the ointment is, of course, the environmental costs, as Mark Ruskell pointed out, but the way to deal with that is through an international approach to carbon emissions.</p><p>I return to the use of the ARDF in developing Scotland's international connections through tourism&#8212;particularly golf tourism, which is potentially one of our biggest earners. That market is expanding hugely in Ayrshire because of inbound traffic from Scandinavia, particularly from Gothenburg, to which the minister alluded. Swedish golfers can leave home early, have a round of golf on one of our famous links courses on Scotland's riviera, have lunch, have another round of golf and return home the same evening. That market is burgeoning. Five years ago, no one would have considered that likely at all, but it has happened, due in part to the seed-corn funding of the ARDF. That golf market is just one example of a measurable, positive benefit from the ARDF&#8212;there are many more across Scotland. That is why we support the Executive's motion and ask the Parliament to support our reasonable amendment to it.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13353937", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Air Route Development Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate.

I support what Alex Johnstone has said and welcome what the minister said about regeneration and environmental justice. The Executive's aims are laudable and supportable, but one must ask whether they are being met, whether they are working and whether things are moving fast enough.</p><p>Essentially, the Scottish Conservatives seek to achieve not only a sustainable development strategy but a sustainable society. At the moment, that aim is not being achieved. Parts of society are certainly enjoying a better standard of living and a better, sustainable quality of life, but too many Scots, including too many of my constituents in Ayrshire, are not doing so. Scotland is still hugely divided by poverty and inequality and the gaps are widening rather than closing. That is happening nowhere more so than in Ayr. Life expectancy for men in north Ayr is six years less than it is for those who live on the south side of the River Ayr. That bald statistic says it all. As a short, fat and bald man who lives in north Ayr, the matter is close to my heart.</p><p>The problem that the Executive must address is highlighted if we consider the statistics more closely. Life expectancy is the end result of our society's success or failure in managing and producing acceptable outcomes for our constituents. That result is derived from a variety of social and environmental justice factors. The success or failure of our education policy, for example, can be judged from the fact that 13 per cent of our young people who are aged between 16 to 19 are not in education, employment or training. That situation is not sustainable. As the minister said, the cost to the Scottish economy each year as a result of energy wastage is &#163;1.3 billion. In a world that is ever-more energy conscious, such a situation is less sustainable by the day. The cost of energy loss from housing is similarly high.</p><p>I say to the minister that differential life expectancies, educational and employment disparities and energy loss are just a few examples that can be given. Many more examples are available that relate to transport, health, green spaces and diet. The crushing fact is that the bad end of the statistics always applies to the poorest and least well-off in our society. Poor housing impacts on my most deprived constituents. Poor transport affects them most in accessing hospital. The situation is about to get worse if our accident and emergency unit at Ayr hospital is lost. Poor <place-holder colnum=\"22188\"/> standards of academic achievement and high unemployment are worst in our social inclusion partnership or regeneration area. We are all familiar with the issues, but they are still not being resolved, despite the Government's best efforts.</p><p>I say to the minister that where we are at the moment with social and environmental justice in their broadest senses is not sustainable&#8212;Sarah Boyack alluded to that. We must do better. Diet is a vital factor for life expectancy and healthy, sustainable lifestyles and it is an area that we can address. My farming co-operative and food retailing experience and connections lead me to believe that we could do better in that area. Essentially, we must produce more local food for local people. Many raw ingredients for a balanced and healthy diet are available to us from our farms in Scotland, but the diet of our population is poor. That there are high levels of avoidable illness is a regrettable fact.</p><p>We must build on the vision for food procurement that Andy Kerr set out in May 2004 and encourage better eating habits and greater consumption of local food. We must create an agency or extend the role of existing bodies to create a Scottish network so that we get more local food to local people. In the public sector, local authorities, hospitals and prisons must use more Scottish food that is supplied by major Scottish companies. Our catering and restaurant trades need to buy more Scottish food wherever possible from local suppliers, as we in the Parliament do. Doing so will produce major benefits for our health and for our tourism industry. Local food is fresher and tastier, has higher vitamin levels and lasts longer. Its purchase results in savings on food miles and creates local employment. Local food that is prepared by local restaurants is likely to produce a better eating experience for the &#163;900 million food tourism market in Scotland as well as supporting our farmers.</p><p>In doing all that, we create a genuine sustainable win-win situation for consumers who, through eating better food, have a better lifestyle and longer life expectancy. The Scottish economy also benefits from an improved tourism product and jobs are sustained and created in the food production and farming sectors.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13353179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sustainable Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by drawing members' attention to my entry in the register of interests.

Before the 2003 election, when I was my party's spokesman on the environment, I warned that the Executive was not moving quickly enough on recycling and that its recycling targets would not be met. Only 25 per cent of biodegradable waste would go to landfill by 2006 was the public assertion by Government ministers Finnie, Wilson and McNulty. We did not believe it then and we do not believe it now. I draw attention to that more in sorrow than in anger. We all sincerely hold the view that we should not be filling up our valuable landfill sites with biodegradable waste. I <place-holder colnum=\"20887\"/> appreciate the minister's acknowledgement today that we could all be doing better in that regard.</p><p>When looking at the figures two and a half years later, it gives me no satisfaction to find that we still send 1.8 million tonnes of waste to landfill every year, and to find that the figure is increasing instead of decreasing. It gives me no satisfaction to note in the 2003-04 figures that only 12.3 per cent of our biodegradable waste was recycled by local authorities. It is a matter of shame that our recycling figures increased by only 8.5 per cent between 1999 and 2004. One cannot see how the target of 25 per cent by 2006 will be met. To meet it, we would need to double our recycling in one year.</p><p>I regret to say that fly-tipping is still a huge issue in urban and rural areas. To me, the problem seems to be getting worse and not better. As levies rise on the legitimate disposal of industrial waste&#8212;which Richard Lochhead referred to&#8212;so too does the temptation to fly-tip. That well-documented practice has significant long-term implications for the environment.</p><p>Urban fly-tipping is on the increase in parts of my constituency. In some measure, that is driven by South Ayrshire Council's policy of emptying our bins only fortnightly. After a week or 10 days, my constituents' bins, on occasion, are literally full to overflowing. What are people to do with their household rubbish then? During the summer, I spent my annual leave in Spain. I was amazed that bins there are emptied every day. If Spain can do it, why can we not?</p><p>In the north Ayr communities, tenants and residents associations are constantly asking for skips to allow concerned residents to tidy up their areas. There is a continuing problem for which we have not yet found a solution. We must do so.</p><p>The first priority on recycling must be to get something done. Area waste plans are all very well, but everything is just taking too long. When the national waste strategy was launched in 1999, we were very far behind on recycling in a worldwide context. At that time, we should have found out what best practice was elsewhere in the world and unashamedly copied it. There is no copyright on ideas about dealing with waste, but six years later, we seem to be little further on. By the time the area waste plans are agreed and implemented, we will have lost another few years. By then, the plans might need to be updated to reflect the best practice that has emerged elsewhere, so I would like the minister to tell us how much flexibility is built into them.</p><p>Perhaps it is time for a little blue-skies thinking on waste disposal. I am thinking specifically of the direct variable charging schemes that are being introduced in the United States and Europe with <place-holder colnum=\"20888\"/> dramatic and positive effect. I understand that such schemes could work in Scotland by reducing the council tax by the average annual cost of collecting and disposing of waste&#8212;which is about &#163;111 per household&#8212;and then levying a charge on the collection of waste on the basis of weight. In Europe, such charging schemes have reduced the amount of waste that is produced by as much as 30 per cent. Indeed, one scheme in the Landkreis Schweinfurt area of Germany resulted in a dramatic 40 per cent reduction in waste.</p><p>It might also be time to investigate advanced thermal treatment of waste, which is used to dispose of 78 per cent of waste in Japan. As the minister will know, ATT is not incineration. It is claimed that the process produces only water, carbon dioxide and heat, so it is certainly worthy of further serious evaluation. It appears that dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls are no longer a problem in the ATT process. We could build local plants that could cope with between 30,000 and 90,000 tonnes of waste per year, which would produce usable quantities of base-load energy.</p><p>We must stop being so lethargic in how we deal with waste issues. The minister alone can inject a sense of urgency into addressing such matters more effectively; I know that he is capable of that. He cannot be comfortable about the imminence of missed targets. For the reasons that I have outlined, I urge the minister and the Parliament to support the Conservative amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-3585.2, to leave out from first \"welcomes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"believes that the Scottish Executive's policy on waste is failing and that the amount of waste being sent to landfill is increasing, so that local authorities will have to double their recycling performance in one year to meet the 2006 targets, and further believes that after six years the Executive needs to take immediate steps to free up local authorities to enable them to deliver innovative and appropriate solutions to suit their local circumstances.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13350037", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waste Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by apologising to the chamber on behalf of my colleague Alex Johnstone.

One need only look in and around the area that I represent to see evidence of Scottish manufacturing's decline. We have seen <place-holder colnum=\"20310\"/> many closures: the Ailsa-Troon shipyard; the Volvo factory in Irvine; the Compaq computers factory; and the Ayr stamp works. The list goes on. According to Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, no fewer than 85 manufacturing companies in Ayrshire have closed over the past four years, with the loss of almost 7,500 jobs.</p><p>There are many reasons why Ayrshire's manufacturing sector is suffering, some of which are beyond the Scottish Executive's control. For example, there has been an increase in competition from the far east, the Indian sub-continent and eastern Europe, where the labour costs of the well-educated and appropriately skilled workforce are cheaper. However, other issues that affect Scottish manufacturing industry's competitiveness lie very much within the influence of Government at UK and devolved level. As I argued in the chamber a few weeks ago&#8212;and as others have mentioned&#8212;the minister's stated intention of reducing business rates in Scotland to the levels that are enjoyed by firms south of the border is welcome, but the reduction cannot come soon enough for businesses in my constituency. We could do with lower business rates now rather than in 2007-08.</p><p>In addition, recent studies have shown that an underdeveloped transport infrastructure and high transport costs are a major stumbling block to business expansion. In recent years, many local companies have raised with me the issue of spiralling utility costs such as water bills, which for a number of firms have been hiked by Scottish Water by 300 per cent and more. Clearly, such costs have a major impact on the ability of the manufacturing firms to compete and to invest.</p><p>It is extremely worrying that the Fraser of Allander Institute's most recent survey on behalf of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce indicates that Scottish investment in research and development and in developing new markets and products continues to decline. To survive and compete in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, Scottish manufacturing must play to its strengths and innovate. Sadly, firms face such a fight to keep their heads above water because of the high business costs that are levied by the Scottish Executive and Scottish Water that they are required to sacrifice future investment for present survival. Who can blame them for doing so?</p><p>Of equal concern is the worrying lack of new business start-ups in Ayrshire. The only way to boost start-ups is to create an environment that is conducive to the spirit of entrepreneurship, which has long been part of the Scottish character.</p><p>However, the news from Ayrshire is by no means all bad.

Above all, we must take the public with us in any changes that we propose.

Although we should not set our face against change, we should acknowledge that the planners of previous generations did a good job. The reality is that, in the main, most members of the public are largely content with our health service. Of course we all want waiting lists and waiting times to be shortened, but very few people want radical change in hospital provision. Patients want to feel that their health service can be improved and expanded locally, but do not want to feel that it is being downgraded or that they will receive a reduced service.</p><p>When there is such a matrix of proposals for change, it is vital to convince members of the public, who are all potential patients, that what is proposed is for the long-term benefit. In the words of Professor Kerr, we need to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"develop options for change with people, not for them.\"</p><p>As many members will be aware, proposals are on the table to centralise accident and emergency specialist care for Ayrshire at Crosshouse hospital and a consultation is under way. Naturally, I welcome the fact that consultation is taking place; I also welcome Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board's publicly and privately stated position that no decision on the future of A and E services in Ayrshire has yet been made. There is no doubt <place-holder colnum=\"20055\"/> that the public are being consulted widely and in a more meaningful way than when the removal of paediatric services to Crosshouse was proposed.</p><p>Public engagement and public debate have certainly been achieved. There have been packed public meetings, at which considered views have been expressed on what has been proposed, and I hope that the health board has been listening. Strong but thoughtful views have been expressed against the proposals. It is a matter of great regret to the public that the most popular proposal that was made in the service review&#8212;namely, that both A and E units should be kept open, that assessment centres should be created at the two hospitals and that community casualty facilities should be provided at Irvine, Cumnock and Girvan, as well as at Ayr and Crosshouse&#8212;has not been included in the consultation. That is the rub&#8212;a meaningful consultation process should contain proposals that a sophisticated patient public regards as an obvious improvement. In my view and in the view of many of my constituents, the current proposals fall short.</p><p>The extra dimension to the consultation process is that many doctors, GPs and consultants in Ayrshire do not feel that they have been adequately consulted. Members of the public need to be consulted and convinced of the benefits of proposed changes but, at the same time, medical staff must be convinced that those changes will produce better patient outcomes.

In that case, I will move on quickly.</p><p>We recommend that proposals must be broadly within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and that there should be no likelihood of legislative action on a similar subject that would afford an opportunity in the current session of the Scottish Parliament&#8212;or at Westminster or in the European Parliament&#8212;to amend the same area of law.</p><p>Other factors that should be taken into account are the size, scope and complexity of a bill, as well as the breadth of support that a proposal has attracted. NEBU can provide us with an estimate of the potential size of a member's bill by reference to other legislation on comparable issues. Scope is estimated by reference to the extent of the policy being pursued as discussed during consultation. Complexity is assessed by reference to the desired policy, to other legislation and to work in other jurisdictions. In each case, NEBU offers us information following input by its legal advisers. Size is important to the exercise. Regardless of the underlying policy, as bills become larger they become more complex to develop and draft and to take through the parliamentary process&#8212;the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill is an example. Similarly, the more strands there are to a policy, the more complex the production of a bill becomes.</p><p>Let me turn quickly to NEBU's workload. In this session, NEBU has researched or discussed 66 potential bills and 22 draft proposals have been lodged under the new procedures for members' bills. Eighteen of those proposals are at varying stages of the process: some are out to consultation, while others are ready to proceed to final proposal stage. The unit is already providing assistance to the Standards and Public Appointments Committee on the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill and it is also providing assistance on three introduced members' bills. Another member's bill has been instructed and assistance is being provided to the Subordinate Legislation Committee on its proposed bill.</p><p>Support for those members' bills is provided on the basis that they meet the prioritisation criteria. In each case, the policy had been sufficiently developed before demand on the unit began to <place-holder colnum=\"19954\"/> exceed available capacity. Although members have until the end of September 2006 to introduce a bill in this session, it can take 12 months to develop the policy and to work with the draftsmen to produce a bill that is fit for introduction. Decisions that we make now will determine the drafting support that is available to members for the remainder of the session.</p><p>That takes me on to how we arrived at our recommendations. We took account only of the eight proposals that had completed consultation&#8212;they are the only ones that have advanced far enough for decisions to be made at this time. We recommended that two proposals&#8212;one for civic appeals and the other for a commissioner for older people&#8212;should receive NEBU's drafting assistance. Both met the criteria on competence and on the fact that there was no legislative action elsewhere and both received the required support. Neither proposal raises concerns about size, scope or complexity.</p><p>We also considered the proposal on liability for release of genetically modified organisms. That proposal raised concerns about complexity and legislative action being taken elsewhere. The combination of those factors led us to conclude that the proposed bill would be difficult and time consuming to produce and would take up a disproportionate amount of available resources. We therefore agreed that NEBU should not support that proposal. The other proposed bill to which we did not allocate resources was that on direct elections to health boards. At the time of our deliberations, the bill's proposer was in the process of gathering members' signatures and support. As proposed, the bill would have contained about 70 sections, so its size would have been a problem. If drafting assistance had been recommended for either of those proposals, NEBU would have had no scope to provide assistance for any other bills, including committee bills, for the remainder of the session.</p><p>Four members had not lodged a final proposal at the time of our deliberations.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347415", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Non-Executive Bills Unit (Prioritisation of Workload)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

However, it is a fundamental yardstick, however crude, which is widely understood and allows comparisons with other countries and economies. Currently, those comparisons are less than flattering for Scotland, as the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, Allan Wilson, has admitted.</p><p>We can all talk about add-ons that are desirable in themselves, such as sustainability and social justice&#8212;as Shiona Baird and Linda Fabiani did&#8212;but they are deliverable only after taxes have been gathered and a certain level of GDP has been attained. To put things simply, we must first create a strong economy that delivers a level of taxation that allows us to provide better public services for the Scottish people, but as Jim Mather said, we are not doing that. Indeed, our quality of life has been damaged by the lack of growth in the Scottish economy. That is a problem not of the Green party's making, but of the Scottish Executive's making.</p><p>Murdo Fraser alluded to the intolerable burden of business rates. The Conservatives have constantly drawn that matter to the Parliament's attention over the past five years. Business rates are about to be abolished by Jack McConnell, who opposed doing so, but we all want to know when that will happen. The tax has not only cost our business communities &#163;838 million since it was imposed, but it has almost certainly discouraged many potential investors from locating and investing in Scotland. Businessmen are risk takers, but they like to be made welcome and to feel welcome in the communities in which they seek to invest. It is regrettable that Scotland is not perceived as welcoming at the moment. All other things being equal, businessmen will not knowingly put themselves at a disadvantage by locating in an area in which it is difficult to do business. Sadly, Scotland falls into that category.</p><p>It has been alleged that the First Minister regards our leading businessmen and entrepreneurs as idiots. That is unhelpful, to say the least. If he did not call them idiots, he should say so. In addition, water charges on businesses are now so high that I am aware of several businesses that are under severe pressure as a result. It is simply not reasonable for our aged and decrepit water and sewerage infrastructure to be rebuilt off the back of Scottish businesses, and the business community certainly resents that being done. In particular, it resents being overcharged by &#163;44 million per year, which the Executive has recently admitted has happened. The poor quality of the water and sewerage infrastructure to which I refer also acts as a brake on business development.<place-holder colnum=\"19364\"/></p><p>Transport links in Scotland are poorer than in other areas. The Institute of Directors recently described our transport network as a \"national disgrace\" and a \"major drag on business\". However, I must welcome the completion of the M77 upgrade and the dramatic impact that that will have on the Ayrshire economy&#8212;I am certain that it will have such an impact.</p><p>It is important that the Parliament supports business development in every way that it can. The Parliament must shake off the perception that it is not business friendly and, in that respect, actions speak louder than words. We must appreciate that wealth creation must precede wealth redistribution and foster a climate that welcomes and understands the business community and its needs.

There is a real choice.</p><p>If the Parliament wants to go back in time, it will heed Government proposals by accepting regional transport partnerships, with more bureaucracy and mass regulation.

As I understand the matter, statutory quality partnerships have been a failure quite simply because&#8212;as Des McNulty pointed out&#8212;none exists. We must examine why no quality partnerships exist before we move on to consider regional transport partnerships.</p><p>No quality partnerships exist because the people who live and work at the coalface of bus service delivery throughout Scotland do not want them. Neither bus operators nor local authorities want quality partnerships; they want their existing voluntary partnership arrangements, which have been strongly advocated by the Conservatives. Bus operators want flexibility to do what they do best, whereas local authorities simply do not want the hassle of quality partnerships. It would be a step in the right direction if the minister would at least acknowledge that statutory quality partnerships and quality contracts have not been the success that he and Sarah Boyack had hoped. An acknowledgement of the failure of that policy&#8212;which, to be fair, was not the policy of the current Minister for Transport&#8212;would be helpful because that would stop the minister compounding the mistake by introducing RTPs. That is why I said that we face a clear choice between a step backwards and a step forwards.</p><p>That point has been made not just by the Conservative Party but by many witnesses who gave evidence the committee.

Cynics among us would suggest that no difference will be made&#8212;indeed, Donald Gorrie suggested that. Despite my five years in politics&#8212;indeed, perhaps because of them&#8212;I am more than ever convinced of the voluntary sector's importance and of the good work that it does. Apparently, only 25 per cent of Scotland's population are volunteers, but the figure for Ayrshire and the Ayr constituency is much higher, at well over 40 per cent. I applaud the huge number of my constituents who give their time freely and selflessly to supporting volunteering in Ayrshire and the Ayr constituency.</p><p>Mentioning specific groups is always invidious, as other groups that equally deserve commendation can be left out. However, with the Presiding Officer's indulgence, I would like to commend to members the good work of a few groups in South Ayrshire. I begin with Victim Support in South Ayrshire, which is chaired by Bob Leitch and backed up by Janie Mortimer and her team. That group's workload has grown enormously in recent years. Volunteers provide a valuable service to the victims of crime in our community. Cathy Jamieson and I will attend the group's annual general meeting in Ayr tonight.</p><p>Also invaluable to our communities is the local Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland group, which is led by Sheila Cameron and Linda Allan. Their teams of volunteers do much to help people who suffer from strokes and heart attacks in Ayrshire. It <place-holder colnum=\"17096\"/> was my pleasure to welcome volunteers from that group to the Parliament recently.</p><p>Another group is the Ayr branch of the National Osteoporosis Society, which is led locally by Liz Morland and nationally by Anne Simpson. I declare an interest as the patron of the Ayr branch and commend its work and commitment to relieving pain and providing support to its members.</p><p>I am a new board member of the South Ayrshire rape crisis centre and commend the difficult work that it has undertaken. The group is led by Jean Sloan and helps the 1,800 to 1,900 victims of sexual abuse that there are annually in Ayrshire.</p><p>All those people and those in groups such as the cancer support groups, multiple sclerosis support groups and WRVS deserve our warmest thanks and support. As a result, we cannot do anything other than support the launch of project Scotland on Tuesday.</p><p>In youth work, I commend the good work of the midnight footballers, supported by the Scottish Football Association and the Bank of Scotland, and the volunteer coaches who run the scheme, which I visited recently, for our young people in Ayr. Another youth organisation that I commend to the Parliament, as an ambassador for it, is Girlguiding Scotland in Ayrshire, under the leadership of Frances Henderson and the two county commissioners. Equally, the Scout Association depends on volunteers for the development of our young men. Those are just a few of our voluntary youth organisations, but there are many more.</p><p>One issue for today's debate is the fact that volunteers are becoming harder to find, due&#8212;in part, at least&#8212;to the difficulties and timescales that are involved in getting clearance for volunteers from Disclosure Scotland. Donald Gorrie mentioned that problem, of which the minister is well aware. Although we all agree with the concept, we must be aware that the process and timescales discourage many people who would otherwise have much to give to their communities.</p><p>Another point to consider is the fact that the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill must not in any way make it more difficult for voluntary organisations to exist or carry out their work. Less red tape and bureaucracy rather than more should be one of the objectives and outcomes of the bill. We must not presume on the good will of the 50,000 or so voluntary organisations throughout Scotland that want to get on with their work rather than fill in forms, which is so often a consequence of new legislation.</p><p>Finally, I mention the tenants and residents groups, community forums and community <place-holder colnum=\"17097\"/> councils that thrive particularly in my constituency. It is important to encourage such groups because of all the work that they do in building and strengthening the communities that they represent, especially in north Ayr, where I live. None of those grassroots organisations finds its work easy and there is never enough funding to support groups' aspirations in either the short or the long term. Nevertheless, there is a spirit and a sense of humour in adversity and in the face of vandalism, crime and drug abuse that keep these people going. They do more for the self-esteem and confidence of their communities than is often recognised or acknowledged.</p><p>Although the Conservatives will support the Executive's motion and both amendments, we believe, as a point of principle, that there ought to be less Government interference in and more independence for the voluntary sector, as Des McNulty said. I hope that the minister will reflect on that view and I look forward to his response.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340401", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector and the Social Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, must declare an interest and refer members to the register of interests.

I also congratulate Shiona Baird on securing the debate and I congratulate Stonehaven and Balerno on holding their first farmers markets.</p><p>During the five years that I have been in Parliament, I have tried to avoid speaking in <place-holder colnum=\"16679\"/> debates about subjects in which I have a financial interest, but today I must break that rule and I do so with the greatest of pleasure. Often members' business debates reflect constituency or health issues, but today's debate is a celebration of a success story that began six years ago. As Shiona Baird said, the first farmers market in Scotland, organised by Jim Fairlie, took place in Perth on 1 April 1999 and my late wife and I set up the second market, in Ayr, with the help of South Ayrshire Council, on 24 July 1999. It is tempting to say that the rest is history.</p><p>Today there are approximately 55 markets operating throughout Scotland and farmers markets have been one of the big success stories in rural Scotland in the past six years. Farmers markets came into existence at a time when Scottish farming had never been more challenged, following the BSE crisis, the E coli 0157 outbreak and the enforced closure due to the foot-and-mouth crisis. In 1999, Scottish farming confidence was at an all-time low, but that confidence is gradually returning and farmers markets have played a huge part in that, delivering benefits to consumers, declining town centres and farmers themselves. It is truly a win-win situation for all concerned.</p><p>To our surprise and, indeed, delight, town centre shopkeepers welcome us on market days, because we bring increased footfall as our customers often spend the rest of the morning or the day in town centres. We have not just put a positive public face on the farming industry in Scotland; we have also given confidence to many of our stallholders, which is vital. That new-found confidence is turning many of our operators into significant rural entrepreneurs. Specifically, it means that stallholders are expanding their businesses by opening farm shops and butchers shops and supplying the catering trade. That is why I am so proud of Scottish farmers markets today.</p><p>At a time of the greatest challenge to Scottish agriculture and declining job opportunities in rural areas, we have been creating new jobs in what are often the most deprived areas. People such as Walter and Annette Young at New Cumnock now employ 19 people in their butcher business. Jim and Ann Smilie at Corrie Mains in Mauchline now employ two people in their egg retail business. Others are giving farming family members a reason to stay at home on the family farm rather than to seek employment elsewhere.</p><p>In addition to the farmers markets, such virtual communities are also in the right place at the right time to supply fresh, locally produced, unprocessed food to our ever more discerning customers. As we all properly become more conscious of what we should be eating, farmers <place-holder colnum=\"16680\"/> markets have created in only six years a brand that is identified with healthy eating, quality food and the supply of fresh, locally produced food.</p><p>Despite having created that niche market, only one in 20 people in Scotland has attended a farmers market, so we still have 95 per cent of the market to aim for, which is an enormous future opportunity. The minister might want to explore with Ross Finnie the possibility of providing further developmental support to the industry, which, thus far, has received little or no financial support, yet is delivering on the healthy eating agenda and is creating jobs in rural areas.</p><p>In the longer term, the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets will have to address the continuing expansion of the farmers market brand. The market opportunities exist to develop further our website into a full-blown retail outlet. We should also consider opening up town centre shops using local farmers market brand images, and our distribution networks could and should be expanded.</p><p>The industry estimates that Scottish farmers markets collectively are turning over &#163;20 million annually, and we have only just begun. With the help of the minister, this provider of fresh, healthy, local food can grow much more. We can supply not just the niche market catering trade but also mass-market local authority schools contracts, hospital contracts and other public service contracts.

I also note that, although the Hannah lies outside the boundaries of my constituency, many of its staff live in Ayr constituency, so today's debate is of importance to them. However, the debate about the Hannah is important not just in a narrow constituency sense as it has to be seen in a whole-Ayrshire context, and indeed in a west of Scotland context. From a west of Scotland perspective, the threatened closure of the Hannah is sending out a dreadful message.</p><p>I was elected to the Scottish Parliament just over five years ago, and in early meetings with Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire I raised the possibility of a bioscience or life science park for Ayrshire, loosely based around the Hannah Research Institute and SAC Auchincruive. After discussion with local authorities, that idea was adopted by the Ayrshire economic forum. The establishment of a bioscience park became the forum's number 2 priority. That was welcomed and agreed by all MPs, MSPs and councillors in Ayrshire at a presentation in this Parliament.</p><p>What has happened now? Auchincruive is a shadow of its former self, and today we are debating the loss of the Hannah as a world-class institute. It is no exaggeration to say that the Hannah's reputation internationally far exceeds SEERAD's perception of it in Scotland, and therein lies the problem.<place-holder colnum=\"16131\"/></p><p>Critical visiting groups have created the current situation. SEERAD has actively discriminated against the Hannah, and the Hannah, Ayrshire and Scotland are the poorer for it. The critical mass of the scientific communities at the Hannah and Auchincruive are being lost; staff numbers at the Hannah are down from 130 to 70. I am hugely disappointed that SEERAD&#8212;and therefore the Government&#8212;appears actively to be pursuing such a reduction, in contradiction to the stated aims of the Ayrshire economic forum. At a time when, as Irene Oldfather said, we should be trying our utmost to attract scientists to Scotland and retain them, particularly in the west of Scotland, we are driving scientists away. Phil Gallie is correct to say that the approach does not represent joined-up thinking in pursuit of a smart, successful Scotland.</p><p>Rather than be less than helpful to, or less than open with, the Hannah, the Government should grasp the opportunity that is presented to demonstrate its commitment to science in Ayrshire and throughout Scotland. If the Hannah is unable to help itself through leadership and direction, the Government should make a positive contribution to finding solutions to the problem, rather than putting obstacles in the institute's path, for example by cutting its funding.</p><p>If visiting group recommendations have been implemented by the Hannah, it is simply not fair for the Government to move the goal posts and say, \"Your research is not relevant; it is not what we want.\" Ministers approved the direction of research and directed budgets for years, so they cannot walk away and say, \"The Hannah has got it wrong\". There is manifest unfairness and a lack of openness about the situation, which flies in the face of open and accountable government.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the minister's closing remarks. I hope that he will acknowledge the quality of research that the institute carries out and that he will not be critical of the institute's recent past, given that it has been following SEERAD's recommendations. I hope that he will tell us what he intends to do to secure the Hannah's future as a working, well-funded, world-class institute. It is not too late to throw the Hannah a lifeline and establish a new, positive direction for the institute.

Before we do that, however, I wish to examine why so many of our young people are leaving Scotland. In my view, it is starkly obvious and a prime example of the law of unintended consequences. In recent years, we have placed huge emphasis on the importance of educating people to degree level, and we have reached a stage at which almost 50 per cent of those who are leaving the education system have a further education qualification of some sort. We have all supported that dash for degrees and shared in that aspiration.</p><p>Simultaneously, however, student debt has soared. Many students leave university with debts of around &#163;20,000. Many of them also take a gap year, either before or after studying for their qualification. They have seen a little of the world&#8212;perhaps a great deal more of it than many of us here in the Parliament have seen. The problem that arises is that students who leave university with that huge debt and the first-hand knowledge that they have gleaned in their gap year appreciate that better working and living conditions exist elsewhere. As a result, they decide to move away from Scotland into a worldwide labour market, which is likely to pay them better salaries and allow them to pay off their debts more quickly.

If we are serious about reversing the brain drain&#8212;which we would all aspire to be&#8212;we must first reduce the pressure to pay off debt. For those who remain in Scotland, only when their debts are paid off, perhaps when they are in their late 20s, will they start to look for a home that they can afford and to consider settling down and having a family. For many people, having children in their 30s is biologically more difficult, so fewer children are being produced. That is part of the reason for our declining population. Paradoxically, the more that we educate our young people, the more likely they are to have huge debts in their 20s, which burden them financially. As far as this debate is concerned, that burden reduces the likelihood of their starting up their own businesses, which is a problem that, in the long term, all parties must face up to.</p><p>However, falling population trends are perhaps a debate for another day. In my remaining time, I wish to address the solutions that are available to <place-holder colnum=\"15650\"/> us for growing an enterprise economy. First, if the Scottish Executive is serious about offering businesses a level playing field in the UK economy, it must cut business rates. That is a given. Secondly, water charges should be cut. That can be done only if the capital that is needed to finance the rebuilding of our aging infrastructure is raised from the marketplace, rather than from the consumers of water and sewerage services. The mutualisation or privatisation of Scottish Water would remove from businesses the intolerable and unrealistic stealth tax that has been placed upon them, which is used by Scottish Water for infrastructure rebuilds. Opening up the water market to competition would help our businesses and put them on a level playing field with England and Wales. Thirdly, the Conservatives would further develop our aging road and rail infrastructure, increasing access to and from Scotland for imports and exports.</p><p>Those are all measures that the coalition could implement tomorrow&#8212;surprisingly, I agree with Bristow Muldoon on that, if nothing else. Indeed, they are the straightforward measures for which businesses are crying out.

The warm deal initiative is vital to pensioners in my constituency of Ayr, where the percentage of pensioners is three times the national average, and it should continue after 2006. I look forward to hearing the minister's views on that issue.</p><p>We should support initiatives to install solar water heating, condensing boilers, to which Karen Whitefield referred, and more external cladding and double glazing, which Nora Radcliffe mentioned. We should widen eligibility for the warm deal to the disabled and reduce the age of eligibility to 60. As Allan Wilson said, that would provide a win-win solution. The one action of improving housing stock would deliver a reduction in fuel poverty and, at the same time, increase energy efficiency. From an economic perspective, we would get two bangs for the one buck.</p><p>Energy efficiency is an issue that gives everyone a chance to act locally to address the problems of climate change.

I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport's announcement yesterday of interim funding for the park and her declaration of commitment and intent regarding securing the future for the Burns heritage in Ayrshire. Adam Ingram's motion has captured the mood of unease and concern about the matter in Ayr, Ayrshire and the west of Scotland. Last week, Peter Watson, the chairman of Alloway and Doonfoot community council, lodged an e-petition expressing concern about the future of our Burns <place-holder colnum=\"13826\"/> heritage. I welcome him and others from Alloway here tonight.</p><p>The future of the Burns national heritage park has dominated the local press for months. Although the park is not located in my constituency, its influence on and importance to the town of Ayr cannot be overstated. Concern has been widely expressed by all sectors of the community at the apparent lack of focus; the feeling is that the future of the park has been too big a problem to solve locally. Concerns have also been expressed at the possibility of loved and valuable Burns artefacts being removed to Edinburgh or elsewhere. With apologies to east coast colleagues, I believe that the artefacts that are located in Ayrshire must remain there.</p><p>However, the mood in Ayr and Ayrshire is far from one of doom and gloom over Burns. As members will be aware, at this time of year we are girding our loins for the annual round of Burns suppers. The annual celebration is now a worldwide event. We are also looking forward to the fourth Burns festival in the spring, although we do not know the dates yet.</p><p>Everyone in Ayrshire knows of Burns's importance as a poetic genius and iconic tourist attraction. However, although his poetry, wit and music are beyond compare or reproach, his potential to attract tourists to Ayrshire has not yet been realised locally or nationally. A huge opportunity now exists for a new beginning. I am optimistic that, with the help of Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, the National Trust for Scotland, Historic Scotland, the national lottery and South Ayrshire Council, Patricia Ferguson will, because of her close interest in the matter, put together a package that secures the Burns national heritage park and develops its potential for tourism.</p><p>Access to Ayrshire has never been easier for visitors, with Ryanair providing low-cost flights to and from Prestwick, which is Scotland's fastest-growing airport. The A77 upgrade is at last nearing completion, putting Ayr within half an hour's travelling time from Glasgow and the central belt.</p><p>Good new ideas are also coming to the fore from the National Trust for Scotland, which is developing a Burns trail that links under a single ticket access to all the sites dedicated to the bard in Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire. Unquestionably, such an approach has benefited whisky and tourism in the north-east; it is an obvious and welcome idea for the south-west. Also new and welcome is the enthusiasm and professionalism that the National Trust for Scotland can bring to the situation.</p><p>I look forward to Burns's fame and influence spreading still further round the globe. I also look forward to the minister's response to the debate, in <place-holder colnum=\"13827\"/> which I hope she will flesh out her proposals for securing and developing Ayrshire's greatest literary and tourism asset.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Robert Burns National Heritage Park"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Adam Ingram on securing the debate on the Burns national heritage park.

Strong rural economies need employment and population growth to sustain them, as Nora Radcliffe pointed out. For farming to be prosperous, it must constantly seek to improve efficiency. However, that can have negative implications for employment opportunities and for the attractiveness of a region for inward migration.</p><p>There is obviously a source of tension in that but, from my background and experience in agriculture, I suggest that there are a number of ways in which that tension can be addressed. Rural businesses can be innovative&#8212;witness the success of farmers markets in recent years. Farmers markets identified a need and recognised <place-holder colnum=\"13586\"/> an opportunity. There are now about 60 farmers markets operating regularly in Scotland. In meeting that need, farmers markets not only bring fresh food to the consumer, contributing to the nutritional health of Scotland, but have created new employment in rural areas in the local processing and distribution of food.</p><p>One feature of farmers markets is that most of them are organised on a co-operative basis and are developed with the help of the specialist co-operative development organisation, the SAOS. Agricultural co-operatives play an important and often underestimated role in creating rural prosperity. They are particularly important for rural employment and training.</p><p>Labour and machinery rings help to make the most efficient use of labour in local economies. Such co-operative businesses sustain jobs by matching the demand for labour with the supply. The rings also build capacity in rural areas by improving training opportunities and the skills base of the labour force, which helps to unlock the potential resource in the rural economy. I give an illustration of the role that co-operatives play: one machinery ring has reported that it handled more than 14,500 requests for labour in 2004, delivering an average of 274 workers per working day. Such businesses are present throughout most of the Scottish rural economy. The newest one, which has been developed by the SAOS, is the Argyll and islands business ring. It is located in a sparsely populated area, where it helps to meet the employment and population challenges.</p><p>Diversification can also offer new job opportunities. The recent consultation and debate on a green jobs strategy highlighted the opportunities that exist in rural areas to develop renewable energy sources. Interestingly, overseas experience suggests that in many areas, such as biomass, opportunities are more likely to be exploited if the farms involved organise as a co-operative, in order to ensure that they can guarantee quality, quantity and consistency of supply.</p><p>Moreover, co-operatives such as Tarff Valley Ltd, ANM Group Ltd and Highland Grain (Marketing) Ltd are businesses in their own right. Managing those businesses generates high-quality employment in rural areas throughout Scotland. In fact, there are about 80 agricultural co-operatives, whose throughput amounts to &#163;1.3 billion per year. Although they employ only 2,500 people directly, their role clearly supports rural employment more generally.</p><p>The minister and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department actively support co-operative development in agriculture in the rural economy through SEERAD's partnership with the SAOS. Therefore, they acknowledge the <place-holder colnum=\"13587\"/> contribution made by co-operatives to a dynamic and successful rural economy. Today, parliamentarians, too, should note the important role that co-operatives play and recognise that the wider development of co-operatives throughout the rural economy would go a long way towards addressing the challenges that Jamie Stone's motion identifies.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sustaining Agriculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer, as the chairman of the Scottish Association of Farmers Markets and as a council member of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society.

I thank the First Minister for his detailed statement and his full and sincere apology to the adult survivors of institutional child abuse in Scotland. That apology will mean a great deal to those survivors, as will the apology from Quarriers, which was highlighted by James Douglas-Hamilton. Great wrongs have been perpetrated in Scotland and the apologies are both welcome and, I hope, cathartic for the individuals involved. Robert Brown and Campbell Martin movingly drew attention to that.</p><p>On behalf of the Public Petitions Committee, I welcome the many measures that the minister announced today. I also welcome how far his position has moved since the petition was first considered on 8 October 2002. In particular, I believe that the committee will welcome, as did Marilyn Livingstone, the information that all available files will be redacted in the near future and available for public inspection in January 2005. I am glad that INCAS witnessed the redacting process and is comfortable with it.</p><p>The committee will also welcome the involvement of the Scottish information commissioner, Kevin Dunion, in the investigations into abuse, which Rosie Kane discussed. Perhaps Robert Brown's suggestion that the commissioner for children and young people should become involved is worthy of further consideration.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell was correct to welcome the creation of another short-life working group, and INCAS and Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the establishment of a counselling service for survivors. I appreciate particularly the proposal to include an advocacy element in that service, as it will be extraordinarily difficult for many people to think clearly about and discuss freely the issues, which have remained hidden in survivors' minds for so long. I welcome the minister's commitment to funding that service, as, I am certain, will INCAS.</p><p>Unquestionably, the quality and sincerity of the debate show that the Public Petitions Committee was correct to bring petition PE535 to the full Parliament for consideration. Many useful speeches were made. I noted and welcomed the minister's comments about lifting the time bar on prosecutions and I am glad that the Scottish Law Commission will look into that early in the new year and report on the subject in 2006.</p><p>I return to the process that we have followed this afternoon. It is important to note that this is the first time that the Public Petitions Committee has <place-holder colnum=\"12446\"/> secured a debate on a petition. The committee has not yet taken a view on the petition's aim, but it recognised the need for a full parliamentary debate on an issue that for too long has been allowed to remain unaddressed.</p><p>On 12 October 2004, the petitioner said in response to the minister's evidence that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The recommendation for a debate in the Scottish Parliament main chamber is a huge leap forward\".</p><p>Today's debate has firmly placed the issue at the top of the political agenda. The minister's agreement to appoint a reporter with experience in the field to investigate institutional child abuse issues will ensure that the subject remains at the forefront of political consideration. The minister has helpfully undertaken if not to be bound by the inquiry's findings, certainly to note them and report to the Parliament. In the spirit of today's debate, we must regard that as positive, as Fiona Hyslop and Janis Hughes noted.</p><p>No longer will it be possible, as it was in the past, to ignore the claims of apparently abused individuals. Today, the Public Petitions Committee fulfils the expectations of the consultative steering group, which recommended in its final report the establishment of a public petitions committee because</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is important to enable groups and individuals to influence the Parliament's agenda.\"</p><p>Petition PE535 has succeeded not only in influencing the agenda of the Parliament and the Executive, but in producing from the First Minister a statement and an apology on behalf of the people of Scotland for the wrongs of the past. I, too, hope that an apology may be forthcoming from the religious orders.</p><p>In petitioning the Parliament, Christopher Daly has shown how an individual can influence directly the political process. The petitioner and the Public Petitions Committee have clearly succeeded in raising awareness of the issue and pressing the Executive to take action.</p><p>However, the proposals that the Minister for Education and Young People announced today do not mark the end of the road for the petition. As the committee's convener said, the committee agreed on 29 September to seek further comments from the minister, the petitioner, the Roman Catholic Church, Quarriers and INCAS. The committee has received the minister's response, the First Minister's apology and responses from the petitioner, INCAS and Quarriers. We will consider them at our meeting on 22 December. Unusually, the committee has also invited the petitioner to attend that meeting, to give him an opportunity to respond to today's debate and to the measures that the minister announced.<place-holder colnum=\"12447\"/></p><p>After full consideration of the responses, the issues that have been raised today and the petitioner's response on 22 December, the committee will agree on any further appropriate action that should be taken on this groundbreaking petition. That will allow the healing process to begin, as Rosie Kane and Fiona Hyslop noted.</p><p>After today's debate and the deliberations on 22 December, perhaps Christmas will be more cheerful and relaxed than it might otherwise have been for the survivors of this dreadful abuse.

Presently, the fire certification process applies only to designated premises, for example factories, offices, shops, railway premises, hotels and boarding houses, and only when more than a certain number of people are employed there.</p><p>As I understand it, the new proposals will greatly extend the types and number of premises that are subject to fire certification, with only single private dwellings being exempt. That is perfectly laudable, but as the size of the certification task grows, the move towards self-certification gives me ground for concern. A self-compliance regime similar to that employed for health and safety legislation, wherein a \"responsible person\" would be obliged to ensure that fire certification standards are met, is fraught with pitfalls. Indeed, it might be a road to disaster. If the Executive intends to go down the self-compliance route, it must be aware of its <place-holder colnum=\"12012\"/> dangers. Industry, businesses and society at large will need to be made much more aware of their responsibilities, and I have the greatest reservations about anyone other than trained fire officers being able to deliver that service.</p><p>It is worth noting that when the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997&#8212;which were based on self-compliance&#8212;were introduced, there was a dangerous lack of awareness among those who suddenly had responsibility for compliance. If ministers are determined to go down the self-compliance route, they will need to mount a significant campaign to make responsible people aware of their duties and obligations under the new legislation. In fairness to the minister, he undertook to do that this morning.</p><p>It is unclear how enforcement will be carried out under a self-compliance regime. That area needs significant further clarification.</p><p>A further and final point is the power to charge for attending incidents following the inappropriate activation of a fire alarm system. In South Ayrshire, crews responded to 520 automatic fire alarms in 2003-04. In this financial year, those crews have already responded to 305 such inappropriate activation calls. Those incidents account for more than 20 per cent of call-outs in the Strathclyde area and have apparently replaced malicious calls as the most common type of false alarm.</p><p>It is obvious that attending such calls is a significant drain on brigade resources and that it reduces available fire cover elsewhere. It appears that many of those incidents are avoidable, and we have only to consider the example of this Parliament building to understand and be aware of the cost of unnecessary call-outs. A financial penalty or charge for repeat offenders would at least allow brigades to recover some of their costs.</p><p>I do not suggest that where genuine concerns and alarms have resulted in calling out the fire brigade to what subsequently proves to be a false alarm, fire brigades should charge. However, where inappropriate calls are repeatedly made that could and should have been avoided, I agree with the principle of charging.</p><p>Although I have not spoken to the amendment in Annabel Goldie's name, I nonetheless urge members to consider it carefully and to give it their full support.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327331", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is my belief that the driver behind the reduction in the number of control rooms is a cost-cutting exercise that I do not welcome.

Thereafter, the political process began to transfer the concept into reality, and Labour ministers chose the site, the architect and the method of construction for the new Parliament.</p><p>Before that happened, back in 1997, when the indecent rush had already started, and long before the Holyrood site had ever been considered, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, in a speech in the House of Lords on 12 November, warned of acting in haste and repenting at leisure&#8212;how prophetic his words were to prove. He warned:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ultimately, I believe it is for the members of the new parliament to decide what building they wish to occupy and in particular what design it should have. Normally if people are buying a house or moving into new offices, it is they who take the important decisions rather than others on their behalf.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>House of Lords</em>, 12 November 1997; Vol 583, c 219.]</p><p>If heed had been taken of that wise counsel, we would not be debating the cost and design of this building today. Labour Government ministers would also not have misspent so much taxpayers' money on this elegant but hugely extravagant building. That is why we are today examining the findings of the Fraser inquiry, which was conveniently requested by the First Minister during the 2003 election campaign and agreed to subsequently by the SPCB.</p><p>Today we are, in essence, considering how blame should be apportioned for the overspend on this building. While responsibility and, therefore, blame can rest only with the Labour ministers at the time when the key decisions were taken, I believe that we are also, in a cathartic way, trying to learn lessons for the future. The project is an object lesson in ministers not taking responsibility <place-holder colnum=\"10447\"/> for their actions. It is an example of worst practice and of how not to behave, and in that regard it must be instructive for future generations.</p><p>We cannot have Labour ministers choosing the site and the architect then saying, \"It wisnae me.\" We cannot have Labour ministers whipping their MSPs at crucial votes then saying, \"It wisnae me.\" We cannot have ministers, in their rush to occupy the wrong building in the wrong place at the wrong price&#8212;under construction management because of their undue haste&#8212;saying, \"It wisnae me.\" Time after time, it was their decisions that sustained the project, long after control had technically been handed over to the SPCB. In particular, the undue haste that apparently drove the project in the early days meant that only one type of contract was suitable. The selection of construction management was a direct consequence of ministers' actions and was the only way in which civil servants could deliver the building and follow minister's instructions.</p><p>It is clear that Donald Dewar understood that completely; we are indebted to Mr Whitton for telling us that Donald Dewar considered resigning because, as an honourable man, he accepted his responsibilities. Had he not considered the building to be his responsibility, he would not have considered resigning. Perhaps that is the difference between the Labour politicians of the previous century and those of the present century. Were Donald Dewar alive today, can members imagine this debate taking place without him taking part? I believe that the First Minister and his absent front-bench coalition colleagues should reflect on those issues.</p><p>Donald Dewar and his team of Cabinet colleagues were perhaps not as honourable as Lord Fraser suggests. Having contemplated the cost of the building in 1999, they knew that a day of reckoning beckoned and, for that reason, they passed the project to an entirely unsuspecting corporate body.

It is a matter of record and shame that the Scottish economy consistently underperforms in the UK economy as a whole. It is an indisputable fact that business rates remain 7 per cent higher in Scotland than they are in England and that high water charges are putting excessive burdens on our small businesses in particular. It is also a matter of the greatest regret that so many of our talented young people are moving to England or elsewhere in the world.</p><p>The Executive makes much of giving young people and the younger population transferable skills. The reality is that transferable skills are just that and are being transferred out of Scotland. Such migration is nothing new&#8212;historically, it has been known as the brain drain&#8212;but its consequences for a devolved Scotland are becoming more damaging by the day. The Executive is doing nothing to stem the exodus at a time when, if our economy is to grow, it is essential that Scottish firms are in a position to set up, expand and compete in an environment that is conducive to their success.</p><p>In my constituency, business start-ups fell by 17 per cent in the April to June quarter of 2004, compared with the same quarter of 2003. Business start-ups are proportionately fewer across Scotland than in England. In addition, that was the second consecutive quarter in which we saw a drop in business start-ups in and around Ayr, Prestwick and Troon, but that should not come as a surprise, given the economic climate across Scotland.</p><p>If I were a younger man&#8212;I wish I were&#8212;without ties, would I consider either working in Scotland or setting up a business in Scotland now? The answer is that I would not. I would not set up a business where I knowingly put myself at a competitive disadvantage to similar businessmen in England. I would not set up a business in Scotland, where business rates are higher than in England and where water rates are penalising businesses young and old alike.<place-holder colnum=\"10263\"/></p><p>What further compounds the position is the lack of self-esteem in our Scottish population, and that must be urgently addressed. We must restore the can-do attitude that is so evident in Scots abroad and so lacking in Scotland. It is not that the genes of Scots abroad are any different from those of us at home, but the upbringing, the business environment and the fiscal climate do not all conspire to keep Scots abroad from fulfilling their potential as they do in Scotland. We must start in our schools and give our young people the appropriate skills and confidence to equip them for life in a competitive world. We must make it easier for school pupils aged 14 and over to access business-led vocational training at FE colleges instead of bribing them to stay at school to collect their education maintenance allowance. We must support our distinguished universities and colleges in producing an annual crop of highly trained graduates, and we must keep those graduates in Scotland.</p><p>To keep our young in Scotland, we must make it a more exciting place&#8212;a destination of choice, as it were&#8212;to be enjoyed rather than deserted, as happens now. To that end, we must have better communication links with the outside world. Better roads, better rail connections and better airport links not only help businesses and the business establishment, but they allow people to travel easily and, crucially, to return, rather than encouraging them to buy a one-way ticket out of Scotland as they currently do.</p><p>We must encourage mentoring and business angels. We have to develop co-operation and collaborative organisations, which are often the spawning ground for new businesses. Mentoring and co-operation build confidence and self-esteem, and that vital bridge between ideas and delivering shining new businesses is something that we have not yet explored closely enough.</p><p>More and better housing must be made available by reforming our outdated planning practices.</p><p>Such improvements in our infrastructure require leadership, political will and example&#8212;things that are not currently on display in the Executive. Encouraging and rewarding excellence in the private sector, rather than promoting political correctness in the ever-growing public sector, will create the vibrancy and excitement that we are missing in Scotland and which many seek elsewhere. We need a determination from the Executive to do everything possible to keep our young in Scotland, to create the right business climate, to foster new businesses, to use the levers of power that are currently available to create new businesses and to encourage our young to stay here. Until we get that <place-holder colnum=\"10264\"/> determination, coupled with action, nothing will change and further decline will be our future.</p><p>We have to up our game. What needs to be done is self-evident, but people are asking whether the Executive has either the ability or the will to do the strikingly obvious. Indeed, many businessmen feel that they achieve what they do in spite of rather than because of the policies of the Scottish Executive. Needless to say, the Conservatives are, as ever, happy to point the Executive in the right direction, and for that reason I urge members to accept the Conservative amendment as the only sensible way forward.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322869", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Growing Scotland's Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I declare an interest as a modest businessman and refer members to my entry in the register of members' interests.

Apart from the pleasure that it will bring to the tens of thousands of visitors who will visit Troon, the championship will be watched by millions of people worldwide.</p><p>Many will not know that the open championship began at Prestwick in 1860 and has gone from strength to strength. In addition, with Turnberry just 20 miles down the road, South Ayrshire has three championship courses within a 20-mile radius of Prestwick airport, and that is a huge and unique asset that we must promote and exploit. However, that can happen only if adequate transport links are developed and maintained in South Ayrshire.</p><p>According to an independent assessment, the 2003 open, held at Sandwich in Kent, benefited the local economy by &#163;17.6 million and created 1,300 full-time equivalent jobs. I hope that this year's event at Troon will benefit the Ayrshire economy by around &#163;20 million. Not just the restaurants and hotels will benefit from the championship; all Scotland will receive a boost through the promotion of our unique and identifiable golf courses.</p><p>Also coming to Ayrshire in 2004 is the world bowling championship, which will be held at Ayr's Northfield Bowling Complex. That event will also publicise Ayrshire's attributes. Ayr will also be the centre of the Burns an' a' that festival, which starts on 28 May. I hope that the many Burns enthusiasts in the Parliament&#8212;I think particularly of Cathy Peattie&#8212;will visit that definitive celebration of Burns's life and work.</p><p>However, none of those events is staged without cost. It is only reasonable to consider the cost in relation to the benefit. Obviously, as world-class sporting events, the open and the world bowling championships will bring international tourists to Ayr. However, gentle questions have to be asked about the Burns festival, which received &#163;630,000 of public funding last year and cost more than &#163;800,000 to stage. Indeed, it has been calculated that every visitor to the festival cost &#163;42 per head, and the festival still has some way to go before it can be regarded as a stand-alone event. That <place-holder colnum=\"8691\"/> said, it is money well spent because it promotes Ayrshire's cultural heritage, builds local self-esteem and develops our tourism product range. We must continue to support the event, still only in its third year, in the belief that it will some day become an international, self-financing festival.</p><p>With the impending demise of Ayrshire and Arran tourist board, we must now consider what will take its place. In Ayrshire, there is an organisation called the Ayrshire and Arran tourism industry forum, which has more than 100 business members who have in the past developed tourism initiatives in Ayrshire. The AATIF has long been overshadowed by the tourist board, but it is a practical and working model of what must be in place to develop and promote market-led tourism in Ayrshire. The organisation, comprised of local business people, developed three of the four products that were referred to recently as major successes by the chief executive of our local tourist board.

We have without question one of Europe's richest and most diverse coastlines, which has been created by a combination of tectonic plate movement and Atlantic wave erosion. The British coastline is certainly one of the most magnificent in Europe, and Scotland's coast is perhaps the best. It contains richness in every sense to sustain Scottish people, with natural resources that range <place-holder colnum=\"8509\"/> from oil and other forms of energy to fishing and conservation areas.</p><p>Our North sea oil industry has been a boon to the British economy for the past 30 years and our fishing industry has sustained communities all around our coastline for generations&#8212;Ted Brocklebank will say more about that in a moment. Our energy-harvesting capability in the marine environment can only grow and the potential for conservation and tourism is being recognised only now. Indeed, there are many Scottish marine assets. However, we must address the fact that they are neither widely appreciated nor adequately managed.</p><p>First, we need to note and catalogue those hugely diverse assets. We need to find out whether they are in decline, as our fish and oil stocks are, or whether their future prospects are improving, as is the case with energy harvesting and marine ecotourism. Having evaluated those assets, we must then begin to plan how we can best maintain and indeed exploit them, preferably in a sustainable way. We must consider consolidating the legislation to provide clarity for all users of the marine environment. Moreover, we must learn from worldwide experience and think about creating a marine national park. The obvious focal point of any such park would be the Darwin mounds and the cold water corals, which until recently have been under threat from damaging fishing techniques.</p><p>We must also develop the potential for tourism that a marine national park would create. Indeed, now that we have land-based national parks we should perhaps think about extending the concept into the marine environment. To do that, we must consider whether we should designate areas of our marine environment for different purposes.</p><p>I ask members to picture in their mind's eye a map of Scotland. In the North sea, we have fishing, oil and tourism. In the Moray firth, we have dolphins, oil, fishing and tourism. In the Pentland firth and the Minches, we should be planning to harvest tidal energy while maintaining our fishing industry. To the north and west, we should also seek to maintain that industry while considering conservation measures and thinking about how we can move tourists into those fragile mainland areas to allow them to discover those unrivalled environments. Aquaculture is vital to those areas and the sooner that we can achieve integrated coastal zone management in them the better.</p><p>We also need to protect the environment and the shipping lanes in the north-west. In the firth of Clyde and the Solway, in addition to sustaining our traditional fishing activities, there is the potential to grow tourism activities such as sailing. Offshore wind farming, which is effectively already in place in the Solway firth, must be contained and not <place-holder colnum=\"8510\"/> allowed to proliferate at random. For those reasons, we must start to manage our assets better.</p><p>We also need to reduce pollution, and instead of extracting what we can get from our seas we need to examine and manage for the future our current assets. However, as Alex Johnstone has pointed out, that should not be done in a heavy-handed or bureaucratic way.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In speaking in this debate, I must say that my primary concern is the same as everyone else's: the future of the marine environment around the Scottish coastline.

Last year, the quantity of domestic waste grew by about 7 per cent, according to Audit Scotland. I know that, last year, a new method of calculating the volume of waste was used, but I maintain that the trend is that there is a marked increase in the volume of waste every year.</p><p>We need to invest in education to reduce waste.

Today, we have a need not for external scanners but for internal scanners, and we need them to be consistently available throughout Scotland.</p><p>In Ayrshire, we have only one DEXA&#8212;dual energy X-ray absorption&#8212;scanner, at Ayrshire central hospital in Irvine. Patients have to travel to Glasgow to be scanned; the alternative is to face a waiting list of 11 to 12 months, which is obviously unacceptable. In Glasgow, there are six DEXA <place-holder colnum=\"6930\"/> bone scanners, to which GPs have direct access, so the community is well served. In Edinburgh, however, there is only one scanner, which operates on a part-time basis and is accessed via consultants.

It has already been said that women are the most at-risk group, with one in three women being affected. The disease causes not only pain, but loss of height and, indeed, loss of dignity and self-respect. The warning signs for women are there if, for example, there is a family history, early onset of the menopause or suspiciously easy fractures. Indeed, simple fractures should often be construed as a warning, but they are not.</p><p>The treatment that is available is not being delivered because men and women are slipping through the net and not being diagnosed with the problem. That is why, as David Davidson said, early diagnosis and intervention are vital to prevent the misery and expense of osteoporotic hip fracture. I understand that fractures cost the national health service in Scotland &#163;200 million annually and the UK &#163;1.7 billion annually. Those figures are frightening. If only a small part of that money was spent on delivering primary care treatment of the problem under the well-developed SIGN guidelines, it would benefit sufferers of the disease and save the NHS money in the long term.</p><p>The &#163;5 million per day that osteoporosis fractures cost the NHS throughout the UK could and should be better spent.

They have other functions, of course, but they are valuable in the creation of new businesses. When an individual is aware of a business opportunity and is sufficiently motivated, he or she will set up their own business or company to satisfy the demand. However, not all individuals have the certainty, the capital or the time to take the risks involved in setting up a new business on their own, and the co-operative route provides them with an opportunity.</p><p>Working together collectively, groups of individuals from my background&#8212;farming&#8212;were able to pool their resources of time, intellect and talent to create business that they would not have been able to create individually. In addition, support was in place through the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which has a distinguished history in rural areas of supporting new and well-established co-operatives as well as some of Scotland's most valuable businesses. The expertise and corporate memory of that organisation would be a worthwhile model on which the CDA could build. That co-operative route has spawned many new businesses that would not otherwise have got off the ground.</p><p>As is obvious, new businesses create jobs. That has been the greatest satisfaction in supporting more than 50 farmers' markets in Scotland. <place-holder colnum=\"6175\"/></p><p>Working as part of a co-operative has given many of our members the confidence to start up other businesses, such as farm shops, butcher shops and online and direct selling businesses, which are vital in Scotland's currently faltering economy.</p><p>At its simplest, co-operation provides an essential stepping stone to allow those with entrepreneurial instincts to take the first step. Of course, many might choose to remain within the collective arena of responsibility that co-operation gives, and that is fine. It is essential that co-operation is fostered, encouraged and developed because, as well as supporting businesses, it strengthens a sense of community.</p><p>In the short time that I have left, I would like to develop that point. Whether in urban or in rural areas, co-operatives that are working well together create an enhanced sense of community. Mutual goals that are achieved through co-operation bring satisfaction to those who are involved and develop the transferable team-building skills that are vital to re-establishing a sense of community in areas where it has been lost. Virtual communities, too, can be creative via the internet and can enhance co-operation and a sense of community.</p><p>I wish the co-operative development agency well.

Currently, most of Scotland's power comes from six plants: two coal-fired plants, one gas-fired power station and three nuclear power stations. The coal-fired plants have a life expectancy of less than 20 years, and there are no plans to replace their capacity.

Our three nuclear power stations are licensed until 2005, 2011 and 2023 respectively, with no plans to replace them.

It is important that the issues surrounding racing are debated here in the Parliament because racing is currently at a crossroads.</p><p>Like Susan Deacon, I want first to express my enthusiasm for racing and for Ayr racecourse in particular. As one of Scotland's five racecourses, Ayr plays a vital role in Ayrshire's local economy. In my view, it is the jewel in the crown of Scottish racing&#8212;although I would say that, wouldn't I?</p><p>The first meeting at Ayr took place in 1777. The Ayr gold cup was first run in 1804. The year 1824 saw the formation of the Western Meeting Club, which then moved lock, stock and barrel to its current site in 1907. National hunt racing began at Ayr in 1950. Ayr is now the home of the Scottish grand national, which is a spring event not to be missed in the Scottish racing calendar.</p><p>Recently, Ayr racecourse has been taken over by Richard Johnstone and Alan Macdonald. The new management team will redevelop the racecourse. They aim to take it on to the next stage and put it on a par with York or even Ascot. I share the welcome enthusiasm of the new owners. I see a positive future for racing at Ayr, which I enjoy particularly.</p><p>In addition, I foresee the low-cost airline Ryanair flying many thousands of racegoers into Ayrshire's Prestwick airport. They may come not just from the UK and Ireland but potentially from all over <place-holder colnum=\"4732\"/> Europe as the new facilities at Ayr take shape. Racing fixture breaks and weekend breaks have enormous potential for the Ayrshire tourist economy. We could confidently expect to attract more than our fair share of those tourists through the use of low-cost air fares.</p><p>However, all the current enthusiasm and excitement around Ayr's racecourse could be put at risk by the Office of Fair Trading inquiry into British horse racing that Susan Deacon mentioned. If implemented, the OFT proposals could, in my view, be the death-knell of Scottish racing. A racing fixture free-for-all must not happen. If it does, Scotland and the north of England will lose out. Racing fixtures, prize money and television will move south to the centres of population, while peripheral courses in the north wither on the vine.</p><p>The current structured system works well. The 97 annual fixtures in Scotland generate &#163;125 million annually for the Scottish economy. Indeed, Scotland punches marginally above its weight, with 11 per cent of British betting turnover taking place in Scotland. Some 29,000 tourists a year visit the Scottish racecourses. Today, I tell the OFT to back off and rethink its position. The wrong decision could destroy our industry and the potential that exists for its expansion, not least in Ayrshire.</p><p>Once again, I congratulate Susan Deacon on securing this debate. I hope that the minister will reflect on what he hears today and that in due course he will argue the Scottish racing industry's corner. Susan Deacon urged him to do that and I too urge him to do so. On a personal note, I would be delighted to welcome the minister to Ayr racecourse so that he can see for himself the quality of racing and entertainment that is on offer there. I look forward to the minister's closing remarks.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308728", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Horse Racing Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Susan Deacon on securing today's important debate.

I shall speak in support of our amendment and re-emphasise the Conservative party's commitment to the protection of bathing water quality.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone and the minister noted, we all have a duty to protect public health. Nowhere is that more critical than in the west of Scotland, where many local people use our local beaches. In <place-holder colnum=\"4021\"/> addition, cleaning up our bathing water enhances our tourism industry generally.</p><p>Nowhere is that more vital than on the beaches of Ayr, Prestwick and Troon&#8212;although, before he intervenes on me, I concede that the minister's local beaches, at Ardrossan, Largs and elsewhere, are equally important. Last summer, sitting in my office in Wellington Square in Ayr, I have been aware of literally thousands of people making their way to Ayr beach to swim in what are now clean and safe bathing waters. The huge investment in our new sewerage system, to which Murray Tosh alluded, is now paying off.</p><p>We have been lucky in Ayrshire this year as, mercifully, a burst sewer on the River Ayr did not significantly contaminate our beaches. By good luck, the old sewer running alongside the new one was able to be brought back into use to cope with the low volumes during the dry weather, and a potentially disastrous incident was avoided. Another incident, near Lochgreen golf course in Troon, was also swiftly dealt with by Scottish Water. Although I am not always Scottish Water's greatest fan, I must acknowledge the enormous effort that it made to protect our beaches on those occasions.</p><p>More can be done to continue to enhance our bathing waters, not just in Ayrshire but throughout Scotland. Stopping the daily trips of the Glasgow sewage sludge boats doon the watter to deposit Glasgow's sewage off Ailsa craig and into Ayrshire's coastal waters is just the first step. Local authorities, as well as the Executive, must play their part. One case in point is the lack of funding from South Ayrshire Council to allow the South sands at Troon to compete for a seaside award. Despite the fact that it has some of the cleanest bathing water in Scotland, the fact that money cannot be found by the council for a ranger service has denied Troon the opportunity to compete for the award. That is short-termism in the extreme, especially given the fact that Troon will be the focus of world sporting attention next summer, when the open championship comes to Troon again. I hope that at least some members will take the opportunity to come to Ayrshire for the open, and perhaps visit our beaches, if the weather permits.</p><p>We in Scotland must continue to support the revised EU bathing water directive, on a value-for-money basis. We will welcome the single river basin district designation order, which is to be laid before the Parliament later this month, as well as the subsequent creation of sub-basin management plans. We will need to continue to address the problems of diffuse pollution from industrial sewage and agricultural sources, as Sarah Boyack mentioned. That must be managed in a cost-effective way. That has not always <place-holder colnum=\"4022\"/> happened in my constituency, particularly on farms in the Craigie area.</p><p>We continue to have reservations about the long-term cost to industry and agriculture of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003. Unlike King Canute, however, we will not stand totally against the incoming tide of additional costs, provided they deliver quantifiable, cost-effective benefits to tourism and public health.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone said, we will need to support colleagues in the European Parliament. They have introduced an amendment to the directive to allow more flexibility over diffuse pollution when flooding occurs after heavy rainfall or snow melt. SEPA and the EU must note that our colder Scottish climate and typical lack of sunshine mean that our beach bathing waters do not benefit from the amount of cleansing ultraviolet radiation that is enjoyed by continental beaches, and I noted the minister's comments on that.</p><p>Nationally, we will have to spend significantly greater sums than other European countries will to bring our waters up to the same EU standard, which the EU must recognise. Locally, we must extend across Scotland the provision of electronic message signs that SEPA piloted in Ayrshire last year, which Ted Brocklebank mentioned. As we seek to attract more foreign visitors to our shores, we must provide to them the information with which they are familiar. I found it surprisingly reassuring to note that a beach that I visited when on holiday in southern Europe this year had a blue flag. Presumably, visitors to Scotland would be glad of similar reassurances when they come here, as Roseanna Cunningham suggested.</p><p>The debate has been very worth while, and many important issues have been raised for the minister to note. I would be particularly interested if he could give me an explanation as to why the geology of Scotland, as well as its geography, should affect bathing water quality&#8212;I am intrigued about that.

They cannot absorb that extra number of passengers from a single source without increases in the number and speed of trains.

I start by addressing one of the problems facing the meat trade: the confusion of butchers as the 1 October deadline for the implementation of EU legislation approaches. In the past, local butchers disposed of waste products in landfill, but from 1 October new EU directives and regulations will require all carcase waste to be rendered, incinerated or composted. The Scottish Federation of Meat Traders Association estimates that the new regime will cost small butchers' shops about &#163;7,500 annually. That will affect butchers not only in my constituency but throughout Scotland. Consumers will not be any better off, but many local butchers that are already on the knife edge of viability will be unable to stand the additional cost and might <place-holder colnum=\"2050\"/> go out of business. That is all driven by needless EU regulation.</p><p>At the beginning of the food chain, farmers are facing a similar problem with the disposal of fallen stock, as Tavish Scott will know. An implementation date of 1 October looms, with no scheme in place in Scotland. The blame for the lack of an appropriate scheme to pick up fallen stock must be laid firmly at the feet of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p><p>A piece of EU legislation that is greatly exciting sheep farmers at the moment is the proposed implementation of an EU-wide sheep-tagging scheme, which George Lyon will know about. The proposals as they stand are unworkable. The record-keeping involved for individual sheep tagging and movement recording will be so complicated that farmers and their staff will be unable to carry out the recording as well as farm.</p><p>Those are examples of current or proposed pieces of EU legislation that are likely to destroy or damage parts of the food production industry. They will not benefit consumers in any way whatever, but will export jobs and services to other parts of the world, where, ironically, such constraints will not apply.</p><p>Those examples affect the industry that I come from, but they are indicative of the burden of red tape and bureaucracy that industries throughout Scotland and the UK have to deal with constantly. They are classic examples of how additional cost burdens caused by European legislation reduce the viability of business and are indicative of the malaise that is keeping the powerhouses of the European economy, namely France and Germany, in the doldrums.

Although the problems of Ayrshire are unique to that area, they are illustrative of the difficulties that health boards face throughout Scotland, where consultants, middle-grade doctors and junior-grade doctors are all in short supply.</p><p>In the Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board area, which includes my constituency, we face two particular issues of great concern to local people&#8212;the continuation of full accident and emergency services at Ayr hospital and the continuation of paediatric services at both Ayr hospital and Crosshouse hospital.<place-holder colnum=\"1840\"/></p><p>I will deal first with paediatric services. Ayrshire has two paediatric units, one at Crosshouse and one at Ayr. The Crosshouse unit treats about 3,000 children a year, while Ayr treats 1,800. However, Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board has just carried out a consultation exercise, which it is feared will be a prelude to the closure of the Ayr unit, despite the overwhelming opposition of local people that was demonstrated in the consultation exercise.</p><p>I am advised that nurses at Ayr hospital have already been given a date for the closure of the paediatric unit. If that is true, it shows that the consultation process was little more than a public-relations exercise. Local Labour MP George Foulkes shared that view and recently predicted at a public meeting that the Ayr hospital paediatric unit would close.</p><p>The problem lies essentially with junior doctors' hours and training and has been entirely foreseeable. Britain signed up to the European working time directive in 1997 and the consequences have been apparent ever since. If the working hours of existing staff are reduced by half, more staff&#8212;about double the number&#8212;will be required to provide the same level of service. That seems a straightforward equation and its implications are inescapable. Of course I agree that junior doctors' working hours should be reduced and I accept completely that the terms of the directive must be complied with, but we cannot allow the price of that reduction in hours to be the sacrificing of crucial health services in Ayrshire.</p><p>A similar problem exists with accident and emergency services in Ayrshire. Last week, contingency plans were revealed under which the accident and emergency unit at Ayr hospital would be closed to major trauma cases from 6pm to 8am and at weekends if sufficient staff could not be found to operate the service. In this case, the problem lies in sourcing middle-grade doctors. Although a world-wide recruitment drive has just about filled up the vacancies in Ayrshire this time, my view, and my fear, is that only part-time accident and emergency services will be available at Ayr hospital by Christmas.</p><p>I raised that matter with the minister in July this year when a Royal College of Physicians survey revealed that in England many accident and emergency units would have to close because of staffing difficulties caused by the reduction in working hours. How does the minister intend to address that nationwide problem?</p><p>I do not want there to be a debate in Ayrshire about whether Ayr hospital or Crosshouse hospital should be the winner or the loser in a carve-up of services. My constituents and I want the existing services at both sites to be retained. In addition, we want services at both hospitals to be <place-holder colnum=\"1841\"/> developed and a general increase in the level of health care provision across Ayrshire. I appreciate that the issues are complex and I would like to make it clear that I do not hold the minister responsible for the problems of downsizing that are being faced at Ayr hospital. However, I believe that he bears a responsibility for helping to find practical solutions to those problems. A shortage of funding is no longer the problem; notwithstanding the large cash injections that have been given to the health service in recent years, it is clear that money will not in itself provide a solution to the problems.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301375", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Scotland's Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse what David Davidson said, but will focus primarily on the problems that people face in Ayrshire.

Householders' water bills have risen by an average of 10 per cent, but the real outcry has come from the small business sector, where charges have doubled, trebled and, in some cases, quadrupled in the space of one year. I am talking about small businesses such as Stanley and Aileen Kaye's St Meddan's Store in Dundonald Road, Troon. It is simply not good enough that, in the past year, water bills in Ayrshire have risen so dramatically. That is why the Tories demanded to have today's debate.</p><p>Looking back in time, we acknowledge that there has been underinvestment in our water industry structure. That is why we agreed to Scottish Water being set up. As predicted, the merger of NOSWA, East of Scotland Water and West of Scotland Water produced cost savings of &#163;100 million in July 2002. Those savings were not used to benefit the consumer or the business sector. Instead, that &#163;100 million was returned to the Scottish Executive and the consumers received no benefit. Instead of putting charges up to current levels, the Executive could have used the &#163;100 million partly to defray costs to small businesses at a time when it is trying hard to encourage small businesses and get the economy moving.</p><p>That is the trouble with Executive policy. On the one hand it maintains that a key priority is the creation and development of small businesses. On the other hand, it increases water charges and <place-holder colnum=\"910\"/> business rates, which continues to drive investment out of Scotland. Constituents often ask me why the business start-up rate is so low in Scotland. The simple answer is that the business start-up climate is oppressive and increased water charges are another nail in the coffin of that sector.</p><p>Big businesses also face crippling costs. BP appears to be threatening to bring court action over its &#163;12 million water bill for the Grangemouth plant. Charities are also facing additional burdens, with the hospice in Ayrshire facing a fivefold increase in water costs as relief is phased out.</p><p>What is to be done? A good start would be to put the consumer first. Competition should be introduced into the industry, as Jim Mather&#8212;a late convert&#8212;suggested. However, the Executive has shied away from allowing competition because it says that it is afraid that Scottish Water would not be able to cope with it.</p><p>A new business structure must be created to replace the nationalised industry that Scottish Water, in effect, is. We propose that mutualisation of Scottish Water would deliver those goals and I welcome Nora Radcliffe's view that mutualisation is a good idea.</p><p>The CBI and the FSB take the view that the present system is unworkable and that a rethink of public ownership is necessary. Instead of the Scottish Government siphoning off profits or merger dividends, as has happened in the past, a mutual company would reinvest every penny of its income on behalf of its customers. It does not matter whether the business model is mutualisation, co-operation, or a not-for-profit trust; we must find a different structure that can deliver for its customers, withstand the rigours of competition, raise capital on the market for much-needed investment and, I hope, make a profit some day.</p><p>I urge the minister and members to support our motion.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13298857", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In speaking in the debate, I intend to communicate to ministers the strength of feeling about increased water charges that exists in Ayrshire and, indeed, across Scotland.

In my view, the Parliament would welcome it if the new rural development committee were to instigate an inquiry and prepare a report on the future of the SAC. I hope that the minister might be able to do something in that regard. Such an inquiry would have several advantages. First, it would introduce transparency into the decision-making process. Secondly, it would reassure us all that the &#163;17 million of public funding that the SAC receives annually is being wisely spent.

For example, <place-holder colnum=\"19887\"/> September 11 might mean job losses at BAE Systems if its principal customers, Boeing, build fewer aeroplanes because fewer people are flying. This week, 27 temporary staff were laid off at GE Caledonian because aircraft engines need less maintenance as a result of the cancellation of flights all over the world because of the gulf war.</p><p>Dependency on the vagaries of the global financial markets makes companies less willing to take on apprentices. School leavers who want to join BAE Systems must compete for the 30 or so places that are on offer, where once there were many more. The human impact is that school leavers and children must either go into further or higher education or leave the area to find a job, as there is little or no work locally. That is why the working-age population in Ayrshire is forecast to decline by 4,000 by 2010.

We are all aware that lead in its many forms poses a threat to us all and particularly to children. Lead is present not just in water pipes, but in paint, exhaust fumes, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the soil in our garden. As Robert Brown said, medical evidence has long shown the need to eliminate or at least keep to a low level our lead <place-holder colnum=\"18272\"/> intake. The debate is helpful because it highlights the problem once again.</p><p>The Conservative party welcomes all moves to reduce lead in the environment, including the Executive's commitment to reduce lead levels in drinking water from 50 to 25 micrograms per litre by the end of the year. We also welcome the proposed further reduction of lead in our water to 10 micrograms per litre by 2013. We will monitor the Executive's promise to deliver those levels.</p><p>As Robert Brown and Shona Robison mentioned, a particular concern is the excessive level of lead contamination found in the water supplies of new houses as a result of the use of lead solder. Given that about 20,000 new homes are built in Scotland each year, the illegal use of lead solder is a real problem. The Scottish new homes lead survey of 2000 found that, at a conservative estimate, 15 per cent of new homes might have unacceptably high lead levels. We welcome the proposed measures and those that have been introduced to make householders aware of that danger, which is a result of bad practice.</p><p>Given the well-documented dangers of lead in water supplies, it is outrageous that 3,000 new-build homes should be affected each year. If we consider the worst-case scenario, as we must, it is possible to conclude from the study that, of the 240,000 new homes that have been built since 1987, more than 75,000 might have lead solder connections in the water supply piping. That puts families and children at risk, particularly with larger new-build houses and flats of the type that are preferred by families with young children. The practice of using lead solder must be stamped out.</p><p>We therefore welcome Scottish Water's convening of a lead strategy group. We welcome the recognition of the need to monitor a problem that most people thought had been resolved a decade ago. We acknowledge the discretionary grants that are available from local authorities for the replacement of lead piping and feel that the public should be made more aware that those grants exist.</p><p>We must try to make progress. The Executive should perhaps consider issuing guidance that local authorities should not issue completion certificates for new buildings or alterations until the levels of lead in the water have been checked. If a completion certificate were not given when a new house was found to have higher than permitted levels of lead in its water, the practice of using lead solder would stop overnight.</p><p>We have a surprising window of opportunity to deliver such a move. I intend to lodge an amendment at stage 3 of the Building (Scotland) Bill, which is to be debated next week. I hope that <place-holder colnum=\"18273\"/> the Executive will consider that amendment carefully. I intend it to cut out the use of illegal lead solder in house building in Scotland.</p><p>We welcome the debate and look forward to the minister's response to it.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13290833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Supplies (Lead Pipes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "You are coming through loud and clear, Presiding Officer.

With 170,000 Scottish homes at risk, the seriousness of the situation and the need for decisive action could not be greater, as the effect of global warming increases daily. That is why we welcome the inclusion of sustainable flood management plans, which will need to be supported by adequately funded agri-environment schemes. We welcome the determination to include all relevant parties in the development of river basin and sub-basin plans, and I and other MSPs look forward to receiving at the end of next month the report of the ad hoc ministerial group on flooding. I hope that it will tell us of the need to develop a national flood strategy.</p><p>I also welcome the pursuit of an holistic approach that accepts the need for an integrated approach to reconciling potentially conflicting policy objectives. That will surely deliver better value for money to the taxpayer. However, of major concern is the fact that the costs of the bill&#8212;which are likely to be huge&#8212;have still not been properly quantified. The minister reported in the autumn that the cheapest cost projection is likely to be around &#163;70 million a year from 2006, with the worst-case projection being more than &#163;100 <place-holder colnum=\"17584\"/> million a year from 2006. Knowing, as we do, the Executive's track record on cost prediction, we can only presume that &#163;100 million a year will be just the beginning of the financial burden to be borne principally by the industry and the taxpayer.</p><p>While we accept that we must implement the EU water framework directive, we have a duty not to impose unnecessary financial strictures on taxpayers and the farming, forestry, mining and energy industries. These are additional costs that are not on taxpayers' or industry's radar at the moment, but they will be real in the fullness of time. We may end up with clean water but little or no dairy farming in some of the more economically sensitive areas.</p><p>Nail by nail, the coffin lid is being hammered down on agriculture, mining and forestry, with increasing cost compliance and regulations. From 2007, the bodies of those industries may gradually be buried as they seek to compete in the world market with countries that do not have to bear the EU-inflicted costs. Our fishing industry has all but been destroyed and our rural industries remain on a knife edge. As a general principle, we should be sceptical of EU legislation that reduces our ability as a country to profit from our primary industries.</p><p>Scottish Water will recover its projected compliance costs of &#163;28 million per year from us&#8212;its customers&#8212;but other businesses might not be able to recover costs from the marketplace and the net effect would be to make them less competitive in world markets. The jury is, therefore, out on what is the most important aspect of the bill.</p><p>I welcome the transfer of planning powers from the Crown Estate to local authorities. Again, that will not be without cost and it will be essential for cost recovery to be recognised in planning fees. I welcome also the minister's assurances that further legislation will be introduced that will be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p><p>I am happy that provisions on sustainable urban drainage systems have been introduced into the bill. Again, we have no hard-and-fast indication of cost, but I welcome the fact that Scottish Water will now take responsibility for that area. The funding of Scottish Water will be crucial and we will have to examine our water and sewerage charges in future to make certain that we are all getting value for money.</p><p>I welcome the bill's progress to this point. If costs can be kept to a minimum in future, the bill will undoubtedly bring significant and sustainable benefit to Scotland which, I hope, will be harvested over many generations.</p>", "hdate": "2003-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13288885", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate brings to a conclusion months of work that has been undertaken by the Transport and the Environment Committee and the Executive and its civil servants.

Although I do not agree with the motion in its entirety, I am happy to support many elements of it. In particular, I welcome the growing realisation in the Parliament of the job creation opportunities that renewables present. Every engineering company, university department and inventor should turn their mind to developing or refining machinery that is capable of harvesting our natural resource of renewable energy.</p><p>Recently, someone said that no one comes to Scotland for our weather, but that is not true; people in the renewable energy business are coming to Scotland in numbers because of our weather. Most of them are in the wind-power business. Scottish Power, Powergen and other international companies, such as ATCO, recognise that we have a valuable wind resource in Scotland, but the problem lies in harvesting that resource. All those who are taking part in tonight's debate, including Conservative members, want a thriving renewables sector. It is absolutely vital <place-holder colnum=\"17486\"/> that we encourage the development of wind farming, but only on appropriate sites. We do not believe that Scotland should be covered with thousands of 300ft-high concrete towers. The appropriate places for wind farms are places where local communities are happy to welcome them. There is no point in forcing wind farms on communities if they are opposed to them. As with so many projects, in this instance location is everything.</p><p>That is why George Lyon's motion moves the debate forward. It is human nature that people's disapproval of wind farming might evaporate if they feel that, notwithstanding the visual intrusion or noise of turbines, they will receive benefit from them. Although it might go against the grain for landowners to give away some of their potential gain when developing sites, it might be necessary to deliver community enhancement projects from profits. That is a well-established principle in urban areas and it is known as planning gain.</p><p>Where planning gain takes the form of local electricity provision or enhancement of public facilities, it is vital to involve and seek the approval of local communities so that they feel the benefit of wind farming. The Knoydart Foundation, which, as Robin Harper mentioned, gave a presentation to the SPREG on Tuesday night, is a good example of that. Communities will be able to exercise their right to buy land under the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, which was passed into law today, in order to build wind farms on it.</p><p>That is all very well, but significant harvesting of our wind resource will not happen unless the infrastructure&#8212;the national grid&#8212;is enhanced and upgraded. Many potentially ideally situated wind farms will never get beyond the concept stage unless the electricity that they produce can be fed into the national grid. As we all know, that capacity does not exist at the moment.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the minister's response to the debate. In his summing up, he might tell us how his plans&#8212;and those of the Department of Trade and Industry&#8212;to upgrade power lines in the west of Scotland in order to allow us to harvest our Scottish wind resource are developing.

I welcome the largely constructive contributions from all parties on what is one of Scotland's thorniest problems&#8212;the future of our rail industry.</p><p>It is obvious that our railways are at a crossroads&#8212;no pun intended&#8212;and, in management terms, are apparently lurching from one crisis to the next. The reasons for that are more complex than mere lack of investment. We in Scotland have to decide what future we want for our railways and other forms of public transport or we will be driven to conclusions that we might not otherwise embrace. The key driver, as has been mentioned, is the increase in road traffic growth. A projected 27 per cent increase in the next 20 years means that our roads will simply clog up unless something is done. David Mundell spoke about that.</p><p>With our limited budget for transport solutions, we in Scotland have hard choices to make. We must accept that some of our train services are already inefficient because the railways are operating in excess of their optimum capacity; we must therefore improve them.</p><p>We need to develop a coherent sense of direction and a transparent decision-making process. Above all, we need stability in our industry, because a lack of it is frightening away investment. For example, the Executive could not make up its mind about what length of new franchise it should offer. Should it be seven, 15 or 20 years? The Executive has now settled on seven years with a three-year extension, but some people in the industry feel that that is not long enough.</p><p>We need to develop a more focused Scottish approach to our problems. It was vital that a Scottish office of the Strategic Rail Authority be established in Scotland and I welcome the minister's announcement that two offices have been established. We also need a more transparent approach to the use of public funds. That is why STAG evaluation and appraisal are vital to the provision of key projects and the delivery of value for money.</p><p>The committee's report recommends a higher <place-holder colnum=\"16984\"/> passenger transport target than the 5 per cent increase by 2006 to which the Scottish Government made a commitment in its spending review. The Executive has gone some way towards increasing passenger capacity by acquiring 22 new three-carriage trains, but we should surely strive for a higher year-on-year increase.</p><p>We also welcome the creation of virtual boards, and we support moves to encourage more freight off the roads and on to the rail network, where capacity exists. However, the solution comes back to money, the establishment of priorities and wise spending. For instance, we need investment in Waverley station more than we need any other project and now that the minister has given a commitment to that&#8212;which was reiterated today&#8212;we need starting dates. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Sarah Boyack spoke eloquently on that subject.</p><p>I know from experience that lines in Ayrshire need longer platforms and better signalling. Longer platforms are also needed on the lines to Bathgate, East Kilbride and Fife, which Helen Eadie mentioned. More trained engineering staff are needed just to keep the network going. We need a clear funding commitment from the Executive and we need to decide whether, as Robin Harper said, spending on the rail network delivers value for money in comparison with other infrastructure projects.</p><p>We cannot afford to do everything and we certainly cannot afford still-greater levels of taxation, which constrains economic growth. Even if we cannot expand significantly our rail network, we must maintain what we have. New developments must be put in place, but only when a clear-cut economic case exists for doing so.</p><p>Those are the hard choices that we must make. I urge the Government to consider carefully, but positively, all of our options.</p>", "hdate": "2003-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13286963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the report on the rail industry in Scotland and I thank the Transport and the Environment Committee's clerks for all their hard work in preparing that enormous piece of work.

I welcome Des McNulty to the front bench. This is the first time that he has appeared in his ministerial role in a debate in which I have been involved.<place-holder colnum=\"16057\"/></p><p>The Building (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced on 18 September 2002, is welcome legislation. It updates the 1959 act and, in addition to making our legislation EU compliant, should simplify and modernise existing legislation. However, some issues need to be addressed in the debate, including verification, certification, costs to local authorities, functional design, building warrants and late applications.</p><p>The Conservatives welcome the Executive's proposal that verification should continue to be carried out by local authorities. We also welcome the opportunity for private sector verification to be introduced at a later date if required. I am content for us to wait to see how private sector verification works in England and Wales.</p><p>We heard conflicting evidence about whether private sector verification could deliver impartial, accountable and accessible enforcement powers. In my view, the jury is still out on the matter in England and Wales. However, if the private sector model works in the long term, there is no reason why we should not welcome it in Scotland.</p><p>I quote the ultra-cautious Institution of Civil Engineers:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The approved inspector system in England has offered the opportunity to provide tailored services on a commercial basis. Competition has delivered service improvements in both the public and the private sector in line with best-value policies.\"</p><p>If that view is still held in another three or five years, I can see no reason why our Government in Scotland should not introduce similar private sector verification. Indeed, to an extent, that is happening already in small local authorities that buy in verification services from larger and better equipped neighbouring authorities.</p><p>Certification is a vital part of the process. There is a need for certifiers to take a narrow role but to be aware of the overall design concept. Contracts above a certain size, which would be defined by ministers, should not be subject only to self-certification. Although I accept totally that a verifier must take the overview, it would also be important to encourage certifiers to be aware and to think holistically about the design concept. As buildings become more sophisticated and complex, there is a greater risk that fragmentation of design could lead to structural failure. Quite simply, the greater the number of people involved in considering the potential risks of a design concept, the more likely we are to avoid structural failures such as the Ronan Point disaster and accidents such as the Summerland fire.</p><p>In practice, a dialogue might take place between verifiers and certifiers, but the minister might wish to consider asking certifiers to consider during the certification process whether, in their view, the part <place-holder colnum=\"16058\"/> of the design that they are certifying creates any risk to the design concept as a whole.</p><p>I welcome the minister's conclusions that fees must be set to recover costs. It is worth noting that those costs could be significant for the property sector if local authorities are to be obliged to inspect existing buildings regularly to ensure that they are not dangerous.</p><p>The Executive must be aware that the financial cost to local authorities, as well as lack of funding, could delay the introduction of the new building standards system. It must ensure that adequate funding is provided. It would be unacceptable if delays in the verification process caused contractors and clients time and money as a result of deficiencies in and underfunding of local authority departments.</p><p>It is essential that functional standards be maintained and improved upon. Although I accept the Executive's intention to reduce prescription in functional design, I share the concern of the Disability Rights Commission that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"technical standards may no longer be mandatory.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Transport and the Environment Committee</em>, 6 November 2002; c 3615.]</p><p>Linda Fabiani also highlighted that concern.</p><p>There is an absolute need for ministers to reassure us that existing standards of accessibility will be built on rather than reduced. After the bill has been passed, I believe that the Scottish ministers will need to keep that matter under review.</p><p>I also want to refer in passing to the likelihood that the costs of indemnity insurance will escalate. We must be reassured that appropriate insurance will be available under the new regime. The minister must spell out how such arrangements would work before we proceed. Finally, the definition of \"owner of a building\" must be clarified, and I look forward to the Executive lodging suitable stage 2 amendments in that respect.

That said, the EU water framework directive recognises that each member state should have flexibility in implementing the directive appropriately. We welcome the recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate.</p><p>Although that flexible approach is welcome, it is where differences creep in. That is why today's stage 1 debate is so important. We support the principle of establishing single river basin management plans, with sub-basin management plans to support them. An holistic approach needs to be taken on creation of river basin management plans, but more work needs to be done to achieve an integrated approach that takes into account environmental, agricultural and forestry policy objectives. Unless an integrated approach is taken, taxpayers' money may be spent pursuing contradictory policy objectives, which must be avoided at all costs.</p><p>Speaking of costs, we also have reservations about that key aspect of the bill. Prior to September 2002, the Transport and the Environment Committee had no real indication of what the cost of implementing the bill would be&#8212;a glaring deficiency in the Executive's proposals. Ross Finnie's letter of September 2002 made the Executive's position a bit clearer and gave a range of implementation costs. Those costs will be low in relative terms until 2006 and will be borne almost entirely by SEPA. Thereafter, costs to a variety of sectors will be between &#163;60 million and &#163;100 million annually for the four years from 2006 to 2010. The Executive has estimated that the cost will be &#163;83 million annually.</p><p>We must hope that the estimates for the costs of the bill are accurate, because if they escalate significantly the already heavy burden of &#163;83 million on industry and other areas will become <place-holder colnum=\"14728\"/> crippling.

However, the Conservative party seeks today an assurance from the minister that the Government and any future Administration will be bound to keep future costs within the limits that are outlined in Ross Finnie's letter of September 2002 to the Transport and the Environment Committee.</p><p>Costs beyond 2011 will also be significant and will impact heavily on hydropower generation, agriculture and mining. We must set the benefits of the bill against those costs, which the financial memorandum estimates will total between &#163;141 million and &#163;324 million. However, the Finance Committee views those figures with considerable scepticism, which I share. That committee noted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The calculation of these benefits is in our view subjective\".</p><p>It comments robustly that it is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"misleading for the Executive and others to seek to rely on such figures which can in no way be substantiated.\"</p><p>Given the Executive's assertion that there will be significant benefit, it is surprising that evidence on the matter has been neither sought nor received from VisitScotland. Is that a failure of Government, of VisitScotland or of both? Is the truth that it is impossible to provide evidence that would demonstrate the benefits that the Government claims? Time will tell whether the benefits of the bill will outweigh the costs, but those costs will be a significant burden on Scottish Water and other businesses throughout Scotland, many of which are as yet unaware of the financial impact that the bill will have on them.</p><p>In our view, too many proposals will be implemented through subordinate legislation. Affirmative rather than negative procedure must be used in conjunction with adequate consultation. The proposals are unacceptable as they stand, although I welcome the comments that the minister has made on the matter today.</p><p>I note with regret Tricia Henton's resignation from SEPA last week and I pay tribute to her for the sterling work that she did during her time in office. The role of SEPA's next chief executive will be extremely demanding, given the Government's intention that the organisation should on the one hand make policy and advise Government, and on the other act as the regulator and enforcer of policy. That is a classic case of \"Who guards the guardians?\" Greater parliamentary and ministerial input will be required than has been outlined so far.</p><p>Flooding is a key issue with which the bill deals inadequately. Recent flooding throughout Scotland and the UK has again emphasised the scale of the problem that we face as global warming takes effect. In my view, some local authorities will in <place-holder colnum=\"14729\"/> future require help and expertise to create flood management solutions. Although that expertise might be available from the private sector, if it is unavailable in-house in local authorities, SEPA will need to be able to take an overview of flood management throughout Scotland. As a result of global warming, river basin management plans&#8212;incorporating flood prevention plans&#8212;will require significant additional funding from the Government. History suggests that funding will be inadequate to meet demand and that a bid system will have to be put in place so that funds can be allocated to the most needy projects.</p><p>The evaluation of bids will have to be carried out either by SEPA or by the Government. It is unreasonable to expect that, as the situation stands, SEPA will not have a role to play in that process, given its projected role as policy maker, adviser, regulator and enforcer of river basin management plans. SEPA is the only organisation that is able to deliver to Government a coherent, informed and uniform approach throughout Scotland. How else in future could projects be evaluated for Government? I do not suggest that SEPA should be responsible for funding or for carrying out any engineering works that are required, but rather that it should be involved only in flood management planning and evaluation of the bidding process that will emerge.</p><p>A new process of flood management project evaluation that is similar to the Scottish transport appraisal guidance may emerge. That would ensure that a consistent&#8212;rather than a political&#8212;approach was taken to funding more projects. I suggest that the Government will need to consider that in the near future.</p><p>I turn to aquaculture. We in the Conservative party believe that there is an urgent need for the transfer of planning powers from the Crown Estate to local authorities. On part 2 of the bill, steps must be taken to clarify the Government's position on infrastructure installation and the maintenance of sustainable urban drainage systems. Obstacles must not be put in the path of our continuing to develop social rented housing in rural areas, and the affordability of such projects, whether to the state or water consumers, will need to be debated by the Parliament on another occasion.</p><p>We welcome the bill subject to the concerns that I have expressed and those that my colleagues will express. We look forward to lodging appropriate amendments at stage 2. In the long term, the bill should deliver an enhanced and more sustainable water environment which, provided that it can be delivered cost-effectively, will be of benefit to future generations.</p>", "hdate": "2002-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13281418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a farmer. \"Water, water, everywhere,  Nor any drop to drink.\" Today, we find ourselves in a position a bit like that of the ancient mariner, burdened as we are with seeking to transpose the European Union water framework directive into Scots law.

It is a matter of regret that the Health and Community Care Committee has thus far refused to consider the health hazard of spreading blood and guts on agricultural land.

There is only so much work that a committee can undertake in any one session, and the Health and Community Care Committee has, unquestionably, had more than its fair share.

The Transport and the Environment Committee has heard no evidence about that, but it all increases the burden of regulation and cost on the farming community.</p><p>It is unreasonable to move the burden of proof from SEPA having to prove that agricultural contractors and farmers are causing a problem, to those contractors and farmers having to prove that they are not causing pollution.

Before I do that, I must say that rarely do Government reports leave one feeling angry and exasperated, but \"The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: Scotland\" does so. It does not acknowledge that the future of passenger air travel in Scotland has changed. Low-cost carriers and no-frills airlines are here to stay. Ryanair's importance to Prestwick and its contribution to growing the market&#8212;to which Brian Adam referred&#8212;cannot be underestimated.</p><p>Neither does the report acknowledge the phenomenal rate of passenger growth at Prestwick. It projects that 3 million passengers a year will pass through Prestwick only by 2030, whereas real-world estimates suggest that 3 million passengers will use Prestwick by 2005. The report puts Prestwick in the same category as Inverness and Dundee. Without being unkind to Inverness or Dundee, I say that the report could not be wider of the mark.</p><p>Prestwick is the only civil airport in Scotland with a 3,000m runway. It is virtually fog free. It has a <place-holder colnum=\"14526\"/> rail link that 30 per cent of its passengers use and an improving road and rail infrastructure. The completion of the A77 upgrade by 2006 will, in effect, make Glasgow Prestwick Glasgow's second airport. It is more accessible to Glasgow travellers than Stansted is to London travellers, as Prestwick is sited only 30 miles from Glasgow city centre. Furthermore, Prestwick can expand in its existing buildings to take more than 3 million passengers and further expansion can be accommodated on site without the need for land acquisition.</p><p>To put it simply, I see no need to develop a central Scotland airport at enormous cost, as the development of Prestwick as Glasgow's second airport can be achieved easily and at relatively little cost to the taxpayer. The &#163;1.5 billion for a central Scotland airport, plus the road and rail infrastructure costs, are costs that we can well do without when we have under-used assets at Prestwick with all the road and rail connectivity in place.</p><p>In addition, low-cost freight carriage may follow low-cost passenger flights in an increasingly competitive market. With its 3,000m runway, quick turnaround times and the potential for rail access, Prestwick has the capacity to facilitate that next step in freight growth. Of Scotland's airports, only Prestwick can accommodate a fully laden 747. To further enhance Prestwick as a freight destination, some freight must be moved from road to rail. I have discussed that idea with all the local stakeholders.</p><p>First, a feasibility study must be undertaken into moving freight from the airport on to the railway by means of a bridge or a tunnel. Secondly, we have to ensure that the rail line from Ayr to Glasgow is cleared to carry containers. That would enable the Ayr to Glasgow line to connect with the existing cleared line network that takes freight to the south of England and Europe. Just-in-time delivery, combined with low-cost freight flights and supported by quick turnaround times will make Prestwick the Scottish airport of choice for air freight in the next 20 years.</p><p>The people of Ayrshire take enormous pride in Prestwick and in its potential to become a niche hub for Scotland because of its maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, and its freight and low-cost travel capability. It is well recognised locally that Prestwick will be the engine of economic growth in the area. I believe that the future development of Prestwick enjoys the blessing of the public and politicians alike, which is important, as Sarah Boyack said.</p><p>In the present climate of low-cost travel, the development of Prestwick offers Scotland the ability to accommodate the increasing need for capacity in air travel for at least the next 20 years <place-holder colnum=\"14527\"/> at little or no cost to the public purse.

I hope that that answers Mr Lyon's question.</p><p>Since 1997, we have had a Labour Government <place-holder colnum=\"14122\"/> that knows little and cares less about rural areas. Since 1999, we have had a Lib-Lab coalition in power that chooses not to address the real issues and that, in the words of Iain McMillan of CBI Scotland, needs to be less \"self-indulgent\" and to \"grow up\". After Mr Lyon's performance, who could disagree with that?</p><p>Let us look at some of the problems. Business rates in Scotland put off would-be entrepreneurs in urban areas. The difficulties of starting up a business in rural areas are far greater, given the lack of skilled people and connectivity. It is little wonder that the rate of business start-ups in Scotland is 40 per cent below the figure for England and Wales, or&#8212;as David Ross said after 1,000 days of devolution&#8212;that people are discouraged by the fact that the Scottish Executive has delivered 1,000 new laws and 500 new regulations. Coincidentally, over the same period, the Scottish Executive has produced 1,244 reports, strategies, leaflets and reviews, none of which has contributed one penny to rural incomes.</p><p>After the extra burdens of regulation, reporting and additional taxation, is the outlook positive or negative? Has the framework to deliver a prosperous rural Scotland been put in place? If one were to ask those questions of any thinking person from a rural area, the answer would be a resounding no. Of course, the farmers' markets co-operative has been a success, given that, from a standing start in 1999, it now turns over &#163;12 million to &#163;15 million a year. Sadly, although that is a valuable model of how to create new small rural businesses without putting at risk a significant amount of capital, and however proud I may be of the co-operative, it will not solve the problems, because they are much deeper. The difficulties that rural Scotland faces are no longer the strong pound and the lack of access to export markets because of disease. The problems that we must address are much worse, and they are of the Parliament's making.</p><p>Allan Wilson referred to the importance of macroeconomic stability, but we face macroeconomic instability. We also face land reform legislation that promotes tenants' rights to buy and unfettered access to land, coupled with the impending unquantifiable cost of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill.

Let us turn the clock back to 1 April <place-holder colnum=\"13300\"/> and the formation of Scottish Water. In a speech on the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill, I said that the Scottish Conservative party would wait and see whether the new animal that is Scottish Water would deliver the goods for the Scottish public. I noted that its success would be judged on its ability to deliver high-quality, clean water economically, and said that we would reserve judgment until it did so.</p><p>I suppose that those were the natural misgivings of a party that regards Scottish Water as an experiment&#8212;an experimental type of company that pretends to be a public limited company but which is actually under the direct control of Ross Finnie.

Normally, radiation from the sun would be enough to destroy those oocysts, but in the wettest summer for many years the climatic conditions were such as to render a challenge to public health inevitable unless action was taken.</p><p>We all know that, mercifully, in the event no one died on this occasion from that mismanagement of the situation, but one is left with the feeling that that was only by the grace of God and not as a result of planning by Scottish Water.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13277829", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Water Supplies and Public Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "\"People could die,\" said no less a figure than Hugh Pennington. \"People will die because of cryptosporidium in the water, and the young and elderly will be most at risk.\" Those warnings are not the warnings of the Tory party in Scotland.

Is Scottish Water essentially exercising due diligence by removing those animals now, even if they were not removed before? Is the procurator fiscal considering whether an offence has been committed concerning the recent outbreaks? Will all livestock be taken off those areas in future?</p><p>Another question that needs to be answered is whether the Executive will be holding a public inquiry into the causes and effects of the cryptosporidium outbreak in the Glasgow water supply. Will the Executive be inviting the Food Standards Agency Scotland to review Scottish Water's practices and procedures, despite such scrutiny not being within its current remit and notwithstanding the investigations of the Bouchier expert group and the interim guidance notes that were issued today? Those questions need answers, and we need leadership.</p><p>Tough decisions need to be taken, but tougher decisions lie ahead for the Executive on the appealed planning decisions for the treatment works in east Dunbartonshire. Tough decisions need to be taken in the real world and not simply discussed by Labour back benchers and ministers. If Scottish Water is to build a water treatment plant, it may have to be a little more sympathetic to local public opinion. Seventeen other sites were available to Scottish Water; surely it is not beyond the wit of man to find a site that would have been agreeable to all. Perhaps a more considered and thorough approach by Scottish Water would have produced a different planning decision.</p><p>If the proposed site had been the only site available, the protesters, who are reasonable, would perhaps have taken a different view. All of them are as concerned as I am about public safety, but the proposed plant could have been sited just as effectively and efficiently elsewhere and with the blessing of public opinion.</p><p>Today, we must confront the reality of the planning decision and the issues that have been thrown up by it. The real issue in the real world is that the safety and quality of Glasgow's water supply cannot now be guaranteed for the foreseeable future. As a result of the planning decision that was taken last week, it will now be impossible for part of Glasgow's water supply to comply with the European Union directive on water quality by 2005. Even if the planning appeal <place-holder colnum=\"13302\"/> is fast-tracked and a decision to go ahead is given, a year will have been lost in respect of construction of the water treatment plant. On the other hand, if the appeal by Scottish Water is unsuccessful, the date for the provision of a water treatment plant will almost vanish into infinity. Either way, an EU directive will not be complied with. Under the second scenario, Glasgow residents may have to suffer a sub-standard water supply for many years to come.</p><p>One might shrug one's shoulders and say, \"The water will not be any different from what it has been in the past, so what is the problem?\" The real problem is the Executive's credibility. Its flagship new hybrid company under ministerial control will deliver water of a quality condemned not only by Brussels and the people of Glasgow&#8212;who must drink it whether it is harmful or not&#8212;but by the Prime Minister himself.</p><p>Scottish Water will deliver water that the Johannesburg summit would condemn in a developed country. The Prime Minister and Jack McConnell would condemn it in another country, but cannot deliver clean and safe drinking water in their own country. It ill becomes those two politicians to parade around Africa tut-tutting at water quality when Ross Finnie's water company has badly let them down.</p><p>Ross Finnie will squirm on the hook like a sprat&#8212;that is a Scottish type of prat&#8212;and, indeed, in his own eyes, he has almost absolved himself of all blame today, but the Scottish people are more observant and canny than he gives them credit for.

The problem looks even more acute when set against the backdrop of global warming, rising sea levels and the consequential loss of productive agricultural land. In order to avoid the Malthusian precipice, we have an obligation to future generations to develop plant forms to nourish our population.</p><p>Whatever we do must be safe and sustainable. Today, we are again debating the safety of a technology that, in its present state, poses more questions than answers. I suspect that all members would like to proceed with the development of GM organisms for the greater benefit of mankind, if we were safe in the knowledge that such organisms will not ultimately cause more problems than they solve. Neither Ross Finnie nor the scientific community have given us that reassurance. That is why the Conservative party believes that a fresh and complete review of all the scientific evidence should be undertaken. That is necessary not only on environmental grounds, but on public health grounds. It is no longer good enough for Minister Finnie to huff and puff indignantly that all is well because ACRE says so.

Today we face an identical situation with regard to GM crops and we are hearing an identical response from the Government. Once again, ministers are not prepared to make decisions, but are following the scientific advice that is available in one area only. I understand the dilemma that ministers face.

The reasons for that are not hard to find. In 1998, Scotland produced 15 million tonnes of waste, and that figure is rising. In 2001, only 6 per cent of waste was recycled, and the bulk of the rest went to landfill. Landfill resources are a scarce and declining asset in Scotland, so something must be done.</p><p>In 1991, the then Government set targets for waste recycling in the UK. One target was for 25 per cent of household waste to be recycled by 2000. We recycled 4.5 per cent by 2000, so not much progress has been made. The UK and Scotland are so far behind that it is possible to claim that that is an advantage. Scotland need not test strategies to address its problems&#8212;as we are so far behind, we can look around the world and copy best practice from pioneers.</p><p>We are playing catch-up with our waste strategy, which we must get right from now on. We and the Executive must seize the initiative and put in place targets and policies. We can no longer afford the luxury of fridge mountains rusting away all over Scotland in heaps that are the size of Holyrood. We must no longer encourage the incineration of waste, as time and technology have moved on, and better practice is available. Incineration must become the last resort for waste disposal. I welcome the minister's comments on that.</p><p>Instead, we must examine ways of reducing waste and dealing with it as a valuable commodity that is to be recycled, recovered or composted. To achieve worthwhile waste reduction, we must first note European policy and the European Union's environment action programme&#8212;the latest is called \"Environment 2010: Our future, Our choice\".</p><p>In practical terms, businesses will have to embrace the development of an integrated product policy that will minimise the life-cycle impact of products.

In that year alone, the Tweed fishing was worth &#163;12.5 million to the Borders economy. Scottish salmon fishing contributes enormously to the tourism industry and its charm and excitement attract high-spending fishermen from all over the world. However, we should it bear in mind that, primarily, fishermen need fish in order to pursue their sport and that they can pursue their sport anywhere from British Columbia in the west to Russia in the east. Unless we attract and keep those customers in a competitive world market, we will quickly lose them. Indeed, unless we do all that we can to protect and support salmon rivers, we could lose a valuable national asset.</p><p>There are many threats to our freshwater salmon. First, there is the coalition Government, whose Land Reform (Scotland) Bill is already reducing the continuous investment that is needed in Scotland's rivers. Those misplaced reforms will do more to destroy the industry than any other threat. Other problems to be faced include seal predation, which has not yet been adequately addressed. Perhaps the establishment of a seal commission, similar to the Red Deer Commission, would go some way toward addressing that. Mink also pose a threat, as do poachers. The only reason why poaching is not a bigger threat is because of the problem of low-cost farm salmon.</p>", "hdate": "2002-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13272748", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freshwater Fish and Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak in the debate as a boyhood angler, but one who has never actively fished for salmon&#8212;although I am open to offers.

There, the fish leap needs to be redesigned and the dam needs to be repaired, but money cannot be found for either task. The fish stocks are suffering and will continue to do so. The problem of the Ayr illustrates my point that wild salmon fisheries are a fragile asset.

Others have spoken about Barra and Yell; I wish to deal with Arran and areas in the south of Scotland, from which I have received a large amount of post.</p><p>In Arran and the south of Scotland, there has been an erosion of the rights of individual farmers. It used to be believed that if one bought and paid for a property&#8212;a piece of land&#8212;one had the right to do with it largely what one pleased. The land had an open market value that reflected the flexibility in its farming capacity. Now, across Scotland, those rights are being eroded in the 12.8 per cent of Scotland's landmass that is designated by SNH. It is therefore little wonder that people are <place-holder colnum=\"11091\"/> up in arms, especially as in many cases designations reflect decades, if not centuries, of care that SNH now says landowners are not to be trusted to continue carrying out properly.</p><p>We all understand that, under EU legislation, SNH has to make designations. The problems are being caused by the way in which it goes about that task.</p><p>Once land is designated, it may become almost valueless. No longer can its farming value be underpinned by a forestry or sporting valuation, as trees cannot be planted on it and sporting rights cannot be fully exercised over it. Neither can the land be improved or diversified&#8212;the list of potentially damaging operations sees to that. A piece of land&#8212;a farm&#8212;is effectively freeze-framed. A snapshot is taken and, under the designations, the land must apparently remain in that condition for ever.</p><p>All that might be bearable if it were done reasonably, but in many cases that is not happening. Letter after letter speaks of SNH's arrogance and inflexibility. Letter after letter speaks of its inability to recognise&#8212;even at the margin&#8212;the socio-economic consequences of its actions, to which Tavish Scott referred in his speech and at question time. A reasonable person might expect that when owners and tenants lose their rights, freedoms and earning capacity, compensation would be paid and socio-economic considerations would be taken into account, but that is not happening. That is one reason for the current state of affairs.</p><p>I do not believe that SNH is happy with what it is doing or about the ill feeling that it is incurring. Farmers are certainly unhappy at having what they can do with their land restricted. A feeling is being fostered of creeping land nationalisation and state control.</p><p>It is necessary for SNH and the Executive to take a more sympathetic approach to the problems that are caused by these designations. Perhaps reform of SNH is required, but a better way must be found. If it is not, disillusionment with SNH&#8212;and, indeed, with the Parliament&#8212;can only grow.

The Scottish Agricultural College is proposing to destroy Auchincruive. We all agree that there is a need for change and progress, but everyone in Ayrshire is unhappy at what is being proposed. The students at Auchincruive are unhappy because they have not been consulted or considered. The staff are unhappy and demoralised because they, too, have not been consulted about the development of the plans&#8212;indeed, they usually learn of such developments from the press. The partner organisations and stakeholders at Auchincruive are also unhappy. Those involved in the tourism <place-holder colnum=\"10607\"/> industry, the food industry, forestry, horticulture and agriculture are unhappy because they are all about to be left high and dry.</p><p>As Adam Ingram said, Auchincruive has delivered on its vision statement to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"enhance the sustainability of rural areas and communities and the viability of the industries on which they depend.\"</p><p>It is already delivering in educational terms what Ross Finnie asked for in \"A Forward Strategy for Agriculture\". Auchincruive is a Scottish rural resource that delivers integrated and cohesive, yet diversified, education to degree standard for rural students. The current plans will destroy that.</p><p>One member of staff told me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If we didn't have Auchincruive, we would be trying to invent it.\"</p><p>That aptly describes the views expressed in much of the correspondence that I have received on the matter, some of which the minister has seen.</p><p>Auchincruive is the jewel in the crown of the SAC. It is a degree-awarding institution in its own right and, with about 60 per cent of the SAC's students, it is the hub of the SAC's teaching capability. Maitland Mackie and his board want to relocate that facility to Aberdeen and Edinburgh, but he forgets that many of the students who currently attend Auchincruive have already scorned Aberdeen and Edinburgh to come to Auchincruive because of its international reputation. Given that more than 50 per cent of Auchincruive's students have Ayrshire postcodes, most would not or could not attend Aberdeen or Edinburgh. In effect, the SAC would lose its teaching capacity and with that its research capability. In short, the filleting of Auchincruive would destroy the SAC.</p><p>Of course the SAC must address its future and its debt of about &#163;9 million&#8212;we would be castigating it if it did not&#8212;but throwing the baby out with the bath water is not the answer. I have no problem with change, but any change must be for the better. Moving agriculture education into Ayr town centre is not a practical option, even if it were achievable.</p><p>An alternative plan must be produced that puts Auchincruive at the heart of the SAC's future operations. An option might be to return to a more regional structure with better links between universities, colleges of further education, Scottish agricultural and biological research institutes and the state veterinary service.</p><p>At any rate, the SAC or perhaps independent consultants must come up with alternative proposals. If they are not prepared to do so and the board of the SAC is not prepared to do so, they must stand aside and let others take up the challenge. If assets or buildings need to be sold, <place-holder colnum=\"10608\"/> so be it. If new partners need to be found and new partnerships need to be entered into, so be it.</p><p>Imaginative solutions must be found to address those problems satisfactorily from a Scotland-wide perspective. I urge the minister to use his influence to ensure that there is a future for the SAC with Auchincruive at the heart of it.</p><p>If the minister does not stop the vandalism, such an act of agricultural terrorism will leave Scotland without an integrated, high-quality teaching and research resource and we will all be the poorer.</p>", "hdate": "2002-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13270637", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Agricultural College, Auchincruive"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Adam Ingram on securing today's debate.

Scottish Water's creation will deliver the necessary infrastructure and investment to bring our water and sewerage services up to UK and European standards. Obviously, one must welcome that.</p><p>The creation of Scottish Water will produce a merger dividend of at least &#163;100 million and the new company's size will result in synergies and economies of scale that are essential for survival in the competitive environment that Scottish Water is about to enter.</p><p>I have served on the Transport and the Environment Committee since last summer and have been involved in taking only part of the evidence and in stages 1 and 2 of the bill.

Everyone in their own way has had an input to what they believe will be in the best interests of the new Scottish Water and we all wish it success. However, as we launch the company, we must not get too starry-eyed about its prospects. We must remember that its creation is a huge development, which uses taxpayers' money, and that its success is not guaranteed. The company's biggest obstacles will be Government interference and Scottish ministers' temptation to meddle and interfere excessively. That must not be allowed. Indeed, Parliament will have a duty to ensure that that does not happen. The new company must be given freedom to breathe, develop, grow and enter into a competitive market with other UK water companies.</p><p>We in Scotland want Scottish Water to rank with the best UK privatised companies, yet fulfil its obligations to its staff, the environment and the people of urban and rural Scotland.

That is not because it would be difficult to disagree with Sylvia Jackson and her eloquent argument, but because there is a <place-holder colnum=\"5913\"/> need for pollution release and transfer registers. However, Sylvia Jackson will not be disappointed to know that the element of caution on my part comes from the increased cost to industry that the proposals would bring.</p><p>There is no doubt that the argument for PRTRs is well made; that is evidenced by their adoption all over the world. The Aarhus convention of 1998 and EC directive 96/61/EEC on integrated pollution prevention and control are moving us towards the development of PRTRs and a publicly accessible register, which has to be a good thing.</p><p>As Sylvia Jackson pointed out, Scotland lags behind the rest of the world in that respect, and lags significantly behind England and Wales. The fact that Scotland is using only the integrated pollution control system tells its own story. Of course, the upgraded integrated pollution prevention and control system, which will be introduced in 2003 and will report on only 50 substances, will be important. However, that only emphasises how far behind we are, worldwide, in best practice and in making such information publicly available.</p><p>In America, as has been said, the toxic relief inventory system website reports on more than 600 substances. As Sylvia Jackson said, Australia has a successful national pollution inventory. Sylvia Jackson also pointed out&#8212;we all seem to be referring to the same briefing paper&#8212;that, significantly, the first-year costs to industry of setting up the inventory ranged from &#163;75 to &#163;3,800. Nonetheless, a PRTR in Scotland will, and must, come about as a result of the Aarhus convention and the EC directive; in honesty, it cannot come quickly enough.</p><p>SEPA's broad shoulders will have to be broadened further. The Scottish Executive will have to provide new funding to support data gathering and auditing and the development of a public access database. I look forward to the minister's comments on that.</p><p>If we are to catch up with England and Wales, never mind the rest of the world, SEPA will have to establish protocols and research programmes and the Executive will have to establish criteria and time scales for compliance.

This is an important subject and I believe that there is an exciting future ahead for employment in the environment generally and in the renewable energy, recycling and tourism industries in particular.</p><p>There is growing interest, particularly among young people, in environmental matters. The prospect of employment in a related industry is what many are looking for. Many students, in their gap year, pay to work on environmental enhancement projects all over the world. That demonstrates people's growing interest in making a career in such fields.</p><p>It is clear that the renewable energy market will continue to grow. Whatever the outcome of the energy review that is being undertaken, there is a looming energy gap. The challenge for the renewable energy industry is to fill that gap as efficiently as possible. That is an exciting prospect.</p><p>If the demand for renewable energy grows, the work force must grow as well. One of the factors that limit the growth and development of the industry is the small number of skilled and capable people who are available. If we are to develop renewable energy, we must recognise that training and education must be provided. If we are serious <place-holder colnum=\"5727\"/> about creating sustainable jobs in the environment, a new range of skills will need to be developed in schools, colleges and universities. That is a vital point.</p><p>When the appropriate skills sets are available, we will be able more readily to develop our renewable energy resources, whether in wind farming, wave power, tidal power or the deriving of energy through biomass production. One can imagine a new offshore industry growing up around tidal power generation with on-going construction and maintenance work being required, just as the oil industry requires it. Indeed, as jobs in the oil sector decline, one can imagine that they will be replaced by jobs in wave energy and tidal power generation.</p><p>Energy-saving policies will create jobs as well. Encouraging the installation of insulation and double-glazing across the UK would boost the building trades. We should promote that.</p><p>Of greatest importance is the technology that will be required to deliver renewable energy. It is important to draw the attention of entrepreneurs to opportunities in that area. We have the brains and we must develop in Scotland and the UK the skills and the technology to enable us to capitalise on what are likely to be enormous markets. If this debate alerts manufacturers to possibilities that would not otherwise have been thought of, it will have served a useful purpose.</p><p>I turn to recycling. A particular interest of mine&#8212;and of Fiona McLeod and other members&#8212;is the recycling of fridges. The fridge mountain grows daily. The Executive must do more than it is with its current policy of sitting, hoping that a solution for the disposal of fridges will appear. I welcome Fiona McLeod's announcement on fridge disposal. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that 2 million domestic fridges are replaced each year in the United Kingdom. Although 40 per cent of such fridges used to be recycled to developing countries, that can no longer be done under European Union regulations. I am delighted to hear that Remploy is taking up the baton and running with it. I would be interested to know whether it will be able to dispose of all Scotland's fridges, which must be a significant number indeed.</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13265207", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Environmentally Sustainable Employment and Recycling"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome in part Robin Harper's huge motion.

I want the Executive to note the headline in today's edition of the <i>Ayrshire Post</i> :</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Cancer fears mount as fourth specialist quits\".</p><p>That succinctly catches the mood of people in Ayrshire. I also speak on behalf of the concerned constituents who contacted me about the Beatson centre and about the withdrawal of clinics from Ayrshire to Glasgow.</p><p>As members have said, the situation at the Beatson oncology centre has become untenable <place-holder colnum=\"4794\"/> and the prospects for cancer care for the 60 per cent of Scotland's population that is covered by the centre decline daily. Yesterday in the chamber, I heard and welcomed Malcolm Chisholm's Pauline conversion to Conservative policy&#8212;his commitment to using private care facilities to treat NHS patients. I welcomed that, because with Dr Adrian Harnett's resignation last week from the Beatson centre, Ayrshire hospitals lost not only a consultant but a highly regarded man who is at the top of his profession.</p><p>I understand that, as a result of Dr Harnett's resignation, breast cancer care in Ayrshire will be reduced by up to 50 per cent and post-operative care clinics might be withdrawn from Ayrshire and go to Glasgow in the short term. Like Nicola Sturgeon, I seek the minister's assurance that those services will be reinstated as soon as is humanly possible. Of course, if another consultant were appointed, that cover would be resumed. However, instead of queuing up to join the once-famous Beatson oncology centre, by all accounts consultants are queuing up to leave.</p><p>The catalogue of mismanagement and lack of man-management is simply breathtaking. The fact that Dr Harnett apparently resigned without a job to go to paints a picture of despair within the centre&#8212;despair among the staff at excessive work loads and at a situation for the improvement of which they think there are no prospects. As my colleague Mary Scanlon said, it is simply unacceptable to have Karol Sikora, an eminent professor of clinical oncology, describe conditions at the Beatson as similar to the third world. It is truly worrying for him to talk of \"Stalinist solutions\" as having been the management style at the Beatson.</p><p>That is why I welcome Malcolm Chisholm's new, pragmatic approach. He will allow patients who would otherwise have been penalised by old Labour policies to be treated at HCI. That is good news for Ayrshire. Waiting lists and waiting times that would have risen immediately as a result of understaffing at the Beatson might not rise so quickly.</p><p>If beds and treatment for Ayrshire patients cannot be found in Glasgow or elsewhere in Scotland, the minister must be prepared to find bed space and facilities in England and Wales. In a worst case scenario, bed space and treatment facilities could and should be sought abroad, because it is a fact that if people have&#8212;or believe that they might have&#8212;cancer, they will travel huge distances to receive treatment, if need be.</p><p>Finally, I appeal to Dr Harnett to stay at the Beatson. If he has not yet taken a job elsewhere&#8212;I believe that he has not&#8212;I am sure that the Parliament, to a man, would ask him to reconsider his position and stay on at the Beatson. With a <place-holder colnum=\"4795\"/> new minister and a new director in charge, surely things can only get better.

As I raised at committee, that would mean that, if the WIC were to set water prices at an inappropriate time in the eyes of the Executive&#8212;say before an election&#8212;the WIC might be unable to set the prices that Scottish Water needs in order to function efficiently. That is vitally important. We in the Conservative party are determined that the new company must deliver water cheaply and competitively in line with what is being delivered by the water companies in England and Wales.</p><p>I welcome the creation of the water industry commissioner's role, but I see a huge risk that his position could be overruled and compromised by ministers for reasons of political expediency. If such a contentious scenario were to come to pass it would, once again, take management eyes off the ball. Those are just a few of the problems that I foresee. I believe that the new chief executive will need to be very strong and focused to deal with ministers, MSPs and so on at the same time as creating a new and vibrant business.</p><p>Another area that needs to be examined is the <place-holder colnum=\"4554\"/> structure of the board, which, as proposed, is unsound. The balance between executive and non-executive directors needs to be moved so that it is less in favour of executive directors and more in favour of non-executive directors. Instead of the current proposal, as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill, there should be no more than four executive directors and a minimum of six fully empowered non-Executive directors. I welcome the minister's assurances on that matter this morning.</p><p>The water industry panels, while superficially an attractive idea, are another potential source of problems. Put simply, if those panels are strong enough to make a difference, they will almost certainly interfere with the efficient running of the company. If they are not strong enough to make a difference, they will only be talking shops and of little value. The role of those panels will need to be more clearly defined than it is at present. I am far from certain that the minister's comments on that today provide the clarification that we need.</p><p>There is also the issue of full commercial freedom. It is already clear that Scottish Water will not be given the freedom to do as it pleases. The authority will be unable to seize a commercial opportunity if it presents itself, because the Executive and the water industry commissioner are afraid that by giving it full freedom it might start to think and behave like a plc.

The minister cannot tell me that the water companies in England&#8212;which are, after all, the model upon which Scottish Water is based&#8212;which, as the reports show, provide cheaper and cleaner water than we have in Scotland, do not operate in the public interest. To say that would be, at best, naive. Scottish taxpayers should be under no illusion: this is a huge experiment, funded by their money, which may or may not work. As a businessman and as a member of the Transport and the Environment Committee, I genuinely wish the new company well. However, the Parliament must be aware that success is not guaranteed.</p><p>Turning to other parts of the committee report, I wish to address matters that are perhaps less contentious. First, there is the efficient collection of moneys, which is vital to the cash flow of the new business. At the moment we are all aware that water charges are collected by local authorities. Scottish Water must move away from that situation as quickly as possible. With many councils' debt collection records being as they are, the inability to collect debt could be the difference between profit and loss and between the success and failure of the project. It is essential that the company takes on the collection of its own debts and moneys as quickly and efficiently as possible rather than putting itself in the hands of 32 local authorities, whose collective track record of council and water charge collection is at best poor and at worst potentially damaging to the new company, which we all want to succeed.</p><p>Another issue is the new company's position as <place-holder colnum=\"4556\"/> the provider of last resort. We believe that it is right and proper that Scottish Water should be the provider of last resort to the Scottish people.</p><p>Like others, I welcome the minister's commitment to leave in place for another year the dispensation that allows water to be delivered free of charge to registered charities. That said, I accept the minister's view that it is an unfair burden on the new company that water should be given free to charities when electricity and gas are not. I therefore cautiously welcome his undertaking to establish a review of the whole situation of charitable reliefs, in order that a more broad-based support scheme for deserving charities can be developed. I ask that that be done as a matter of urgency.</p><p>We welcome the Scottish Executive's initiative in introducing the bill. Although we welcome the new commercial freedom to be found in the bill, it is a halfway house. The new company is essentially a hybrid, a compromise and an admission that the Executive aspires to the private sector model. The bill recognises that privatisation of water worked in England and Wales. Sadly, the Executive does not have the confidence to take the industry out of public sector control. That is why the bill contains contradictions, some of which I have highlighted. Time will tell whether the model is a success. In the meantime, the Conservatives will monitor the situation.</p><p>We hope that Scottish Water delivers the service that the people of Scotland deserve and expect. We will monitor its progress carefully over the months and years ahead, and observe how it performs in comparison with the private sector down south, which, despite what the SNP says, is delivering cleaner and cheaper water for consumers. If further change is necessary, it will be based on an open-minded examination of the evidence and facts and a judgment made purely on the interests of Scottish consumers and taxpayers. While we accept the broad principles of the bill today, we of course reserve our right to lodge amendments at stages 2 and 3.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13261960", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Industry (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A private company could still operate very much in the public interest.

After that debacle, the Labour Government rightly launched a public inquiry, and this is a disaster of similar proportions. I am sure that George Lyon will concede, in his inimitably gracious way, that the Tory Government of the day at all times followed the best scientific advice that was available to it. As the foot-and-mouth disaster affected not only farmers, but almost every business in Britain, it is vital that lessons that were wilfully ignored following the previous foot-and-mouth outbreak of 1967 are learned this time around. They should be set in tablets of stone, as a reference point for any future outbreak.</p><p>So far, the UK Government has offered three inquiries instead of an overarching one, and they have almost certainly been designed to let the Government and DEFRA off the hook. Many questions still need to be answered. Why did the disease spread so quickly? Why was there such a delay in slaughtering animals? Why was the contiguous cull introduced, rather than vaccinations? Why were vaccinations not available? Why was the Government not better informed about a vaccination policy and better able to inform the farming community&#8212;which was bitterly opposed to a vaccination policy, as was I&#8212;about it, even though it might not have been the right course to pursue? Why were people allowed to transport dead infected animals through uninfected areas, and why were the most basic animal welfare issues ignored in the slaughter policy? Above all, why were the lessons of the Northumberland report totally ignored?</p><p>We need assurances that the lessons that were <place-holder colnum=\"3760\"/> so expensively learned this year will be logged into the memory banks and acted on in future. However, without a full-scale public inquiry, there will be no definitive report, no minister or DEFRA official will be held to account, and any future outbreak will again be characterised by muddle and ignorance.</p><p>Another aspect of the outbreak has been its effect on other industries, especially tourism. In Ayrshire, the effect on tourism has been marked. The number of hotel bookings has fallen and tourist spend in the area is down, yet the compensation that has been made available to businesses elsewhere in the south-west has not been made available to my constituents, who have also been affected by the crisis. I appreciate that we have not faced problems on the scale of those faced in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders; nonetheless, tourism has been significantly affected and nothing has been done to help the contiguous counties.</p><p>In conclusion, I call on Parliament to support Alex Fergusson's motion to hold a public inquiry.

At the moment, people throughout Scotland are farming without hope or income. Farm borrowings are at an all-time high and, despite &#163;450 million of public support, most farmers will make a loss in this financial year.</p><p>The Executive motion is fine and \"A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture\" is fine, but there is nothing particularly new or revealing in either. Land management contracts are not a new idea. In fact, I and others wrote a paper for the NFU in 1997, partly on that subject. My fear then, as now, was that, as Alex Fergusson said, such contracts would mean less support in the end for agriculture. I hope that the minister will prove me wrong in that respect, but that is my fear.</p><p>In 1996-97, when we considered land management contracts, Scottish net farm incomes were &#163;470 million, and the support levels were similar to those of today. As the minister and Elaine Murray said, BSE and the foot-and-mouth outbreak have cut those incomes to less than a tenth of that figure. Last year, I believe that net Scottish farm incomes&#8212;I do not mean profit&#8212;totalled around &#163;35 million. Members will understand why farmers are in despair.</p><p>A forward strategy as a wish list is fine, but where are the proposals that will return profitability to the industry? Where is the cash to deliver the much-vaunted agri-environment schemes?</p><p>The reality of hands-on farming is more and more paperwork, increasing costs in the livestock sector in tagging animals, extra transport and not enough hours in the day to complete movement licences or wash out floats or trailers.</p><p>Despite Ross Finnie's best intentions, which I do not doubt, almost every source of income in the industry is declining. Export markets are firmly closed and are likely to remain so for the <place-holder colnum=\"3057\"/> forseeable future&#8212;if the minister tells me otherwise, I will be delighted. As a result, returns from the marketplace cannot be found. Export markets that have been built up patiently over the past 30 years have all gone. Unless and until those markets are reopened, all the strategies&#8212;forward or otherwise&#8212;will not make a jot of difference.</p><p>Indeed, such strategies are little short of insulting to many farmers as they do not confront the real problems of day-to-day farming. They are certainly insulting in respect of improving the environment. The Scottish rural stewardship scheme is heavily over-subscribed. Of the &#163;30 million that has been earmarked for agri-environment schemes this year, my estimate is that only around &#163;3.5 million will be left for the new rural stewardship scheme.</p><p>Environmental enhancement, which is much desired by everyone in the industry, cannot be delivered by farmers who are fighting to put food on the family table.

With farm incomes at an all-time low, especially LFA farm income, the introduction of this scheme <place-holder colnum=\"436\"/> could not have come at a worse time.</p><p>We have heard talk of winners and losers. That is the crux of the problem. As Alex Fergusson said, the new scheme will apparently create more losers than winners. I do not know of anyone south of Stirling or east of Inverness and Pitlochry who will benefit from this scheme, yet those are the main food producing areas of Scotland.</p><p>The scheme will transfer precious funding away from farms that are economically hanging on by their fingertips to the even more disadvantaged farms in the north and west. I am not saying that the north and west should not be supported and funded. On the contrary, those areas, along with all the Scottish islands and the crofting communities, should receive extra special consideration and support. What I am saying is that this new scheme is not the way to do it.</p><p>Key to the whole question is how SERAD defines permanent grassland and rough grazing. If SERAD generously interprets the term \"permanent grassland\", the damage to farm incomes will not be so great in some cases. If SERAD classifies as rough grazing land that many farmers believe to be permanent grassland, many more farms will become totally unviable&#8212;which is a polite way of saying that they will go bankrupt. Furthermore, the classification in the south of Scotland that differentiates between moorland farmland and southern upland might also lead to further losses in income for many.</p><p>Simply put, the level of environmental support for moorland farms in the south of Scotland, and I suspect throughout the whole of Scotland, will not make up for the loss of headage payments under the old hill livestock compensation allowance scheme. This deal appears to satisfy no one, neither crofters nor most farmers in the north and south of Scotland.</p><p>I know that, in his summing-up, the minister will say that he had no choice but to accept this scheme and that his hand was forced by Brussels. However, it will not put him out of business; instead, as the scheme stands, it will put many of Scotland's hill farmers out of business in three years' time.

I also welcome the minister's announcement of &#163;50,000 to be made available to the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution.</p><p>This debate is characterised, as was the debate on fishing, by the sense of anguish felt by those directly involved. The worst fears of the 13 farmers whose stock has been wiped out have been realised; I share their anguish. We can only hope, for the rest of Scotland that is under siege, that a policy of containment works. However, it is not just the farmers who are suffering as they find themselves unable to move their stock from field to field, from field to farm, from farm to market or from farm to farm. The families are also suffering, with children wondering whether the farm dogs, the pet lambs, the farmyard hens and even the hamster will be put down when the dreaded phone call comes.</p><p>We should spare a thought for those who live by rural tourism and who, even as we speak, are cancelling hard-won bookings in an internationally competitive market. As members have said, we should also remember the hauliers and the livestock marts that are lying quiet. Those people make their daily bread by trading in livestock and meeting the market demand for beef and lamb.</p><p>That brings me to a general point that must be made today. Many in the press and elsewhere are suggesting that if there had been a network of small local abattoirs, this disaster would not have happened. Nothing can be further from the truth; and those who are promoting that idea are either misinformed or peddling their own agendas. The fact is that this outbreak probably boils down to the inadequate treatment of pigswill, and I believe that feeding swill to pigs should have been stopped long ago&#8212;indeed, I honestly thought that it had been.</p><p>We must examine the possibility of operating more small abattoirs in the current financial climate to satisfy the growing demand for locally produced food. At the moment, many abattoirs are uneconomic, and small ones that cannot achieve <place-holder colnum=\"350\"/> economies of scale are simply not viable. That situation has come about because each successive food scare has brought in its wake increased regulation, to try to stop similar problems recurring. For example, there was increased regulation after the salmonella in eggs crisis, the BSE crisis and the E coli crisis; and it will follow this crisis as well. The burden of payment for the extra costs of that increased regulation has fallen on the industry itself. Unlike in the rest of Europe, where national Governments pay for the policing of public health, in this country the public health bill in this sector is largely funded by the industry itself.</p><p>That is why small abattoirs cannot exist across the country. Making veterinary inspections available costs the same for a small abattoir with a low throughput as it does for a large abattoir with a greater throughput. As a result, unless the Government&#8212;of whatever colour&#8212;is about to pick up the bill, the economies of the marketplace will dictate the matter, and only a few large abattoirs across the country will survive. The Maclean task force report must therefore be fully implemented.</p><p>Consumers also have a hand to play. Time after time, surveys at point of sale have shown that people who buy their food from supermarket shelves say that they are prepared to pay more for&#8212;and would like to buy&#8212;high-welfare, high-health-status British beef, pork, chicken and lamb.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13247112", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crisis in Rural Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In speaking in the debate, I must declare an interest as a working farmer who is responsible for 100 suckler cows and calves and about 1,600 breeding sheep.

The yard's second dry dock was opened in 1899 and, after refurbishment in 1937, was extended to its present size, to accommodate ships up to 120m in length. It is the only dry dock of that size in the west of Scotland and so has strategic significance in defence terms.</p><p>To jump forward quickly, after trading through the years variously as Ferguson Brothers (Port Glasgow), as part of the Scott Lithgow group, as Ferguson Ailsa, as Ailsa-Perth Transport and as Appledore Ferguson Shipbuilders, the yard was sold in March 1996 to Cathelco of Chesterfield. It appeared that, under the name of Ailsa-Troon Ltd, the yard's future for shipbuilding was again secure.</p><p>Members may remember that 1999 was one of the yard's busiest years. It had a healthy order book and Caledonian MacBrayne was using it for its annual ferry maintenance programme. In May 1999, Alasdair Bisset, then chief executive of the yard, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The yard is ideally placed to compete for repair and refit work for vehicles trading along the UK's West Coast.\"</p><p>At that point, Ailsa-Troon employed 287 people. In the summer of 1999, the yard was competing for contracts at home and abroad. It had a &#163;20 million landing craft contract with the Ministry of Defence, a &#163;5.5 million contract with CalMac for a new 50m ferry for the inner Hebrides and a full repair and refit order book. All appeared to be going well. A further boost was given to the yard in May 1999, when it became eligible for funding <place-holder colnum=\"1186\"/> from the shipbuilding intervention fund. In July 1999, John Home Robertson toured the thriving yard. On 15 December 1999, Mr Bisset said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are very pleased with the progress that the company has made in increasing its share of the available repair work and it will certainly be a record year for the yard.\"</p><p>It seems as though that was almost the kiss of death for the yard because, thereafter, despite a full order book and a huge number of buoyant press releases, things seemed to go horribly wrong. Less than a year later, the yard was closed and everyone was laid off.</p><p>On 7 June 2000, 95 staff were laid off and Cathelco talked about a downturn in the market&#8212;a gap in the order book. On 18 August 2000, the real hammer blow came, when Cathelco effectively announced the closure of the yard, with a further 70 lay-offs. It was announced at the time that around 20 people would remain to finish existing contracts.</p><p>By October 2000, just four months ago, most of the staff had been made redundant and had been given reasonable redundancy packages. However, the 16 key workers who were hand-picked and, indeed, implored to stay on by Cathelco did not, at that time, receive their redundancy packages. Instead, they were assured that, on completion of the work, they would be paid in full. Given that all their colleagues had been adequately compensated for their redundancies, those loyal men and key workers had no reason to doubt that assurance.</p><p>However, in December 2000, as the work finished, instead of being given their redundancy packages&#8212;which totalled some &#163;300,000&#8212;the men were told that they would in effect receive no payment from Cathelco, as the yard had been put into administration by its owners. That meant that the 16 key staff would become creditors of Ailsa-Troon&#8212;not even preferred creditors, at that. I believe that that is a heinous situation. Were it not for the redundancy payment service, the men would have been left with nothing. Some of them had worked there all their life&#8212;in particular, Mr Dykes, who has spent much of his working life there since 1954.</p><p>Cross-party pleas to Cathelco to do the decent thing by those men have fallen on deaf ears. One is left with the conclusion that Ailsa-Troon was, under Cathelco's ownership, at first badly managed then desperately managed, seeking work that yielded no profit. In the final analysis, the yard has been asset-stripped. I do not at all support Cathelco's proposal to change the site from industrial to residential and leisure use.</p><p>The whole affair, as I am sure all members will agree, has left a very bad taste in Troon and in the west of Scotland. The purpose of today's debate is <place-holder colnum=\"1187\"/> to try to shame Cathelco to do the decent thing by its former employees. It appears that Cathelco has not broken the law, but its actions are, for me&#8212;and I suspect for everyone else in the chamber&#8212;morally repugnant. Cathelco has e-mailed me and other members to tell us of its financial difficulties. None the less, I believe that it has a moral obligation to its employees, particularly those who, by staying at the yard, kept both Ailsa-Troon and Cathelco afloat until Cathelco management cut its ties and responsibility by putting Ailsa-Troon into administration.</p><p>In order to shame Cathelco into doing the right thing, I have also asked Tony Benn MP, in whose constituency of Chesterfield Cathelco's head office is situated, about the matter. He and I have asked Stephen Byers of the Department of Trade and Industry whether that department and the Ministry of Defence will withhold future Government contracts from the company until it pays its employees the difference between what they should have been paid and what they have received from the redundancy payment service.</p><p>Given the scale of job losses in Troon caused by the closure of the shipyard, I ask the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and Gaelic whether he has any special plans to encourage the creation of new jobs in that part of Ayrshire to replace the 287 that were recently lost. I know that that is also a matter of concern to my colleagues. In asking him that question, I welcome yesterday's confirmation of objective 2 funding for the west of Scotland and recognise that Troon will benefit from that eventually, if not immediately. I also look forward to welcoming Wendy Alexander to Ayrshire on 28 February, when I hope she will have concrete proposals to make.</p><p>I know that other members will have points to raise and I look forward to their contributions to the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13245532", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Redundancy Packages (Ailsa-Troon Workers)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak in today's debate both in sorrow and in anger.

We welcome the Scottish Executive's consultation paper on renewable energy obligations. The major source of renewable energy in Scotland is wind. The point must be made loud and clear that Scotland has 40 per cent of Europe's potential wind energy. As Robin Harper said, wind is obviously an asset that must be tapped into.</p><p>Unlike the SNP, I do not believe that we have missed the boat; wind energy is still in development. Many members agree that it is time to consider proactively managing and harvesting that asset, but if a policy of significantly increasing wind farming is pursued, it must be done sympathetically so that, wherever possible, the visual impact is kept to a minimum. As Allan Wilson and Murray Tosh said, a balance must be struck.</p><p>Studies show that public attitudes to wind farming are largely favourable. The idea of getting something for nothing appeals to most Scots. Using a natural asset to create electricity makes sense in these days of pollution and realisation of the exhaustibility of fossil fuels. It is a policy that is <place-holder colnum=\"1069\"/> driven by pragmatism&#8212;acting as needs must&#8212;so the argument is no longer about whether renewables are a good idea but about the best way of delivering a co-ordinated approach, where best to do it and when best to promote it.</p><p>The Executive's target of 18 per cent for ROS seems realistic. The targets offered by Robin Harper and Fiona McLeod&#8212;of, respectively, 22 per cent and 25 per cent&#8212;are simply aspirational. We must take a measured but positive approach, rather than act in haste and repent at leisure.</p><p>In South Ayrshire, calculations show that we have a potential renewable energy resource of around 6,630 million kWh, of which 98 per cent is in the form of wind energy. Not only do we have the wind in Ayrshire, we have the South Ayrshire Energy Agency, which is the first of its kind in Scotland. It has been established to provide energy advice and to promote energy efficiency in both the domestic and the business sector. Linda Fabiani drew attention to the need for that. Perhaps the agency could be used as a model for other areas in Scotland.</p><p>Given the advent of the climate change levy, which will increase electricity charges by 0.43p per kWh, the need for such agencies grows daily and the need for small and medium enterprises to cut costs and remain competitive is paramount. The Liberal proposal to introduce a carbon tax would just increase costs.</p><p>Another welcome source of renewable energy creation in Ayrshire is the Alba proposals for Killoch and Piperhill. That project's potential to provide integrated waste management disposal solutions and create, as a by-product, a renewable energy resource strikes the right chord. I wish such projects every success. However, whether they should attract capital grant funding must be examined carefully.</p><p>Another type of project, which is still at the concept stage but which I sense has great potential&#8212;it is my hobby-horse&#8212;involves what are, in effect, underwater wind farms harnessing the energy of tidal currents. I hope that that makes sense. Such a project could work well between Orkney and mainland Scotland, where giant underwater turbines could be used to tap into the enormous tidal currents in the area.</p><p>I think that we are all largely agreed on this matter.

Once again, I am speaking in a debate for a sense of balance. Today, I will address the creeping powers of the state over private property. Perhaps unfashionably, I do not subscribe to the view that land belongs to the Government and the people. In my view, it belongs to the country and to individuals such as the farmers and landowners who have bought and paid for their land, and who look after it and cherish it for little or no reward.</p><p>For generations, the country folk have struggled in all weathers, in good times and bad, to create the environment, the habitats and the scenery that is uniquely and identifiably Scottish and is so highly prized today. The preceding generations planted the trees, built the dykes and ploughed the fields that give us the habitats and biodiversity of today. There was and is an order, a balance in the rural areas, which is under threat. Why is it under threat, and from what? What threatens the balance in the countryside most noticeably, apart from low incomes and Mike Watson's Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill, is the imposition of special sites of scientific interest, special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p><p>As of 1999, more than 8 per cent of Scotland was covered by those designations. After the latest round of designations, that figure has now risen significantly, to cover between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of Scotland and put it under the control of Scottish Natural Heritage. That means <place-holder colnum=\"296\"/> that those areas are under the control of the state, because we must not forget that SNH is a state organisation. It is a Government instrument, which poses the threat of back-door nationalisation of the land.</p><p>Today, the threat is more focused. This year, due to a need to make European quotas, we have to create more SSSIs, more SACs and more SPAs, this time to protect the already protected hen harriers. There are between 450 and 500 breeding pairs of hen harriers in Scotland, a figure that has remained relatively stable for the past 10 years. The low point for hen harriers in Scotland was between the wars, when there were as few as 50 pairs. Since then, due to careful management and a desire to create a balance in wildlife and bird-life, numbers have increased to where they are today. In relative terms, hen harriers have recovered from the position of 60 years ago and, although rare, they are very much part of the Scottish landscape. It is the people who care about the countryside who have delivered that, not SNH.</p><p>Today, those who rescued the species and those on whose farms the birds have been allowed to increase in number and to prosper are being told by an organisation that came into being only 20 years ago: \"No, you don't know what you're doing. No, you cannot be trusted. No, we know best\". In a Government-inspired drive, SNH is taking control of even more of Scotland, telling those who look after the land physically on a day-to-day basis that SNH knows best.</p><p>When those ideal habitats are found, SNH imposes on owners a checklist that forbids up to 30 potentially damaging operations, so that those sites and wildlife habitats, many of which were hundreds of year in the making, are protected for future generations. The problem is the effrontery of SNH and Government&#8212;the Johnnys-come-lately of environmental care&#8212;in coming to the table in the past 20 years to tell those who have been looking after the land for hundreds of years how best to do so.</p><p>In my view, the Government has gone about this in completely the wrong way. If it had approached the issue in the European way, it might have ruffled fewer feathers. Some European countries are also trying to protect their wildlife and have introduced voluntary schemes. In Europe, the carrot rather than the stick is being used to encourage the preservation of the most valuable wildlife sites. That used to be the case in Scotland, where environmentally sensitive area and countryside premium schemes run at present. The stewards of the land have been queuing up to take part in those schemes.</p><p>The Government could have said, \"We now want to introduce another scheme to protect hen <place-holder colnum=\"297\"/> harriers. You farmers and landowners will be eligible for entry if you undertake to meet the criteria by agreeing to the prescription of the potentially damaging list of operations. If you do all this, we will give you a small cash incentive.\" If the Government had done that, farmers across the country would be queuing up to join, as they did with the ESA scheme and the CPS.</p><p>Instead, across the country, the stewards of the land are bristling with indignation at the heavy-handed treatment meted out by SNH, which, as I said, knows little of the skills required to juggle and balance the competing demands of looking after and living off the land that feeds us all. That is why SNH's announcement yesterday that it is not seeking confirmation of four sites in the south of Scotland is welcome news, as it will allow a breathing space for full scientific evaluation and proper consultation to take place.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239215", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protected Area Designations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I declare an interest as an affected farmer and as an active conservationist&#8212;one who has perhaps done more than most for conservation in Ayrshire.

In the care in the community programme, almost excessive efforts are being made to keep people in their own homes in South Ayrshire. Visiting Mathieson House in Ayr last Saturday, I was struck by how content the ladies are to live there. They enjoy the sense of security, they enjoy each other's company and they enjoy the food that is prepared for them by caring staff. They are more comfortable than they would be in their own homes. Houses such as that one are under threat, because social work departments are making such huge efforts to keep elderly people at home when perhaps&#8212;I repeat, perhaps&#8212;it is not always in the best interests of the people concerned. We are in real danger of losing those publicly and privately funded residential homes&#8212;which would be throwing the baby out with the bath water&#8212;because of a doctrinaire approach to looking after the elderly.</p><p>Furthermore, the withdrawal of warden services from sheltered housing in my constituency is part and parcel of encouraging the elderly to stay at home and not move into sheltered housing. Sheltered housing is no longer what it was; it is no longer as sheltered as it was. I have been asked whether those houses can now be bought from the council because they no longer meet the criteria of sheltered housing&#8212;they are council houses or flats. I would be interested to hear the minister's opinion.</p><p>Every day we hear about money flowing into the health service, yet for many people it seems to be getting harder to access the most basic services. In my constituency, podiatry care that was previously available to the elderly is no longer available. Lunch clubs for the elderly that were previously funded by the council are now being delivered by volunteers and the churches. The sense of community that those clubs engendered is under threat. It appears that the Government is setting out to destroy it and I cannot understand why. Imagine the outcry that there would have been if, during these three short years, the Conservatives had achieved such cuts.</p><p>I understand the current idea of caring for every individual in their own home, but the law of unintended consequences is at work here.

That adds extra cost for Scottish farmers, which is bad enough, but the fact is that many of the farmers being asked to pay the charge already face higher costs due to climatic disadvantages. They also face higher costs because 85 per cent of Scotland is classified as a less favoured area; almost 100 per cent of those facing the bill will be farming such land, which suffers from \"permanent natural handicaps\"&#8212;to use the former Scottish Office definition of less favoured areas. Not only is the charge being imposed in Scotland and not in England, but it is being imposed on those farming in the toughest farming conditions in Britain.</p><p>We hear much from the Executive about tough choices. However, this choice is tough only on the most disadvantaged part of our rural economy. None the less, the Executive has made that choice and is implementing it through SEPA.</p><p>When the introduction of the charge was first mooted in 1996 or 1997, the proposed level of charging for the whole of the UK was about &#163;700 per farmer. At that point there was an outcry and what we have today is a watered-down charging system&#8212;2,128 asked to pay in Scotland; none asked to pay in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. SEPA tells me that, of the 2,128 farmers affected in Scotland, 1,702 have paid up. Those who do not pay will, in due course, be subject to debt recovery process and ultimately will have their licences withdrawn.</p><p>However, it is more than money that is at stake. As Alex Fergusson has said, there is a point of principle of which I would ask the minister to take note. In England and Wales, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is paying for the issuing of licences to about 12,000 farmers, who receive them free of charge. In Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, charges are not being levied on farmers.</p><p>In fact, as far as I can find out, the charge is not being levied anywhere else in Europe. This is another manifestation of the Executive's desire to penalise and disadvantage rural areas and communities. Take note, minister. It is a conscious decision knowingly entered into by the Scottish Executive, and no other spin can be put upon it. I cannot accept that the Executive is serious about its declared aim to minimise farmers' regulatory costs if it continues to impose the charge, especially when it is being imposed only in Scotland. It is yet another attack on rural areas and the rural way of life, and must be recognised as such.</p><p>I ask the Executive to change its mind on the tax&#8212;that is what it is; another stealth tax, this time levied on sheep farmers&#8212;I ask the Executive to <place-holder colnum=\"1408\"/> repay the charges that have already been paid, and give us parity with our competitors in England, Wales, Ireland and Europe. I ask the Executive in future not to impose such charges, and in the interest of making life easier for it and for farmers, I ask it to introduce a charging policy that is consistent with the rest of the UK.

Three days is all it has taken for the Labour Government's policies to bring our country to its knees. Three days is all it has taken to take us back to the memories of the winter of 1978-79&#8212;the winter of discontent that was the grand finale of the previous Labour Administration.</p><p>Yesterday, Donald Dewar said that there is no need to panic. He should try telling that to those who depend on transport and haulage for their daily bread and to hauliers and car owners whose fuel tax burden has risen by 34 per cent since 1997. They are panicking because they can see no future for themselves or their families due to current fuel prices.</p><p>Alex Fergusson has outlined the problems facing rural areas due to the dependence on private transport and the isolation that is experienced there. I want to talk about how it is possible to feel isolated in towns and urban communities. Those are the people about whom I am worried.</p><p>I have spent part of this morning, as I did yesterday, contacting people in Ayr. I have been reassuring them that there will be enough fuel for the ambulances and that all of the Y2K-related disaster planning has not been in vain. I have said that there will be enough fuel for the fire engines if they are careful and do not undertake any non-essential journeys. I have said that the police will be able to cope but that they are extremely worried about the developing situation.</p><p>The real problem lies further down the fuel food chain. Local bus companies are struggling and are starting to prioritise. They plan to maintain only skeleton and priority services and there will be absolutely no bus services on Sunday. South Ayrshire Council's crisis management team is meeting twice a day to ensure that essential services are maintained. Local supermarkets are still okay, but food stockpiling has started. That is the next step.</p><p>The next problem to be faced is how those who operate essential services&#8212;ambulance drivers, firemen, police officers, bus drivers and those who work in supermarkets and hospitals&#8212;get to work. If the blockade continues, panic buying becomes a problem; if petrol stocks can be cleared in three days, so can food stocks. The real problem is not so much for the young and able, but for the old and infirm. I am worried about elderly people who might, on what is possibly the only bus of the day, go to the shops only to find that there is no food. That conjures up pictures of Moscow and food queues.</p><p>Three days is all it has taken for Mr Blair and his <place-holder colnum=\"233\"/> policies to transport us to his socialist utopian dream: a dream in which councils cannot supply basic services; a dream in which children cannot get to school; a dream in which the buses do not run; and a dream in which rubbish will presently be piling up on the streets.

Scottish farmers also bear welfare costs and bureaucracy costs. The cost of fuel&#8212;mentioned by Duncan Hamilton&#8212;is the highest in Europe.

Action is badly needed.</p><p>Scottish agriculture is drinking in the last chance saloon. In three short years under a Labour Government, Scottish net farm incomes have fallen from &#163;470 million to just &#163;75 million&#8212;in other words, they have fallen by more than 80 per cent. The day of reckoning is at hand. Last week, Brian Pack, the chief executive of the ANM group, raised the prospect of there being no agricultural production in Britain if present trends continue. North of Carlisle, farming is no longer viable in the prevailing agricultural climate. Unless that situation is addressed quickly, there will be an exodus from Scottish farm land on a scale that has not been <place-holder colnum=\"1107\"/> seen since the 1930s. Those are the stakes that we are playing for.</p><p>The process of leaving the land has already begun. One has only to read last week's <i>Scottish Farmer</i>: suddenly, there are more farms on the market, to let or buy, than there were. The dam that has held for so long is about to burst, as farmers finally admit defeat and get out. Last week, at the Ayr show, which is normally a celebratory event, I was struck by the mood of despair among colleagues and friends, which appalled me. This Government must take its share of the blame for that.</p><p>I welcome the initiatives that Ross Finnie has outlined in \"Rural Scotland: A New Approach\" as a forward strategy for Scottish agriculture. I hope that he can make them work. Farmers perceive that, in the Government, an ideological battle is being waged between town and country interests. Farmers accept that in the past the Government did not have the funds to sort out the problems of the rural sector, but they know that that argument no longer stands up. Gordon Brown has the money, but he has no intention of parting with it. The policy of importing food from abroad is leading, as surely as night follows day, to the destruction of a once great and proud industry.</p><p>The minister must make the reviews and glossy brochures work, or he will witness an exodus of farmers and farm workers the like of which has not been seen in Scotland since the 1930s. In my constituency, dairy farming is on its knees and cannot get up. Hill farming and pig farming are on the verge of collapse, and arable farmers and nursery growers are having an equally difficult time. Although I do not question the sincerity of Ross Finnie's attempts to sort out the problems, I feel that his hands are tied&#8212;tied by Nick and Gordon Brown who in fact hold the purse strings for rural Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13229100", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Race Relations: \"Rural Scotland: A New Approach\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not know how the NFU will vote this time around.

Tourism is another industry with huge growth potential in the area. It, too, needs to be encouraged by better road links.
