Suddenly, free school meals&#8212;a policy that was dropped from the 2011 SNP manifesto and was mentioned in passing as a five-word post-independence aspiration in the white paper&#8212;is produced like a rabbit out of the hat by Alex Salmond this afternoon, as a substantive policy for primaries 1 to 3 from next January. So, why now that belated conversion? Could it be that the much-maligned Westminster Government has pledged free meals from this April and that the SNP was caught napping and red faced, and is playing embarrassed catch-up?</p><p>The further irony, of course, is that the policy needs no constitutional change. All that it took was a Tory-led coalition at Westminster to force Alex Salmond&#8217;s hand. [Laughter.] Listen to the raucous laughter.

Sadly, debates on violence against women are a recurring feature in the Parliament. That is a matter for sorrow but it is also a matter of necessity, because the statistics on domestic abuse and rape make for depressing reading. Worldwide, violence against women is one of the most common but least punished crimes.</p><p>It is, of course, possible that those statistics show that victims are becoming increasingly confident about reporting incidents of violence because they believe that action will be taken. If that is the case, we can draw some encouragement from it. However, the fact remains that, in Scotland, violence against women is a pervasive social problem that affects every neighbourhood. It can be found in every social background, as Jackie Baillie powerfully illustrated.</p><p>We must continue to reassure victims that abusive behaviour is not normal. It is repugnant, disgusting and unacceptable, and victims must be supported in understanding that they are not to blame. The people who are to blame are the perpetrators, and the greatest protection that is available to them is silence. That silence is potent. It spawns in the mind of the perpetrator an illusion of power and control. Women must therefore be encouraged to report incidents and, when they do so, support must be provided and any convicted perpetrator dealt with appropriately.</p><p>My colleague Margaret Mitchell articulated her concerns that the warm words of the motion are not reflected in practice, and she cited various instances of her concerns. In particular, her comments about sentencing for domestic abuse offenders are entirely valid. Perpetrators in a third of domestic abuse cases received only a warning, which sends out totally the wrong message to victims and to the criminals. I repeat our concern about automatic early release. The Scottish Government&#8217;s promise to end that discredited practice for only the most serious offenders and violent criminals is betraying victims.</p><p>We must never forget that young girls can be victims of violence, either as witnesses to incidents of abuse or, heartbreakingly, as victims themselves. Alison McInnes referred to that. In January, I suggested that, to raise awareness and to help any youngster who is under threat, a smartphone app might be a way forward. The cabinet secretary, Alex Neil, seemed to be receptive to that idea, so perhaps the minister could outline in closing whether any progress has been made on that.</p><p>On a positive note, I welcome the development of the strategy to tackle violence against women. I hope that it will have the effect of enhancing the good work that is already being done by voluntary organisations. A great deal of excellent support is being provided by charities, not least Zero Tolerance, Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, and Rape Crisis Scotland, and I pay tribute to them all.</p><p>Victims need to be supported by a justice system that places victims first, and by adequate and long-term funding. In that connection, I am pleased to see that funding has been awarded until 2015, but I urge the Government to plan now for funding beyond that.</p><p>Violence against women includes modern-day slavery. I say to Rhoda Grant that I was encouraged to hear yesterday about the UK Government&#8217;s draft legislation, which will disrupt and imprison for longer the organised criminal gangs that are behind much of the modern slave trade. I welcome indications that the Scottish Government is willing to explore a legislative consent motion for the bill. I also note Jenny Marra&#8217;s efforts to introduce a member&#8217;s bill to tackle the issue. I do not consider that those two bills will be mutually exclusive, and I hope that the best bits from each can be adopted in Scotland to provide the practical help that many victims are crying out for.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22813683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a thought-provoking and timely debate, and all parties can agree that violence against women is a blight on Scottish society, which we must seek to eradicate.

In fact, for 20 of the past 21 years, Scotland has run a fiscal deficit.</p><p>However, the real magnitude of this inconvenient truth for Alex Salmond is highlighted by two sources.

We are given tax and spending figures for one year only&#8212;2016-17, the first year of independence. The question arises: why are there not further projections? The conclusion can only be that to make further projections would be dangerous because they would be either so guarded and canny that they would raise justifiable fears about the deficit, or so rosy as to be utterly incredible.</p><p>The second source is the IFS report, to which various members have referred. That report lays bare the fiscal gap and the likelihood of increased taxes, which Gavin Brown covered incisively.

I, too, thank Mike MacKenzie for bringing the issue to Parliament. I should declare an interest, in that I have been invited to become an honorary fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland&#8212;an invitation that I have, with great pleasure, accepted. I do not have an entry in the register of members&#8217; interests yet because the process is embryonic rather than complete. I believe that I have to attend a dinner next year and make a speech, at which point I am in, so to speak.</p><p>The RIAS is an important influencer in Scottish affairs in general, but most particularly in the important arena of our built environment. As Patricia Ferguson said, there is widespread evidence of that all over Scotland. That influence is captured well in the motion.</p><p>In no way is the RIAS either passive or purely advisory. It is a catalyst in the encouragement of creative design and build, both in its programme of activities and of course in the awards scheme to which the motion refers.</p><p>I, too, congratulate the 12 winners of the 2013 awards. They reflect the cream of talent in the profession. The fact that they emerged from 75 submissions from throughout Scotland is, in itself, a tribute to the calibre of ability to be found among practitioners. It is also an inspiring contribution to the shape of our future built environment.</p><p>One of the 12 winning projects is the Beacon arts centre in Greenock. I can speak at first hand about its attributes. It is a superb facility in a stunning location. I was privileged to listen to Nicola Benedetti playing in the state-of-the-art theatre, I have attended an art exhibition in the flexible conference area and on more than one occasion I have enjoyed delicious food in the bistro. That imaginative and attractive facility has given a real lift to the Inverclyde environment.</p><p>As others have said, the winner of the Andrew Doolan best building in Scotland award will be chosen this evening from the 12 RIAS award winners, with the award announced and presented in the Parliament this evening. Unfortunately, like Patricia Ferguson, I cannot be present, as I have another engagement in Glasgow. However, the award will be a prestigious triumph for the successful contender. I only hope that my absence does not scupper my honorary fellowship or my free dinner.</p><p>The phrase &#8220;built environment&#8221; can sound rather abstract and a bit dreich, but arguably there is no more important influence on how we live, where we work and how we relax than the built environment. Historically, people congregated where there were centres of activity; perhaps that activity was trade, or access to a market, or perhaps it was maritime activity identified with a river or coastal location. A built environment then developed to accommodate people and their families and to create ancillary facilities for trade and worship. Much of that, as we all know, has left a fascinating legacy of historic interest and quaintness the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. Many buildings, despite being hundreds of years old, are iconic. However, I am equally fascinated by what happens when architects are asked to address a new human and social need and to create a built environment appropriate to that.</p><p>I have much enjoyed reading a chronicle of post-war history, which is David Kynaston&#8217;s series &#8220;Tales of a New Jerusalem&#8221;. I commend it to anybody who is interested in how Britain has evolved in the past 70 years, because it is readable and fascinating. It shines a light on how we have become shaped as a society in the past 70 years. Much of that is down to political intervention, but a great deal of it is down to our built environment, which features prominently in the chronicle.</p><p>We sometimes forget that the first town and country planning legislation was passed only in 1947, just over 60 years ago, but it was hugely influential in shaping much of our current environment. It is fascinating to consider how architects addressed the post-war challenges of devastated locations, in which the need for new housing was paramount, with the concept of new towns and building upwards to address the scarcity of land. We did not always get it right, but that work has been vital in informing how we approach design now, as Mike MacKenzie said. The experience of those early pioneering projects has been instructive.</p><p>Mike MacKenzie also said that Scotland faces challenges. We face the emerging trend of an increasing proportion of elderly people, which is good, but it means that we need to think about how our built environment should adjust to that situation over the next 20, 30 or 40 years. With the architectural talent that is so clearly available in Scotland and with a dynamic and engaged body such as the RIAS, I feel confident about the future of our Scottish built environment.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Best Buildings in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great pleasure to take part in the debate.

I am not a member of the Justice Committee, so I must say that undreamt-of vistas, without limit of horizon, have opened up for me this afternoon. Who would have imagined that reform of tribunals could reveal such glittering facets as &#8220;judicialisation&#8221; and &#8220;courtification&#8221;?</p><p>One feature of this debate that has distressed&#8212;nay, alarmed&#8212;me is that, while the rest of us have been sustained throughout the afternoon with the presence of colleagues, the minister has been on her own for lengthy chunks of the debate. Quite honestly, in the 21st century and a debate of this nature, that is not humane, and I think that the Scottish Government should address the matter without delay. I accept that the topic of reform of our tribunal system might not set the pulses racing but, as members have acknowledged, it is an important topic and reform is overdue.</p><p>The tribunal system as we know it grew up on an ad hoc basis during the 20th century as Governments acquired more and more power over citizens&#8217; daily lives. An important landmark was the 1957 Franks report to which Nigel Don referred. That followed the Crichel Down affair in which land acquired during the second world war was not returned to the previous owner but was instead handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture and leased out&#8212;so land grab is nothing new.</p><p>Following that scandal, the Franks report moved tribunals from an executive and administrative model towards a judicial footing, based on the three principles of openness, fairness and impartiality. That was an important change. That judicial footing can be observed without either judge overload or&#8212;to use that extraordinary word&#8212;courtification. That sounds to me more like a mandatory term for wooing, so I hope that the minister will let me know how she gets on with that.</p><p>In Scotland there is a clear division between tribunals that deal with devolved matters, and are therefore under the responsibility of the Scottish Government, and those that are reserved. However, users of a tribunal are unlikely to be concerned about or aware of&#8212;or, for that matter, care about&#8212;whether a tribunal is devolved or reserved. We must come up with a system that is as efficient and fair as it can be and which, above all, meets the needs of the users. Indeed, the minister specifically referred to that.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to continue working with the UK Government in coming up with a satisfactory solution for the reserved tribunals, which are more numerous and deal with far more cases than the devolved tribunals.</p><p>Ah&#8212;the minister has found a friend. I am much comforted by the appearance of Kenny MacAskill in the chamber.</p><p>The system&#8217;s complexity has been commented on. Indeed, the 2008 Philip report specifically referred to that complexity and fragmentation. It also expressed concern that the system did not</p><p>&#8220;meet the key principles of independence and coherence.&#8221;</p><p>I think that we all acknowledge that that complexity is not in the best interests of the users of tribunals; nor does the duplication of resource, in whatever form that occurs, represent value for money.</p><p>Although the Scottish Government has taken some limited steps to simplify the system&#8212;most notably by bringing some of the devolved tribunals under the administration of the Scottish tribunals service&#8212;progress has been slow. I observe that the UK equivalent to this bill was passed six years ago. As Roderick Campbell observed, the legislation represents movement, but it will still apply to only a tiny 2 per cent of tribunal cases north of the border.</p><p>There is a risk that we may create different systems for tribunals in Scotland, compounding the complexity that surrounds them, which would be unfortunate. Currently, only some tribunals are supported by the Scottish tribunals service, and the bill will establish a separate structure for some devolved tribunals, while leaving untouched other devolved tribunals and all the reserved tribunals.</p><p>I will now comment on a few points that were raised on the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report. As mentioned by Margaret Mitchell, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland has expressed concern. A number of members have commented on that, and I expect that the minister will comment on the matter, too. That raises the wider point that the challenge for the Scottish Government is to come up with a system that preserves the specialist qualities required by the Lands Tribunal without complicating a structure that is meant to simplify things.</p><p>I also reiterate the points made about the importance of protecting our tribunals&#8217; unique and distinct approach to civil justice. There is no doubt that the informality and less adversarial nature of our tribunals, compared with the courts, is a strength. However, there is a legitimate concern that, with the Lord President in charge, a senior judge appointed as president of the tribunals and the expansion of judicial members, care must be taken to avoid judge overload.</p><p>I hear alarm bells ringing with the proposal that, until the newly created Scottish Civil Justice Council is in a position to take over, ministers will make procedural rules. Ministers, who are of course sometimes subject to tribunal proceedings, should not be making the rules, no matter how much independent or expert advice they take. Instead, the rules should be made on an interim basis, either by the new Scottish Civil Justice Council with additional resource or by another interim body.</p><p>Other speakers have commented on independence. It is critical to tribunals, and the bill could do more to promote that&#8212;an idea that the Lord President shared with the Justice Committee. Indeed, I understand that he suggested the inclusion in the bill of a similar provision to that in the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008. Perhaps the Scottish Government will consider that.</p><p>The new structure, with the position of president of the tribunals appointed by the Lord President, is interesting. I have noticed a restriction: the bill limits the pool of candidates to senators of the College of Justice. I have no quarrel with the senators of the College of Justice, but that pool is deep rather than wide and it needs to be broadened out. The system would benefit from a wider scope of qualified and experienced personnel.</p><p>The Justice Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report notes that much of the detail of the new structure is not contained in the bill. One or two speakers have referred to that, and I am slightly concerned about it. It hampers scrutiny and, although I accept that the proposed legislation seeks to provide a framework for the new structure and needs to be flexible, the amount of detail that will be left to delegated legislation is disquieting. I hope that the Government will take on board some of the comments that the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee made.</p><p>The Justice Committee will closely scrutinise the forthcoming secondary legislation, but it already has an enormous workload and I think that it would have preferred that the Parliament be given more specific information about the detail of the proposed new structure. Perhaps the minister could address that.</p><p>I believe that the Government is considering merging the Scottish tribunals service with the Scottish Court Service, but has it considered related matters, such as the sheer number of tribunals and the concerns that have been expressed about the independence of some of them?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunals (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in the stage 1 debate on the Tribunals (Scotland) Bill.

In doing so, she underlines the vital role of a Parliament in finding common accord across party boundaries to highlight something that is wrong.</p><p>That is no trite moral judgment. This is not about prim ladies of propriety of a certain age, who might be of ample proportions, pursing their lips in disapproval at the antics of their juniors. This is about how we wish the image of Scotland and the United Kingdom in the 21st century to be represented, and particularly how we wish women in that society to be portrayed. I should also clarify that the views that I am expressing are my personal opinions.</p><p>To put this debate in context, I point out that women died that we might be given the vote; rent strikes were women fighting for their families and the justice of fair rents while their husbands were at war; women fought for our right to university education; and down the ages women have made sacrifices of all kinds for their families and their society that others might be given chances and opportunities. Given those heroic achievements, it is no surprise that women have risen to the highest levels of every activity imaginable. Their influence and success is as impressive as it is beyond dispute. In 2013, how do we celebrate that? With the consistent portrayal of topless women in a tabloid newspaper. That tasteless and demeaning portrayal of some women is actually a gross and offensive betrayal of all women. For example, when Jessica Ennis won an Olympic gold medal, which was a major achievement in sport, an occasion for national celebration, a fantastic representation of female ability and signalled the creation of an excellent role model, The Sun recognised that triumph by giving greater pre-eminence to a photograph of a topless woman.</p><p>To me, Lucy-Anne Holmes, with her petition to stop this tacky and questionable practice, is a new heroine. She is right and I support her position, as do more than 120,000 others. However, she, I, Jackie Baillie and all the other signatories also recognise that there is a darker side to this practice, a sinister and disturbing element that is referred to in the motion. As has been confirmed by research, there is a known and proven link between the portrayal of sexualised images of women in the media and attitudes that reinforce sexism, sexual harassment, abuse and violence towards women. That alone should justify stopping the publication of photographs of topless women in newspapers; the practice is indefensible, as are the purported arguments advanced by those who support such activity.</p><p>We are told that freedom of the press must prevail. As a proposition, that does not bear even superficial scrutiny; it is more naked than the page 3 offerings. Publishing material in the public interest is not the same as, and can never be confused with, producing salacious material to satisfy the prurient interest. We are told that commercial freedom justifies that, and that, after all, no laws are being broken. If that proposition is intellectually robust, we should expect First ScotRail to employ topless ladies on the catering trollies, our supermarkets to have topless female staff stacking shelves, and topless women at the counters of our banks and building societies. Can members imagine that? That will not happen, because those businesses not only have to defer to public taste and acceptable conduct but they cannot afford to be associated with practices that induce and reinforce sexist attitudes, sexual harassment, abuse and violence towards women. It is a no-no. If it is a no-no for them, it should be a no-no for The Sun.</p><p>The Sun needs to act up to its name. It needs to reflect the light of its title on the darkness of the shadows that are cast by its topless feature on page 3. When groups as diverse as UK Girlguiding and the other organisations that are mentioned in the motion and that Jackie Baillie mentioned in her speech, not to mention the Scottish Parliament, raise the cudgels, The Sun needs to listen. As UK Girlguiding pointed out:</p><p>&#8220;The Sun is a family newspaper. Anyone can pick it up, turn to Page 3, and think that it is normal for young women to be treated as objects. This is just wrong.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with UK Girlguiding. In 2013, women deserve better from The Sun, and The Sun can and certainly should do better by women.</p><p>The motion is timely.

We are discussing the abolition of corroboration, which is a long-standing and much-valued component of the law of evidence in Scotland. I thank members for their contributions to the debate, some of which were more thoughtful and measured than others. I speak as a former solicitor, but I am no longer a member of the Law Society of Scotland and I am not on the roll of solicitors.</p><p>In my years in the Parliament, it has been my privilege to take part in many important debates, but this one is pre-eminent, because corroboration finds itself in the dock, charged with being an irrelevance, an anachronism and an impediment to convictions. Those are serious accusations and I want to examine them.</p><p>Traditionally in Scotland, two crucial facts require proof in every crime: first, that the offence was committed; and, secondly, that the accused committed it. So where does corroboration come in? What is it, when did we get it and why has it been considered so important to the law of evidence in Scotland and the presumption of innocence? Historically, it goes back to the new testament, when it was developed to avoid the execution or capital punishment of innocent individuals. More recently, in the 18th and 19th centuries in Scotland, the rationale for corroboration became that a single witness is insufficient for proof or, to quote the founding authority on Scottish criminal law, David Hume:</p><p>&#8220;no one shall in any case be convicted on the testimony of a single witness&#8221;.</p><p>As members have said, corroboration underwent reform and was developed as a theme of evidence so that, by the 1950s, it was clear that two witnesses were not required to prove every fact in a case. Reference has been made to the Moorov doctrine, which allows corroboration by similar facts. I sympathise with the situation that Christina McKelvie described, but I point out that the complainer&#8217;s distress as observed by a third party after an alleged sexual offence can be used to corroborate the use of force or a lack of consent. Of course, there are now some statutory exceptions to the requirement for corroboration, which tend to relate to minor crimes such as road traffic offences.</p><p>What remains unchanged is the underlying principle of corroboration, which is that one version of events on its own is not enough and is not safe. Mr MacAskill says that it is not just about one witness, but then what is it about, because that is what I and others are now completely unclear about? Some members of his party think that corroboration is not to be abolished, but Mr MacAskill&#8217;s amendment says explicitly that it is to be.</p><p>For modern purposes, the rule is based on the idea that it is better to let a few guilty people escape conviction than to risk depriving an innocent person of their liberty. The current authority on Scottish criminal law, Professor Gerald Gordon, put it in a nutshell when he said:</p><p>&#8220;we accept that sometimes a single witness can be reliable and that by refusing to believe him we may be doing injustice in the particular case; but we cannot always be sure about our judgments of reliability, and indeed we are so likely to be wrong, and the results of our error are likely to be so serious, that it is better to make it a rule that we shall never rely on only one witness, because, on the whole, that will lead to less injustice than will reliance on our ability to detect unreliability&#8221;.</p><p>How might the testimony of a witness be unreliable? Contrary to popular belief, witnesses lie in court and their motives might be sinister. Alternatively, they might be completely honest but simply wrong in what they thought they saw, or they might get flustered in the tension of a courtroom environment and, through anxiety or confusion, misrepresent the actual position.</p><p>That is because giving evidence is a human process and, for whatever reasons, human beings are fallible. If corroboration as we understand it is abolished, none of that will be tested or challenged. The bastion of the accused&#8217;s protection against such frailty and the guardian of the presumption of innocence is corroboration, and that view is shared by all the groups that are mentioned in Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s motion: lawyers, judges, groups of police officers, the Scottish Human Rights Commission, adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and Justice Scotland.</p><p>On the matter of judges, I ask the Justice Committee to investigate which judges support the abolition of corroboration, with the honourable exception of Lord Carloway.</p><p>Why does corroboration find itself in the dock? In the wake of Cadder, the Scottish Government instructed Lord Carloway to carry out a review of criminal procedure. That case gave rise to significant issues to do with detention, period of detention and the right of the detainee to legal advice. I disagree with Mr MacAskill: I do not think that corroboration was central to the Cadder case. Lord Carloway made numerous recommendations about Cadder, prominent among which was the abolition of corroboration. That is what we are talking about. I say to Sandra White that if she is any doubt about that, she should look at the text of her colleague&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>What consultation, research or evidence taking was engaged in to justify that conclusion? None of any extent that I am able to discover. The conclusion is therefore largely subjective. That, in itself, is not fatal&#8212;Lord Carloway is an eminent judge&#8212;but that conclusion demands the support of a rigorous examination of the arguments that have been advanced.</p><p>We are told that corroboration does not serve its stated purpose of preventing miscarriages of justice and that the real protection is the standard of proof that is required. No, it is not. If the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt, we still need reliable evidence to satisfy that test. In the absence of corroboration, a dishonest, mistaken or confused witness could easily satisfy that test.</p><p>Corroboration is then condemned because it concerns&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697497", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Corroboration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is timely.

When we are dealing with evidence, if we reduce the quantity, we will as surely prejudice the quality as night follows day. Dishonest, wrong and confused testimony will prevail&#8212;what kind of quality is that? I would not want to be at the mercy of that if I were the accused.</p><p>Then we are told that corroboration acts as an artificial barrier to prosecution in which the only potential evidence might be from the testimony of a single complainer. Yes, it does. That is a strength in our criminal justice system, not a weakness. Of course abolishing corroboration will increase the number of prosecutions, but to imagine that that will lead to more convictions is as naive as it is nonsensical. It will lead to greater doubt in the minds of jurors, who might be much more inclined to acquit people who are guilty. How does that serve the victims? It will certainly lead to innocent people being convicted on dishonest, mistaken or confused testimony because the witness convinced the jury.</p><p>The other arguments advanced in the review do not merit the abolition of corroboration, but I accept that they justify its reform. That is a different matter entirely and I am sympathetic to that. The motion in the name of my colleague Margaret Mitchell makes the investigation of that option a possibility.</p><p>The Scottish Government is proposing to abolish corroboration on an analysis that is flawed, reasoning that is opaque, logic that is incoherent, and a conclusion that is plain wrong. The Scottish Government has no substantive alternative substitute or mitigating safeguard to offer and that too is plain wrong. It is akin to demolishing the dam wall without putting any flood prevention measures in place.</p><p>In my opinion, corroboration is innocent. It requires reform, but the charges against it have not been proved.

The debate is already passionate, voters are getting engaged with the issue and emotions are running high. However, I echo Bruce Crawford&#8217;s view that the debate must be conducted with clarity, courtesy and a degree of dignity and must not become an unedifying barney or stairheid rammie. Whatever we may think, the public have no great impression of politicians as it is, so an uninformed shouting match will merely cement that negative perception. The public deserve better.</p><p>If the debate is vital, no less so is the process to ensure that there is a mechanism for the referendum in which voters can have confidence. That may be a lot less sparky and may be redolent to some of the drabness that can attach to process, but process matters. We have already dealt with phase 1 of the process in the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 and we are now dealing with phase 2: the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill.</p><p>As a member of the scrutinising committee, I pay tribute to Bruce Crawford for his canny and wise chairmanship. I do not say this lightly, but I enjoy serving on the committee. I thank Andrew Mylne and the clerking team for really breaking sweat to support the committee through a demanding timetable. I thank, too, our advisers and SPICe for excellent input, which I found extremely helpful. All that endeavour has culminated in the stage 1 report that is before the Parliament today.</p><p>With that absence of logic in which I rejoice, I will start at the end of the report by quoting paragraph 322, which states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee is confident that its Stage 1 inquiry has enabled this important Bill to be subjected to a wide-ranging and robust scrutiny process. Inevitably, as with any large and complex piece of legislation, there are some aspects of the Bill that require adjustment, and other points on which clarification is needed. Overall, however, the Committee is confident that this Bill should provide a suitable framework for next year&#8217;s referendum.&#8221;</p><p>I think that that adequately encapsulates the position and my party will support the bill this evening.</p><p>Let me tease out one or two issues that I think require adjustment or comment. An issue on which there is probably complete consensus is when we get the result. I had some anxiety over that, as it was not clear from the bill if or when a local result could be announced. It was less than clear when the chief counting officer would announce the overall result. The public expectation is clear, as is that of the Electoral Commission, that once the chief counting officer is satisfied with the local count, the local counting officer will be authorised to declare it locally. I hope that the Deputy First Minister will confirm today that that position is now beyond doubt. I am also satisfied that it is clear that there is an expectation that the national result will be announced as soon as is practicable.</p><p>To me, the main area of sensitivity all concerned the period before 18 September next year, governed by the regulated period of 16 weeks and the purdah period of 28 days. That has implications for campaigning groups, their activity and their expenditure, but it also has implications for Governments and their quangos.</p><p>My impression is that the principal campaigning groups are content with those periods and understand their impact on their activities. However, I have to say that emotions ranging from mild suspicion to rampant paranoia surrounded what Governments and their quangos might get up to during these sensitive periods. I think that a purdah period for Government of 28 days is reasonable.</p><p>While the Scottish Government is content to have its conduct for that period regulated in the bill, I do not consider it either necessary or reasonable for this long-standing protocol to be legislated for at Westminster. There has been no need of that in the past. As she has confirmed today, the Deputy First Minister has expressed herself content with the terms of the Edinburgh agreement and such a legislative obligation on Westminster seems to me to be excessive. For that reason, along with Tavish Scott, Patricia Ferguson and James Kelly, I dissented from that proposal in the report.</p><p>However, I think that taxpayers would take a very dim view of any quango or public authority appearing to support either side of the debate, whether within the purdah period, the regulated period or any other period between now and next September. It seems to me to be both unnecessary and inappropriate for quangos to express any such views. The Deputy First Minister, while being characteristically robust when questioned on these matters, did not seem entirely unsympathetic to concerns that Tavish Scott and I expressed. She strongly rejected any suggestion that such bodies would behave inappropriately by stating:</p><p>&#8220;Public authorities do not operate in a political way, and they will not do so during the regulated period any more than they do now.&#8221;</p><p>She went on to say that to suggest that such bodies would be</p><p>&#8220;out there campaigning for either side in the referendum ... stretches credibility.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 13 June 2013; c 564-5.]</p><p>However, the Deputy First Minister provided what to me is a welcome acknowledgement of the concerns expressed by confirming that the Scottish Government would issue guidance to relevant public bodies and she has offered to provide a draft of such guidance to the committee. I hope that that draft will be available in early course, but I also hope that it is broader than covering just the 28-day purdah period. It should reflect the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s confidence that such bodies will not behave inappropriately.</p><p>As has already been indicated, this Parliament will have to resolve the issue of the two days of the purdah period during which the Parliament will now operate. I think that that is described as a casus omissus, which is a Latin euphemism for something else, but it is certainly not clever and it needs to be addressed.</p><p>The bill delivers a workable mechanism for 18 September 2014, when I confidently expect Scotland to reject overwhelmingly separation from the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Next year will be a momentous one when, arguably, the most important decision ever to confront Scottish voters will require to be taken.

I know that David McLetchie&#8217;s family will have been much comforted by all that has been said.</p><p>My first recollection of David McLetchie, at a party meeting many years ago, is hardly an extensive encapsulation of either his character or his talents: I noted him simply as that good-looking big Edinburgh lawyer chap with the glasses. Mind you, coming from a then Glasgow lawyer, that was in the realms of high praise. [Laughter.]</p><p>Even then, David made an immediate impression, leavening the universally dry fodder that was so characteristic of the business meetings of all parties. Not only was he analytical and forensic in his approach to all issues, he was dogged in his pursuit of what he believed to be right. Those attributes, in conjunction with an approach to political issues derived from basic principle and an unshakeable commitment to his political beliefs, made him the effective and formidable political operator that he was.</p><p>In politics, working relationships between colleagues in the same party are routine and we could not function without them. However, real friendships within parties are perhaps a little less common, and across parties they are rarer still. Yet, in politics, David McLetchie cultivated and established all those different relationships. That is not easy to do, but, as we have heard from the speeches this afternoon, even among his political opponents he elicited respect and affection.</p><p>When David became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, those personal strengths of character served his party and his colleagues well. His first ever speech to the Parliament in 1999 had clarity, vision and his trademark acerbity. He began by saying:</p><p>&#8220;I am well aware that, unless there is a sudden, widespread and highly unlikely outbreak of common sense, my candidacy for First Minister will not succeed this afternoon.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 13 May 1999; c 19.]</p><p>He then articulated his vision for the Scottish Conservatives: he said that we should be a constructive Opposition in the Parliament, dedicated to making it a success, and that we should aspire to Government in Scotland again some day. That is still the vision for my party&#8212;it was endorsed by me and Ruth Davidson as his successors. David was unflagging in his endeavours to realise those ambitions.</p><p>When I succeeded David, I could not have asked for a more supportive colleague. His counsel was sound and any confidence that I shared with him remained with him; he knew how solitary leadership can be. His friendship was comforting and reassuring, and his integrity manifest.</p><p>The one word that I knew never to mention in David&#8217;s presence was &#8220;consensus&#8221;. To him, &#8220;consensus&#8221; was synonymous with fudge, dilution of intellectual rigour and impairment of political purity. However, he was pragmatic. As others have said, in 2007, when the Parliament first experienced minority government, there was a need for party business managers with honed political skills, razor-sharp minds and acutely sensitive political antenna who were astute in judgment and skilled in negotiation. I could not have been better served than I was by David McLetchie. He excelled, and not only his party, but the Parliament, were the beneficiaries.</p><p>The touching and eloquent tributes that we have heard this afternoon reflect David McLetchie&#8217;s enormous contribution to Scottish politics and our sorrow as politicians at the loss of a colleague, a gentleman and a friend.

I echo Patricia Ferguson in thanking all those who have been involved in the process in whatever capacity. In aggregate, their evidence has helped the whole process of scrutiny and improvement of the bill.</p><p>Although the issues at stake in the referendum are immense and are already being debated passionately, deciding who is entitled to vote is also of profound importance. Broadly speaking, I think that deploying the existing franchise for local government and Scottish Parliament elections is sensible, but using as significant an occasion as the referendum on Scotland&#8217;s future as a test-bed for extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds is, in my opinion, premature and misjudged. As I observed during the stage 1 debate, I do not deny that there is a debate to be had about the franchise and the age at which it is obtained, but little if any value can be extrapolated from the limited experience in Scotland of such an extension, given the dismal turnout levels for the health board elections. If there is a desire to look at age levels for elections&#8212;or, for that matter, when people may first drive a car, purchase alcohol or hold a firearms licence&#8212;a broader debate and more widespread consultation would have been sensible.</p><p>Being mischievous, I observe that the First Minister is not a man to make decisions without a reason, nor is he averse to a promising punt. I can surmise only that his enthusiasm for extending the franchise was because he envisaged wide-eyed innocence and unquestioning sentiment embracing and promoting his separatist agenda and fanning the yes vote. However, the young people seem to be having the last laugh, because a recent poll suggests that 60 per cent of them will reject independence. Notwithstanding their commendable common sense, I still feel that extending the franchise for the referendum is premature. I realise that I am a lone voice on this issue, but my dissent, which is noted in the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report and in my party&#8217;s opposition to the bill at stage 1, will be reflected by my voting against the bill at decision time.</p><p>However, recognising that the bill will be enacted, I want to make some constructive comments. It is essential that these enfranchised young people have access to information. Given that many of them will still be at school, it is paramount that local authorities understand the difference between the legitimate provision of information provided by balanced debate and partisan propaganda. The first can be responsibly provided by properly balanced panel discussion in schools or by referring young people to the main campaigning entities, Better Together and Yes Scotland, but the second&#8212;partisan propaganda&#8212;is completely unacceptable. I recognise that it would be wrong for the Scottish Government to intrude on local government territory by imposing guidelines, but local authorities must demonstrate their resolve by opposing anything that reeks of influence or coercion by setting out a code of practice for their schools that underpins neutrality and minimises disruption to learning.</p><p>Turning to more specific aspects of the bill, section 3 prohibits convicted prisoners who are held in a penal institution from voting. We have to some extent rehearsed that issue when we discussed the amendments. Suffice it to say that I agree with the Scottish Government&#8217;s view on the issue and, given the recent rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, which questions such a blanket prohibition, it was right to deal with the matter in the bill. However, as I have said, there is a fundamental principle underpinning the prohibition of votes for prisoners: if a court considers prison to be an appropriate sentence for an accused, then the suspension of liberty rightly also involves suspension of franchise.</p><p>I was interested in the discussion that surrounded the risk of legal challenge on that issue. However, based on the evidence that the committee received from the Scottish Government and other witnesses, including the Law Society of Scotland, the prospect of a successful challenge seems extremely remote.</p><p>In conclusion, I will refer to a couple of the bill&#8217;s technical points that interested me during the committee&#8217;s evidence. First, the Deputy First Minister confirmed that she had been reassured by the Cabinet Office at Westminster that individual voter registration would not start until after the referendum. I would be grateful for clarification on whether progress has been made at Westminster with the necessary statutory instrument to achieve that outcome. Secondly, as I have said, I was worried that the canvass form did not make it sufficiently clear to the adult completing the form that the address of a young person does not need to be disclosed. I therefore welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s amendment on that that was passed earlier; it is a welcome improvement to the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695176", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today represents the final stage of phase 1 of an important legislative process that will culminate in the referendum on 18 September next year.

Do we give them firearms licences? Do we allow them to drive motor cars? No one has clarified those aspects to me. Perhaps that debate is for another day.</p><p>One important area that time constraints meant that I could not dwell on in my opening speech is the right of our armed forces personnel to exercise their vote. In fairness, I accept that the Deputy First Minister has listened to concerns that emerged at the committee and I know that she is working with her Westminster counterparts to facilitate every possibility that armed forces personnel outwith Scotland can exercise their vote on such an important issue.</p><p>A related anxiety is about ensuring that 16 and 17-year-olds who are abroad with their armed forces parents are given the same opportunity. I know that the Scottish Government is investigating that. If there is an update on that, I would very much appreciate hearing about it.</p><p>The process that the bill envisages involves the need for information, the encouragement to vote and then, on the day of voting, access to appropriate facilities. I was struck by the briefing that we received yesterday from the National Union of Students Scotland. It made some excellent points and pointed out that</p><p>&#8220;It is vital that comprehensive efforts are made to educate young people who will be eligible to vote at the time of the referendum about how to register, and ensure they have the information and tools needed to take part in this historic vote&#8221;.</p><p>That is absolutely right.</p><p>The NUS also makes the interesting point that it would support</p><p>&#8220;the unbiased promotion of referendum participation in schools and colleges&#8221;.</p><p>I agree, provided that such promotion is unbiased. It goes on to say that it</p><p>&#8220;would like to see polling places open on college and university campuses for the referendum.&#8221;</p><p>I have a great deal of sympathy with that, because the referendum will take place at what could be a critical transitional point for some students. The Electoral Commission also picked up that issue in its briefing.</p><p>Another aspect that I will dwell on is whether there could be a useful tandem between the NUS and the Electoral Commission. A lot of the Electoral Commission&#8217;s briefing involves cross-references, and some themes are repeated by the NUS and the Electoral Commission. Such a tandem might be helpful.</p><p>The Electoral Commission&#8217;s briefing talked about what it was doing to improve awareness among 15 to 17-year-olds.

We brought our different backgrounds and experiences to that forum.</p><p>In bringing this debate to the Parliament, Hanzala Malik has achieved two important things. First, and quite rightly, he has highlighted the imagination and innovation of Amina&#8212;the Muslim Women&#8217;s Resource Centre in Glasgow in devising and launching the I speak for myself campaign, which deserves praise in its own right. Secondly, the carefully drafted script of his motion lifts the veil on the vulnerability, apprehension and isolation that are felt by many in the Muslim community, all of which can be intensified by external events.</p><p>As a Parliament, we should be very concerned if that community suffers from misconceptions about and endures discrimination towards Muslim women and the Islamic faith.

It is also an immensely enjoyable social occasion.</p><p>This year the dinner was outstanding. It took place against the backdrop of the appalling murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, to which Malcolm Chisholm referred, but that tragedy served to demonstrate how, from our different backgrounds and cultures, we stand united in condemning what is wrong and bad and supporting what is good and right.

The golden eagle is still not the national bird of Scotland.</p><p>That sorry tale was told not to discourage but to outline the pitfalls. Joan McAlpine has been wise to keep her motion non-specific about the type of tree, although her speech was perhaps a little more partisan. It is also important that neither the proposal nor the tree that is ultimately chosen, if that happens, be claimed by any one party. The proposal will work only if there is cross-party and broad-based support.</p><p>I observe that accepting a principle is only the start of a long and tortuous journey. From my experience, careful thought must be given to process. It has to involve wide public consultation and embrace public comment on the principle, because if the public do not want a national tree, the game&#8217;s a bogey. However, if the public are supportive of that, there are other issues to clarify.

I say that not because I have been in the Parliament for nearly 14 years and not because, in that time, I have heard numerous suggestions from all parties&#8212;whether in government or opposition&#8212;about how we should deal with childcare, but because I start from first principles.</p><p>Some parents decide that their family will have a non-working mother or father and can afford to make that decision. That is fine but, for the majority of parents, it is not an option. The reality of modern life is that both parents work&#8212;possibly out of choice, probably out of necessity. In working, they bring much-needed skills to the economy, bring stability to their workplace environment and generate welcome spend in the economy. That can only be regarded as positive but, for some parents who cannot access childcare, that opportunity does not exist, and that is wrong.</p><p>For those reasons, I regard the provision of childcare to be as essential as the provision of healthcare or schooling or as maintaining our public transport system. To avoid confusion, I clarify that I am not advocating a new publicly funded universal benefit. I am saying that we can do an awful lot more to match the needs and responsibilities of parents with reasonable and more effective support from Government.</p><p>The other important consequence of childcare is a direct benefit to the child. That may range from learning new personal skills and nurturing positive relationships with other children to embarking on the process of learning. Hugh Henry rightly referred to that.</p><p>On how the Parliament has fared on that front over nearly 14 years, the answer has to be patchily. Things are certainly better than when we started, but recent progress has been more glacial than swift. On the positive front, the statutory provision of 475 hours per annum for three and four-year-olds, which was introduced in 2007 to improve on the previous 415 hours, was helpful. The proposed increase to 600 hours by 2014 is welcome. It is overdue progress&#8212;it has, after all, taken seven years to accomplish.</p><p>Where does Scotland sit in relation to childcare? The statutory provision is not as good as that in England. England&#8217;s childcare entitlement is being extended to two-year-olds from 40 per cent of the most disadvantaged families from 2014. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, is in discussion with childcare providers to persuade them to price services on an hourly rate rather than in blocks. That would make childcare more affordable, as parents would not have to pay for care when they did not need it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690403", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Hugh Henry is to be commended for bringing the debate to the chamber.

That matters not only because more and more offenders are being punished within the community but because it relates directly to Scotland&#8217;s eight community justice authorities, the sole purpose of which is to reduce reoffending in Scotland.</p><p>As a number of members have noted, reoffending is a both worrying and costly problem in Scotland. Margaret Mitchell was right to reflect that in her amendment, which I support. Why is it worrying? It is worrying because nearly one in three offenders are reconvicted within a year. Why is it costly? Despite spending &#163;128 million annually in an attempt to reduce reoffending, the Scottish Government estimates its economic and social cost to be around &#163;3 billion a year.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government accepts that reform is necessary. The Audit Scotland report, to which many members have referred, concluded that the way in which CJAs were set up, along with inflexible funding, have &#8220;significantly limited their effectiveness.&#8221; The report was remarkably blunt and concluded that CJAs</p><p>&#8220;have made little progress with reducing reoffending.&#8221;</p><p>Identified shortcomings include a lack of incentive to reduce reoffending, complex management arrangements, a short-term approach to funding and a lack of assessment of CJA performance. Those are serious criticisms.</p><p>The Scottish Government has put forward three proposals for reform, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Like the Government, I, too, will wait for the consultation responses before indicating a preferred option. However, I would like to make three general observations.</p><p>First, the priority of any future model must be to direct resources to what works in reducing reoffending. As the Audit Scotland report notes:</p><p>&#8220;There is a mismatch between what is currently being delivered and what is known to be effective.&#8221;</p><p>That is damning, so we need to ensure that the new model is much more clearly focused.</p><p>Secondly, I suggest that the Scottish Government must learn from its mistakes in driving through the reform of the police service despite justified criticism. It must seek to carry all the relevant agencies and, I would suggest, the Opposition parties, with it in the process. I welcome the Government&#8217;s apparent willingness to take time to get this right. It is helpful that this debate has been called before any firm decision has been made.</p><p>Thirdly, I suggest that the Government should not restrict itself to the three options proposed for reform. Perhaps in summing up the minister will indicate whether the Government has considered more radical reform. For example, there is clearly room for improvement in throughcare. Christine Grahame, Colin Keir, Graeme Pearson and Alison McInnes all made what I thought were helpful and reflective contributions in that respect. Has consideration been given to the creation of one body with overall responsibility for reducing reoffending both inside and outside of prison?</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to look back at the creation of the system that we are debating today. I was convener of the Justice 2 Committee, which considered community justice authorities back in November 2005. My party was the only party in this chamber to vote against the bill that introduced them. We did so for two reasons.</p><p>First, we took the view that insufficient time had been afforded to assess the regime that CJAs replaced, which had been established in 2002. By 2005, it was already proving to be useful in effectively co-ordinating activity and co-operation between agencies. My party worried about unnecessary bureaucracy. Eight years down the road, we are debating whether CJAs are fit for purpose.</p><p>Back in 2005, the view was taken&#8212;and has been embraced by the Scottish National Party&#8212;that because reoffending rates were slightly lower for those who were given community sentences than they were for those who were given custodial sentences, more offenders should be dealt with in the community.</p><p>My party has no principled objection to robust community sentences, which are cheaper and can be more effective than a prison sentence for some crimes, but we do not support the use of community sentences as a means of emptying our prisons of violent and dangerous individuals who should be locked up for the protection of the law-abiding majority. We fundamentally disagree with the SNP&#8217;s analysis that, because reoffending is lower with community sentences, more and more offenders should be spared prison. That is like saying that, because lambs in fields do not attack people, we should put more lions into fields&#8212;it is perverse logic. It is not the community element that reduces reoffending; it is simply that less serious offenders are given community sentences, so the risk of reoffending is lower.</p><p>The second reason why my party opposed the Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Act 2005 was that it introduced home detention curfews and did so under the much-discredited automatic early release regime. I lodged amendments to try to end that practice, but I am afraid that the Labour and SNP members of the committee voted against them.</p><p>As I was looking back at the passage of the 2005 act, I came across a statement by a substitute member of the committee, who agreed with my approach on automatic early release. He told me:</p><p>&#8220;I have a great deal of sympathy with what you are trying to achieve&#8221;.</p><p>He added:</p><p>&#8220;We would all agree that we wish that we were not where we are. We are not in the chamber so, to some extent, who did what and when does not matter. What matters is what we are going to do about it. Lawyers are all aware of the differences: 50 per cent for those serving under four years and two thirds for those serving more than that. The public, however, are baffled; they simply think that whether the sentence is six months, two years or 12 years, what you see should be what you get.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice 2 Committee, 27 September 2005; c 1688.]</p><p>I wonder whether the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, still stands by the comments that he made eight years ago.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690163", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome both the Scottish Government&#8217;s recent consultation and this afternoon&#8217;s debate on redesigning the community justice system.

If I were a querulous polemicist of dyspeptic demeanour, I might observe that the motion implies that Scotland is not already the best place for children to grow up&#8212;indeed, Mark Griffin and Dennis Robertson alluded to that aspect. That implication would be unfortunate, because I, like many others in the chamber, grew up in Scotland and I could not have grown up in a better place or had a better upbringing. That is not the same as saying that I am well brought up&#8212;an assertion with which many would take issue, I am sure.</p><p>If the motion exhorts us to do better, so that more children can enjoy what many of us were fortunate enough to enjoy, that is an entirely worthy aspiration that I whole-heartedly support, as, it is clear, do other members across the chamber. There have been some notably thoughtful contributions.</p><p>The unpalatable truth is that too many young people in Scotland do not get the start that they need, the stability to which they are entitled or the supportive love that is so essential in their lives.</p><p>Those are uncomfortable truths, but we need to acknowledge them. The debate has been a welcome opportunity to discuss those issues in a frank and open manner. However, we must recognise how much is already positive in Scotland for young people. The majority of children in Scotland grow up in a loving, secure and stable family environment. Of course, more of those young people need to know the reality of what a loving, secure and stable family environment is. That is why I applaud the increased focus from successive Governments on targeting spending on the earliest years. The importance of early childhood development and the impact of early intervention on determining future health, social wellbeing and educational achievement cannot be overemphasised. Quite rightly, that is seen as a priority.</p><p>It is a sad fact that too many children are affected by a background of lack of stability, substance abuse, alcoholism or poor school attendance. Any one of those problems can seriously prejudice a child&#8217;s development. Those problems span two or three generations disturbingly often and cannot be solved by the will or policies of one Parliament or one Government. Solutions may come from a variety of sources&#8212;some from within politics, others not. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s recognition in the motion of the role of the third sector. Aileen Campbell referred to the collaborative approach that is already being adopted.</p><p>I will consider some of the issues that have arisen and some possible solutions. Health visitors are people close to my heart. We cannot underestimate the role that those professionals perform in their significant contribution to the health and wellbeing of families and communities across Scotland, which is why Liz Smith lodged her amendment. I remember visiting a health centre in a part of Glasgow facing many challenges, where one of the GPs eloquently described how a health visitor could both gain the confidence of and enter a household into which that GP might not be invited. The GP was clear about the twin benefits of the health visitor, first, in being seen as a help to the household&#8212;not a threat, or part of officialdom&#8212;and, secondly, in being able to identify at an early stage any possible cause for concern in the household. The children and young people bill will be a chance for my party to reiterate our commitment to health visiting, which is a vital preventative service in the early years. My party has advocated extending universal health services to all children, with particular emphasis on the first three years.</p><p>Many members have referred to parenting. The sad and stark fact is that, in some cases, we have seen three generations where either there has been an ignorance of parenting skills or the parenting role has been fundamentally prejudiced by other issues, such as substance abuse or alcoholism. Instead of seeing an example of good parenting, children have grown up with parental chaos and have had no good model of parenting to adopt and pass on to their children. As members have suggested, even when many new parents want to do their best, they may not have a full understanding of the demands and responsibilities of their new role. Mark McDonald referred to that aspect of parenting. Those problems become more acute when there is no support network of family and friends.</p><p>I have long since argued that we need a wholesale review of parenting. To that end I whole-heartedly welcome the publication of the Scottish Government&#8217;s national parenting strategy. Charities and voluntary groups have a vital role to play, and it is good to see that recognised in the motion. I have previously referred in the chamber to street stuff, which is a project in my area that I think George Adam is familiar with. It does fantastic work with young people who come from very challenged backgrounds.</p><p>Another important area is the particular and significant problems facing children in care, to which Liam McArthur referred. I am delighted about the renewed focus on GIRFEC; the philosophy underpinning it is admirable.</p><p>We must also support and encourage young carers themselves. Those committed and brave young people are doing a wonderful job. It is all too easy for them to slip off the radar screen. We have heard reference to childcare. My party would extend free childcare provision to all two-year-olds, starting with the most deprived. It is also important that we bring more flexibility to the provision of childcare. We need hours that suit the parent; that would be an enormous help to many parents, particularly women, and would give them the opportunity to re-enter the workplace.</p><p>It has been a helpful debate, which has highlighted a number of interesting ideas. We all want to do more to ensure that all children in Scotland can enjoy at first hand the experience of this being a great place to grow up.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion for the debate speaks of an aspiration &#8220;to make Scotland the best place in the world for children to grow up&#8221;.

I have always believed that we should never be shy in looking at how we deliver our public services. Many contributions to that debate are now coming forward and they certainly merit serious consideration.</p><p>I note that the committee also took evidence on healthy life expectancy. Discussion often centres on life expectancy, but healthy life expectancy needs to be given a much sharper focus. The report states that it is</p><p>&#8220;the length of time an individual can expect to live free of chronic or debilitating disease&#8221;.</p><p>Like Mr Macintosh, I was struck by the differences in different areas of Scotland. We can compare the average not-healthy period of 5.5&#160;years in one area with the period of 11.2&#160;years in another area. I think that we would all regard that as a staggering difference. The gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy for men has actually been widening again. We would like to know what action the Scottish Government is taking on that.</p><p>It will be challenging to plan ahead successfully. It will require comprehensive and&#8212;I do not like the phrase, but I cannot think of a better one&#8212;joined-up thinking and partnership action. The Improvement Service phrased it well when it said that we need to</p><p>&#8220;endorse a long term shift from a service base that is reactive to one that is preventative and promotes positive outcomes first time round.&#8221;</p><p>There is also a striking difference of approach between various councils when it comes to developing a strategy. Mr Macintosh alluded to that. Some councils are enlightened and proactive. One has taken long-term planning seriously and it has a 10-year plan, but others are moving at a more leisurely pace and they focus on three-year funding cycles. That has to change, so I welcome the meeting with COSLA that Mr Gibson mentioned in his speech.</p><p>In that context, I ask the cabinet secretary what central Government&#8217;s advice to the public sector is on long-range planning. Are there clear guidelines, or is there just a general opaqueness? Further to that, what does central Government itself do in practice? The committee was told that activity varies between departments, but some clarity on how that activity varies and the timescales that are adopted in certain policy areas would be welcome and helpful.</p><p>The committee posed a number of other questions that need to be answered. On health, although I listened to what the cabinet secretary said and accept that there have been many advances in preventative spend for health, we have to ask why we have not seen improvements regarding emergency admissions to hospital and what actions will be taken to turn that around.</p><p>On the broad issue of preventative spend, again my party is more than sympathetic to the idea of deploying resource to that objective. In fact, I have to say that the new drugs strategy for Scotland, which my party insisted be delivered in 2008 and which focuses on recovery, is all about trying to help people in advance, support them in their addiction and have a much more positive destination at the end.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to my home patch of Renfrewshire. He is right to say that some extremely successful community safety initiatives are taking place there. I and one or two others in the chamber contributed to a debate on a motion that I lodged on the street stuff project in Renfrewshire, which is a strikingly impressive example of what happens when all the main partnership agencies get together and deliver a welcome and meaningful improvement.</p><p>I welcome the funds that have been set aside in general for preventative spend. I think that there are broad questions about how the Government can ensure that the fund is going on genuine preventative spend and about how that is measured. I am not pretending that it will be easy, but I think that there is a need to focus on those issues.</p><p>Housing has been dealt with in the debate, and the housing for older people strategy is a good idea&#8212;I will probably be a beneficiary of it in the not-too-distant future. However, where are the measurable targets and the corresponding budgets?</p><p>In conclusion, I commend the committee on what I think is a good, constructive and helpful report. Its last paragraph echoes what Mr Macintosh was talking about. It says:</p><p>&#8220;Both this Committee and its predecessor have consistently called for the need for more effective collaborative working across the public services including the need to pool resources and to share good practice. There is also a need to develop a more performance based and target based approach as a means of measuring the effectiveness of the various government strategies and policy initiatives which in turn should provide an increasing evidence base for accelerating the cultural and structural change which is essential if the challenges of demographic change and an ageing society are to be met.&#8221;</p><p>That paragraph gets right to the nub of the issue. I very much hope that the committee might think of performing a standing role of vigilance on this issue. I think that the committee has an important locus in that respect.</p><p>I look forward to seeing the Government&#8217;s formal response and listening to the rest of the debate. The issue will straddle several Governments and several sessions of Parliament. It is vital that, in Scotland, we try to get it right.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say to the cabinet secretary that, where I am concerned, he is pushing at an open door.

The project is core funded, managed and co-ordinated by Renfrewshire Council&#8217;s education and leisure services, and it is delivered in partnership with environmental services, St Mirren Football Club, Engage Renfrewshire, Strathclyde Police, Strathclyde Fire and Rescue, and McGill&#8217;s Bus Service.</p><p>I want to thank and pay tribute to all those partners as well as to the main drivers of the project: Councillor Eddie Devine; Stephen Gallacher, who is the project&#8217;s co-ordinator and a St Mirren member of staff; Carolanne Robertson of Renfrewshire Council environmental services; and Fiona Watson, who is the sport and health services manager for the council.</p><p>Every member in the chamber will have experienced the thrill of excitement and hope that arises from coming across something completely unexpected that has success written all over it. I remember vividly my first visit to street stuff. On a rather damp evening in a not very accessible part of Renfrew, I had been invited to inspect the box. I had repeatedly got lost and I was totally unprepared for the animated enthusiastic young people who welcomed me with open arms. They could not wait to tell me about the project and show off the box, which is a fitted-out and heated metal shipping container. They told me how proud they were of the project and how much they enjoyed being able to meet up with one another, and they entertained me with some song and dance.</p><p>The enthusiasm and passion of those young people are matched in equal measure by the people whom I have already mentioned and by the other supporters and volunteers, whose commitment to the young people is unwavering. My second visit, on the cold frosty night of 7 December, was just as inspiring, and it included a visit to the Inchinnan bus depot to see the two specially adapted buses.</p><p>What is the project all about? Street stuff is a youth diversionary scheme that aims to give kids in local communities something to do in the evenings as an alternative to hanging around the streets. The project has helped dramatically to reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour. Let me just give some of the facts: between 2007-08 and 2011-12, the number of incidents of vandalism and youth disorder fell in Paisley North from 3,150 to 1,768, in Paisley South from 2,356 to 998 and in Renfrew and Gallowhill from 2,668 to 1,312. I do not know about other members, but I call that inspiring and impressive.</p><p>How does it work and what happens? Working with disaffected and hard-to-reach young people aged between 10 and 18 in some of the most deprived areas of Renfrewshire, the project seeks to do the following: with the local police, identify youth disorder hot spots; engage directly with diversionary activity; inform the young people of the opportunities open to them; support referral to the local employment initiative; provide training and volunteering opportunities; encourage the young people to participate in local youth clubs or sports clubs; and deploy a range of mobile equipment, including four mobile football pitches, a youth bus, a gym bus and the box to which I have referred. All of that happens six nights a week for 48 weeks of the year, with additional facilities being provided during school holiday periods.</p><p>The box is a multipurpose entertainment unit kitted out with computer games and dance mats. The two buses are very impressive. The youth bus offers information technology equipment, including computers and a Wii game. The gym bus has been fitted out with state-of-the-art gym equipment. Obviously, both buses are mobile, and McGill&#8217;s both garages and maintains the vehicles and provides drivers as required.</p><p>But there is something else. The kick and collect programme, which is run by street stuff, encourages youngsters to take part in voluntary work in the community, for which the youngsters are rewarded with prizes. They learn about mutual respect and they learn about the community. That is real hands-on community engagement, and it works.</p><p>The kick and collect programme continues to engage with young people who are willing to volunteer in their communities. In partnership with environmental services, a range of clean-ups, litter picks and graffiti removals have taken place across Renfrewshire. Each time a young person volunteers for a clean-up or community activity, the young person&#8217;s kick and collect card is stamped. Once the young person has collected a number of stamps, the card can be redeemed for a reward.</p><p>To date, all rewards have been donated by a number of local organisations and businesses, including Renfrewshire Leisure, Xscape, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Filshill and Showcase Cinemas. The rewards and experiences provide an opportunity to participate in activities that are potentially out of the reach of very vulnerable young people.</p><p>Not surprisingly, street stuff has been recognised for innovative practice and has received 12 awards over the past 18 months. The project has been cited as a model of best practice in Scottish Government publications, and it has been shortlisted for a 2013 Convention of Scottish Local Authorities excellence award.</p><p>Street stuff is a huge success, and I believe that the initiative could be rolled out across Scotland. Street stuff staff have told me that they would be very happy to share their experiences. Perhaps the minister could encourage that. I urge her to go and see the project for herself. She will find it an uplifting and informative experience.</p><p>Street stuff is an exemplar of organisations working in partnership with a team of dedicated individuals who are all committed to making a real difference to young lives and to their local communities. I wish everyone who is involved in the project the very best for the future, and I sincerely hope that the initiative can be rolled out across the rest of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Street Stuff"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted that the motion has been selected for debate, and I thank everyone who has supported it.

All major political parties are signed up to the importance of human rights. However, there is scope for debate on the best way in which to enforce and interpret those rights, and I will return to that point later.</p><p>It is equally important that the framework of human rights must enjoy the support and confidence of the public. That positive perception is essential and a negative perception is deeply damaging. What the public might support in theory, which is good, does not necessarily translate into support in practice, which is bad, so I will develop the theme.</p><p>I agree with the general tenor of the motion, which my party will support, and I welcome the opportunity for the Parliament to reaffirm its commitment to human rights. I also support Jenny Marra&#8217;s amendment. However, when reading the motion, I reflected on the use of the term &#8220;inalienable&#8221;. Every member of the Parliament is signed up to human rights as a set of fundamental rights that every person can expect to enjoy. Nevertheless, all rights are subject to interpretation and, crucially, they all interact with one another.</p><p>It is legitimate to explore that aspect, so I pose the question&#8212;I do so genuinely&#8212;of how we reconcile the absolute rights of, say, a victim, with the absolute rights of an assailant. Those are opposing rights. One person&#8217;s rights to a fair trial and to liberty are balanced by the other&#8217;s rights to security of person and freedom from ill-treatment. In that case, granting absolute or inalienable rights to the two individuals seems to me to be potentially irreconcilable. The use of the term &#8220;inalienable&#8221;&#8212;perhaps the minister could have picked an easier word to pronounce for the motion&#8212;therefore ignores the fact that fundamental rights can sometimes be in conflict and does not recognise that with rights come responsibilities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683467", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Rights"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic, particularly on Scotland&#8217;s responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens and promote a similar approach abroad.

A YouGov poll that was published last year found that 72 per cent of the public thought that</p><p>&#8220;human rights have become a charter for criminals and the undeserving&#8221;.</p><p>A similar poll that was published the year before found that 75 per cent of respondents believed that the Human Rights Act 1998 was</p><p>&#8220;used too widely to create rights it was never intended to protect&#8221;.</p><p>We should not ignore that or just brush it aside, because it is in the interests of those of us who champion fundamental human rights to bring the public on side and to improve that perception. As I said earlier, that negative perception by the public is deeply damaging.</p><p>It is right that the UK Government is considering reform of the human rights regime. For the benefit of the minister, I will say that it is absolutely not the case that the UK Government wants to repeal the human rights act&#8212;it is looking at replacing it with a new bill of rights, and, 15 years on from the human rights act, it is appropriate to consider whether reform could strengthen the human rights regime. Perhaps we need to look at whether there is a requirement for a shift in emphasis to achieve a balance&#8212;to get rid of that irreconcilable element as regards the rights of those who do wrong compared with the rights of the victims.</p><p>It is a paradox that lawbreakers can demand as a right a voice in lawmaking when they showed scant regard for upholding the law in the first place. That illustrates a dilemma and it illustrates one of the reasons why, sadly, the public apparently has a poor impression of the human rights framework. By considering reform, we have the opportunity to strengthen that framework and to win over the public, both of which are good for human rights in Scotland.</p><p>As I close, I hope that I can adopt a more consensual note. I know that everyone in this chamber remains absolutely committed to the importance of human rights in Scotland, in the United Kingdom and worldwide. A modern, democratic Scotland, as part of the United Kingdom, has a responsibility to promote good practice abroad.

Part 1 implements a key recommendation of the Gill review and it is a welcome step towards updating Scotland&#8217;s civil court rules. The council will have a remit to review the wider civil justice system. We should be in no doubt that the council will be a powerful organisation that will exercise considerable influence.</p><p>I noted the cabinet secretary&#8217;s assurances at stage 2 that the council will act in an open and accountable way and that appointments to it will be made in an accountable manner. It is unfortunate, however, that the amendments in relation to the activities of the council lodged by Margaret Mitchell at stage 2 and Jenny Marra&#8217;s amendment 22 debated today, which my party supported&#8212;amendments that sought manifest openness and transparency; I do not see how people could object to that&#8212;were rejected by the Scottish Government.</p><p>I will turn to part 2 of the bill, which I find problematic. Part 2 has had a difficult time. Indeed, I understand that the Justice Committee came close to rejecting part 2 at stage 1, but had a change of heart at stage 2. We have heard from Lewis Macdonald the reaction from the legal profession. Notably, 12 bar associations, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, remain opposed to the legal aid reforms, and the Law Society of Scotland, while accepting the Scottish Government&#8217;s compromise offer, maintains opposition to the collection regime.</p><p>My party has attempted to support efforts to improve the efficiencies of the bill. Certainly, the increase in the disposable income threshold above which contributions will be made, and the agreement that the disability living allowance, its replacement personal independence payments, and war pensions will be disregarded is welcome. It is also right that no contributions will be required for offenders in custody or in police stations, which at least means that access to legal advice at a critical time will not be restricted.</p><p>The rejection of Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s amendment 24, which sought to exclude the income and capital of spouses and partners, which would have been a lot fairer to an accused who desperately needs advice and may need financial help, was unfortunate. Margaret Mitchell attempted to secure a wider debate on the question of contribution refunds; Mr Pearson spoke about that, too. That wider debate is needed and I hope that the Scottish Government will consider that and perhaps reflect on what might be done.</p><p>Part 2 of the bill is underpinned by the presumption that those who can afford to pay for public services should do so. I support that general proposition and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s conversion to the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; way of thinking. However, that presumption must be weighed against the specific situation in which it is to be deployed. When that situation is the administration of justice and the fundamental right of an accused to legal advice, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that those unable to pay for that advice are not denied it.</p><p>That is where, for me, the bill hits a brick wall, because either the Government discharges that responsibility with a cohort of state-funded public defence solicitors or it creates a workable criminal legal aid system. The overall provision of public defence lawyers would be very expensive and much more inflexible to administer than a criminal legal aid system.</p><p>In this bill, the Government has failed in its attempt to deliver a workable criminal legal aid system. When an accused is unable to meet privately the cost of legal defence, the legal aid system must work on the basis that the accused can access advice without immediately being confronted by demands for money that he or she might not have. Equally, at that critical point the solicitor should have confidence that the legal aid system will resolve what the accused is due to pay and when, so that the solicitor can proceed without impediment to give advice.</p><p>The bill fails those fundamental tests. It presents the spectre of an anxious accused who desperately needs advice and is expected to scrape around to find sufficient funds to unlock the advice, and a solicitor who departs from the role of adviser and assumes the mantle of debt collector to hound the accused for money. If at that point the accused does not have or cannot produce the money&#8212;shoes for the children or food on the table might have taken precedence&#8212;the solicitor is placed in a professional and moral dilemma about what to do.</p><p>That is not a workable criminal legal aid system. It is a dog&#8217;s breakfast and an affront to decent standards of fairness and the fundamental right of an accused to representation. The bill raises significant questions about access to justice. What is predictable is that individuals who are accused of crime will be scared of seeking advice, might not be able to muster the funds to pay for advice and might end up representing themselves. That helps neither them nor the courts.</p><p>I welcome the reforms to the civil justice system in the bill, but the criminal legal aid system that part 2 will deliver is unfair and unworkable and will betray the most vulnerable.

There has been a well-informed process to justify our decisions as to how we might embark upon the civil justice reforms. In that respect, that bit of the bill has been proceeding on a stable basis. We want more efficiency and broader civic involvement in the Scottish civil justice system, and that will be achieved through the Scottish civil justice council. The amendments from Margaret Mitchell and Jenny Marra that were discussed this afternoon would have improved openness and transparency, and it is a great pity that the Government did not accept them.</p><p>We could have had a standalone, solid, consensual civil justice bill. Criminal legal assistance is an entirely different matter. As I have said, I do not underestimate the challenging proposition involved, but would not the whole process have benefited from broader consultation and a separate bill resting on what that broader consultation produced, with the aim of trying to unite people? That matters to Scotland, not just to civic Scotland and those who are accused of committing crimes. It matters that we have a solid, confident, competent, professionally capable legal profession. At the moment, we have a legal profession that is split into pieces. I do not need to explain that to the cabinet secretary&#8212;he knows it for himself.</p><p>I agree with Lewis Macdonald that the profession is divided.

Yet 20 years on from those pioneering campaigns, regrettably violence against women is still with us and it remains high on the political agenda.</p><p>Violence against women is a pervasive social problem that affects every neighbourhood throughout Scotland; it can be found in every social background. Against that bleak backdrop, Zero Tolerance is a torchbearer that works to tackle the causes of men&#8217;s violence against women. It works with individuals, communities, women&#8217;s organisations, schools, the media and others to address the causes of violence against women and bring about change. Starting the new year with this debate, just over a month since Jamie Hepburn&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate on the white ribbon campaign, is a good way to drive forward that change.</p><p>We need to reassure victims that abusive behaviour is not normal. It is repugnant, disgusting and unacceptable, and victims must be supported in understanding that they are not to blame. We need to send an uncompromising message to the perpetrators of abuse&#8212;the cowardly bullies who frighten, threaten and hurt&#8212;that they will be exposed, their names will become public and their squalid little secret will be out.</p><p>In the December debate, I said:</p><p>&#8220;Violence against women is unacceptable and abhorrent, and it has no place in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>I referred to the statistics, which are very depressing:</p><p>&#8220;In Scotland, nearly 60,000 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded by the police in 2011-12, which is a 7 per cent increase on the 2010-11 figures. Since 2002-03, there has been a 67 per cent increase in recorded incidents of domestic abuse, and there are currently 163 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police each day.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 4 December 2012; c 14293.]</p><p>The greatest protection available to the perpetrators of that misery is silence. That silence is malign, which is why domestic abuse must be reported and, when reported, tackled.</p><p>As it is vital to make help available to women who are fleeing violence, we should, as other members have pointed out, recognise the valuable work of many voluntary groups in that regard. I recently visited organisations in my area that carry out excellent work to support and protect women and their children suffering from domestic abuse. My most recent visits were to Renfrewshire Women&#8217;s Aid and Inverclyde Women&#8217;s Aid, which provide fantastic support to women and their families.</p><p>We must never forget that children can also be victims; for example, they might be present when incidents of abuse occur or might themselves be subjected to direct violence. I was heartened to hear, as I think Malcolm Chisholm mentioned, that the Zero Tolerance Scotland website contains a link to a website for younger people, safe hub Scotland, which provides information and guidance to younger people who have experienced domestic abuse. I was also interested to learn that this invaluable tool was designed for young people by young people who have experienced such abuse. In this age of technology and social media, we have a huge opportunity to inform, reassure, share information with and give guidance and advice to victims.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681105", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Zero Tolerance Campaigns"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Malcolm Chisholm for bringing such an important issue to the chamber for debate.

I support the motion.</p><p>In my remarks, I want to concentrate on Scotland. Historically, Scotland has been a country of net out-migration, but over the past 45 years that has greatly reduced. Indeed, in every year since 2002, Scotland has experienced net migration gains of at least 19,000 per year. In 2010-11 there was a net migration gain of 27,000, which was the highest since estimates began in 1951.</p><p>Some of the most recent and reliable data and information on migrants in Scotland is contained in the Scottish Parliament Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s fifth report in 2010, which followed its inquiry into migration and trafficking in Scotland.</p><p>The committee made the following findings. It said that Scotland has demographic problems, and its report noted that the</p><p>&#8220;Demographic projection of an ageing population and an increase in the ratio of workers with dependents has led to the view that Scotland will need to attract migrants in order to support the economy.&#8221;</p><p>The committee was prescient, because we have learned from the 2011 census results that were published yesterday that, for the first time, there are more pensioners than young people in Scotland. That has huge implications for a range of policies, but foremost among them must be that of achieving a sustainable economy. The migrant population&#8217;s importance to the economy was&#8212;rightly&#8212;underlined by the committee&#8217;s report in 2010, and it is highlighted by the census data that was published yesterday.</p><p>That is why the committee&#8217;s other findings are significant. The committee said that there is a lack of reliable data. That must be addressed. We need to know the extent to which the economy depends on the migrant workforce, the skills and experience that are being deployed and the sectors in which they are being used.</p><p>The committee pointed out that the public perception of migration in Scotland is negative&#8212;some members have referred to that. I think that we all agree that that is utterly unacceptable. People need to be educated about the asset that is our migrant population; our economy would not function fully without them.</p><p>The committee observed that there is a lack of awareness about migrants&#8217; entitlements and that migrants lack knowledge and awareness about public services, rights and entitlements. That is also unacceptable. In this day and age, with the benefits of technology, surely we can make a far better fist of providing such basic information&#8212;this is not a large country. The committee said:</p><p>&#8220;it is vital for information to be made available to migrants on their arrival in Scotland so that they know what their legal and civic rights and entitlements are, and to assist them in sourcing help and information so that they can have access to the full range of public services that will assist them and help make their transition to life in Scotland as straightforward as possible.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with that. How do we make that happen?</p><p>In 2009, the Scottish Government commissioned a report into migration in Scotland, which found that</p><p>&#8220;there is evidence of poor employment practice ... for example breach of regulations on working hours. Migrants have been found to have limited awareness of their employment rights. Many migrants are over-qualified for the low-skilled and low paid work in which they are predominantly employed.&#8221;</p><p>The findings in that report also highlighted the need for more robust data about Scottish migration.</p><p>I would welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s report and the Scottish Government&#8217;s 2009 report, with an emphasis on progress to date.

Not for the first time, a title that looks slightly dry in the abstract turned out in practice to be extremely interesting.</p><p>The role of the Scottish Parliament committee, as its convener said, is important because, although the order is a United Kingdom statutory instrument, it can proceed to law only if it is approved by resolution of both houses of the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament. Therefore, there is already enough material to provide a paradise for constitutional lawyers and other gurus and aficionados of parliamentary process. I share the convener&#8217;s admiration and appreciation of the experts in those fields, who provided useful evidence to the committee. In their absence, we would have been like shepherds without a star, to use a seasonal metaphor, although I sometimes felt that I was looking at a number of stars and was slightly dazzled by them all. However, that evidence was extremely helpful and provided useful pointers to the committee not only for the essentially very technical process of scrutinising the draft order but in giving a backdrop to the broader process of the bill and the paving legislation for the proposed extension of the franchise, both of which are to follow.</p><p>Let me deal with the simple technical issue of the draft order. Procedurally, of course, it can only be approved or rejected, so a relatively straightforward choice lay before the committee. Given the prelude of the Edinburgh agreement between the UK and Scottish Governments, approval by the committee was, arguably, predictable. The only factor that might have precluded such an outcome would have been explicit evidence that the order was incompetent or materially flawed as drafted. No such evidence was provided, and the committee unanimously approved the order. Members are invited to do the same this evening.</p><p>I would like to cover the broader issues that the scrutiny process flagged up, the first of which is the status of the Edinburgh agreement. Paragraph 22 of the committee&#8217;s report notes:</p><p>&#8220;There was broad consensus among oral witnesses about the significance of the agreement&#8212;which the Secretary of State described as &#8216;historic&#8217;. For the Deputy First Minister it was &#8216;a watershed moment in Scotland&#8217;s home-rule journey&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Whatever the different political destinations that the two Governments desire, it is clear to me that both have confidence in and respect for the agreement, and that they both wish the ensuing process to be conducted in the spirit of the agreement. That is vital to ensure public confidence in the whole process. Indeed, as paragraph 23 of the report makes clear, that was underpinned by the secretary of state and the Deputy First Minister. I welcome Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s clarity in saying that the Scottish Government is</p><p>&#8220;honour-bound politically and morally by the Edinburgh agreement, which makes it clear that, where appropriate, the rules and certainly the spirit of PPERA will govern the referendum.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 15 November 2012; c 85-6.]</p><p>It is important that the spirit of the agreement and what it sets out to do are mirrored by the subsequent actions of politicians.

I am encouraged to see, however, a recognition that it is important that the other part of the operation is ensuring that the process remains unimpeachable. Without that, there will not be the necessary degree of confidence among the public.</p><p>A number of members commented on the role of the Electoral Commission, and I thought that the report was very helpful in that respect. Many witnesses in the committee laid great emphasis on the importance of the role of the Electoral Commission in ensuring that there is the necessary fairness to reassure the public that no one set of politicians is trying to hijack the process for a particular end. The Electoral Commission will, of course, also have an important task in assessing the intelligibility of the question.</p><p>I was struck by what one of the witnesses, Alan Trench, pointed out. I quote paragraph 34 of the committee&#8217;s report, in which we are told that he said that,</p><p>&#8220;since the Electoral Commission was not mentioned in the section 30 Order itself, it would in principle be possible for the Parliament to pass a Bill that gave the Commission a more limited role than that envisaged in the agreement.&#8221;</p><p>However he warned that</p><p>&#8220;such an approach would ... carry significant legal and constitutional risks, and also political risks, as it would jeopardise the perception of fairness that was so important to securing respect&#8221;</p><p>for the process.

That is vital to the integrity of the process.</p><p>We understand that passions will run high and that politics will play a momentous role in the debate, but I hope that it will be possible to conduct the debate with a degree of mutual respect and courtesy.

The inquiry exposed unethical as well as illegal conduct by some elements of the press&#8212;that is the dry technical description. To the broader public, it laid bare squalid practices and unprincipled, shameless behaviour that all reasonable people find repugnant.</p><p>The inquiry went further. It demonstrated the elementary failure of the current regulatory regime and a fundamental failure of our political system over the past two decades to tackle an intensifying problem. In that context, Lord Justice Leveson asked what the Roman poet, Juvenal, asked near 2,000 years ago: &#8220;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&#8221;&#8212;who guards the guard dogs?</p><p>Well, Lord Justice Leveson has published his findings and recommendations. In among the responses and the commentary, one feature has emerged: the problem is not simple and whatever we do, we should do with caution. In many respects, the debate has captured that mood and there have been some measured and reflective contributions from across the chamber. Dennis Robertson&#8217;s speech was particularly courageous and, from a different perspective, Margo MacDonald&#8217;s was very thought provoking. Yes, we need to do something, but we should be mighty careful about what we do.</p><p>The Leveson inquiry took place against the background of the democratic tradition: the freedoms and values that we cherish in our open society. Those freedoms are the envy of oppressed peoples around the world. Thomas Jefferson said:</p><p>&#8220;The only security of all is in a free press.&#8221;</p><p>He added that it was necessary to &#8220;keep the waters pure&#8221;. Lord Justice Leveson echoed those sentiments when he said:</p><p>&#8220;a free press is the lifeblood of a mature democracy&#8221;.</p><p>That is not something to be sacrificed or lightly put at risk, although that does not mean that the freedom of the press is unlimited. There are legitimate boundaries within which the press must operate and an effective system of regulation is essential to ensure that those limits are adhered to.</p><p>Today, we have heard many members add their voices to the debate. Although at times they may have been in disagreement with one another, we should remember what we all agree on. First, we as a Parliament have a duty to consider these findings and recommendations&#8212;although I observe that responding does not necessarily mean legislating. Secondly, the status quo is no longer a tenable option.</p><p>Lord Justice Leveson rightly criticised the current regulatory system. The Press Complaints Commission made the press judge, jury and executioner in its own case, which was inherently flawed. In its place, Leveson recommended an independent self-regulatory body to remedy what he sees as a</p><p>&#8220;profound lack of any functional or meaningful independence from the industry&#8221;.</p><p>Under his model, appointments would be independent and representative of the public interest, as would be the setting of standards of conduct.

It is interesting that Lord Justice Leveson&#8212;I do not know whether Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney share this view, but if they would listen, they might learn something about the report&#8212;identified that very tension. He noted:</p><p>&#8220;a balance must be struck between the use of statute to deliver independence ... and the risk that the use of statute might introduce some element of state control of the press which is clearly unacceptable.&#8221;</p><p>My party&#8217;s view is that any form of statutory provision that enacted the &#8220;requirements&#8221;&#8212;that is Leveson&#8217;s language&#8212;that a regulatory body must fulfil would inevitably introduce the risk of political interference in the freedom of the press. That cannot be helped. Such statutes control the press. Governments pass statutes, and there is the rub. To introduce such legislation on to the United Kingdom&#8217;s statute book or the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s statute book would be an unprecedented step.</p><p>I want to end my contribution by returning to what my colleague Ruth Davidson argued in her speech. A two-system solution, as the First Minister has proposed, whereby the rest of the UK goes one way and Scotland goes another is unrealistic and unnecessary, because almost all the largest titles and media groups in Scotland either trade throughout the United Kingdom as a whole, are based in England, or are owned by non-Scottish proprietors. Newspapers are used to dealing with differences in Scots law day in, day out; they are also used to operating under a unified UK regulatory system, albeit that that system was imperfect. Given that context, a Scottish solution will mean having to sign up to two systems. I presume that that also means paying for two systems, and I do not think that there is an appetite for that. Indeed, Leveson even noted that in his report in recognising that there is no reason why a new regulatory system could not easily apply across the various legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.</p><p>I return to Juvenal. His friends advised him to adopt the following plan: &#8220;Bolt her in, constrain her!&#8221; The free press and its crucial role are of such paramount importance that we cannot follow such an approach lightly. Bolting in and constraining through statutory provision that is susceptible to political meddling is only the answer of very last resort. Let us move forward together.

It is part of an international campaign in more than 55 countries, which is the largest effort in the world by men who work to end violence against women. I say well done to Jamie Hepburn for lodging the motion and for bringing the debate to the chamber.</p><p>The statistics are depressing. In Scotland, nearly 60,000 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded by the police in 2011-12, which is a 7 per cent increase on the 2010-11 figures. Since 2002-03, there has been a 67 per cent increase in recorded incidents of domestic abuse, and there are currently 163 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police each day.</p><p>I noted from one of the local papers in my area, the Kirkintilloch Herald, that</p><p>&#8220;more women are killed ... as a result of male violence than car accidents, cancer, malaria and war combined.&#8221;</p><p>That fact drew me up short and shocked me.</p><p>There are also women who do not report crime because they believe that it is a private family matter. We have to encourage them to believe that it is nothing like that at all. They must have the courage to come forward and report such unacceptable behaviour.</p><p>There are women who are frightened that reporting the violence will make it worse. We need to encourage them and let them know that the only thing that will make it worse is not reporting it. When it is reported, it must be tackled.</p><p>It is vital that help is made available for women who are fleeing violence. We should recognise the valuable work of many voluntary groups in that regard. Members have already paid tribute to some of them, and I have recently visited organisations in my own area that do excellent work to support and protect women and children who are fleeing from domestic abuse. My most recent visits were to Renfrewshire Women&#8217;s Aid and Inverclyde Women&#8217;s Aid, who do fantastic work to support women and their families.</p><p>I also pay tribute to the Women&#8217;s Support Project.

A lot of positive work is being done out there.</p><p>We must never forget children, and some members have already alluded to them. Tragically, children can also be victims because they are often present when incidents of abuse occur. On my visit to Inverclyde Women&#8217;s Aid, I was delighted to learn that it is running classes in schools about healthy relationships to try to reverse the trend of domestic abuse and explain to children that things can be done in a different way and there is a different way to live their lives.</p><p>Domestic violence is a stain on Scotland. We must tackle it, encourage women to come forward, and support them when they do. As Dennis Robertson said, we must change this pernicious culture because it still exists.

He was a fisherman on the northern shores of the Sea of Galilee. However, it was not until the end of the first millennium that St Andrew&#8217;s links with Scotland were established, when he was made the patron saint of Scotland after some of his relics were brought by St Rule to St Andrews, where they remain to this day. Other relics can be found in Patras in Greece&#8212;I have viewed them there&#8212;in Amalfi in Italy, in Warsaw in Poland and in St Mary&#8217;s Roman Catholic church in Edinburgh, so he was well travelled in death.</p><p>St Andrew was no less well travelled in life; he preached along the southern borders of today&#8217;s Ukraine along the Black Sea, as well as along the Dnieper and Volga rivers, which is why he became a patron saint of Russia, Romania and the Ukraine. However, the temporal reach of St Andrew does not end there, with his patronages in sainthood extending from Luqa to Esgueira, and even as far as Barbados. The global reach of St Andrew is not limited merely to countries that enjoy him as their patron saint. This year alone, individuals of all nationalities will gather, from Australia and New Zealand to the USA and Canada and from Bonn to Brussels to celebrate the saintly feast day.</p><p>The cabinet secretary asked me about UK celebrations of St Andrew.

Putting it into a timeframe will provide a helpful perspective. The new strategy was the product of budget negotiations between my party and the Scottish Government in 2008. Prior to that there was no strategy; methadone was a management tool. I remember saying then, with reference to the road to recovery:</p><p>&#8220;That road will be challenging and in places very rocky, but at least we are on it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 4 June 2008; c 9282.]</p><p>That remains important.</p><p>Four and a half years on we need to examine the pace of progress in delivering the strategy, as we also constantly need to explore fresh options and initiatives that may support that delivery. The general backdrop of the prevalence of drug abuse in Scotland is still very troubling. For example, we know from official figures that the number of drug users has increased substantially over the past decade. Reference has already been made to drug-related deaths and a depressing statistic in the 2011 figures was the confirmation that, for the first time, the number of methadone-related deaths exceeded heroin-related deaths. However, that might be down to a reduction in heroin users, who are moving on to harm reduction programmes.</p><p>We know that the stubbornly high level of drug finds in prison continues to present a challenge. Recent figures disclose that, last year, there were more than 1,700 finds and, for the nine months up to 30 September this year, 1,322. We also know that in 2011-12 the number of drug offences recorded by the police increased on the preceding year.</p><p>However, as the minister said, progress is being made among younger people and I have to ask where we would be had the strategy never been put in place. It is instructive to remind ourselves of its main components. It was about making a fresh start, preventing drug use, promoting recovery and ensuring that a range of appropriate treatment and rehabilitation services was available locally. Nevertheless, as the figures I have cited illustrate, we still face a major challenge. In that light, we need to investigate the disclosure that there is unused rehab capacity throughout Scotland.

At one end of the spectrum, there is the view that methadone is harmful and expensive and should not be prescribed to anyone; at the other end, there is the view that it is a positive intervention that delivers a crime-free life of stability to the patient and should in no circumstances be interfered with.</p><p>The true position is somewhere in between. I accept that, depending on the individual, methadone might provide a bridge from the chaos of illegal using to a more stable existence. I have to say, though, that I consider sensationalist articles in tabloid newspapers to be unhelpful. That said, given that the road to recovery anticipates a range of options, I would also consider it unfortunate if someone seeking help who did not want to be prescribed methadone was given no alternative. As has been indicated, we know that methadone prescriptions&#8212;and their costs&#8212;have increased significantly. However, information on the number of patients who are on methadone is not available and we do not know how many have come off methadone or have had their prescriptions reduced. It will be quite difficult to make any objective assessment of the range of available options implicit in the strategy if we do not have the basic data.</p><p>However, I expect prescribers and their patients to be engaged in a judgment as to whether a prescription could be reduced or ultimately ceased. Methadone patients who are constituents have told me that they have found it difficult to engage in such discussions; indeed, some have been discouraged from even embarking on them. That such discussions can be usefully pursued is evident from the methadone cessation pilot in North, East and South Ayrshire, which comes under the alcohol and drug partnerships and is aimed at supporting long-term methadone users. The only conclusion that anyone who reads the report of the pilot can reach is that it has had a whole host of positive outcomes from cessation and reduction of scripts to the people in question moving into education or even employment.</p><p>Given the levels that methadone prescriptions have reached, given that we know how many patients wish to discuss their programme and given the success of the cessation pilot, I feel that the review could examine how more information could be provided to patients&#8212;hence the second strand of my amendment. I also want the review to be open-minded about other replacement therapies. Might, for example, neuroelectric therapy, which is available in Scotland, play a role? How well does it work?

The victim expects that, the accused is entitled to it, and the public interest requires it.</p><p>Those fundamental tenets must be kept to the fore in any debate about our criminal justice system. Above all else, as other members have indicated, the criminal courts do not exist to provide public entertainment or media gratification. That is the umbrella that I want to hoist up before I consider in more detail the important issues that have emerged during the debate.</p><p>It is not surprising that the main elements in the debate have focused on the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the possibility of extending the televising of criminal court proceedings. Let me therefore deal with the 1981 act first.</p><p>The 1981 act was passed in a communications environment that was dramatically different from what we know today, but the underlying principle of the act remains important and relevant: to ensure that the course of justice and court proceedings could not be seriously impeded or prejudiced by the publication of material and that a person who created a substantial risk of such impediment or prejudice would become strictly liable for such publication of material, thereby committing a statutory contempt. There is also a common law contempt, which requires the proof of mens rea&#8212;an intention to prejudice the court proceedings.</p><p>The whole reason for the underlying principle of avoiding impediment and prejudice to justice is to ensure that the guilty are convicted and that, in so far as possible, the conviction is safe from challenge. Although the world of communication has been transformed by the advent of the internet and social media, which has brought a new raft of challenges to preserving justice in criminal court proceedings, we must not lose sight of the fundamental principle of protecting and preserving justice. That is paramount when we consider any reform.</p><p>There are two prerequisites that the Justice Committee might consider before any amendment to the 1981 act is contemplated. First, research should be carried out to gather empirical evidence about the impact of the internet and social media on juries. As my colleague John Lamont said, accessing information online is not the same as being influenced by that information, but we need data on the issue.</p><p>Secondly, there is a need for official guidance now on the use of live communication devices from the court. The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales last year issued guidance on the issue. Can there be some indication as to whether the Lord President in Scotland has reflected on that guidance? The convener of the Justice Committee may wish to clarify that point direct with the Lord President.</p><p>I will now reflect on televising court proceedings. As others have indicated, a limited facility already exists, but it is interesting that it is restricted to hearings that do not involve witness testimony. Those who support extending the scope of televised proceedings believe that it would strengthen the principle of justice being seen to be done and better serve the public interest.</p><p>I am very clearly of the opinion that exactly the same criteria as apply to determining contempt of court and what is acceptable communication from the court apply to televising court proceedings: those who break the law will be dealt with fairly and without prejudice; justice will be done; the guilty will be convicted; and, in so far as possible, the conviction will be safe from challenge.</p><p>As I said, the courts exist to deliver justice, not to provide entertainment. The current&#8212;and in my opinion correct&#8212;emphasis on fairness, impartiality and transparency does not derive from some abstract tenet of benevolent philosophy to make everyone feel good; it exists to minimise the possibility of prejudice, oppression and collusion resulting in unsafe convictions and miscarriages of justice. That is because the public interest and the victim expect that convictions should be sound and safe against challenge.</p><p>It is completely flawed to confuse the principle of justice being seen to be done with the notion that every man and his dog requires to view the minutiae of court proceedings. Mary Fee and Colin Keir alluded to that aspect. The reality is that the average man and his dog could not give a toss about the detail of court proceedings and court procedure. He may be interested in the identity of the accused, the charge against the accused and a summary of the evidence&#8212;all of which he can learn from news reporting. Indeed, that will also be sufficient to alert a member of the public that he or she may have evidence relevant to the case. None of that requires detailed viewing of the proceedings.</p><p>In relation to the particular issue of the public interest, I think that it is very clearly defined. It is a confidence that the guilty will be convicted and that the conviction will not be vulnerable to challenge because of prejudice to the accused or a lack of impartiality, or because nervous and frightened witnesses were unable to give clear evidence. Graeme Pearson referred to that aspect.</p><p>I can see the public interest being disserved by any significant expansion of televised court proceedings, especially if that intrudes on occasions when witnesses are giving testimony. Media coverage will distort the court environment. The accused, who may be innocent, could look shifty and edgy; witnesses who are already nervous could become agitated and confused; and bold, but lying witnesses could look confident and convincing. That has the makings of a parallel trial.</p><p>The one aspect of public interest that I do not agree with is the view that, because the taxpayer pays for the judges, the courts and the legally aided solicitor, the public is entitled to know what is going on. By that analogy, because surgeons, nurses and theatre porters are paid for by the public, we would have viewing galleries in the operating theatres of our hospitals.</p><p>There are perplexing issues in relation to the media&#8217;s role, and it is healthy and encouraging that the Justice Committee is looking at those issues.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are few more important subjects than our criminal justice system, because at the heart of any society is the public&#8217;s confidence that those who break the law will be dealt with fairly and without prejudice and that justice will be done.

To say that I would mangle that beautiful language would be an understatement.</p><p>I am pleased to take the opportunity again to pledge the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; support for the Gaelic language. As members of different parties have pointed out in the Parliament on a number of occasions, it was the Conservatives who ignited the Gaelic revival, in the early 1980s, by delivering &#163;16 million of funding support for that purpose. We continue to work in co-operation with our partners to ensure that that impetus is sustained.</p><p>As we heard, the Gaelic language forms an intrinsic part of Scotland&#8217;s history and culture. The temporal reach of Gaelic is not limited to the past; the language connects us to our future and informs the evolution of our society, our identities and our characters.</p><p>Gaelic was a thriving language with more than 230,000 speakers in the late 1800s, but the number of speakers dwindled to just under 60,000 at the most recent count. Although the Gaelic decline has been less pronounced over recent decades, the language&#8217;s designation by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2009 as a world-endangered language adds a new level of importance and urgency to the Gaelic debate.</p><p>When it comes to language, there is very much one guiding principle: use it or lose it, as the minister himself said. The national Gaelic plan underlines that simple truth and correctly identifies the key role that education plays in the survival of Gaelic. In that connection, I wonder whether it is worth exploring nursery education. I vividly remember visiting a nursery in Paisley some years ago where children were learning elementary French from an early age. The children had the most remarkable, sponge-like capacity to absorb words and phrases. Knowledge acquired at that age sticks with us&#8212;just as nursery rhymes do. In many communities, there are older Gaelic speakers who might be interested in contributing their knowledge at that level. Perhaps the minister will reflect on that.</p><p>It is encouraging that B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig has said that it will play a crucial part in Gaelic teacher recruitment as well as improving</p><p>&#8220;workforce planning ... and education of Gaelic teachers.&#8221;</p><p>However, that is not in itself a fully formed strategy; it is merely a statement of how things should be and how we would like them to be. Time and again in the national Gaelic plan, essential detail about the realisation of the stated outcomes is missing.</p><p>Therefore, I ask the minister to elaborate on what the board&#8217;s new role in teacher recruitment, planning and education will entail and what will be done to achieve the board&#8217;s ambitious outcomes of doubling the annual Gaelic-medium education intake to 800 by 2017, increasing the number of pupils who are engaged in Gaelic learning education and expanding the availability of Gaelic-medium subjects in secondary schools.</p><p>Education in itself is by no means sufficient to save Gaelic from further decline, as the minister acknowledged. UNESCO has noted that</p><p>&#8220;the most crucial factor is the attitude of the speaker community towards its own language.&#8221;</p><p>Gaelic speakers must therefore be encouraged to optimise the use of Gaelic and to foster its growth outwith as well as within their communities. With there being more than 90,000 people in Scotland with an ability in the Gaelic language but only 60,000 who actually speak it, the Government and the board still have plenty of work to do in harnessing the unrealised potential of that silent 30,000.</p><p>Identifying strategic priorities and listing outcomes that are to be achieved show ambition and are part of an important strategy, but we need creative collaboration between communities and Government, and inventive solutions for how best to engage those who have an interest in learning the language. Once again, the detail on how that will be achieved is made conspicuous by its absence from the plan.</p><p>It is also imperative that the ambitious language of the proposed strategy and the outcomes that are identified in the plan translate into tangible achievements. That is particularly true given the increased cash funding for Gaelic that was announced in last month&#8217;s budget. That is welcome, but in times of limited budgets and scarce resources the Scottish Government as well as the board must be able to show that money is being spent wisely and effectively by delivering material outcomes. That might mean focusing spending on areas and in communities in which increased teaching provision matches identified interest from learners, so that the combination of the two can reasonably be expected to contribute to an expanded awareness and use of the language.</p><p>It is for that reason that the Scottish Conservatives have lodged an amendment that the Government should devise a mechanism to measure whether the national Gaelic plan is delivering the specific outcomes that it identifies and that we all want to see. Although the board will monitor the implementation of development activities, the importance of the issue&#8212;not to mention the considerable sums of public money that are at stake&#8212;requires the Government to undertake an assessment of how the board and the plan are working. Our amendment is intended to be constructive, and I hope that it is seen as such.</p><p>I end by underlining the fact that we in Scotland do not exist in isolation, and the problems that the Gaelic language faces are by no means exclusive to Scotland. UNESCO&#8217;s endangered languages programme supports communities and Governments in promoting endangered languages by providing services such as policy advice, technical expertise and training, and a platform for the exchange and transfer of innovative ideas and good practice between countries that are threatened with the loss of a language. We should take full advantage of that expertise, and I invite the minister to comment on the role that he envisages for international collaboration in the implementation of the national Gaelic plan&#8212;the plan is silent on that.</p><p>Although the national Gaelic language plan should not be seen as a panacea for all the Gaelic language&#8217;s woes, and although it is imperative that words on the page are translated into tangible outcomes, the plan is to be welcomed for charting a course in the right direction to ensure the continued survival of Gaelic. That is what we all want.</p><p>I support the motion and I move amendment S4M-04313.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;and that the Scottish Government should devise a mechanism to measure whether or not the strategy is delivering improvement against the outcomes and priorities that it identifies in the plan.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have the opportunity to add to this important debate on the future of the Gaelic language in Scotland.

I urge the cabinet secretary to listen very carefully to those concerns.</p><p>It is also the case that if a jury does convict, an equally alarming consequence of the abolition of corroboration is the prospect of miscarriages of justice, particularly if&#8212;as some members have indicated&#8212;related aspects of Scots criminal law are not also considered.</p><p>The SNP has undergone something of a change of heart on the issue. The Cabinet Secretary now describes corroboration as a rule</p><p>&#8220;that stems from another age&#8221;</p><p>and appears to be hell-bent on abolishing it, regardless of what the experts say. However, I observe that he is the same individual who thought it appropriate to claim that two of Scotland&#8217;s most senior and universally respected judges in the Supreme Court had gained their knowledge of Scots law through visits to the Edinburgh festival.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has previously castigated the Cadder decision as being one that</p><p>&#8220;overturns decades of criminal procedure in Scotland, a proud, distinctive, justice system, developed over centuries, and predicated on fairness with many rigorous protections for accused persons.&#8221;</p><p>Those are bold and stalwart words that I entirely support. The irony is mocking: by &#8220;rigorous protections&#8221; the cabinet secretary was, of course, referring primarily to&#8212;yes&#8212;corroboration; a principle of evidence that he robustly supported when lambasting the evil Supreme Court.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates and Justice Scotland have all warned against implementing the corroboration recommendation in isolation. This is not about the establishment resisting change&#8212;this is about effecting change that makes things better, not worse.</p><p>We are talking about getting a major change to a criminal legal system right and not reforming it in a higgledy-piggledy and illogical fashion. Removing the requirement for corroboration without seriously considering introducing other safeguards against miscarriages of justice would not only be dangerous; it would also be a missed opportunity to consider related matters. Some of those matters have been referred to this afternoon; for example, majority verdicts, and the burden of proof in criminal cases being beyond reasonable doubt. Should Scottish judges be able to warn juries about the reliability of a single piece of evidence, as is the case in England and Wales? What about the not proven verdict?</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation has given only passing consideration to those questions. It is, perhaps, unsurprising that Lord Carloway did not recommend a full-scale review of Scottish criminal procedure. That was not his remit, as Christine Grahame rightly observed, but the proposal to abolish corroboration in isolation is causing widespread unease, which is clearly shared by members of Parliament across the political parties. In December last year, the convener of the Justice Committee, Christine Grahame, listed no fewer than seven concerns that she had heard against removal of the requirement for corroboration without wider reform.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell has called for a debate on majority verdicts, and Colin Keir has said that now is the appropriate time to re-examine the three verdicts. Almost a year on, it is worrying that the Scottish Government has failed to listen to such legitimate and reasonable concerns, many of which have been echoed by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s own colleagues during this afternoon&#8217;s debate.</p><p>Although I appreciate that the cabinet secretary wants to press ahead with the useful reforms that Lord Carloway has proposed, I urge him to exclude corroboration from the forthcoming criminal justice bill. The issue needs to be part of a wider debate and it needs to be informed by the very sort of evidence that Mary Fee, to her credit, confessed she did not have, and which Christine Grahame quite rightly indicated is an essential part of informing the debate.</p><p>For that reason, although I have found today&#8217;s debate to be genuinely interesting, I support my colleague, Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s, amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reforming Scots Criminal Law and Practice (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In support of the point that I have just advanced, I remember the review of sexual offences that was published in 2006.

I will broaden out the debate to explore and comment on that.</p><p>Polish immigration has enriched Scotland&#8217;s culture and has strengthened our economy over many years. If I may be permitted a little self-indulgence, I note that one of my favourite composers is Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chopin. He is widely regarded as perhaps the greatest Polish composer and is among the greatest composers of all time for the piano. An important influence on Chopin&#8217;s life was his Scottish pupil, Jane Stirling. With her encouragement, he visited Scotland in 1848, staying at Calder house, near Edinburgh, and at Johnstone castle in Renfrewshire, my home area. While he was in Edinburgh, he spent time residing at the home of a Polish doctor, Adam Lyszczynski, by whom he was being treated. By contrast, Renfrewshire must have seemed slightly forbidding, as Chopin wrote to his friend, Wojciech Grzymala:</p><p>&#8220;The weather has changed and it is dreadful outside.&#8221;</p><p>Some things do not change very much.</p><p>The connections between Poland and Scotland are of long standing. In 2012, although not a lot has changed about the Renfrewshire weather, the social climate for our Renfrewshire Polish community is very positive. In February, the Renfrewshire Polish Association was established to bring support to the Polish community living in Renfrewshire and to promote Polish culture in the area. The association&#8217;s activities are directed at various age groups, and it aims to provide access to the widest possible part of the Polish community but with a focus on Renfrewshire. Its objectives are to organise events for children, encouraging their development and integration with peers and teaching them the Polish language; to organise events related to Polish traditions and culture; to hold events that allow the Polish minority to integrate with the Scottish community and other national minorities in Renfrewshire; to encourage self-development and improve self-confidence within the Polish community; and, importantly, to assist with the acquisition and improvement of work-related qualifications and language skills.</p><p>Given that Polish immigrants face many challenges, the Renfrewshire Polish Association, with its committed volunteers, is doing excellent work both to support my local Polish community and to enhance Renfrewshire. I thank the association for that invaluable work. Given the abundance of musical talent in Renfrewshire, perhaps the Renfrewshire Polish Association would like to consider a Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chopin celebratory event in memory of his visit to Johnstone 164 years ago. Without doubt, any problems of weather would be more than eclipsed by the beauty of his music.</p><p>I thank all our Polish residents, wherever they are in Scotland, for enriching our Scottish communities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672874", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Great Polish Map of Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Christine Grahame for securing the debate.

I was so impressed that I thought that it should be abolished. Indeed, I shared my thoughts with the then controller of BBC Scotland, John McCormick, who&#8212;quite rightly identifying that he was conversing with someone whose grasp of screen culture was slender&#8212;informed me that a soap needed time to bed down and that a second series had been commissioned. After I had recovered from the shock of that unwelcome announcement, I thought, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s so ghastly it will probably self-destruct, and we shall all be rid of the whole unhappy affair.&#8221;</p><p>I could not have been more wrong, because I decided to watch the new series and I was hooked, as were a lot of other people. Now, the Tuesday programme has an average audience of 420,000, and, when the Sunday repeat and the BBC iPlayer catch-up are factored in, that figure rises to around 500,000 a week, which is no small achievement. That all adds up to a significant drama success for BBC Scotland, a positive contribution to Scottish culture, an impressive showcase for our Scottish acting talent and an important economic boost for Dumbarton and the wider Scottish economy. That is why I think that it is important that the Scottish Parliament should acknowledge and celebrate the 10th anniversary of this Scottish success.</p><p>I have not constructed this speech along the lines of a &#8220;River City&#8221; script&#8212;that might have held members&#8217; attention, but they would have needed a lie-down afterwards. However, it is worth looking at some of the facts behind the entertainment&#8212;I thank the BBC for the provision of this helpful information.</p><p>Including dailies and casual labour, the drama, which is filmed in Dumbarton, employs up to 200 people over the course of a year, with a core of 90 crew when in production, 25 main cast, 60 guest cast, four child actors and 150 extras, 90 per cent of whom are local. It films all year round, but the programme is prepared during only two 14-week periods, which enables the crew to work on other productions, encourages a healthy turnover of production talent and enables productions such as &#8220;Garrow&#8217;s Law&#8221;, &#8220;The Eagle&#8221; and &#8220;The Deep&#8221; to utilise the facilities at Dumbarton.</p><p>That leads me to the economic impact. The programme uses local supporting artists, equipment is hired locally and the crew shop locally. According to a draft report on the economic impact of BBC Scotland&#8217;s Dumbarton studios that was prepared by Strathleven Regeneration CIC, the cumulative regional gross value added to Dumbarton is around &#163;140&#160;million, and the cumulative national gross value added is around &#163;45&#160;million. As Shellsuit Bob might say to Deke, &#8220;Nae small money that, pal.&#8221;</p><p>Let us move on to deal with the entertainment component of this much-loved soap. &#8220;River City&#8221; has gripped the public imagination, pulled the heartstrings and brought tears of sorrow and laughter to the watching eyes of Scotland as we have shared the highs and lows of life in Shieldinch. With 500,000 fans viewing each week, BBC Scotland has found a winning formula that encapsulates urban life and the distinctive grain of Scottish character. However, with hard-hitting and gritty storylines, it has also created a social commentary that many people can identify with. To me, that is a tremendously important part of its success, reassuring people that they are not alone in the challenges that confront communities and individuals and providing useful signposts for help&#8212;all of that, of course, brought alive with vibrancy and pace by gifted actors, compelling scripts and the highest professional standards of direction and production.</p><p>The BBC is to run an online vote to let the drama&#8217;s fans choose their favourite moment from the last 10 years of the programme. There will be no shortage of suggestions. Challenging issues have been taken head on, including drugs abuse, alcoholism, prison, gangland mafia, marriage breakdown, stillbirth, unemployment, homophobia, Alzheimer&#8217;s and the embezzling lawyer. Those are just some of the issues, but all the programmes have been skilfully scripted, sensitively acted and superbly directed.</p><p>Another important dimension is that &#8220;River City&#8221; has evolved into a significant social medium. As members of the Scottish Parliament, we know the raw side of human nature&#8212;the frightened, the wronged, the lost, the abandoned and the lonely. Sometimes, one of the most difficult decisions for an individual to make is to speak to someone&#8212;to anyone. &#8220;River City&#8221;, by representing those difficult issues in a realistic way and then offering, either within the script or at the end of the programme, signposts towards help, is doing something invaluable. That is not an argument for people to live their lives through a soap; it is recognising that, for some people, vital companionship and communication can be provided by a soap, and there is a world of difference between the two.</p><p>Of course, there are lighter moments. Who would want Molly as a mother-in-law or Scarlett as a daughter-in-law? We have to admire that fierce defence of family against all comers, because it strikes a chord with us. Kelly-Marie, Madonna, Shellsuit Bob and Big Bob really have a formidable duo of matriarchs looking out for them. Of course, I have my own views about what Shieldinch might want to embrace in the future. Surely, it cannot remain immune from the constitutional debate. Eileen must have an opinion, because she does on everything else. Will Lenny be part of the yes campaign and, if so, does it want him? Is Liz a confirmed unionist? What does Scarlett think of the curriculum for excellence? I fear for Mike Russell if she ever expresses a view. Who knows what will unfold in the Oyster Cafe and the Tall Ship in the coming months and years?</p><p>I thank and congratulate the BBC and everyone who is involved in &#8220;River City&#8221;, who make the programme the gem that it is, and I send very best wishes to Shieldinch for the future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671634", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;River City&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great pleasure to open this debate, which is the first Thursday lunch-time members&#8217; business debate in our new parliamentary timetable&#8212;I am sure that the residents of Shieldinch will be captivated by such change.

Who knows what might unfold during the debate?</p><p>When I was a small child, my parents regularly pointed out to me the circle in the Paisley street where the charred remains of the last perpetrators of witchcraft were buried, and that became part of my local folklore. As both George Adam and Graeme Dey have said, the unfortunate individuals had allegedly bewitched an 11-year-old Bargarran girl, Christian Shaw. Bargarran lies between my home village of Bishopton and the town of Erskine. She was supposedly a smart and lively girl. Well, we are all like that in my area&#8212;the people in the public gallery this evening are testament to that. She alleged that she had been cursed by the servant Catherine Campbell, as a consequence of which poor Christian took fits, saw strange visions, levitated and claimed that others were torturing her body. We have not seen any of that in this Parliament&#8212;at least, not yet.</p><p>As George Adam and Graeme Dey said, an unhappy fate awaited the perpetrators. One miscreant&#8212;James Reid&#8212;hung himself in his cell and the remaining six were strangled at the stake on the Gallow Green in Paisley, after which their bodies were burned on a blazing bonfire. Afterwards, their charred remains were buried at Maxwellton cross at a site that is marked by a horseshoe and the circle of cobbled stones to which I have referred.</p><p>All that is gruesome, ghastly and ghoulish but is, in its own way, a rich cultural legacy. What became of young Christian? She went on to become a successful businesswoman and manufacturer of thread. She and her mother became the founders of Renfrewshire&#8217;s textiles industry.</p><p>On Saturday 9 June 2012, Paisley town centre returned to 1697 and every citizen of Renfrewshire was invited to dress in historical attire, come into town and join in the re-enactment of the event. The Renfrewshire witch hunt 1697, which was spearheaded by the Paisley Development Trust, involved schools, businesses and community groups. Our visitors in the gallery this evening are an impressive representation of the event.</p><p>I believe that such community-based events are vital to community spirit. They encourage pride in the local area and nurture relationships across all sectors of society. Whether it is the witch hunt in Paisley, the annual papingo shoot at Kilwinning Abbey, Bishopton gala day or a street party for the diamond jubilee, I congratulate everyone who is involved in such community activity and who demonstrates such community spirit. Far too often, we are told that community spirit is dead, but that is certainly not what I see. There are countless examples of it to be found in the west of Scotland, from the events in Paisley to community fairs, gala days, school f&#234;tes and other charitable events.</p><p>There are also the volunteers who clean up beaches, villages or urban spaces or who just give of their time to help others. I have recently visited Age Concern in Largs, Engage Renfrewshire, the Renton Community Development Trust, Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire and the Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Trust treatment centre&#8212;all of which are made possible by volunteers.</p><p>I congratulate and support the Paisley Development Trust and everyone who is involved with the Renfrewshire witch hunt 1697 event, including our visitors to the gallery this evening. I also congratulate all the people in our local communities who go that extra mile to support their local heritage and identity, to sustain their local culture and to foster community spirit so that their communities can flourish.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671224", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renfrewshire Witch Hunt 1697"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank George Adam for securing the debate.

After all, we have a national health service and a national water and sewerage service, so why not a national police service?</p><p>I have always felt that a country&#8217;s law enforcement body occupies a unique position. Given the nature of what it does and the power that it has, there should be a respectful and respectable distance from the political process and a public confidence in how it discharges its role.</p><p>Interestingly, since devolution began, there has been discussion about how complaints against the police are handled and how we balance the sensitive and challenging job that we ask the police to do with the legitimate interest of the public, if police conduct gives rise to question, in having that concern addressed.</p><p>The present structure of several forces with a complaints investigatory function and a police complaints commissioner has provided that distance from the political process and served the public interest. However, the bill creates a very different beast. Graeme Pearson correctly described it as a national police force, and that is what it is.</p><p>I do not instinctively shy away from that beast. Indeed, as my colleague John Lamont said, my party supported the principle of a single police force, subject to two important conditions. Those were that the savings from such a proposal, having been costed in detail, would demonstrably preserve the presence of front-line officers, which my party were instrumental in securing, and that the distance from the political process and the public confidence in the ability to challenge any abuse of power would be protected. That second condition is of paramount importance when there is a single law enforcement body.</p><p>At stage 1, the bill as drafted did not allay the concerns of my party, and we chose to abstain at that point. It is disappointing that the strenuous attempts by Graeme Pearson and my colleague John Lamont to address some of those fundamental concerns and to improve the bill have been rejected.</p><p>The general tenor of the debate suggests that some of those fundamental issues of public interest are not fully recognised. Sarah Boyack made an important point in that regard. Speaking to a very senior police officer who had genuine concerns about the proximity to Government, I found that there was a legitimate anxiety about how the bill would work in practice.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham suggested that we are being cynical about the ability of politicians to behave with integrity and probity. My view is that, when we are dealing with something so sensitive, we should create a system that anticipates that every barrel can have a bad apple and that identifies and deals with that possibility, rather than waiting for some disaster to happen and saying, &#8220;Goodness&#8212;why did we not do something better when we framed the legislation?&#8221;</p><p>I say with reluctance that, under the bill, the principle of a single police force&#8212;which my party supports&#8212;does not translate into practices that are safe or healthy. Therefore, with regret, I say to the chamber that my party feels unable to support the bill and we will abstain in the vote at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670454", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The bill is a very important piece of legislation.

However, I harbour a hope that, across the chamber, we can perhaps coalesce around some areas that might point the way towards a better direction of travel.</p><p>My starting point is a reflection on our Scottish colleges of further education. Historically, they have been unsung and underrated. Of course, the reality was different. Colleges were the accessible, physical presence of further education, providing essential skills in a wide range of trades and occupations and offering school leavers the opportunity to develop and expand on existing educational attainment. Indeed, since being given autonomy of governance, Scotland&#8217;s colleges have made an outstanding contribution to education and are to be warmly congratulated on doing so.</p><p>In Scotland, we have many colleges straddling the country and demonstrating that vital component of local access, and many local economies are crying out for the trades and occupations for which colleges can educate people. It is important that colleges can also, as we know, be the entry point for transition to higher education that can, again, offer affordable local access. I am in no doubt about the vital and flexible educational role that our colleges play or about the importance of their local accessibility. Even with distance learning, that physical presence matters.</p><p>That is my starting point, and I hope that there is universal acceptance of those virtues. I think that it is generally understood that our young people have a particular reliance on college education. Indeed, Patricia Ferguson, Drew Smith and&#8212;to be fair&#8212;Bob Doris commented on that.</p><p>The Scottish Government seems to accept the propositions that I have outlined. Certainly it was, in the most recent election campaign, supportive of the National Union of Students&#8217; reclaim your voice campaign, which among other things was committed to protecting graduate numbers and college places. However, the pledge on student places is one thing, but I fear that the reality is different and troubling. According to Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, the reduction in the further education budget will lead to an estimated 20,000 student places being lost. In 2011 alone, approximately 1,000 people were made redundant in the college sector. So, unless they had been twiddling their thumbs, which I am sure they were not, that must have had an impact on college places.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670516", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: North Glasgow College (Funding Cuts)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Patricia Ferguson for bringing this debate to the chamber.

First, there is an issue and everyone can see that. Secondly, there is a valuable opportunity afforded by the debate to identify and highlight the areas and the aspects of the issue that we as a committee need to explore. Thirdly, our committee and the parliament have the opportunity to inform thinking and practices not only in Scotland, but in the rest of the UK and beyond.</p><p>My starting point is that the economy and society benefit when women are at work.

That certainly is the view of Save the Children, which provided a helpful briefing for the debate. The reasons for that situation are multiple and some are more obvious than others. I certainly like to think that if our committee inquiry can lay bare those reasons and investigate sensible solutions to address them, we shall achieve two very important objectives: we shall accelerate the pace of women playing their full and proper role in the workplace and we shall strike at that structural employment vulnerability that is so damaging.</p><p>As has been indicated in the debate, some of the reasons are specific and obvious: lack of affordable childcare has already been identified as a major issue. However, that deficiency does not explain why some women fail to acquire skills to enter the workplace or, having acquired skills, seem to hit obstacles in career progression, or fail to be recognised as meriting consideration for public appointments, to which issue Mary Fee alluded; nor does it explain occupational segregation.</p><p>On the matter of skills, we like to think that with a combination of education, training opportunities and modern apprenticeships we do a lot to prepare young men and women for the workplace&#8212;and we do&#8212;but let me share an experience. Last week, I visited a successful manufacturing company in an area of significant unemployment. Much of the work requires full-time, skilled sewing machine operators. The company has vacancies, but it cannot fill them. Young people with those skills are not coming forward. I am taking the matter up with the local council to see what has happened to the teaching of such basic skills at school level, but I find that kind of mismatch in this day and age alarming.</p><p>The issue of the obstacles confronting women with skills was partially touched on in last week&#8217;s debate, as Mary Fee indicated, when the bizarre sparseness of women on many of our public sector boards of governance was highlighted. We all agree that the paucity of female presence has absolutely nothing to do with the unavailability of female talent, so there must be a question over attitudes and appointment procedures. In fairness, I have detected a willingness by the Scottish Government to take that on board.</p><p>The private sector, however, does not have too much to shout about either in that regard. The most recent labour force survey figures show that in skilled trades occupations 93 per cent of employees are men and 7 per cent are women; and in the realm of process, plant and machine operatives, 87.7 per cent are men and 12.3 per cent are women. The survey also shows that of 212,000 managers, directors and senior officials, only 36 per cent are women.</p><p>I believe that the whole scenario has to be probed. The minister was wise to say that no one has a monopoly of knowledge, wisdom or solutions on the issue. However, something is getting in the way of women getting on. Is it prejudice? Is it inadvertence? Is it attitude? Is it historic legacy? Is it lack of skills or lack of confidence? Is it lack of help with family responsibilities? In some cases, is it down to the individual choice of the woman? We need to find out. I hope that this debate will throw more light on what we need to explore, examine and challenge.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women and Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted, as a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee, to take part in the debate, and I am very pleased that time has been found for it in the parliamentary schedule.

As many other members have done, I welcome the minister&#8217;s confirmation that there will be a summit in September. Claudia Beamish raised the specific issues that confront refugee women.</p><p>It is easy to feel quite gloomy about the issue sometimes, but I think that all of us, having listened to the debate and sensed the degree of purpose to do something about it, now feel a sense of optimism. Margaret McDougall articulated that feeling very well when she spoke about having positive aspirations, although she tempered those remarks with her comment about the stigma that is attached to some part-time jobs.</p><p>Some interesting things are already happening. I was struck by the reference to the relevance of quality part-time jobs and flexible working. The evidence that the committee received on 21 February was supported by written submissions, including one from a member of the public who outlined her own experience of part-time working. She was clear about the lack of quality part-time work and&#8212;interestingly&#8212;about the difficulty of making the transition from full-time to part-time work. She also noted the challenge of having limited opportunities for training and promotion. A number of members have spoken about the pay gap, but there is also a gap&#8212;which is different, but nonetheless important&#8212;between flexible working policy and its implementation.</p><p>We are clear about the challenges in front of us, but we are also clear that we can approach the task as a committee with&#8212;as I just said&#8212;a tremendous sense of purpose. Our approach will be greatly assisted by the speeches from members in today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>The committee will want to look at examples of good practice, because there are such examples out there. Mary Fee mentioned her experience in the retail industry. I was made aware of a charity in Edinburgh called Women Onto Work, which supports women who are trying to get back into the workplace. I was very struck by what it does: it gets self-referrals from individual women who are seeking help, and it does so without using any marketing or getting any referrals from service partners. It has supported clients into employment, further education and even self-employment.</p><p>One of the most successful dynamics for change involves using the experience and example of successful women. I hope that the committee can explore that area and identify women who could make a positive contribution to our deliberations. With no disrespect to the Presiding Officer, I regard every woman in the chamber as a successful woman. We have counterparts throughout Scotland in every area of life: we need to take the success of those successful women and thread that into the warp and woof of the web of the Scottish workplace.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women and Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been short, but extremely useful.

If we can unite in that purpose, we will do a great deal to address the concerns that Jenny Marra, absolutely rightly, is highlighting.</p><p>Women are resilient, capable, adept and determined. They are excelling in educational attainment and they are making headway&#8212;particularly in careers that were once the preserve of men. That is certainly happening in the House of Commons&#8212;perhaps not at the pace that we would like, but there is a direction of travel. Indeed, at the Scottish Parliament, 40 per cent of my party&#8217;s MSPs are women. That compares well with the other parties.</p><p>However, there are still significant issues and Jenny Marra indicated quite rightly where they lie. In particular, she highlighted the position of public boards in Scotland. I looked at the comparable situation for company boards. I noticed that in 2010, women made up only 12.5 per cent of the members of corporate boards of the FTSE 100 companies. That was up from 9.4 per cent in 2004. However, the figure for all FTSE-listed companies was only 9.6 per cent in 2010. That is why I say that there is an issue. It is not just peculiar to the corporate world. It is&#8212;as Jenny Marra indicated&#8212;also to be found in the public sector. I am interested in exploring the reasons behind that. Is there a ceiling that women cannot break through, or is it down to other factors, such as the lifestyle or career choices that women make?</p><p>In 2010, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills report recommended that the chairmen of FTSE 350 companies should set out the percentage of women that they aim to have on their boards in 2013 and 2015. That is a way of getting the issue on the radar screen, which is where I want it to be. That approach is the best way to get this issue looked at sensibly and effectively. I say to Jenny Marra that the report went further&#8212;it also recommended that FTSE 100 boards should aim for a minimum of 25 per cent female representation by 2015. However, it is interesting that the report did not recommend the introduction of legal quotas and apparently only 11 per cent of the responses received recommended the introduction of quotas.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women&#8217;s Representation (Public Sector Boards)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall try not to be provocative or patronising and I shall do my level best to be passionate.

In my experience, where women emerge in fora that have been traditionally male-dominated&#8212;whether a university court, a board of directors, a body of trustees, or even leading a political party, all of which I have done&#8212;they bring their own unique characteristics to bear.</p><p>I say to Jenny Marra that in my experience in dealing with David Cameron, I could not have found a more enthusiastic advocate for promoting the cause of women in politics.

Although it has made progress, that success&#8212;and I accept that it has been a success to some extent&#8212;has not altered the fundamentals of how women progress through organisations. Non-executive director appointments account for most of the increase in representation. Quotas have not tackled the issue of women coming through their own organisation&#8217;s pipeline, because apparently in Norway women still make up only 2 per cent of chief executive officers and 10 per cent of executive committee members.

To anyone who is in any doubt that there is an issue, I say that I think that the matter is self-evident. Jenny Marra, John Park, Alison McInnes, Christine Grahame and other members spoke eloquently about that.</p><p>Jenny Marra was absolutely right to focus her attention on public bodies in Scotland. I, too, looked at that area. I remind members that Quality Meat Scotland seems to have a female-free board&#8212;it has a 12-person board with not a woman on it. Who, may I ask, is likely to cook most of the meat? The Lands Tribunal for Scotland has four blokes on its board. The Water Industry Commission for Scotland has a Gordon, a David and a Charles. Jenny Marra mentioned the Scottish Police Services Authority&#8212;there is only one woman on its seven-member board.</p><p>Some of the other quangos that are low on female representation with one female board member are the Crofters Commission, VisitScotland, David MacBrayne Ltd, the Scottish Law Commission, the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland, Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, Children&#8217;s Hearings Scotland&#8212;that is particularly worrying&#8212;and the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee.</p><p>The tale does not get much better. By any assessment, there are other public bodies that are, in my opinion, in a similarly deficient state of composition&#8212;in fact, one might be tempted to say decomposition. Frankly, that is a gloomy catalogue of female exclusion.</p><p>It would be tempting, in looking at the issue, to call for a cure by quota. However, I have to say to Jenny Marra that I am not convinced by that approach. There are legitimate concerns, which Christine Grahame and Graeme Dey eloquently alluded to. Although it is tempting to call for a cure by quota, getting more women is not synonymous with getting better talent. Getting more women on to a board may look good in numerical terms, but the test must always be how best representation on that board can serve the public interest.</p><p>There is no doubt that there is an issue, and there is no disagreement whatsoever that that issue must be addressed. When it comes to the boards of public bodies in Scotland, it seems to me that there is a ray of sunshine: an appointments structure over which we have collective control and input. The minister&#8217;s contribution in that regard was extremely helpful.</p><p>The most important feature of the debate is that Jenny Marra has brought the issue into the public domain.

For too long those people have been the silent and voiceless presence in our criminal justice system. They should be at the heart of it. Our criminal justice system needs to prioritise those who have been wronged and those who are prepared to stand up in court for those who have been wronged. Their voices must be heard.</p><p>I therefore welcome the publication of the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation. Although it is overdue, it includes a number of important measures. The six objectives of the victims and witnesses policy are: that they should know what is going on in cases that affect them; that they should know what to expect; that they should feel confident that their personal safety will be protected; that they should be able to contribute effectively to cases; that they should have access to appropriate support; and that offenders should pay for injury, loss or distress caused.

Taken as a whole, they appear to address the legitimate interests of victims of crime and witnesses, and they represent a sensible discussion on how to improve public confidence in our criminal justice system. For example, allowing victims to make oral representations to The Parole Board for Scotland will give them an important say in decisions about releasing prisoners.

I reassure Jamie Hepburn that I have publicly declared, including in this chamber, that a Conservative Government in the 1990s introduced automatic early release. It accepted afterwards that it had got it wrong, which is why it enacted, before 1997, a statute to terminate automatic early release. However, the incoming Labour Government did not implement the act. The point is that we have an opportunity in this devolved Parliament to discuss such issues. I say to Jamie Hepburn that I think that it would be remiss of me, as an Opposition politician, in a debate about victims, not to raise an issue that I think goes to the heart of public confidence in the justice system and is certainly an issue that perplexes the public.</p><p>That said, the debate has been interesting and largely consensual, in that members agree that more must be done for victims and witnesses. The Scottish Government consultation document contains a number of sensible policy suggestions and is therefore to be welcomed as informing the drafting of legislation. However, as I said, I am not here to agree with everything that the Scottish Government does and I think that the proposals are slightly deficient in urgency and ambition. As a number of members have said, it has taken rather a long time for the Government to consider the issue. The SNP&#8217;s 2011 manifesto included a commitment to introduce a victims&#8217; rights bill, but it was not included in the Government&#8217;s subsequent legislative programme. It has taken over a year to publish the consultation document, so we are unlikely to see a draft bill until much later in this parliamentary session.</p><p>To his credit, the cabinet secretary acknowledged in 2010 that support for victims was an issue. However, the pace is ponderous and I share Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s concern about how to make the progress on the issue that I think we all want. I support his desire for a timetable in that regard.</p><p>I must also raise some questions about the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition in this area. As I stated earlier, the six objectives for victims and witnesses identified in the consultation document seem to me to represent what victims and witnesses should at the very least expect from a criminal justice system. Throughout the consultation document there are references to the draft EU directive on establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The directive, indeed, informs many of the Government&#8217;s proposals. The Scottish Government boldly claims:</p><p>&#8220;These emerging international standards raise the bar internationally and challenge us to raise our game here too.&#8221;</p><p>However, rather than raising the bar, the EU directive is a set of expected minimum standards for victims. Is it really the Government&#8217;s aspiration for Scotland that victims and witnesses should be given only the minimum level of support? Let us try to be a little more ambitious than that.</p><p>There have been some compelling and thoughtful contributions to the debate. I noted particularly those made by Duncan McNeil, David Stewart, Willie Coffey and Nigel Don, who made an important point about whether we could bring the forum of justice to where the people are in the community. I think that there is a precedent for that in the form of the Scottish Land Court, which is a mobile court that convenes where a problem has arisen. In my days as a lawyer I was involved in its proceedings when we met on an island. There is therefore a precedent to consider in that regard, on which the cabinet secretary might want to reflect.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

That is a commendable and laudable principle, but I wonder whether it is logical to extend that type of support to police and yet exclude from that support other public sector workers at risk, such as fire officers and NHS workers. I merely make that observation.</p><p>I cannot help but notice that the consultation proposes to extend the definition of a child witness to someone up to the age of 18.

I am signed up to that. I warmly support the concept of family, and that breadth of representation has made this Parliament, as an elected forum for MSPs, accessible by people of all ages, not least those with parental or other family responsibilities. From 1999, the beneficial effect of that influence has been obvious and it has enhanced the breadth of contributions to debates and committee proceedings.</p><p>Presiding Officer, you are being vigilant and sensitive when you express the desire to ensure that the Parliament is responsive to developments and meets the needs of the people of Scotland by ensuring topicality and relevance in its deliberations. There are two sets of circumstances that did not apply in 1999, but which now give an added piquancy to such a desire. One is the overall majority of one party in the Parliament, and the other is the significant additional powers conferred upon the Parliament by the Scotland Act 2012. The former calls for a heightened emphasis on accountability and the latter places an even more onerous obligation upon our committees. I shall address that latter aspect in more detail in a moment.</p><p>I have never taken the view that the more MSPs sit, the better they get on. Indeed, for such a notably garrulous grouping as politicians, the opposite is probably the case. Hugh Henry is absolutely right to say that we should not be dealing with parliamentary sittings and committees in silos. What matters to me is why we sit, whether in the Parliament or on a committee, and what we do when we sit. If the extension of parliamentary sittings is to provide flexibility in dealing with topical issues and more accountability by debate and use of ministerial questions, then the time is spent usefully. If the extension of sittings is cosmetic&#8212;the &#8220;Well, it looks as though we&#8217;re working harder&#8221; approach&#8212;then, frankly, we are kidding ourselves, we are failing the Parliament and we are failing our constituents. The extended sittings can be justified provided that they are manifestly for the purpose of satisfying topicality and accountability.</p><p>I have one profound concern about the mechanism for asking questions, which operates utterly by chance on the outcome of a ballot, with the exception of First Minister&#8217;s question time. In my case, that has meant that over the past few months, I have been selected for questions on health, transport and justice. That is all very interesting, but the area for which I am the spokesman is culture. I last asked a culture question three months ago.</p><p>If we are really serious about accountability, surely the MSPs best able to ask ministers questions, to challenge them and to put them under the cosh, are the shadow spokesmen in the opposition parties. They know about the portfolio in depth and they are briefed by external organisations about issues.

Currently, when legal experts and the keeper cannot agree on legal issues surrounding aspects of land registration, it is clear that what may be deemed to be materially misleading in the opinion of one lawyer may be deemed to be innocent representation in the opinion of another, and what may constitute reckless disregard for one lawyer may reflect due diligence and adequate professional service for another.</p><p>The difficulty is that, where a client or an adviser to the client other than the solicitor, or a third party who is dealing with or for the client gives erroneous information to the solicitor with malign intent and is determined to deceive the solicitor to induce a fraudulent land registration, the hapless solicitor is the easy target and could be subjected to the nightmare of a technical criminal prosecution that is made possible by the section. As I observed during stage 1, existing law covers such dishonest or fraudulent activity, and the Scottish Law Commission did not seek a new criminal provision in its original bill, the provision was not consulted on pre-legislation, and it did not find support from witnesses who gave oral evidence to the committee. The one exception was the Solicitor General; I might suggest that the Solicitor General&#8217;s office naturally relishes a growth industry in new criminal offences. I would have thought that all that would ring serious alarm bells for most people. I am sorry that the Scottish Government is not among them.</p><p>With those reservations, I accept that the bill makes good progress towards an objective that we all want to be reached and my party will support it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668114", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes.

As many do, I feel that the SNP independence project has been around for a long time: but then, it has been around for a long time.</p><p>I recall the SNP rhetoric of the past four decades&#8212;much of which has been colourful&#8212;not to mention the cocktail of slogans. &#8220;Free by &#8217;93&#8221; sticks in my mind. That did not happen. In 1997, it was &#8220;Yes, we can&#8221;. Well, they did not. Then there was &#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221;, but when or for what never became entirely clear, and that slogan was ditched. When the SNP formed a minority Government in 2007, at least we got the pledge of a referendum bill, but that was ditched, as well.</p><p>It would be tempting to yawn and say, &#8220;Here we go again. The 10 Salmond assertions for a better Scotland&#8212;number 1 being independence.&#8221; However, this time it is real. There will be a referendum. Scotland will be asked to make a massively important decision and slogans alone will not be enough. There must be an informed and mutually respectful debate. If I may say so, the First Minister&#8217;s somewhat vainglorious contribution earlier this afternoon does not augur well.</p><p>The SNP has one not inconsiderable difficulty. Whether it likes it or not, people know how the UK works. They know how Scotland benefits from that partnership, and according to a recent YouGov poll they overwhelmingly support that arrangement. The SNP has a lot of explaining to do, a lot of information to provide and many questions to answer. That means that, when legitimate questions are asked or legitimate concerns are expressed, they cannot be sneered at or dismissed with scoffing contempt. I have observed with concern that, when anyone poses such a question or expresses a reservation about delay in the referendum or about separation itself, an SNP lexicon comes into play. No answer is given, but people are accused of blundering into politics or their suggestions are described as being &#8220;ludicrous&#8221;, as &#8220;scaremongering&#8221; or as &#8220;fanciful&#8221;.</p><p>I have never rubbished the idea of a separate Scotland. Theoretically, Scotland could be independent, but to me the real debate is about what serves Scotland best. Is it our remaining within the tested and enduring partnership of the United Kingdom, or is it separating from that partnership and being an independent country? Drew Smith made that point well.</p><p>It is known that I support our remaining in the United Kingdom. I shall fight that corner over the forthcoming months, but I will try to do so by seeking to make informed comment and to ask legitimate questions, which must be answered before voters can make an informed decision at the ballot box in the referendum.</p><p>Let me illustrate the problem. If Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond say that they are confident that Scotland, if we separate from the UK, will have a place on the Bank of England monetary policy committee, that is assertion, not fact. It will become fact only when the Bank of England confirms that it will happen. We should remember whose bank it is; it is not the bank of Scotland and certainly not the bank of Salmond but the Bank of England, which will, post-independence, be a foreign country. The assertion is meaningless unless Alex Salmond can show that he has discussed the matter with the Bank of England, and the assertion remains just that unless the Bank of England agrees with it.</p><p>Alex Salmond asserts that an independent Scotland will seamlessly, on separation, become an independent member of the EU. He bases his assertion on legal opinion. He is perfectly entitled to do that, but he should explain that what that really means is that one judge supported that view in 1992, a director general of the EU fisheries directorate supported the view in 2007 and a former secretary general of the European Commission has supported the view. What is not mentioned is that numerous organisations and entities, legal luminaries and constitutional experts&#8212;14, the last time I counted&#8212;disagree with that view. Therefore, for the moment the SNP&#8217;s stance on the EU is assertion, not fact, and unless Alex Salmond has raised the issue with the Commission and had his assertion accepted, assertion it remains.</p><p>Like Drew Smith, I do not mind debate. I do not dismiss the SNP&#8217;s right to make its argument; it is entitled to do so. I have never objected to rhetoric and knockabout, which I enjoy as much as anything. However, at the end of the day, this debate cannot proceed without substantive information and reliable facts. Any attempt to dodge that, eliminate it or gloss over it not only does a true disservice to this Parliament, but does a profound disservice to the people of Scotland.</p><p>In the days of slogans, soundbites and rhetoric, much fun was enjoyed. Those days are over. Slogans, soundbites and rhetoric alone will not wash; they are not enough. We are moving on to informed argument and fact, and it is high time that the SNP provided both.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Having been in the Scottish Parliament since 1999, I suppose that I should not be surprised by this debate.

We have come a long way since deafness was regarded simply as an unfortunate fact of life, with little more than primitive and obtrusive hearing aids being available for those who suffered from deafness.</p><p>My initial awareness of the condition was due to the fact that, in her early 30s, my mother experienced significant loss of hearing. Only as I grew older did I realise how isolating and discriminatory deafness was for her. I realise now how frustrating it was for her when shopping, travelling or just leading her everyday life. Her deafness blocked communication; when communication is blocked, it is frightening. Further, there is the embarrassment of asking someone to repeat what was said and, on repetition, of still being uncertain what was said, and there is the feeling of a lack of confidence about one&#8217;s ability to cope.</p><p>It was only as my mother got older that I really understood how isolating deafness can be.

Section 1 says explicitly:</p><p>&#8220;The body corporate known as The Trustees of the National Library of Scotland, established by section 1(1) of the 1925 Act, continues in existence and is renamed the National Library of Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>Section 1 therefore reaffirms the existence of a body of trustees. That is good, because trustees have independent duties and obligations and operate under a well-developed framework of law&#8212;they know what their responsibilities are. Is it not then inconsistent of the bill never again to refer to trustees? Schedule 1, which deals with the entity that is the NLS, talks about &#8220;members&#8221;, not trustees. To guide us in the interpretation of the bill, it is confirmed that &#8220;the 1925 act&#8221; means the National Library of Scotland Act 1925, which schedule 3 to the bill will abolish. Will the minister clarify whether the NLS is to be run by trustees, as defined by the 1925 act? If that is the case, would it be wise to retain section 1(1) of the 1925 act, rather than to abolish it? I understand that that could be done by adding to the relevant provision in schedule 3 the words, &#8220;with the exception of section 1(1)&#8221;, and that that could be effected by a holograph amendment.</p><p>My other profound concern is the provision for ministerial intervention. I am vexed that the Scottish Government could not support Mr McArthur&#8217;s amendments. If the minister desires to retain ultimate power of last resort to intervene in the event of gross incompetence, malfunction or dishonesty, the intervention power should be appropriately qualified. Otherwise, the potential for conflicts of governance and unreasonable intrusion by Government is manifest. The cabinet secretary should be more explicit about how the power could be used. If she is not explicit, what she is saying to us is analogous to saying, &#8220;I won&#8217;t run you down in my motor car and I won&#8217;t boil you in oil, but I might put arsenic in your tea or shove you off a cliff.&#8221; That is not reassuring.</p><p>It is also relevant to observe that ministerial powers of intervention are less forbidding if the devolved Administration is a coalition or a minority Government, as was always thought would be likely in the Scottish Parliament. In the case of an Administration that has an overall majority, the opportunity for checks and balances is greatly diminished.</p><p>As Liz Smith said, we support the bill. It is necessary, and it is timely that we take account of circumstances that are vastly different from those that prevailed in 1925.

I do not dance, I do not sing, I do not act and&#8212;this will astonish members&#8212;I do not do ballet. However, I certainly enjoy being a member of audiences who enjoy all those activities, so I want to thank the people in Scotland who nurture and encourage those cultural assets&#8212;not least the people who work in Scotland&#8217;s national performing companies. Scotland has a rich cultural life and we are fortunate to have such talent to enjoy. Further, as Patricia Ferguson and the minister have said, the growing international profile of the activities not only enriches our cultural scene, but opens up a broad range of opportunities.</p><p>The activities of the individual companies show energy and innovation. I was intrigued to see that, since its inception, the National Theatre for Scotland has played to more than 710,000 people in 160 productions. The RSNO continues to offer high quality varied fare and has been reaching out to new audiences with initiatives like &#8220;Naked Classics&#8221;, for which there is a &#163;10 ticket. I have not attended a performance, but I am reliably informed by a friend that they are very good.</p><p>In 2010-11, Scottish Ballet danced to more than 56,000 people, and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra continues to delight audiences in Scotland and abroad with varied programmes. Also, Scottish Opera&#8212;the largest of our national performing companies&#8212;has continued to woo the younger audience with its &#163;10 tickets for the under 26s and, as the minister said, with the intriguingly entitled &#8220;BabyO&#8221;, which is a performance for infants and their parents. It is with regret that I note that I am ineligible for either category.</p><p>As well as performances in Scotland, the national performing companies have delivered acclaimed productions to audiences around the globe. As I mentioned earlier, that has an important dimension beyond the arena of culture. I was interested in the minister&#8217;s announcement about the RSNO&#8217;s proposed trip to China and I wish it well with that.</p><p>It is right that we recognise the work that the national performing companies do and the benefits that they bring to Scotland, and that we congratulate them on that, but it is also right that we are objective and question whether there are areas of concern. Debate demands that we do not just accept the status quo as being the best that we can do: we can always improve.</p><p>The NPCs are in the fifth year of a direct-funding relationship with the Scottish Government. I will look at three issues that are appropriate to that. I note that in the 2010-11 annual report, the cabinet secretary takes pride in&#8212;she pointed this out earlier&#8212;the number of performances having increased by 31 per cent, from 692 in 2009-10 to 904 in 2010-11. That increase is a cause for celebration, but it must be put in the context of the somewhat difficult year that the NPCs had in 2009-10 and&#8212;which is perhaps much more important&#8212;the four-year trend since the establishment of direct Government funding for the NPCs. Although performances have increased by 30.5 per cent between 2009-10 and 2010-11, the performance figures for 2010-11 represent an 8 per cent decrease from the number of performances in 2007. That scenario is worrying, when set against the overall budget situation. I ask the minister, when winding up, to confirm what discussions the Scottish Government has had, or is having, with the NPCs about the situation, and what the Government proposes to do.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson raised the issue of audience numbers and I listened with interest to the minister&#8217;s response. However, once again&#8212;to go back over that four-year period&#8212;the audience numbers in 2010-11 represent a 10.5 per cent decrease from attendances in 2007-08. The minister was helpful in expanding further on that to Patricia Ferguson, but that is exactly the area on which content is needed in the annual report. It would be helpful. If there are genuine explanations, such as activity abroad that has drawn audiences of which we may be unaware, and which has affected domestic performances, that is fine, but what is going on should be known. The report would benefit from such detail.</p><p>On a separate front, educational events are up a staggering 69.7 per cent since 2007-08, which is impressive progress that represents the efforts in the past five years of the NPCs to promote cultural arts education. I am all for that. However, in the same period the number of people attending has risen by a somewhat disappointing 23.5 per cent. I fully accept that those figures do not take into account the qualitative aspect of the performances or the cultural yield per event, but if we assume certain fixed costs for putting on events, surely the more people who attend them, the greater the educational return and the greater the growth potential for new adult audiences. Perhaps the minister will allude to that in her closing remarks.</p><p>I applaud the work of the national performing companies and, as the minister and Patricia Ferguson did, I congratulate all those who are involved in the wonderful productions, which delight audiences. I hope that my observations can be taken on board. I want to help and strengthen the NPCs, but we will do that only if we are realistic about challenges and if we show willingness to address them.</p><p>I note the plea that I fill a generous six minutes. I do not know whether I have served you well, Presiding Officer, but it was an unusual request as I am accustomed to obeying you by observing brevity.</p><p>I support the motion, and I support the amendment in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s name.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666257", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Performing Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for bringing the motion to the chamber for debate, and I am pleased to speak in the debate because I, too, want to pay tribute to the breadth and variety of cultural talent throughout Scotland.

What our creative industries and NPCs do for Scotland and our economy has been universally recognised; indeed, Clare Adamson made a most impressive cultural contribution of her own.

The issue of audience numbers for performances, coupled with the somewhat disappointing increase in education participants despite a substantial increase in educational events, is disturbing, given the consistent increase in cash-terms funding that NPCs have received under the Scottish National Party Government in recent years.</p><p>I note Sandra White&#8217;s warning, which I do not dismiss. However, we have to note trends. The trend between 2007 and 2011-12, in terms of the Scottish Government core funding grant, is interesting. The grant has increased by 8.1 per cent in cash terms, which is an average of just more than 2 per cent per year. Despite that, as we have seen, audience numbers are down from five years ago, performances are down, and education participants have not increased proportionately to the number of educational events. I merely articulate that as food for thought; it is not a trenchant criticism of any of the companies.</p><p>On a positive note, Patricia Ferguson and Jenny Marra made some interesting suggestions about young people and how we might look at that cohort.</p><p>To return to the funding figures, there is another statistic that I find slightly troubling. Since becoming heavily dependent on central Government funding, two of our five NPCs have become more dependent on Government core grant. For the RSNO, the core grant in 2010-11 represented 59 per cent of its turnover, which was up from 57 per cent in 2007-08. For the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the figure was 50 per cent, which was up from 49 per cent over the same period. Admittedly, those figures are not earth-shattering, but there is a trend. We should not lose sight of the fact that, since the establishment of direct Government funding, two fifths of our Scottish NPCs have increased their dependency on that funding.</p><p>I want to raise another point with the cabinet secretary. According to the 2010-11 annual report, there has been a stagnation in the level of sponsorship and funding for NPCs overall. That is not to diminish the vital role that sponsors perform, nor the invaluable commitment of fund-raisers, which are to be commended. However, I note from the report that the proportion of NPC funding that comes from sponsorship and fundraising &#8220;remained at 8%&#8221;.

By way of being positive, I observe that there are a number of important events coming up in Scotland. We have the Commonwealth games and the Ryder cup, and a short time ago we debated tourism, which is one of Scotland&#8217;s economic success stories.

There have been many excellent speeches. I congratulate Dame Elish Angiolini not only on producing a well-researched and robust report but on her clear and uncompromising message that action is necessary. Her insistence on that point is relevant and timely because, having been a member of this Parliament since 1999 and having spent part of that time as convener of the Justice 2 Committee, I know that the issues of the rehabilitation of offenders, male and female, and the complete inadequacy of the preparation for their release from prison and of the support that is available to them on their return to the community have been regularly raised and discussed. Others have made that point. Significantly, as we heard from Margaret Mitchell, in 2009, the Equal Opportunities Committee produced a thorough and comprehensive report, &#8220;Female offenders in the criminal justice system&#8221;. Looking at the general thrust of the Angiolini report, I see that it recognises and addresses many of those issues in a thoughtful and practical manner. I commend her for that.</p><p>I certainly sympathise with Elish Angiolini&#8217;s call for action, because progress to date has not been impressive. Elaine Smith, Richard Simpson and Margaret Mitchell made that point. Indeed, Elish Angiolini&#8217;s report and the report of Her Majesty&#8217;s chief inspector of prisons beg two pertinent questions: what has the Scottish Government been doing over the past five years; and, much more significantly, what has the SPS been doing over the past 13 years since devolution began? The SPS has witnessed the discussions, debates and expressions of concern since 1999, in this Parliament and beyond, it has heard the calls for improvements, innovation and change and it has seen the disturbing levels of reoffending, yet it has looked lumbering and unresponsive and has displayed glacial progress when reacting to events. The minister should feel distinctly uneasy about that culture of inertia. Maureen Watt and Alison McInnes clearly share my unease about it.</p><p>I observe that many of the recommendations in the report apply equally to male and female prisoners. It is important to recognise that the approach to criminal justice in Scotland needs to be changed and improved across the board, and I hope that the Scottish Government will be sensitive to that and cognisant of it in taking the report forward.</p><p>That said, the report rightly identifies that there are specific circumstances and challenges that are common among and particular to women prisoners. Many members commented eloquently on that, and it is an important distinction to make, particularly when the women are mothers. To me, addressing the needs of the children is every bit as important as addressing the needs of the prisoners, and often those needs are mutual.</p><p>I therefore feel positive about service redesign involving community justice centres, multidisciplinary teams and supported accommodation. However, let us be clear about how they will engage with community justice authorities and let us ensure that we eliminate duplication or replication of function or service. On that issue, I share Alison McInnes&#8217;s concerns about some of the proposals for further bureaucracy. The proposals for new national bodies need to be examined carefully. We have a Scottish Parliament, a Scottish Government and a Scottish Prison Service, and it seems to me that they&#8212;particularly the SPS, if it is functioning effectively&#8212;ought to be able to embrace many of the responsibilities.</p><p>I warmly welcome the focus on mental health services, the recognition of borderline personality disorders and the need for improved and timeous psychiatric reports. The proposals in those areas have potential to deliver huge benefits. Mark McDonald made a thoughtful contribution in that respect.</p><p>I am not hostile in principle to alternatives to prosecution, which might play a useful role, but they must not become the automatic, default position for all classes of lower-level offending simply because of a balance-sheet-driven approach. The public interest might require that some offenders are still prosecuted and, on conviction, imprisoned.</p><p>The alternatives to remand deserve serious consideration, and improvement to community reintegration is years overdue. I fully support the recommendation that, on release, a woman should have immediate access to benefits and safe accommodation. Without those fundamental supports, it is irresponsible to release her from prison.</p><p>I have left the issue of prisons to the end. It is genuinely perplexing. First, and importantly, the report states explicitly:</p><p>&#8220;There are women who should be in prison to protect the public and to mark the seriousness of their crimes.&#8221;</p><p>The report acknowledges that by proposing a new national prison for women offenders. It anticipates that the facility will be smaller than Cornton Vale. If many of the changes that are proposed in the report work, pressure on prison capacity will reduce, but, as my colleague David McLetchie said, there is still a significant challenge. Recent figures show that the numbers of women who commit non-sexual crimes of violence&#8212;that is homicides, attempted murders, serious assaults and violent robberies&#8212;are extensive, and we must be sure that we have the prison capacity for that cohort of serious offenders.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to take part in the debate.

I must confess that I was not particularly knowledgeable about them, but I made it my business to find out more about them. I am hugely impressed, because they not only serve geographic communities but reflect the diverse character of communities and their cultures. They are manned by committed and enthusiastic individuals, and they provide a wealth of local information to their listeners. It is important that much of the content of their broadcasts is popular with, and relevant to, a specific local audience and may not be covered by commercial or mass-media broadcasters.

Benefit to the community is at the heart of its activities.</p><p>Interestingly, community radio aims not to talk at the local community, but to engage with it, which is an attractive aspect. I was struck by the passion of Christine Grahame and Dennis Robertson for politicians getting involved in it, but I sound a note of caution, in that listeners might not have the same enthusiasm for such participation as they would have for pet owners being reunited with their long-lost pets, which Elaine Murray mentioned.</p><p>Another virtue of community radio stations is their diversity. Some concentrate on a particular area or a particular genre of music or culture, while others aim to attract younger audiences, religious communities or the Armed Forces and their families. Interestingly, according to Ofcom, to date 228 community radio licences have been issued in the UK and around 11&#160;million people can now tune in to community stations across the UK. That shows just what a popular medium community radio is.</p><p>The Scottish community broadcasting network, which was established in 2007, supports community radio projects in Scotland. As Christine Grahame said, there are currently 18 community radio stations across Scotland. I think that I featured on Glasgow&#8217;s Sunny Govan Community Radio; I certainly recollect that it was a great experience.</p><p>In my regional constituency area, 3TFM Community Radio for Health broadcasts to the people of Stevenston, Saltcoats and Ardrossan. With a primary focus on promoting health, 3TFM takes volunteers from the three towns and surrounding areas who are interested in different aspects of broadcasting and it provides training in presentation, radio production and administration. 3TFM has a wide and varied schedule and regular shows include &#8220;Manic Mondays&#8221;, &#8220;Musical Spirit,&#8221; &#8220;Community Sounds&#8221; and &#8220;3TFM Jukebox&#8221;. It all seems to me to be a great example of broadcasting innovation and community commitment.</p><p>Pulse 98.4 is another community radio station in my area. It is a not-for-profit community radio station that is based in Barrhead, in East Renfrewshire. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The original emphasis was on youth participation, but that has broadened out and it has a full-time community radio licence. It has a huge contribution to make, including in training. In my opinion, it is not just a medium for communication but a training provider and a presence that helps to knit the community together. Fiona McLeod comprehensively covered East Dunbartonshire Radio.</p><p>I applaud all efforts to empower local communities, and community radio is an example of that as it provides local communities with a platform to discuss local issues and communicate with others in their areas. I both recognise and congratulate all the volunteers across Scotland who work hard to run the radio shows and to provide training to those who are interested in progressing in broadcasting.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665517", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Radio"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christine Grahame for bringing the issue of community radio to the chamber.

I say to Mrs Eadie that I am just relieved that what was overheard was so benign; it could have been a lot worse.</p><p>Legislative consent motion debates may appear to be dry, technical, box-ticking exercises, but the motion that we are considering is anything but. Arguably, it is the most important LCM that the Parliament has ever debated, because the Scotland Bill significantly changes the face of devolution. It is also the culmination of the lengthy and comprehensive process of examination, investigation, consultation and evidence taking that the Calman commission carried out. I am grateful to Iain Gray for commenting in detail on that process, and I pay tribute to Wendy Alexander and the then Liberal Democrat leader Nicol Stephen, who, with me, were involved in its inception.</p><p>The Calman process has been augmented and, in fairness, complemented by parliamentary process here and at Westminster and by the discussions between the Westminster and Scottish Governments, to which Mr Crawford referred.</p><p>Back in 2007, I was clear that the devolution settlement was inadequate, and I think that that was universally recognised. At that time, the only constitutional alternative was the SNP&#8217;s separation agenda. Whatever the passion among the SNP&#8217;s ranks for that agenda, it is not universally shared throughout Scotland. There is an alternative and more dominant passion to keep Scotland within the UK with a beefed-up, dynamic and fiscally accountable Scottish Parliament, and that is what the Scotland Bill delivers.</p><p>Back in December 2010, I said in the chamber that the Scotland Bill marked</p><p>&#8220;a watershed in the life of the Scottish Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>I observed that the bill did not tweak and tinker and that it was &#8220;not merely an MOT.&#8221; I said that it was a road map for our future, the purpose of which was to strengthen Scotland&#8217;s position within the UK, to make devolution work better and to respond to the wishes of the Scottish people. I said that if the powers in the bill were used properly, they would allow Scotland to become</p><p>&#8220;a more dynamic and prosperous place.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 9 December 2010; c 31363, 31365.]</p><p>Those remain my sentiments.</p><p>On the back of the Calman commission, the Prime Minister and the coalition Government at Westminster have delivered a substantial transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament. Crucially, the real fiscal accountability that the Scotland Bill offers means that the Parliament and every MSP will have to think about how money is raised, not just about how it is spent. That is a critical discipline, the absence of which has diluted political responsibility and accountability to date. The Parliament has been the poorer for that omission.</p><p>A number of members&#8212;notably Iain Gray&#8212;have referred to the important development of fiscal accountability but, interestingly, if my notes are correct, SNP members have not been among them.</p><p>These powers will create exciting new political opportunities and will hopefully encourage political innovation and new ways of thinking. At my party&#8217;s conference in Troon, in March this year, the Prime Minister stated:</p><p>&#8220;In the Scotland Bill we've got a huge transfer of fiscal powers. New borrowing powers. A cash reserve. A Scottish income tax. Indeed the proportion of the Budget that can be raised in Scotland will more than double &#8230; So this is a Bill delivered in Westminster, supported by the Scottish Government, consented to by the Scottish Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>To me, that represents not only a significant constitutional development for Scotland and the Parliament, but respect in operation, because that is exactly what we have had. We have seen Scotland&#8217;s two Governments and two Parliaments working together&#8212;not always seeing eye to eye, which is accepted, but all seeing the need for progress and co-operating to achieve that. That, to me, is mature politics.</p><p>As Iain Gray said, the Calman commission represented a genuine, cross-party, cross-border response to improving the devolution settlement. It has created a viable legacy and a basis for change. Unlike the SNP&#8217;s national conversation, the Calman commission was approved and validated by this Parliament in 2007. Its remit was to review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, recommend changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable this Parliament to better serve the people of Scotland, improve financial accountability and secure the position of Scotland in the UK. I argue that the Scotland Bill delivers that in spades.</p><p>We are about to enter phase 2 of devolution and embrace an exciting new era for Scotland. That is why there is a legitimate and clear choice for the Scottish people. I seem to have an authoritative ally for that view in Bruce Crawford. The clear choice is between separation and leaving the United Kingdom, and strong devolution and staying in the United Kingdom. Linda Fabiani also seems clear about that choice and, apparently, she is confident about the outcome.</p><p>So, what is the problem? Why the delay? Scotland should be allowed to make that choice, and to do so as soon as possible. The delay is unnecessary, unhelpful and corrosive to business confidence and stability.

The subject does not brim with pulsating excitement. Things were a lot more colourful when buyer and seller exchanged clods of earth to reflect the sasine of acquired ground. I declare an interest as a former solicitor who practised conveyancing.</p><p>All the complex, technical and rather dry environment surrounding registering a title to heritage in Scotland should not blind us to the important function of giving a purchaser or an existing landowner a good title in law, and a secured creditor a good security. Without those components being delivered in an efficient and cost-effective process, much domestic conveyancing could grind to a halt and, on the commercial front, Scotland could become an unattractive destination for doing business. In modernising and improving the function of land registration, an important balance has to be struck.</p><p>My party accepts the need for that modernisation and, within the constraints of the time I have available, I will restrict my comments to the particular areas on which I would like the minister&#8217;s input. I also pay tribute to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. I found its report to be very informative and helpful.</p><p>The objective of completing the land register is essential and the statutory changes that are proposed to achieve that are positive. However, if voluntary registrations are cut off at the pass by excessive registration fees, progress will not be made. That is a fact. I urge the Scottish Government to produce the carrot in the form of voluntary registration fees that act as an inducement. There could be a trial charging regime for a fixed period to assess the response. If the fees in Scotland are significantly greater than those in the comparable process in England and Wales, that is not a good message.</p><p>I accept that keeper-induced registrations are consistent with the ends of the bill, and the minister has sought to clarify the fee-charging mechanism, to some extent. I am still unclear about how the proposal will work in practice, so I urge the minister to spell that out in more detail. It is not only the involvement of the landowner that is significant; it is also about intimation to any secured creditor who has an equivalent interest. Without that clarification, the retention of section 29 will be problematic.</p><p>Nothing could be more vital than the technical issue of the land register&#8217;s accuracy. There are problems with the scale of the Ordnance Survey map, particularly for remoter geographical areas. Interestingly, those problems also existed in the old sasine system, which depended on a combination of plans and a series of written descriptions of physical boundaries such as walls, hedges, burns and rivers. I suggest to the minister not only that such additional information should be a minimum requirement to accompany a land registration application, but that the documents should be retained by the keeper for the purposes of archive information and that they be accorded legal status. A professionally drawn surveyor&#8217;s plan that is fully measured to reference points of an area of ground is the most accurate description that the keeper can procure. An Ordnance Survey map cannot match that degree of accuracy. That additional information can only help the keeper and make the land register more robust. That is why, without legal status for such plans, the inherent weakness of title depending on an Ordnance Survey scale that is too small for purpose remains unaddressed.</p><p>On electronic conveyancing&#8212;a bewildering concept to an old bird like me&#8212;I share the committee&#8217;s rejection of making it compulsory. The opportunities that will be provided by, and the potential of, proceeding with automated registration of title to land are obvious, and the committee was right to raise the twin issues of cost and safeguards.</p><p>The provision that troubles me most is section 108, in which the theory of box-ticking usurping common sense seems to have manifested itself. I do not know who is responsible for the inclusion of section 108, because it does not seem to have many friends. It was not in the original Scottish Law Commission bill, it was not consulted on, and it did not seem to find support from witnesses or in written evidence to the committee. At present, any party or agent&#8212;whether purchaser, landowner, heritable creditor, solicitor, surveyor or other adviser to a land registration application&#8212;who is dishonest and who, through dishonest conduct, knowingly induces a registration of land, is committing a serious criminal offence and can and should be prosecuted under existing law. The proposed new law is unnecessary and grossly disproportionate. I urge the minister either to remove section 108 or to amend it heavily.</p><p>Genuine error is a separate issue. I am concerned that section 33(1)(b) will give a power to the keeper that could be used excessively, to the detriment and prejudice of purchaser applicants and their heritable creditors. Rejection for a serious error or a material omission is one thing, but rejection on any other grounds seems to be irresponsible and could seriously prejudice a creditor&#8217;s interest.</p><p>Finally, anything that replaces letters of obligation has to be very good. I still recall the spasm every time I signed a letter of obligation, knowing that I was personally guaranteeing the wellbeing of my partners and my firm&#8212;an onerous undertaking for which to be responsible.

The much-vaunted target for tourism, for example, was set with the best of intentions, and now everyone keeps hanging their argument on it. The lesson to be learned is that, if the bill changes things for the better, we should assess the practical consequences of its implementation and consider whether adjustment or change is necessary.</p><p>I was struck by some of the contributions on inducing greater voluntary registration. Hanzala Malik made an interesting point about large landowners such as the MOD. The MOD may well be amenable to an approach, and other larger landowners may take the same view. I noted that James Kelly and Paul Wheelhouse share my view that the charging mechanism could be the key, and I would like to hear the minister&#8217;s comments on that.</p><p>On the accuracy of the land register, members such as Paul Wheelhouse made some good points about the genuine practical problems, particularly for remoter rural areas. Rob Gibson made an interesting point, but I am not quite sure whether I understood him completely. He seemed to be focusing on the OS map as the problem, and arguing that we should make that better. My concern is that, at present, I do not think that we can make an OS-based system better at dealing with issues relating to plots in rural areas on an appropriate scale. One line on an OS map may be a difference of several metres on the ground, which could be critical for the accuracy of title conferment and title interpretation. I go back to the point that we must ensure that the keeper is armed with all the ancillary information that she can get. There is a huge obligation on the registration applicant&#8217;s solicitor to provide as much information as possible. That may include professionally drawn surveyor&#8217;s plans and&#8212;as Mike MacKenzie indicated&#8212;information that is held in the old sasines system.</p><p>Surely whatever informs the keeper about how to register a title is worth while only if it is given some type of legal status in the archive.

Tourism is a good news story. The debate has, by general assent, been positive, with a predictable element of unanimity.</p><p>As members have said, our diverse Scottish tourism industry makes an important contribution to the Scottish economy. With an estimated total contribution of &#163;11&#160;billion, tourism encompasses numerous sectors and supports more than 240,000 jobs. Visitor spend in Scotland supports sectors such as transport and food and drink, as the minister acknowledged.</p><p>VisitScotland has set out its objectives and priorities for the next few years, including tackling the challenge of seasonality, which is important, improving the quality of tourism jobs and making holidays in Scotland available for all. Those are welcome aspirations.</p><p>A new phenomenon is emerging, which some members touched on: the staycation. Like so many modern terms, that is a bit jargony for my taste, but staycations are nonetheless important to our Scottish economy. Margaret McCulloch made that point. I hope that VisitScotland is engaging with all relevant Scottish agencies, travel operators, local authorities and accommodation providers to maximise the opportunities in that regard, because Scotland has much to offer the staycationer, be that the day visitor, the long-weekender or the residential holidaymaker.</p><p>In my area, the west of Scotland, tourism is not only at the forefront of existing economic activity but offers untapped potential for more economic activity. Six out of the 10 Scottish Parliament constituencies in the west of Scotland are either bounded by the Clyde or include islands, such as Arran and Cumbrae. I wisely left Paisley to be dealt with comprehensively by George Adam.</p><p>To see Arran, as I did on Monday, when I was holding a surgery and visiting the local secondary school on a glorious sunny day, is to witness something breathtaking. Arran is understandably called &#8220;Scotland in miniature&#8221;, but I never cease to be astonished at the number of people, many of them resident in Scotland, who have never visited the island. There is beautiful scenery, abundant wildlife, a wide range of accommodation, walking, climbing&#8212;all 874m of Goatfell, although I cannot vouch for that personally&#8212;and there are welcoming businesses and friendly locals.</p><p>Even so, Arran&#8217;s economy is fragile. Tourism plays a vital role, and the island is accessible, with inclusive rail and ferry tickets to Brodick, but I ask the minister whether the ferry services are as flexible as they need to be if access to the island is to be maximised. The extension of the road equivalent tariff to the Ardrossan to Brodick ferry service will be important, but if that leads to more visitors, as we hope that it will do, a re-examination of ferry times could be required. Within the constraints of weather, the ferry service must suit the needs of the public and local businesses. I hope that the minister will confirm his willingness to consider the issues with CalMac ferries.</p><p>Another Firth of Clyde gem is the combination of Largs and Cumbrae. Largs has undergone significant town centre regeneration, which is a positive development, and taking the short ferry trip to Cumbrae offers a marvellous day out. Again, both places are readily accessible by car and public transport and have a great deal to offer the day visitor and the residential tourist.</p><p>Also crying out to be visited are attractive coastal locations such as Helensburgh and Kilcreggan, the latter being just a short ferry trip from Gourock, which is well worth a visit in its own right. Gourock has the unique heated seawater swimming pool, which is currently undergoing refurbishment but will reopen in summer. Who needs the balmy climes of the Med? That could be a delightful day out for the Ewing family.</p><p>If one&#8217;s interest is culture and industrial heritage, which Stuart McMillan talked about so eloquently, Port Glasgow and Greenock have a lot to offer. Greenock has a beautiful esplanade and there is great ice cream at the cafe. If one&#8217;s taste runs to sandy beaches, West Kilbride, Seamill, Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston offer great choice and variety and are all accessible by public transport. Why would anyone want to go anywhere else?</p><p>Those are all ideal staycation destinations, but we need a clearer strategy to recognise and promote the distinctive nature of staycations. I proudly trumpet the attractions of the Firth of Clyde as a tourist destination; other MSPs are equally proud to promote the beauty and attractions of their areas, as Siobhan McMahon and David Stewart did. They, too, will recognise the emerging opportunities of staycations, as Graeme Dey did.</p><p>The future of our tourism industry is very important to us all. I think that, as well as focusing on the traditional and natural attraction of our country, it should look at the less obvious opportunities. Stuart McMillan&#8217;s speech was helpful in that regard. We have cultural tourism, to which the minister referred, wildlife tourism and archive tourism. Scotland is brimming with opportunity on all those fronts.</p><p>As we look at the big events from which we will benefit&#8212;the Olympics, the Commonwealth games and the Ryder cup in 2014&#8212;it is important that we derive maximum benefit from the opportunities that they present. However, there is still more that we can do, and we must not lose sight of the less glamorous but still vital opportunities of staycations.

It has a roll of 33, and meets the needs of children with additional learning needs, including some with autism spectrum disorder. I understand that the council proposes to close the school by August 2013, and to offer, as we have heard, additional support for learning provision in Barmulloch primary. There is clearly an apprehension that Glasgow City Council education department&#8217;s plans to shut Gadburn have been too hasty, and most parents are naturally fearful about the impact that integration with a mainstream primary will have on their children.</p><p>In early 2011, the city council launched an official consultation into the future of the two schools, in which it outlined its plan to move the children at Gadburn to the new unit in Barmulloch primary. According to the consultation paper, measures would be taken to ease the transition, but it is instructive to note that of the 67 responses, only 15 supported the plan, while 45 were against and seven unclear. It is disappointing that the council then took the decision on 27 January of this year to close Gadburn school.</p><p>The early years are an important time for children&#8217;s physical, emotional, educational and social development, Parents naturally want the very best for their children, including a schooling environment that supports their needs. Schools such as Gadburn aim to educate pupils who require additional support in a way that addresses those pupils&#8217; individual differences and needs. That might include adapted equipment and materials, accessible settings and other interventions designed to help children who require additional support to achieve a higher level of self-sufficiency and success than if they were given access only to a typical classroom environment and education. Humza Yousaf&#8217;s description of some of the young people&#8217;s experiences is disturbing.</p><p>&#8220;Gadburn School Handbook&#8221; states:</p><p>&#8220;The pupils learn in a highly structured, ordered environment designed to reduce anxiety and prevent distraction. A clearly defined, predictable routine is followed throughout the day.&#8221;</p><p>I can see, therefore, why Gadburn parents have genuine fears that a change in the school setting will be a seriously disruptive upheaval for their children. Ruth Davidson and I understand that the closure of a school, particularly one that provides additional support to students, is a sensitive subject. I know that the parents at the school have campaigned tirelessly to try to prevent the closure, and I sympathise with their concern about Glasgow City Council&#8217;s decision. There are significant concerns about the council&#8217;s decision-making process, and I urge the minister to listen to the parents&#8217; legitimate concerns, heed these children&#8217;s very particular needs, and call in the decision.

The debate has been well informed, and there has been much agreement on a range of points.</p><p>Human trafficking&#8212;the recruitment, transportation, intimidation and incarceration of vulnerable persons&#8212;is deception and exploitation at their very worst, and it is to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. A simple Google search on human trafficking in Scotland in 2012 brings up horrifying headlines. There are details of victims of human sex trafficking in modern-day Scotland. Victims are threatened with witchcraft and subjected to torture and are vulnerable to death. Women are viewed as commodities and are forced to take alcohol and drugs. Trafficked women are forced to work for 16 hours a day and to have sex with numerous men. Those violations, including domestic servitude, occur throughout Scotland, not just in the shadowy back streets of our cities, and those abused individuals are not just physically captive; they are mentally shackled and controlled by traffickers. We must resolve as one to root out that evil and bring an end to that suffering. Law enforcement is important, and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to it.</p><p>Jenny Marra was correct to say that quantifying the problem is difficult. As long ago as 2001, the International Organisation for Migration estimated that 1 million people were trafficked for sexual exploitation each year, and the United States Department of State claimed that 600,000 to 800,000 people were trafficked globally each year and that 80 per cent of them were female. That is simply a catalogue of incalculable human misery.</p><p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission&#8217;s inquiry into human trafficking in Scotland was therefore timely. It was helpful that the Scottish and UK Government response was positively acknowledged, but it was still recognised that more could be done. As other members have indicated, it is disturbing that a low awareness of human trafficking was found among professionals and the public. It was also questioned whether authorities such as the police and health workers were sufficiently well attuned to spot or consider human trafficking issues. If that is allied with the conclusion that police and victim support services often did not work in co-operation and the fact that trafficking was observed to be an issue across Scotland, not just in cities, a troubling picture emerges. Given that the report recommended that the Scottish Government must be willing to take a leadership role in devolved areas and be proactive in its relationship with the UK Government over reserved areas, I am encouraged by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response in holding this debate, and am encouraged by the motion and the intention to host a summit to refresh the strategic direction for policy and delivery. I say to the cabinet secretary that that should be sooner rather than later.</p><p>I share Mary Fee&#8217;s and Alison McInnes&#8217;s anxiety about the possibility of trafficking increasing around the Commonwealth games. It is therefore urgent to frame a date and a structure for the summit. I hope that the minister will expand on that in her speech.</p><p>The amendment that was lodged by my colleague Mr McLetchie underlines the need for cross-border co-operation. I thank Roddy Campbell for acknowledging the positive approach from Westminster. I realise that Christina McKelvie has a slightly less positive perception of the UK Border Agency, but I urge the cabinet secretary to share any concerns directly with the Home Secretary. I support that approach. Graeme Pearson also made that point.

Much good work has been done there.</p><p>Closer to home, there is one local weapon available to us in fighting this repugnant trade. As both reports confirm, awareness of trafficking is low. The justice system is supposed to prevent trafficking, but something has to trigger the intervention of the justice system and other agencies. Sadly, sex trafficking is very much a hidden crime and there are concerns about detecting the trafficking networks. These activities are covert; they are out of sight and in the shadows. The traffickers dread exposure. The prospect of being brought out into the light stops them in their tracks and brings an end to their nasty operations and their parasitic lifestyles. One weapon that we have is community intelligence. Individuals throughout Scotland need to be vigilant to report any suspicious activities. We are all observers and we can be the key to unlocking a trafficking network.</p><p>I hope that the minister will reflect on that and perhaps indicate in her wind-up speech whether there could be a place for community representatives, in whatever form, at the proposed summit.

I thank Patrick Harvie for lodging a motion on 17 January that encapsulated admirably why this issue is so important. I had no hesitation in supporting the motion and I was not alone in doing so. To preserve that consensus, I have repeated the motion verbatim&#8212;I could not improve on it. I look forward to Patrick Harvie&#8217;s contribution to the debate.</p><p>I use the word &#8220;debate&#8221; advisedly. The Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to this matter is less than perfect; indeed it is manifestly flawed. However, I have noticed since last May that although the First Minister and I disagree on many things, he has not regarded his majority as a mandate to steamroller through any Scottish National Party pet project. Indeed, where reasoned argument has been deployed and the possibility has emerged that the Scottish Government might not have got something right, he has deferred to the Parliament and shown a willingness to listen. I very much hope that this debate may allow that precedent to be observed today.</p><p>I shall comment briefly on the role of our Scottish prison visiting committees and, in doing so, thank and pay tribute to the dedicated volunteers who organise and carry out those visits. They do something unique. In a captive situation, which is what a prison is, no matter how well intended the Scottish Prison Service and prison officers are, for prisoners they are part of the system&#8212;part of officialdom. Many prisoners feel unable to trust them or confide in them.</p><p>The prison visitor, on the other hand, is something very different: a person who is independent, who has no axe to grind and who is not part of the system. It is no surprise, therefore, that prison visitors can establish a positive relationship with the prisoner in a way that is impossible for many prison officers. That is not a comment on the prison officer; it is simply a consequence of what prison is.</p><p>There is ample evidence to suggest that a prisoner may speak to a prison visitor when they will speak to no one else. That is not supposition on my part: the HMP Addiewell prison visiting committee&#8217;s response to the 2011 consultation notes a variety of ways in which the prison visitor was able to intervene in important issues in an important way.</p><p>The other aspect of prison visitors is that they do not inspect; they independently monitor, and they do so consistently. It is also acknowledged that they may be far better able to identify a potential suicide risk.</p><p>It is not surprising, therefore, that prison visitors are regarded as helping and supporting the prison service in a very positive manner. That is certainly the private view of a number of governors and prison officers. Indeed, it would be bizarre for a prison officer to hold a different view, unless to such a prison officer a conscientious prison visitor was a tiresome inconvenience.</p><p>Prison visitors enjoy an attribute that I would have thought would be irresistible to any Government: they are free, because they volunteer their services. The cost of training and operating the VC scheme annually is approximately &#163;75,000, and the services that visitors volunteer for that modest outlay are impressive.</p><p>I have mentioned the Addiewell example, but there is also the visiting committee for young offenders in Cornton Vale. According to its 2010-11 report, seven visitors made 205 visits in that period. I understand that each visit is six hours long.</p><p>Interestingly, for pretty obvious reasons, the prison visitation scheme has never needed anyone to plead its case. The virtues have been self-evident, as was recognised in the 2005 review. The &#8220;Report on the review of prison visiting committees 2005&#8221; stated:</p><p>&#8220;At the outset, the group tackled in depth the fundamental question of whether there was still a need for VCs paying particular attention to the existence of the Prisons Inspectorate and the Scottish Prisons Complaints Commissioner ... Discussions took place with the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Complaints Commissioner who agreed that there was a distinctive and important albeit complementary role for visiting committees. Principally, the distinctiveness arose from VCs being representative of local communities, being independent of the prison service and in the sustaining of a continuing regular relationship with a particular prison.&#8221;</p><p>Importantly, that review group concluded that visiting committees &#8220;should be retained&#8221;.</p><p>Following that review, the then Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive accepted 32 of the 39 recommendations. In 2007, the incoming SNP Government endorsed that position.</p><p>The Scottish Government then&#8212;for reasons that were at best opaque, because it had already endorsed the 2005 report&#8212;decided to undertake a further consultation last year. I say &#8220;opaque&#8221;, because normally a consultation is instigated when something is no longer working or is no longer relevant, or when external circumstances have dictated change.</p><p>However, that was not stated to be the case in the consultation document. Tellingly, it said that the key driver for the consultation was the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to simplify the landscape of public sector organisations in Scotland. It was nothing to do with prisoners or prisons, with trying to replace a very good service with a better one or with the most basic of human rights. I support the principle of public sector reform, but not if that means trampling all over people&#8217;s human rights, and not if a very good service is replaced with a less good one at far greater cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>Nonetheless, the consultation proceeded, and the results are most informative. Overwhelmingly, respondents voted and believed that the visiting committees should remain, and that they should complement Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of prisons. The respondents overwhelmingly endorsed the 2005 review and overwhelmingly rejected integration of visiting committees with the Scottish Prison Service.</p><p>Any view that the work of prison visitors could be undertaken by HM inspectorate of prisons was blown out of the water by HMIP itself, whose submission recognised</p><p>&#8220;the importance of local and regular monitoring of individual prisons. The individual Visiting Committees carry out this role, which also includes dealing with complaints. HMIP does not deal with prisoners&#8217; complaints.&#8221;</p><p>To me, the most intriguing response came from the Scottish Prison Service, which was the only organisation to oppose the continuation of visiting committees. Its response is that prisons have changed and that more people from outside enter them in a variety of capacities. Well, what has changed so dramatically since 2005? The answer is nothing.

I am a great supporter of culture, and if my solitude in the chamber today suggests that I am advancing the cause in isolation, I should say that my party is very much behind what is happening.</p><p>Of course, the initiative has already begun. The bells of hogmanay and the spectacular fireworks in our capital city marked the beginning of this creative year, and it is the beginning of an exciting period that embraces London 2012 and Glasgow 2014 and generates momentum towards the homecoming of 2014. Through a year-long programme of activity, Scotland will celebrate our artistic and cultural heritage. Although I recognise that 2012 has been given the title of the year of creative Scotland, we all appreciate that, year in and year out, Scotland showcases its breadth of talent to the world. Scots and tourists alike are treated to wonderful productions, world-class events, festivals and shows, and we should pay tribute to everyone who makes that happen.</p><p>Scotland is rich in heritage and one of the world&#8217;s most dynamic and creative nations. This year, in particular, we celebrate that fact. The initiative is ambitious in scope as it involves the spectrum of the creative industries, and Creative Scotland is not shirking on its investment, having put &#163;6.5 million into the creative Scotland 2012 programme&#8212;that is no small amount of money. I also agree with Patricia Ferguson that Creative Scotland working in tandem with VisitScotland, EventScotland and VOCAL is sensible.</p><p>I welcome all that in principle. However, this is a debate, so I would also welcome the response of the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, Mr Ewing, if he is winding up, to concerns about the emphasis being on promoting what already exists. That emphasis has a place, but what about the anxieties of organisations that depend on Creative Scotland not for a one-off jamboree but for basic funding just to keep going? They need some certainty and reassurance about the shape of future funding. I hope that the minister will agree that while we look to Creative Scotland to co-ordinate and facilitate delivery of very exciting projects for the year, we do not want the staple diet of recurring and excellent creative activity falling off the radar screen. Nevertheless, I welcome the diversity of what is proposed and I am delighted to see the geographical spread of activity.</p><p>I am the first to hold up my hands to taking the cultural banquet that is regularly on offer from Edinburgh and Glasgow completely for granted. Those of us who live in the central belt are fortunate. The iconic locations and events with which Scotland is now indelibly associated&#8212;Edinburgh castle, Stirling castle, our museums in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Edinburgh international festival and fringe and Glasgow&#8217;s Aye Write! festival&#8212;all have their proud place, which is entirely appropriate. I think that a particular highlight this year will be the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, which will have a wealth of creative talent from four continents and will pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s diamond jubilee as well as the year of creative Scotland. That will be a special celebration and a crowd-puller, and a terrific advertisement for Scotland.</p><p>Among all the high-profile bells and whistles, I am delighted to see activity in some of our more remote communities being recognised and rewarded. I was pleased that the minister referred to that. I pay tribute to three towns that have won creative places awards in recognition of their status as Scotland&#8217;s most creative places. Wigtown in Dumfries and Galloway received &#163;50,000 for winning in the category of places with fewer than 2,500 residents. The town already hosts a successful book festival and the award will allow the book festival to be developed into a year-round programme. I know the area well and regard it with great affection, having holidayed there, so that is great news. It is precisely what a local community like that needs.</p><p>In my own west of Scotland region, West Kilbride was awarded &#163;100,000&#8212;I hope that Wigtown will not come with a war cry to West Kilbride&#8212;in the category of places with fewer than 10,000 residents and is seeking to develop itself as craft town Scotland. West Kilbride has a special place in my heart. I have known it since childhood and it was probably my introduction to the seaside. Indeed, I have been known to take a dook in the chilly Firth of Clyde there, but before Mr Ewing collapses it was admittedly not recently and it is certainly not for the faint-hearted. West Kilbride has so much potential in such a beautiful setting and the award can only enhance its growing reputation. Ally that with a train service, good road connections, its proximity to Portencross castle and its historic connection with the ancient Scottish kings, a sandy beach, a golf course designed by old Tom Morris and local recreational facilities, and West Kilbride to me is a wee diamond and a must-visit destination.</p><p>If you cannot get there, St Andrews will have to do. St Andrews featured in the category of places with fewer than 100,000 residents and won &#163;150,000, which was a significant achievement that will greatly enhance what it is trying to do. Again, on the local front, Creetown in Galloway and Huntly in the north-east have both impressed with their long-standing creative programmes involving the whole community, so the reach is indeed both local and broad. That localism matters, so I support Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment. It is very important that we give a physical assurance that all this is reaching out and beyond the two Mecca points of Glasgow and Edinburgh in the central belt.</p><p>As the minister said, the year will proudly feature a host of cultural delights that are too numerous to mention, some familiar names and some less so&#8212;I wish them all well. However, as well as celebrating all that, we should keep our heads screwed on. It is important that we do not view all this in isolation. I think that Patricia Ferguson alluded to that aspect slightly. We need to ensure that there is a legacy from the activity and the disbursement of public money and that we build on and develop our cultural infrastructure. As we enjoy the events of the year in Scotland and in the UK and look forward to the Glasgow Commonwealth games and the 2014 homecoming, I have two ambitions. First, for the homecoming, can we aim to exceed the proportion of overseas visitors that we achieved in 2009? Secondly, if we are repeating the gathering, can we have the most stringent financial safeguards to protect creditors?</p><p>I am confident that 2012 will be an exciting year and I wish all those involved every success.

Its most obvious feature is what has emerged about the diversity of Scotland&#8217;s creativity. The minister set the scene with her reference to diverse events such as the cultural olympiad, with the 2012 festival including the marvellous concert in Stirling featuring the Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var Youth Orchestra. Her reference to peripatetic ballet alarmed me a little, but as long as I am not involved, I am right behind it. She indicated a breadth of activity about which we can feel excited and proud. Clare Adamson paid a deserved tribute to the role played by Alasdair Gray. I was struck by Mark McDonald&#8217;s reference to youth art in Aberdeen and by the references to fishing in Deeside and admiring Balmoral, which seemed to be Dennis Robertson&#8217;s very worthwhile pastimes.</p><p>The whole issue of localism was reflected in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment, about which I spoke in my own contribution. I detect support for the need to ensure that we do not disregard localism and get carried away in a huge froth of excitement about the big, glitzy events but are also right down there in our communities. Several contributors made important points about that. Margaret McCulloch talked about Lanarkshire and the Kittochside museum, which I have visited. I recommend it to anyone; it is a fabulous experience. Several members gave impressive descriptions of what is available in their parts of Scotland.</p><p>Some powerful points were made about the economy. The minister alluded to that, and Margaret McCulloch made some important observations, too. I had not realised the extent, according to Scottish Enterprise, of the contribution that is made by the sector&#8212;&#163;5.4 billion, which is a whacking big amount of money. That makes it clear how culture can drive tourism and how the concept of cultural tourism is so important to us. I was struck by her observations on the role of skills and work experience in cultural tourism; she hits the nail on the head in that regard. There is an important benefit to be derived from that.</p><p>Kevin Stewart was very candid. I enjoyed the part of his speech where he said, if I understood him correctly, that we do not always quite tie up the marketing of culture and tourism. That is a point well made.

When visitors come to Scotland, we want to ensure that they have a very positive experience at whatever level their engagement is taking place. Perhaps the message is that we all need to be more proactive. I must confess that I am pretty passive; if I am in an eaterie somewhere and do not think that the service is all that great, I tend to just grin and bear it and disappear. Perhaps we need to be slightly more vigilant, and, if we think that something is not quite up to scratch, we should think to ourselves, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t just about the service I&#8217;m getting&#8212;it&#8217;s an advertisement for our country.&#8221; We may need to make people more aware of that.</p><p>Jean Urquhart made a fascinating speech about the historic legacy.

She referred to the whole spectrum of historic cultural contribution, whether Sir David Lindsay&#8217;s &#8220;Thrie Estatis&#8221; or the Unity Players&#8212;yes, I knew what she was talking about&#8212;and the exciting concept of a new enlightenment.

My point is that it is right that we have to try to achieve a degree of exposure and publicity. The argument that I am advancing is that perhaps we cannot always achieve what we would desire to achieve in an ideal world. What we desire to achieve must be considered alongside licence fee issues and what is sustainable, cost wise.</p><p>I will explore those two themes a little further. As I understand the current situation, &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; is a Radio 1 network programme. For three out of the four weeks it broadcasts in Scotland and on the fourth week it broadcasts UK-wide. I believe that what is proposed is a Radio 1 programme that will broadcast UK-wide every week and on which one of the co-presenters will still be Ally McCrae. At the same time, apart from the other social media outlets to which I referred, music talent in Scotland will continue to be covered by Radio Scotland and Radio nan G&#224;idheal, which already broadcast a wide range of music.</p><p>I move to what I accept might be the slightly tedious but nonetheless inescapable issue of cost. Some rather stark facts have to be considered. The BBC informs me that the listening audience for the existing programme is about 9,000 people. Interestingly, in Wales, whose population is only three fifths of Scotland&#8217;s population, the listening audience for its counterpart is 12,000. My information from the BBC is that the current programme costs about 22p per listener, whereas the average cost for other specialist music programmes is only 0.8p per listener. I am informed that the cost of the new programme will be about a fifth of the cost of the current one.</p><p>I bring those facts into the debate, because whatever we want or might aspire to achieve in an ideal world has to be balanced by the other relevant factors.

I thank the MSPs who have supported it, and I particularly appreciate the cross-party support. That reflects the wide appreciation by MSPs across the chamber of the vital role that the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire and many other local organisations throughout Scotland play in our communities.</p><p>In November last year, I was privileged to visit the centre in Kirkintilloch, to meet staff and to learn about the excellent work that the centre does. I know that members across the chamber are diligent in making visits, but I have to say that when I emerged from that one I said to my researcher, &#8220;What an uplifting experience!&#8221; It was like drinking a glass of champagne.</p><p>The centre provides a central point for volunteering throughout East Dunbartonshire. It aims to support and encourage local people to offer their services to help others in their community&#8212;it is the focal point where people are encouraged, enabled and have the opportunity to volunteer.</p><p>When I stepped through the door, the enthusiasm and passion were tangible. That is down to the positive can-do approach reflected by all the staff, not least Paul O&#8217;Kane and Elaine, with whom I spent most time. Some of the staff are with us in the public gallery, and I welcome them to the debate.</p><p>Those of us who were privileged to listen to Paul earlier today during time for reflection saw that passion and enthusiasm at first hand. I thought that he nailed it when he posed the question: what would happen if we woke up one morning to find that there were no volunteers? I think that there would be a Scotland full of voids and black holes, with thousands of lonely, vulnerable and unsupported people. No Government minister or local authority leader of any political hue could fill that void.</p><p>Volunteering is unique. It is the antithesis of selfishness. It is basically the implementation in people&#8217;s own time and without remuneration of the enduring principles of people helping their neighbour and doing what they can to help others, not because they have to but because they want to. Those principles are all too often pushed aside. We are all guilty of that&#8212;usually not intentionally but simply because other pressures in life eat into our time and compete for our attention.</p><p>That is why the East Dunbartonshire centre is so important. It reminds us of the need to volunteer, to help and to remember others around us. It also co-ordinates those who want to volunteer, and of course it plays a vital role in facilitating how to volunteer.</p><p>However, that is only part of the story, because volunteering involves a symbiotic relationship&#8212;it is an exchange. It brings benefits not only to the recipient but to the volunteer. Indeed, among the reasons the volunteer Scotland website lists for why people should volunteer is because it feels good and because there will be</p><p>&#8220;No More Billy/Mary Nae Mates&#8221;.</p><p>However, there are other benefits for the volunteer. Volunteering can be a very social activity and can help people to make new contacts and meet new friends. It can provide new skills and experience. According to the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire, just over 50 per cent of the people who go to volunteer centres are on jobseekers allowance or incapacity benefit. Volunteering is a recognised pathway to personal development, learning and employment. Importantly, it can be immensely satisfying and hugely enjoyable.</p><p>On my visit to the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire I was particularly interested to hear about the specific projects that it runs. Two in particular stood out for me: the befriending service, which for me represents the essence of what a volunteer&#8217;s presence can do; and the volunteer champions project, which endeavours to promote and encourage volunteering among our youngsters.</p><p>The befriending service was first introduced by the centre more than 11 years ago. Befriending is a supported relationship between two people. It is usually face to face but it can be by telephone, letter or e-mail. The service pairs a volunteer with an isolated adult, and there have been approximately 300 successful matches. The befriending relationship is initiated, supported and monitored by volunteer centre befriending service staff. The project aims to make a difference to the quality of life of people who experience social isolation due to ageing, disability or other changes in their circumstances. It provides a vital source of friendship, assistance and company. How marvellous and, like so many good things, how simple.</p><p>The volunteer champions youth volunteering project was developed by the volunteer centre in partnership with Turnbull high school in Bishopbriggs. Volunteer champions receive training from the centre so that they can promote a volunteering culture in their school and local community. In phase 1, the centre recruited 16 volunteer champions, who successfully completed their training in Turnbull high school and went on to promote volunteering and volunteering awards within the school environment. A volunteering hub is now being established in the school to assist the promotion of volunteering. The champions are fully involved in the project&#8217;s development and are encouraged to take ownership of the programme. I think that that is fantastic.</p><p>The champions learn many new skills. They learn how to produce confident and motivating presentations, set up a volunteer stand at public events, work better in a team, overcome nerves and extend their knowledge of volunteering. When I visited I was delighted to meet Luisa, who runs the volunteer champions project. I also met Rachel, a volunteer champion and former Turnbull high school pupil. Both girls have clearly benefited from being involved with volunteering from a young age and both are a credit to the centre and to themselves. All those young people are a superbly positive advertisement for their local area.</p><p>What, then, is the positive message from the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire? First, although we are often told in the media that community spirit is dead and that everyone is busy or out for themselves, I can tell members that community spirit is in fact very much alive and kicking in East Dunbartonshire and Scotland. It was also clear to me that volunteering is cool. Our youngsters want that opportunity.</p><p>I congratulate the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire and its dedicated staff on the tremendous success of what they do and thank them for being such an inspiration to everyone else. I am glad that Parliament has been able to show support for their efforts this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658329", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that my motion on the Volunteer Centre East Dunbartonshire has been selected for members&#8217; business this evening.

It is clear that we all agree that the Commonwealth games represent an exciting opportunity.

The excitement was palpable&#8212;I think that I might even have kissed Nicola Sturgeon.</p><p>The whole venture is surrounded by high hopes and good will. Glasgow wants it to be a success; we want it to be a success; and Scotland wants it to be a success. Of course, as members have indicated, we want Scotland to benefit from the Olympic games as well. However, if we are to translate the good intentions and aspirations into reality, there must be robust, objective and, if necessary, critical assessment of progress. The 2009 report &#8220;On your marks ... Get set ... Go: A games legacy for Scotland&#8221; laid out a positive set of objectives for the Commonwealth games. I will concentrate on two of the areas that were covered: young people and the economy.</p><p>I might look an improbable candidate to take part in a debate about sport in general and the Commonwealth games in particular, but I have had my moments&#8212;at least, I vaguely recall that I have had my moments. When I was active in sport, two things were important: a structure by which I could engage in sport and role models to encourage me. I am delighted by the desire to ensure that, by 2022, 80 per cent of children meet the recommended level of physical activity that is set out in the national activity strategy. That is great, but how will it actually happen?</p><p>When I was at Greenock academy, which was a state secondary school, we had something called games every week and interschool matches every Saturday. There was hockey for the girls and&#8212;yes, Mr Wheelhouse&#8212;rugby for the boys. In the summer term, we had tennis, athletics and cricket. That led me from the age of 12 into a life in which sport was a regular component. Competing was fun and winning was a bonus, although a somewhat infrequent one. That activity continued at university and beyond and it certainly had benefits for me way beyond the actual sport. Neil Bibby referred to that aspect.</p><p>The role models were not just Wimbledon tennis champions and ace athletes; they were the dedicated and passionate physical education teachers who turned out in all weathers to instruct, train and inspire. Only in adulthood did I really appreciate how much I owed them. They were supported by other teaching colleagues whose commitment to their pupils extended to assisting with umpiring, refereeing and bus duties for away games.</p><p>Can we really say that such or even similar opportunities exist for youngsters at secondary school today? They might do in the private sector, and those pupils and schools are very lucky, but what about the state sector, particularly when recreational areas and open spaces are disappearing at an alarming rate? Those reservations about what exactly is available to school pupils are shared by the Scottish sports alliance. The Scottish health, household and recreation surveys have indicated that there has been no significant impact on the average level of physical activity among Scots.</p><p>A British Medical Journal report in 2010 showed a mixed picture on the legacy of large sporting events. My friend Nanette Milne urged caution in how we view the legacy. If we want to deliver a worthy legacy for our young people, the Scottish Government must commission an audit now of how, where, when and by whom that legacy will be delivered. It is not just about a fitter future for our young people, although that is important, but about identifying Scottish sporting talent for the future, which is too precious an issue to leave to speculation and good intention. I hope that the Scottish Government will respond positively to that suggestion. The Government should also be prepared to report on progress to the Parliament. Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s sensible amendment makes that point, and we will support it.</p><p>Economic benefits have featured as an identifiable legacy. As many members have said, not least John Mason, benefits are already visible for Glasgow, which is hugely important. We can anticipate direct spend in the Glasgow and Scottish economies from spectators and visitors but, again, anticipation and expectation are not enough and there are health warnings hovering around. The British Medical Journal report confirmed that an increase in tourist numbers cannot be taken as a given. During the games in Lillehammer, Seoul, Barcelona and Atlanta, tourist numbers increased, but that did not happen during the games in Manchester and Calgary, and Sydney showed mixed results.</p><p>If we want to translate economic potential into reality, we need robust activity to measure what is happening on the ground. I ask the Scottish Government to liaise regularly with Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry Scotland to get accurate feedback from businesses on whether progress is actually being made or is just fondly imagined. Again, I expect the Scottish Government to report back to the Parliament on what those organisations find.</p><p>The debate has been informed, interesting and constructive, as Bob Doris said. I hope that the Scottish Government will respond in a similar vein. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657777", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Delivery and Legacy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to take part in this positive debate.

The debate is an important annual reminder of events, behaviour and attitudes that are completely unacceptable. We have all welcomed the emphasis on focusing on prevention as a means to an end.</p><p>As Jackie Baillie said, it is a positive feature of the Parliament that since its inception we have frequently debated these issues in a constructive manner. I remember speaking in a debate in 2003 in support of the then national strategy to address domestic abuse in Scotland and another national strategy to prevent domestic abuse. At the same time, we celebrated the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001. Since then, devolved Governments have brought forward a variety of measures, initiatives and legislation to address the challenge, endeavouring to improve the situation for victims and potential victims.</p><p>As the minister said, the Scottish Government has taken a proactive approach, which has included raising public awareness through media campaigns and increasing support for courts in Scotland by drawing on the experience of the domestic abuse court in Glasgow. I echo Johann Lamont&#8217;s positive comment about the domestic abuse court in Glasgow and I have a suggestion for the minister. Why do not we consider having a floating expert sheriff in domestic abuse, who would go to the court that has the problem, rather than use a more rigid structure and try to create a court in the location?</p><p>As others have done, I applaud the tireless and outstanding work carried out by Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid and the other organisations that, together, have been such powerful influencers and effective advocates for those who live in the dark shadow of abuse.</p><p>All these activities and achievements suggest that positive progress is being made and that something that has stained and diminished Scotland is being tackled head-on and might be receding. However, the debate has highlighted that the unacceptable attitudes and bullying behaviour towards women of so many men&#8212;conduct that we find repugnant and unacceptable&#8212;are still out there, as Anne McTaggart and Dennis Robertson ably described. That is why we must never cease to investigate and challenge such behaviour and to intervene to support abused, fragile and frightened women. They need the reassurance that they are not alone, that they are not forgotten and, perhaps most important, that they are not in the wrong.</p><p>When I looked back to 2003, I was struck by the figures. Recorded incidents of domestic abuse against women in 2002-03 totalled just over 32,000. Although the 2009-10 figure represents a welcome decrease from the preceding year, let there be no complacency. The stark fact is that since 2000-01 there has been a 33 per cent increase in the number of female victims of domestic abuse.</p><p>On the positive side, I am clear that prevention and early intervention are the way to go. However, we have to be vigilant in monitoring current strategies and initiatives. Some approaches work and some do not.</p><p>The official data discloses a repeat pattern of abuse. That is obvious from some of the recent data. We have to be clear about whether we are putting the necessary emphasis on the first report of an incident, because if we are not, a repeat pattern of abuse is likely to emerge. We also know from the Scottish crime and justice survey 2009-10 that more than six out of 10 of those who had experienced partner abuse in the previous 12 months had told at least one person or organisation about that most recent incident. Given that we know of the tendency towards repeat patterns of behaviour, are we sure that we are highlighting to victims and to their friends, their relatives or whoever they have confided in that intervention could achieve prevention? It is better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>I conclude with two observations. First, as David McLetchie ably and extensively described, despite our best efforts to focus on intervention and prevention, some perpetrators will end up in the criminal justice system. I say to the minister that it is essential that judges have the option of custodial disposals available to them. I hope that the Scottish Government will rigorously track what is happening to ensure that no judge is being denied that option.</p><p>Secondly, the statistics confirm that too many men still behave towards women in a disgraceful, inexcusable and utterly unacceptable manner. As Jackie Baillie said, it is a societal issue&#8212;Marco Biagi eloquently referred to that aspect. The debate sends out a message to those men that Scotland is on their case. They must stop this behaviour. They will not win. They will eventually be found out, shamed and dealt with.

When the Scottish National Party made clear its ideological opposition to the generation of nuclear energy in Scotland&#8212;I do not agree with it, but it is perfectly entitled to do that&#8212;there flew from that policy certain inevitable conclusions. One conclusion is that, if we exclude that component of energy provision in Scotland, we will have to have a renewed emphasis and focus on other forms of energy generation. It is clear that one form that has emerged is the contribution that is to be made by the generation of energy from wind turbines.</p><p>The main point that I desire to make to the minister this evening is a broad one, and there have been echoes of it in the many excellent speeches this evening. The logical conclusion of what has happened over the past four and a half years under the policy that has been driven by the Scottish Government is that we now have a strategic energy policy that undoubtedly depends on a contribution from wind turbines. It is a policy that is pursued with vigour by ministers, the very consequence of which is to subject our planning system to what is now manifestly intolerable strain.</p><p>I am aware from my own West Scotland region, not least with communities such as Uplawmoor, that there are communities and individuals throughout Scotland who feel marginalised, ignored and irrelevant and who have absolutely no confidence in the planning system. That is not only intolerable; it is utterly wrong.</p><p>I will adhere to brevity, Presiding Officer. My message to the minister is simple: the Government should review its energy policy and current planning law and procedure because the public in Scotland are ill served by both, and the current position is unsustainable and ludicrous. It is within the control and the power of the Scottish Government to take corrective action now, and there are communities throughout Scotland&#8212;as is manifest from the number of members of the public who are here tonight&#8212;that are calling on the Scottish Government to sort out the issue and to do so soon.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656502", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wind Farms (Impact on Communities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Mr Findlay for the motion.

[Laughter.] Reform of our public services is unavoidable. That is why it is perplexing to see that the Beveridge report, which is one of the most important contributions to the debate, is now more than a year old and gathering dust on the Scottish Government&#8217;s shelves. That independent report into our public finances set out some solid ideas, but what was Alex Salmond&#8217;s response? It was to set up another review, the Christie commission. Such was the success of that little endeavour that we now have a new Cabinet sub-committee considering the Christie report and kicking things around a bit more.</p><p>In the First Minister&#8217;s statement, there were just four paragraphs on public service reform and not one specific proposal. He is all talk and no action. It is a bit like the SNP&#8217;s plans for an independence referendum&#8212;there is no date, no question and, it would seem, no idea of what independence means any more.</p><p>The summer offered Alex Salmond an opportunity to reflect, innovate and reform, but instead it was one long whinge&#8212;one long rant from him about what everyone else is getting wrong. People are getting fed up with that diet of negativity and gripe. The SNP is relentlessly hostile to anyone who dares to speak out against it, question its version of reality or challenge its proposals.</p><p>The Confederation of British Industry Scotland is right to ask when the referendum will be and to point out that the fudge on offer from Alex Salmond is harmful to Scotland. What does it get in reply? Vitriol and bullying. Instead of answers to reasonable questions about precisely when the referendum will be and what the question will be, all that we get is a defiant, blustering and evasive response about some vague day in a few years&#8217; time from a party that has already spent vast sums of taxpayers&#8217; money drafting a bill.</p><p>The SNP looks even more ridiculous when it comes to pinning the party down on what independence would mean for our currency, our armed forces, our defence jobs, the Scottish national deficit, social services and all the other essential aspects of a 21st century country. The SNP is always quick to complain about the powers that it does not have, but it is struck dumb when it comes to providing answers about what it would do and how it would pay for it. Only today, a series of legitimate questions to Mr Swinney from the UK Treasury about the devolved corporation tax was dismissed as &#8220;predictable&#8221; and &#8220;depressing&#8221;. If the questions were so predictable, why did the SNP not anticipate them and formulate the answers?</p><p>The SNP&#8217;s true colours are on show. It cannot deal with informed comment and criticism. Its total response is hectoring and bullying bluster, which says everything that we need to know about the party. [Interruption.] Mr Lochhead is getting exercised, which is a rarity.</p><p>What is more, I know what the next three or four years will bring: Alex Salmond will grind on and on, day after weary day, about the powers that he does not have. I can hear him now saying, &#8220;If only I had the powers to do this or that!&#8221; I say to him that today&#8217;s poll in The Times could not be clearer: Scotland says that he should get on with his independence referendum and get it out the road.</p><p>If the First Minister will not or cannot answer detailed questions on what independence means, will he start concentrating on using the powers that he has? There are measures in the legislative programme that we can support, others that we cannot and some that will need amendment. My colleagues will deal with them in greater detail, but I will highlight a couple.</p><p>First, the Government was right to acknowledge the problem of sectarianism and contemplate legislation but wrong to try to rush that legislation through. It was sensible to pause, reflect and consult. Therefore, let us ensure that the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill actually addresses the evil of sectarianism and contributes to its eradication.</p><p>Secondly, on the reform of our police forces, the Scottish Conservatives have accepted that there are compelling arguments for having fewer forces in Scotland. However, public accountability is paramount. We favour directly elected commissioners throughout Scotland. The Scottish Government&#8217;s reform of policing cannot concentrate power in the hands of one minister and one police chief without the public protection of democratic accountability, and I hope that the First Minister will listen to us on that.</p><p>I will also put down some markers about the big challenges that face our country and people&#8212;challenges that transcend constitutional issues or party politics. Three years ago, I gave a speech that, in light of recent developments, has renewed resonance. I spoke about how a new insidious and corrosive threat was emerging from the shadows. The threat to which I referred was not like drugs abuse or excessive alcohol consumption. It arose not out of something that people do but out of something that they do not do. I am talking about parenting skills or, sadly and in far too many cases, the complete lack of them. Too many parents do not or cannot extend to their children the parenting skills that are so essential if young people are to have any hope of growing up with guidance, support and boundaries. Why do they not extend those skills? Because, sadly, they were the children of parents who did not possess such skills. Disturbingly, we might now be moving into the third generation of that parental void.</p><p>Just look around our society and ask our teachers&#8212;the depressing evidence is all too obvious. Indeed, the 2010-11 report from the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration noted that the number of children who were referred on the ground of lack of parental care was more than 13,000. That is a reduction from previous years, but we all realise that that number is deeply disturbing. It is not some abstract bit of statistical data. We are talking about young lives being ruined and 13,000 children living in a desperate situation, and those are just the ones we know about. Those children are our nation&#8217;s future and the parents of the future. I welcome the First Minister&#8217;s intention to address the issue, but only time will tell whether legislation is what we need. We certainly need a long-term strategy to deal with this new problem. We cannot just cobble together solutions to deal with individual problems as they arise. We cannot hope that the overall problem will solve itself, because it will not.</p><p>I will not stand by silent on the issue. I am prepared to ask tough questions. I accept that there is no simple solution, because the causes might be complex, arising from deep-rooted reasons, but we need to take a fresh look at the issue and find a new way. We cannot keep passing the buck to hard-pressed social workers or teachers, who are already under immense pressure.</p><p>Our voluntary and charitable sector has a tremendous amount of expertise and skills, so how do we harness that? I will return to that point in the months ahead.</p><p>That point also takes me to my next issue, which is drugs abuse. I am proud of my party&#8217;s role in forging the national drugs strategy, &#8220;The Road to Recovery: A New Approach to Tackling Scotland&#8217;s Drug Problem&#8221;. That was one of the Scottish Conservative conditions for agreeing to the 2008 Scottish budget. However, three years on, I am angry. Why? David Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, claims:</p><p>&#8220;if you look at the rate of drug-related deaths compared to the overall population, Scottish people are seven times more likely to die from a drug-related death than their European counterparts.&#8221;</p><p>That is not the road to recovery. In June, we learned from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that Scotland tops the world league for cocaine consumption. That is not the road to recovery. Methadone, a state-prescribed opiate, still contributes to one third of drug-related deaths in Scotland. That is not the road to recovery.</p><p>Clearly, more needs to be done to turn a good and well-intentioned strategy into results on the ground, so I put down this marker. I fought long and hard for a new strategy that would be based on recovery leading to abstinence. In the months and years to come, I will redouble my efforts to turn that aspiration into a reality. A glossy strategy is one thing, but success will come only when those who work in the drugs field get on board. It is time to forge a new political will to make that happen, because the benefits will be incalculable.</p><p>The legislative programme might deal with some of the immediate issues that are facing Scotland, but other deep-seated challenges lie way beyond the scope of one year of lawmaking. The First Minister has the majority to railroad anything he wants through the Parliament, but I hope that he has the wisdom to realise that a majority does not make a flawed proposal good, and it does not make something that is wrong right.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you.

Many people share that positive assessment.</p><p>There is a difference between patriotism and nationalism. One can be a broad and widely shared sentiment of pride and cultural adherence; the other can run the risk of becoming narrow, restrictive and introspective. I want the best for my country, which, for me, means being Scottish and British and that we should work together for the good of us all. I know that not everyone agrees with that view. I respect their right to hold their view, but I do not share it. Our United Kingdom union is not broken but, like any other enduring institution, it needs to adapt and move with the times. That is why the Scotland Bill is the way ahead.</p><p>I remind the First Minister that implementing the Scotland Bill was a commitment of 53 of the 59 Scottish MPs elected to Scotland&#8217;s other Parliament last year.

It is about whether we want to be as we are or on our own; whether we want to be part of the British family or just a northern neighbour looking on; and whether we want to work together for the common good, sharing our assets and spreading our risks, or take the separation gamble. At its simplest, the union is about doing what families do best. It is about just being together and being comfortable and at ease with one another with the occasional squabble and difference of opinion, but knowing that we are stronger together. It is about the best of both worlds and being comfortable with who we are. I repeat: it is fantastic to be Scottish and great to be British, and I am proud to be both.</p><p>I accept that the First Minister won his argument about holding an independence vote in this session, but there are two big questions that he must now face up to. The public have called his bluff, and they must know from him the question that will be in, and the timing of, his referendum. The question must be fair. It cannot be open to challenge or ambiguous. It cannot be a referendum lite. It cannot merely ask for the right to negotiate; it must give the people a fundamental choice about whether they want Scotland to remain part of Britain or to be a separate state. It is one or the other.</p><p>Now that a vote is inevitable, the First Minister needs to explain his change of view on timing. If holding a referendum was the right thing to do last year when he had a minority of seats in the chamber, why does he now wish to delay a referendum by years when he has a majority of seats?</p><p>The Scotland that I want to take forward is one that has learned from the past and is comfortable with its present and optimistic about its future. Let us consider how we can take Scotland forward and create a fair society.</p><p>Now that it has been established that the First Minister does not, on his own admission, have a monopoly of wisdom&#8212;I think that we all suspected that&#8212;let me put that to the test. My party&#8217;s manifesto is packed full of good ideas that address Scotland&#8217;s real and pressing priorities using all our existing powers. There are policies to boost the economy and create jobs, reform our public services and take Scotland forward. Over the coming weeks and months, the Scottish Conservatives will continue to do what we have done over the past four years. We will find every means that we can to deliver common sense for Scotland. We will put our case debate by debate, committee by committee and argument by argument, and we will test every assertion that the SNP Government makes. We will provide the opposition that is needed and the alternative voice that is required, and we will carry on telling it like it is, however much the SNP does not want to hear that. When the uncomfortable truth needs telling, we will tell it, and when there is a better way to do things, we will be its advocate.</p><p>I recognise that politics, especially when we are facing a Government with a majority, is the art of the possible and not chasing unrealisable dreams. During the debate, my colleagues will set out in more detail the policies that should be considered, but let me paint a picture of what the Scottish Government should be doing and could reasonably be expected to do.</p><p>On the economy, creating jobs and boosting economic growth are rightly the number 1 priorities that underpin everything that we strive to do. There is no question but that the jobs of the future will come from the private sector. So, although we must protect our vital public services, if we are to create more prospects, opportunity, jobs and wealth for all of us, we must grow the private sector. I want an entrepreneurial, dynamic and thriving Scotland&#8212;a Scotland that backs small businesses and provides a framework for them to succeed and prosper. Let those be the watchwords of the new Parliament.</p><p>On our public services, we now have a minister with a specific brief for public sector reform. However, that must be more than an elongated name on a business card; it must lead to real and meaningful change and it has to mean the end to the &#8220;aye been&#8221; mentality&#8212;the attitude that, &#8220;This is how it is, because that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve always done it.&#8221; We have to break that status quo. We must embrace all the talents of Scotland, including its third sector and, yes, its private sector, and accept the simple premise that someone does not have to be a public servant to provide a public service. We must have a Scotland of all the talents, with a fairer and bigger society.</p><p>I turn to three specific areas in which I believe progress is possible and more can be done, and on which I hope there is common ground. The first is health visitors, who are the vital point of contact with parents and young families in the community and in homes. They speak to mum and dad and give reassurance, help and advice.

The bill will set the direction of the Parliament for the rest of the decade and beyond. It is not a tweak and tinker. It is not merely an MOT. It is a road map for our future. It is the direction of travel that is wanted by the great majority of people in Scotland, and wanted overwhelmingly by the Parliament. It is no coincidence that, as the three unionist parties have come together to make devolution work better, support for independence has hit an historic low. Let us be very clear: we have settled the constitutional question, and devolution has won. I am a proud Scot and a committed unionist. The proposed legislation and transfer of powers will not only benefit Scotland, but strengthen the <place-holder colnum=\"31364\"/> union. The bill and the report that preceded it were conceived by Scots, for Scots and for the strength of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It is no mean feat to have brought together the three main UK parties.

Time after time, it was given the opportunity to participate, contribute and debate the proposals. At all stages, the invitation to get involved and to shape the future was extended in good faith but, at all stages, it was rebuffed. The SNP is outside the political main stream. It resented the fact that the Calman commission was the will of the Scottish Parliament. It cried foul when the bill was published, and although it could align itself today with the Parliament and Scotland, it has indicated clearly that it will not.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Having listened to the First Minister, there must be very few people who are thinking with any confidence that they would have welcomed an independent Scotland in the past two years.

Both are lost in the ideological and dogmatic fights of the past, when Scotland has actually moved on.</p><p>To address the First Minister&#8217;s intervention, I hope that Alex Salmond continues to fight on that ground during the Scottish parliamentary election, as it will be a fitting political epitaph that says, &#8220;Here lies one who didn&#8217;t like the answer to his national conversation. It was no&#8212;N, O.&#8221; The Scotland Bill heralds a new era. From now on, the debate will not be about the powers that Scotland has; instead, it will be about how those powers are used. Let us consider what those powers involve. There will be real fiscal accountability. The Parliament will have to think about how it raises money, not just how it spends it. That is a crucial discipline, the absence of which has weakened political responsibility and <place-holder colnum=\"31365\"/> accountability. The Parliament will now have a real financial stake in the success of the Scottish economy.</p><p>Those powers offer a huge opportunity for the Scottish Conservatives. We are the party that froze council tax bills&#8212;cutting them in real terms&#8212;and reduced small business rates. Now we have the opportunity to argue for tax competition within the UK, to encourage and reward the Scottish entrepreneurial spirit that will return this country to prosperity. We have an opportunity to grow our private sector and rebalance our economy.</p><p>There has been a wide debate over many years with diverse ideas feeding into each party&#8217;s discussion and into the Calman submissions. There are those who worry about devolution and have no desire to move it out of the current limbo, but it is that very atrophy that is dangerous to the union. So, too, there are those who argue that full fiscal autonomy is the only way forward but, after years of scrutiny and evidence, the broad consensus across the parties, the Parliament and the country is that the bill is the way forward.</p><p>David Cameron and the coalition Government pledged to act on Calman and they have delivered. I support the proposed legislation. However, because of its importance, scope and impact, it must be scrutinised in detail in committee. That is entirely right. We must find the best way of implementing the financial provisions. We must properly examine the proposed new powers for the Parliament and for individual ministers both here and at Westminster. Those are the practical issues that must be looked at. </p><p>For today, the questions are simple. Do we, as a Parliament, want to move ahead following the road map that was set out by the Calman commission and which is now in the Scotland Bill? In doing so, do we want to strengthen devolution and safeguard the union? Do we want to embrace greater tax responsibilities so that fiscal responsibility goes along with spending power? My answer&#8212;but, much more important, Scotland&#8217;s answer&#8212;is a resounding yes. Over the past three years, the cross-party, cross-border initiative that created the Calman commission led to this bill. The three unionist parties north and south of the border worked hard to get to this point. Why? So that we could look beyond party politics, set aside our differences and work for the future benefit of Scotland. Even now, it is not too late for the SNP to put its partisan tub thumping behind it and join us in supporting the principles of the Scotland Bill. I am proud to support the bill. It will strengthen the union. It will make devolution work better. It responds to the wishes of the Scottish people. If used properly, it will allow us to make Scotland a more dynamic and prosperous place.

I say at the outset that the Scottish Conservatives, alongside our colleagues in the United Kingdom Government, have long been supporters of clean-coal technology. We support the Scottish Government's stated aim of Scotland becoming the European leader in carbon capture and storage. To that end, we welcome the CCS road map that the Government has produced jointly with Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>Turning to the motion, I note the deeply worrying figures that Mr Finnie cites on the levels of carbon dioxide that would remain unabated under the Hunterston proposal. However, rather like Mr Gibson, I would not wish to go as far as Mr Finnie does in seeking to restrict carbon capture solely to existing installations. That seems to be inflexible, although I accept that Mr Finnie raises real concerns about how we assess implementation of the technology.</p><p>The fact remains that, as with all new energy infrastructure, whether it be wind turbines, hydro schemes or&#8212;as we are debating&#8212;a brand new power station, it is essential that it be the right scheme in the right place. Mr Gibson raised legitimate questions about that. I am certainly aware, as he is, that local concern remains current and the community is worried. Having examined the details of the Hunterston proposal and the passionately expressed concerns of local residents, not to mention the issues that are highlighted in the motion, the Scottish Conservatives are not fully convinced that the site in question is an appropriate location on which to construct such an installation.</p><p>As someone who lives near the Clyde and who, like Mr Finnie, went to school in Greenock, I know the Clyde coast well. The proposed development is in an area of exceptional beauty that is rich in biodiversity and popular with tourists. We must therefore subject any such proposal to the highest levels of scrutiny. I am concerned by the representations of bodies such as RSPB Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, which have real concerns that the proposal could destroy a substantial part of the Portencross SSSI, which they say has the best remaining intertidal mud and sandflats on the outer Clyde and which are important feeding grounds for a huge range of waterfowl and waders.</p><p>The comments that were made earlier about the attitude of Scottish Natural Heritage legitimately give rise to concern. We must be in the business <place-holder colnum=\"28579\"/> of sustainable development and of considering proposal and consequence. It is difficult to justify development on the proposed scale on such a sensitive site if we are serious about fulfilling our obligations to preserve and enhance the rich diversity of our coastal locations and to respect the concept of a sustainable environment.</p><p>I note that the proposal entails an air emission stack of some 500ft in height. There is no doubt that that would be a disruptive and detrimental visual intrusion and that it would impact negatively on the landscape. Profound concerns have been expressed to me by local people about the road infrastructure in the area, which they feel is unsuited to dealing with the inevitable increase in heavy transportation that the project would entail. Rail transport also seems to be at maximum capacity. Concerns have also been raised with me about health, and the data to which Mr Finnie referred do nothing to assuage those.</p><p>I conclude with a word about the future energy development that my party would like in the region. The Scottish Conservatives, along with every other party in Parliament, supported the world-leading emissions reduction targets that were agreed by the Parliament last year. It is our conviction that achieving those targets will be exceptionally challenging if, as has been said, nuclear capacity is not part of the mix. To that end, the Conservatives would like the continuation of nuclear generation at Hunterston, initially by extending the life of Hunterston B beyond its current estimated decommissioning date for as long as it is safe to do so, and ultimately by replacing it with a new nuclear facility.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20995742", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hunterston Power Station (Carbon Capture)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Ross Finnie on securing this important debate.

That old politics has boxed Scotland into a sterile corner while the rest of Britain&#8212;and indeed the world&#8212;has moved on.</p><p>The immense financial challenges that we face mean that tough choices have to be made. They mean that we must sort out the essential from the optional. They mean that we must challenge how Scotland is run and who does what. The \"it's aye been\" mentality might have worked once, but not any longer. We must find the political will to challenge the status quo and we must put people first. By putting people first, we will restore fairness, common sense and community to the fabric of Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"28260\"/></p><p>We are in difficult times. I will not dwell on how we got into this dreadful mess&#8212;on how Labour's debts and bank-busting deficits will cost our children and grandchildren dear. I care about how we will get out of the situation. That is why the few bright spots in the otherwise unrelieved gloom of broken promises and dogma from the SNP Government have come when the Conservatives have shown political leadership and delivered for Scotland.</p><p>Who ensured that our society was kept safe by delivering an extra 1,000 police officers on the streets? It was the Scottish Conservatives. Who, I would ask Mr Gray, ensured that thousands of small businesses could ride out the recession by insisting on business rates relief? The Scottish Conservatives. Who stepped in to stop the decline in our high streets by delivering a town centre regeneration fund? The Scottish Conservatives. Who protected council tax payers by sanctioning a freeze in their bills&#8212;not for one year, but for each of the past three years? The Scottish Conservatives. Who started a real debate on how services will be delivered in the future by establishing an independent budget review group? The Scottish Conservatives.</p><p>The First Minister may bask with his self-indulgent and complacent smile, but none of those achievements would have happened without the Scottish Conservatives. Those achievements show at least that Alex Salmond listens to me now and again. Perhaps he listened last year, too, when I told him that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"he should stop the smoke and mirrors and ... ditch\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-09-03.19216.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 3 September 2009; c 19217.]</citation></p><p>the independence bill. He has, but what humiliation. The promise that he made in 2007, which he has repeated through the past three years and which was to define him and his term in office&#8212;the raison d'&#234;tre of his party&#8212;has gone. It has been reduced to a self-proclaimed campaigning tool for the SNP.</p><p>How much has the unauthorised nationalist conversation cost us? How much ministerial time and effort, parliamentary resource and civil service manpower have been invested in that broken promise? With the independence bill now in the bin, I want the First Minister to promise that not one penny more of public money will be spent on his fantasy politics&#8212;on the separation of our country that we do not want and which he knows he cannot deliver. Will he give that promise now?</p><p>Scotland does not want a First Minister who whines about not having independence. We want a First Minister who has the courage, the foresight and the drive to take the difficult decisions to address the challenges that Scotland faces now. Edwin Morgan's \"nest of fearties\" is alive and well <place-holder colnum=\"28261\"/> on the Government benches. We want a First Minister who will stand up for the Scotland that we have, not fantasise about a Scotland that we do not even want. What we want from a First Minister is realism, vision, innovation and leadership.</p><p>The 10 bills are not without merit, but they do not represent a sea change for Scotland. The SNP's political prospectus is worthy rather than innovatory; it is track maintenance rather than forging a new direction of travel. A less charitable person might conclude that the Government wanted an easy life this term and that ministers were so busy trying to keep their jobs that they were forgetting to do their jobs.</p><p>My colleagues and I on the Conservative benches will do&#8212;as we always have done&#8212;what is right for Scotland. We have consistently contributed positively to the Parliament. We have backed bills that we thought would make ordinary Scots' lives better, amended ones that were flawed and opposed those that failed Scotland.</p><p>Scotland needs leadership, a new narrative and a new vision of how to take our country forward. Scotland does not need the SNP's narrow nationalism and dogma or Labour's unreconstructed statism.</p><p>The legislative programme contains little that is of controversy, which is exactly the problem: it is legislation heavy, innovation light. A safety-first First Minister is trying to secure Bute house for his SNP successor rather than secure a better future for Scotland. That is selling Scotland short. Scotland deserves better.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20976559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The statement that we heard from the First Minister this afternoon is not just the final legislative agenda from the Government, but the final nail in the coffin for Alex Salmond's political credibility.

I apologise for that, Presiding Officer. No discourtesy is intended to you or to members in the chamber, but I require to prepare for First Minister's questions. I hope that the chamber will understand that there is an irreconcilable conflict of interest.</p><p>This is the first Conservative business debate since the general election. I have waited 11 years to say this, but it is also the first Conservative business debate in the Parliament to take place with a Conservative Prime Minister at Westminster, leading a Liberal-Conservative Government. We have in David Cameron a Prime Minister who came to the Scottish Parliament before he even went to Westminster. We also have a new Government that is committed not just to respecting devolution but to strengthening it. In short, we have a new politics.</p><p>We have turned the page in Scottish politics. When the nationalist First Minister of Scotland is able to have a constructive dialogue with a Conservative and Unionist Prime Minister and a Liberal Democrat Secretary of State for Scotland, we see three parties looking to the future. Although Labour, ousted from Government, must adjust to the humbling experience of being in opposition, I hope that it will recognise the opportunities that are being created for Scotland in the United Kingdom and contribute positively to that process. Of course, that task is made more challenging by Labour's appalling legacy of debt, but no one can doubt the coalition Government's resolve to take the tough decisions that are needed to sort out Labour's mess.<place-holder colnum=\"26626\"/></p><p>However, enough about Labour, and enough about the past. Scotland can look forward to the future with confidence. Our new Government will do what the Labour Government failed to do&#8212;work together with the Scottish Government for the good of the people of Scotland. We will scrap Labour's jobs tax, because we want to keep Scots in work, not tax them out of work. We will scrap Labour's identity cards, because we believe that the state should protect our liberty, not erode our freedoms. We will strengthen the Parliament, because we believe in devolution and are determined to make it work better. We will build an agenda of mutual respect between Scotland's two Parliaments and Governments, because Scotland needs co-operation, not confrontation.</p><p>Of course, it takes two to tango. Everyone knows that the First Minister wants Scotland to separate from the rest of the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond knows full well that he and I will never agree on our ultimate constitutional destination. I will fight him every step of the way if he tries to separate Scotland from the rest of the UK. I take heart from the fact that, once again, the overwhelming majority of Scots chose parties that support the union over parties that support separation. Despite our differences on the constitution, nationalists and unionists can work together in Scotland's interest. Indeed, our differences on the constitution need not preclude us from working together on the constitution, where we can find common ground.</p><p>I was disappointed that the Scottish National Party did not participate in the work of the Calman commission, but that is in the past. I take at face value the Scottish Government's desire to work with the UK Government to take forward the Calman proposals for financial responsibility and hope that that constructive engagement will happen. Conservatives always argued that the Calman proposals were the platform for change. I appreciate that the new Government's proposal to raise substantially the income tax threshold will have an effect on the Calman proposals; that issue, and others, should be discussed. I am pleased that we have from the Scottish Government a degree of engagement that did not exist under the previous Labour Government.</p><p>Yesterday's announcement that the Calman steering group is to be reconvened, under the chairmanship of the new Secretary of State for Scotland, Danny Alexander, is more welcome evidence of the coalition Government's resolve to take Calman forward. The steering group was originally set up to look at the implementation of the Calman commission's recommendations and included representatives of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties at both Westminster and Holyrood. As a member of the group, I know that Labour and Liberal Democrat <place-holder colnum=\"26627\"/> representatives found it an effective and positive forum. However, I shall not support the Labour amendment in the name of Pauline McNeill, which suggests that we should just rush ahead, without proper scrutiny of the proposals, and omits all reference to the fossil fuel levy. That is indicative of a slight lack of grasp of the issues and of the new agenda of mutual respect.</p><p>The new dimension is that, following the constructive talks in Edinburgh between the Prime Minister and the First Minister, the Scotland Office will now have a dialogue with the Scottish Government on the Calman recommendations. As my colleague David Mundell, minister at the Scotland Office, said yesterday:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The implementation of Calman recommendations is very important to Scotland. We have shown a commitment to talking to the Scottish Government on how best to take this forward and it makes sense at this time for the Steering Group to continue to meet ensuring dialogue across and between all the main parties.\"</p><p>He added:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At this exciting time for Scotland it is important that everyone works together in the national interest and I look forward to discussions with politicians from all parties in Scotland in the coming weeks.\"</p><p>Once again, we have hard evidence of the new politics and the new coalition Government attitude to Scotland and the Scottish Government.</p><p>I have been heartened by the marked change in tone from the First Minister. From the bombast of the election campaign, we have seen Mr Salmond not only mellow but almost wax lyrical. He has talked with such warmth of the new Government that it must have been a matter of regret to him that he was not there in person on Tuesday to cheer the Queen's speech. When phrases such as \"impressive\", \"extremely positive\" and \"substantive\" trip off the first ministerial tongue, it is usually a sign that the First Minister is back to his favourite topic&#8212;himself. However, on this occasion, that is not the case&#8212;those words were his assessment of his meeting with the new Prime Minister. I welcome that change in tone.

Both Mr Scott and I would like to know whether there is any difficulty in facilitating such communication.</p><p>With a new approach of mutual respect, when disagreements arise, rather than rush to the nearest television studio to lambast the other side, we will have the opportunity to try to find common ground and, if that cannot be found, at least to understand why that is the case. There will be respect for the right of the Scottish Government and the UK Government to pursue their different agendas within the areas for which they are responsible.</p><p>A good example of the new politics is the fossil fuel levy, which has been raised as an issue by the Scottish Government on many occasions. Almost &#163;200 million from the proceeds of the levy in Scotland is held by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, yet currently if Scottish ministers ordered that the money be paid into the Scottish consolidated fund, the Treasury would reduce the block grant by the same amount. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how it would ever be in the interests of any Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"26629\"/> Government of any political persuasion to seek the release of that money. It is right and proper that the Treasury looks at the issue again, so I am delighted that George Osborne has ordered that to happen. Complex issues are involved, but the new UK Government has already taken a substantial step to listen to the legitimate concerns of the Scottish Government and to see what can be done to address them.</p><p>That is the respect agenda in practice, and it has taken a Liberal-Conservative Government to deliver it. Shamefully, Labour did not even try to build any relationship between our two Governments and our two Parliaments. Since leaving office, Labour has made it abundantly clear that it has a similar lack of respect for the intelligence of the public. Iain Gray has been happy to rant on in this chamber about \"cuts, cuts, cuts\" as if the spending squeeze had nothing to do with the out-going Labour Government, which was racking up debt at the rate of &#163;3 billion a week.</p><p>Thus, although there is much that is new in the new politics, there are clearly some things that do not change. For example, those who take over from a Labour Government always have to clean up the mess. Liam Byrne was not joking when he said there was no money left. The Treasury cupboard is indeed bare. Labour's recession was the longest and deepest since the second world war. Britain's deficit is the largest in the European Union. The Labour Government was spending one third more than it raised. It was addicted to out-of-control spending and to mortgaging our nation's future in an attempt to save its own political skin. Labour's waste and Labour's financial mess mean that tough times lie ahead, but our Liberal-Conservative Government will always ensure that we look after the most vulnerable in society and that the spending decisions that are taken, although tough, are fair.</p><p>Let us be honest: there will be difficult days ahead. Yes, there will be disagreements between the Scottish Government and the UK Government. Indeed, there may be disagreements between the two coalition partners. However, this new age of mutual respect and of constructive engagement lays the foundations for a new era of devolution and genuinely offers a fresh start and an exciting and different future for Scotland.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of HM Government to establish a positive and constructive working relationship with the Scottish Government and Parliament to tackle the problems facing the country and, in particular, welcomes the commitment in the Queen's Speech to introduce legislation to implement recommendations from the final report of the Commission on Scottish Devolution and the willingness to consider matters in relation to the Fossil Fuel Levy.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20811379", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Her Majesty's Government (Relations)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sure that serious regard will be had to the issue that Mr Doris raises.

We need a Government that is focused on economic recovery, not constitutional vandalism. We need a Government that is focused on reforming our public sector, not wrecking our political partnership. We need a Government that is focused on restoring Scotland's battered international reputation.</p><p>On the constitution, Alex Salmond is on the extremes of Scottish politics. Let me take something right on the chin: the Conservatives were on the extremes of the constitutional debate in the 1990s, when we opposed a Scottish Parliament. We are now well and truly back in the main stream once again. We are the party that understands devolution. We know that there needs to be a basis of mutual respect between Governments and Parliaments&#8212;something that the SNP and Labour do not understand. Alex Salmond is a lone voice representing a minority view, but his obsession with independence is harmful to the best interests of the people of Scotland.</p><p>My final point on this unnecessary and opportunistic piece of legislation is that Mr Salmond knows that he has no chance of getting the referendum bill through. As a result, he wants to fiddle it to tempt the Liberal Democrats to join <place-holder colnum=\"19217\"/> his team. He thinks that, by offering more powers as an option, he will split the unionist vote and come steaming through the middle to take his independence prize. My message to Mr Salmond is that he should stop the smoke and mirrors and just ditch the bill.</p><p>I turn to the real challenges. For some time now, I have been warning about the consequences of what Labour has done to this country through record levels of borrowing that will saddle future generations with massive debts. I have challenged the First Minister on how he will respond to Labour's &#163;500 million budget squeeze. Where will he take the tough decisions? What will he cut? I have yet to get an answer to that from the First Minister. In fact, we have had a silence that Gordon Brown would be proud of.</p><p>Gordon Brown's Government may well be in its death-throes, but Labour's debt&#8212;and the harsh impact that paying it back will have on devolved spending&#8212;will be with us for years. Tackling Labour's debt while protecting the public services that we all value will be the Scottish Government's main responsibility this year and next. It will also be the main responsibility of whoever is in government from 2011.</p><p>Only this morning economists from the University of Glasgow said that, because of Labour's recession, Scotland's budget will be cut by &#163;2.5 billion over the next four years. If this Salmond Government, rather than deal with that situation, chooses simply to ignore it or to make political capital out of it, Scotland will be in big trouble. Being First Minister is about more than just turning up to open everything in sight and pressing for independence. The First Minister has a job to do. From the evidence of his legislative programme, he is ducking that responsibility. Although Labour has created this mess, we must all play our part in getting out of it. That requires leadership from the Government, not parochial party posturing.</p><p>Where in the First Minister's statement are the signs of a Government that is willing to take the tough decisions that we need to reform public services to make them sustainable and affordable while we repay Labour's mountain of debt?

At first, the SNP claimed that the minister had to meet the Lockerbie bomber because Jack Straw's rules required him to do that. Then, the SNP said that they met because Mr Megrahi asked for a meeting. However, we now learn that Kenny MacAskill instigated the meeting, although under no obligation to do so. In my view, that personal engagement was acutely misjudged and profoundly naive. Again, the suspicion lingers of nods and winks and deals.</p><p>Despite his claims, Mr MacAskill has not published all the medical advice. It is quite clear that, as Dr Ian McKee indicated this morning, the SNP was given expert advice. If Mr MacAskill is in possession of that expert advice, it must be published. Further, on the BBC's radio programme \"Good Morning Scotland\" today, Nicola Sturgeon said that all the medical evidence that Mr MacAskill saw has been published. Where is it?</p><p>The medical officer's report to Mr MacAskill says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we attach relevant medical reports in a sealed envelope\".</p><p>Where are those reports? Where is that expert <place-holder colnum=\"19081\"/> advice? Why has it not been published? Dr Richard Simpson was absolutely right to raise those issues. They are germane to this matter and, so far, there is a huge silence surrounding the import of that medical advice.</p><p>Alternatively, is it the case that, as the medical officer also says, no expert is willing to give a prognosis of three months? Once again, the suspicion lingers that this was not a decision that was based on facts, but that facts were found to fit the decision that had already been taken and had already been signalled to the Libyans.</p><p>I think that Gordon Brown and Alex Salmond have been engaged in nudge-and-wink diplomacy and that the SNP Government made the wrong decision. It is important that the Scottish Parliament has an opportunity today to express the Parliament's view. As I said last week when I responded to Mr MacAskill's statement, I do not consider that the decision that he made was a decision in the name of Scotland or this Parliament, and it was not a decision that was in my name.

That said, I will not reject out of hand proposals over which the commission&#8212;whose remit was endorsed overwhelmingly by this Parliament&#8212;spent months deliberating. In our 2007 manifesto, the Conservatives acknowledged the need for a debate on devolution powers and funding. I repeat what I said earlier: I want our response to the Calman recommendations to be right, not rushed. Whatever we do to the devolved settlement must be built to last; it must be a secure legacy from this generation of MSPs to future generations of Scots.</p><p>I am a committed unionist. I will do nothing to put at risk a partnership that has served our nation well for centuries. That is the agenda of another party. However, as we recognised in 2007, when we voted to establish the commission, devolution was at a crossroads. At that time, we asked a simple question: is the current arrangement incapable of improvement? I believe the answer to that question was no. For instance, I believe that devolution has been done a disservice by the lack of mutual respect between Governments and Parliaments. We need to see a vast improvement in that area.</p><p>The answer that flows from the simple question \"Can things be improved?\" is fundamental for those of us who are unionists. Is the best way of securing Scotland's continued place in the United Kingdom to reject all change? I am clear that the answer to that is no. Rejecting any and all change would be to play into the hands of the separatists and to stoke the fires of resentment that the SNP Government has been busy igniting over the past two years.</p><p>Given my strong and unwavering commitment to the union, let me make it clear that supporting the creation of the commission was not a decision that I entered into lightly. I believed it to be&#8212;I still believe it to be&#8212;the best way of progressing the unfinished business of building a stable devolved settlement that will secure Scotland's place in the union As the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> noted on the Calman report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The timid will warn that this could weaken the Union, but why should it? Separatist tendencies are more likely to flourish if Scotland continues to have a client relationship with Whitehall\".</p><p>Commitment to the union is not measured by hostility to devolution any more than Scottishness is measured by support for separation. I am British and Scottish and proud to be both. An <place-holder colnum=\"18846\"/> overwhelming majority of people inside and outside the Parliament believe in devolution, not separation. We do so because we believe it to be in Scotland's best interests that we remain part of a greater whole, and because we believe that Scotland's distinct needs and desires can be accommodated within a union that has evolved over centuries, at the core of which is a recognition that we have much to gain in working together.</p><p>Supporting the unionist motion tonight will be a sign of self-confidence, not a sign of weakness, on the part of the unionist parties. It will be a signal that we have the courage to consider change and that far from wanting to weaken the union, we share a common aspiration to strengthen it. I remind the Parliament of the central remit of the Calman commission, which is to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.\"</p><p>That is the acid test that will underpin all the deliberations of my party.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19979498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commission on Scottish Devolution (Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I have made clear in my remarks to date, the process upon which we are embarking, post publication of the report, is hugely   significant and must not be rushed.

It has always been possible for all the other parties in the Scottish Parliament to combine to defeat the party of Government at the United Kingdom level. However, that has never happened in a vote on a motion of this kind. Today's vote, if carried, will be a parliamentary first. We have not lodged our motion lightly. A unique combination of factors makes it right that we demand a UK general election. We are in the final year of the current Westminster Parliament. Even Gordon Brown cannot avoid calling an election in the next 12 months, unless he ceases to be Prime Minister. The question is not whether we have a general election in the next 12 months, but when. Let no one pretend that there is any principled objection to holding a general election now.</p><p>The expenses scandals at Westminster have caused grave damage to trust in politics in general. All parties at Westminster&#8212;Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party&#8212;have had serious questions to answer. The issues may be particular <place-holder colnum=\"18260\"/> to the Westminster system of expenses, and the transparency with which we operate in this Parliament may stand in contrast to the shroud of secrecy that surrounds the House of Commons, but let us not pretend that the public considers the Scottish Parliament beyond reproach. Last week's elections show us that much if we did not already know it.</p><p>We are, sadly, all tainted by what has happened at Westminster&#8212;deservedly or not&#8212;so we have a legitimate and fair question to ask: how do we restore faith in politics? Yes, there must be transparency and changes to the rules, but until there is a general election and the opportunity for the people to have their say, the stench will remain. There is currently a wave of cynicism&#8212;not just a lack of faith in individual politicians or even in the political system, but a more fundamental and damaging view that politics can never deliver change. That is corrosive and strikes at the heart of democracy. That cynicism or scepticism must be dispelled.</p><p>Why do the public doubt the motives of politicians of every party more now than in the past? Why has there been such a breakdown of trust in the capacity of politics to deliver? Yes, in large part it is a reaction to the expenses scandal, but there is much more to it than that. We have grown used to a Government that routinely says one thing and does another. That is a lesson that the SNP Scottish Government must heed. We have become accustomed to a hatchet job being done on anyone who dares to speak out or question what the Prime Minister says or does. When Government ministers speak openly of smears against colleagues, what message does that send to the public?</p><p>Moreover, what signal does it send when the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the subject of briefings by number 10 and is hung out to dry in public? He is clearly the Prime Minister's second choice, yet he remains in office not because the Prime Minister wants him there but because the Prime Minister lacks the authority to move him. That sends an atrocious signal to the financial markets, investors and the international community. It sends an even worse signal to the public. If the Prime Minister has no confidence in the chancellor, why should anyone else?</p><p>Until there is a general election, a cloud will hang over politics. I shall, of course, campaign for the return of a Conservative Government at the next general election. I hope and expect that David Cameron will prevail. Others will argue for different outcomes. However, the fact remains that, at present, we have a weak and pitiful excuse for a Government that is not worthy of the name.</p><p>Unlikely as it seems, it is possible that Labour could win a general election. Let us consider that <place-holder colnum=\"18261\"/> ghastly prospect&#8212;one party should certainly consider it. How can any Labour member seriously argue that their Government and Prime Minister would not have greater credibility and more authority if they had the mandate of a general election victory? Would any member really claim that the Government is better able now, in the current horrendous mess, to take tough but necessary decisions than it would be following an election victory? In short, would the party be better able to govern if it won that election? Of course it would. There is only one reason why Labour members are against a general election: they expect to lose it, as the Prime Minister admitted at question time some weeks back.</p><p>Government is a privilege, not a right. It requires the national interest to be put ahead of party interest, but it is clear that such a concept is alien to the Labour Party and to Gordon Brown. As Scotland languishes in what is expected to be the worst recession since the second world war, members of the UK Government are more concerned about briefing against each other and clinging to office than about taking the right decisions for our future.</p><p>The right decisions involve not only sorting out the appalling mess that Labour has made of the public finances, although that challenge will dwarf all others, and will have direct and lasting consequences for this Parliament and Scottish Governments for years to come.

I recall that, on that occasion, Ms Alexander said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I begin by congratulating Annabel Goldie. In fact, I might go as far as to say that I did not disagree with a word that <place-holder colnum=\"12476\"/> she said. This may be the only time for a number of years that I can make that statement\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2005-09-07.19015.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 7 September 2005; c 19005.]</citation></p><p>I can do no better than quote her words back to her, and say that I entirely agree with her contribution.</p><p>As Wendy Alexander said all those years ago, when that embryonic thought emerged in the mind of some musical people in Paisley, it was regarded as a pretty brave aspiration and ambition. I recall&#8212;as I mentioned in the previous debate on the subject&#8212;going to a concert in Paisley one fairly wet Friday evening, at which the suggestion for the event emerged. The venture is, as Wendy Alexander said, greatly to the credit of the organisers&#8212;not just the current chairman and his colleagues, but their predecessors&#8212;who have seen it through to considerable effect.</p><p>I remember saying that I thought that the festival had three attributes. First, I felt that it represented a particular spirit of determination, not to mention musical talent, that is to be found in the Paisley area, which is to be applauded. Secondly, I thought that it was a good example of partnership with local organisations, including Renfrewshire Council, which is also to be applauded. Thirdly, I thought that it was important that the Parliament recognised the festival not just as the welcome emergence of a cultural activity in Paisley, but as relaying a bigger message and as a means of putting Paisley back on the map after a challenging period for the town. Wendy Alexander and Bill Wilson have articulated clearly just what a triumph that has been for the organisation.</p><p>I have a sorry confession to make. This year, for the first time, I was unable to attend any of the festival events. The intrusion of a by-election was more than a little responsible for that. I do not know whether that was a triumph over anything, but cultural enjoyment in Paisley was denied to me, which was a matter of considerable regret.</p><p>When one considers some of the organisations and musical groups that the festival attracts, one sees just what it has achieved. Wendy Alexander referred to the Swingle Singers, and the festival has also attracted the King's Singers, Capella Nova, the Dunedin consort and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra chorus. Those are prestigious musical groups. Coming from Bishopton, a village just down the road, I feel privileged that such prestigious music can be found a few miles from my door. I think that that is a tremendous cultural achievement for the festival company.</p><p>As Wendy Alexander said, the economic benefits of the festival have never been lost sight of, and I think that they play a role in the festival company's activities. There is no doubt that Paisley is blessed with many rich architectural gems, such as the abbey, the Thomas Coats <place-holder colnum=\"12477\"/> memorial church and the church of the Holy Trinity. To be able to contribute to their fabric, wellbeing and preservation is very important. I know that the local council aspires to have Paisley identified as a suitable venue for the Royal National M&#242;d. That is something that all of us from the local area would applaud. If there were any possibility of that happening, we would do everything that we could to promote that objective. In my opinion, Paisley would be a very fine location indeed for the M&#242;d.</p><p>The other, less direct, activity of the festival company and the festival in making links with other organisations, musical education and other institutions in Paisley and the west of Scotland has again been brought to fruition. It has resulted in a good and healthy engagement with the University of the West of Scotland, Reid Kerr College and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Those important connections extend out into the University of Glasgow's school of Slavonic, central and east European studies, with the visit of the Estonian Philharmonic chamber choir. Those are not names just to bandy around; they are solid evidence of what the festival is achieving in the area.</p><p>I am very glad to take part in the debate and thank Wendy Alexander for bringing it to the Parliament. It is an opportunity for us all to pay tribute not just to the town of Paisley, which is deserving of praise, but to people such as Alistair Campbell, the directors of the organisation and all those who assist with the festival for doing such a splendid job.</p><p>I think that I am correct in saying that, this year, the schoolchildren's concert was unable to go ahead. That ought to be able to go ahead in the future because, of all the events that I have attended at the festival, it really stuck in my mind as a showcase for the talent that is to be found among young people in Paisley. We should also keep a focus on what brings in the money. What is esoteric may be good entertainment for the cultural high-brows of the world, but musical pops are more likely to pay the bills. So, a pragmatic eye must be kept on the economics.</p><p>I applaud the resolve, fortitude and resilience of all those who have made the festival happen, and I conclude with a couple of suggestions.

That company was subsequently nationalised in February 2008. Northern Rock has a small presence in Scotland, so the underlying tremors perhaps seemed slightly remote to us then, but they were felt more directly when, in April 2008, the Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it needed to raise &#163;12 billion from shareholders, which it at least managed to do with only marginal reliance on underwriters.</p><p>The tremors became fault lines in May, when HBOS sought to raise &#163;4 billion from its shareholders. The rights issue was largely spurned by the shareholders and massive support was needed from underwriters. At that time, the vulnerability of HBOS became clear. Last week, that vulnerability delivered its own Scottish financial shock wave. HBOS, wounded and bleeding, needed help. The problem delivered to Scotland's doorstep the full impact of market turbulence&#8212;an impact that affects thousands of employees, hundreds of thousands of small shareholders, millions of customers, and billions of pounds.</p><p>It is essential that the faltering of one Scottish financial institution should not be characterised as a crisis of the whole Scottish financial sector. That sector has a critical mass and a tremendous reputation for skill and acumen that will endure. It <place-holder colnum=\"11099\"/> would be unpardonable folly if extravagant rhetoric or unguarded comment were to undermine that reputation. We should all remember that there is a sensitive period ahead for HBOS and Lloyds TSB, pending the takeover's becoming unconditional, because another bid might emerge during that period: it is not a done deal. None of us knows what lies ahead, but I am clear that it is infinitely preferable that the challenge that confronts HBOS be resolved by the banking industry rather than by its being laid at the door of the Treasury and at the feet of the taxpayer.</p><p>We are where we are, and our duty now is to look for the opportunities, not just for the employees, small shareholders and HBOS customers but for the broader Scottish economy. The new banking entity will be a huge institution and, at the joint meeting with the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and at the meeting that I had yesterday with Lloyds TSB, I made it clear that I expect its presence to fortify and enhance Scotland's financial sector.</p><p>In fairness, I should, like other members, point out that with its existing activity in Scotland Lloyds TSB genuinely understands both the Scottish financial sector and the Scottish economy. It is helpful that Mr Archie Kane, who has been charged with fronting the takeover at the Scottish end, has already played a leading role in the merger between Lloyds and the TSB and in Lloyds's tie-up with Scottish Widows.</p><p>What will be singularly important to customers, particularly business customers, is that substantial decision making on financial advice and support continues to come from Scotland. The tendrils of HBOS activity reach into a huge number of areas of Scottish life and the support and advice that it currently extends are vast. Mr Gray has already referred to some of those areas. At the SCDI meeting, Duncan Osler of Macroberts said that HBOS could be seen as a number of different business units. It is vital that that input is not lost.</p><p>HBOS also plays a very important role in Scotland's physical infrastructure, not just as a lender and investor but as a facilitator. Its roles in tourism and in the sphere of corporate social responsibility have also been mentioned. It is essential that the new entity recognises both the social importance and economic significance of that contribution and that it determines to continue it.</p><p>Lloyds TSB also has an obligation to assuage the real concern that reduced competition in the banking sector will prejudice the service to business, particularly small businesses. For such businesses, a local branch network is essential, and smaller businesses that want to grow need to have access to affordable capital. I am clear that politicians and this Parliament can make cogent <place-holder colnum=\"11100\"/> representations on all these issues to Lloyds TSB, which has indicated its willingness to continue to meet party leaders. That line of communication is very welcome.</p><p>I turn to broader issues that are not the responsibility of this Parliament but are relevant to Westminster and the Financial Services Authority. My party thinks it right to suspend competition rules, having regard to the broader public interest, and will support measures to stabilise the banking system. We also welcome any short-term action that will bring stability to the markets. However, it is emerging that the extent of short selling of HBOS shares was greatly exaggerated. We all have to understand that short selling is a symptom, but not the underlying cause, of the problem. The fact is that an economy with excessive property inflation, excessive debt, over-borrowing and a dysfunctional regulatory system has to face corrosive challenges. My party positively supports changes to the capital rules for banks to ensure responsible lending; we would, for example, protect depositors by protecting the first &#163;50,000 of a person's savings. Those broader issues will be dealt with in another place and will certainly be discussed as an election approaches. For the moment, this Parliament can advance many positive arguments to Lloyds TSB in its proposed takeover.</p><p>As someone whose party is committed to a strong and confident Scotland within a strong and confident United Kingdom, I am absolutely clear that recent events could have been neither stopped nor meaningfully influenced by an independent Scotland. In an independent Scotland, we would have been pitched like a coracle in the tossing seas of financial tumult. I find comfort in being part of the United Kingdom: it might have the wrong captain on the bridge, but that vessel is nevertheless much better placed to withstand the buffeting of this economic storm.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035851", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a shareholder in the Royal Bank of Scotland and a customer of HBOS.

Indeed, when I look back at a debate in the Parliament in November 2002, I recall that my party was roundly criticised for suggesting that, although intentions were good, what was happening in practice was clearly not implementing the good intentions.</p><p>What was clear then was that there was an absence of any universal national strategy for dealing with drug abuse in Scotland and an over-reliance on harm reduction&#8212;something that I think is now not disputed. I remember saying in another debate that harm reduction had become the predominant response to drug abuse. It meant that many methadone patients were parked on methadone&#8212;they were in a cul-de-sac. We were not looking with sufficient urgency at a range of options, including rehabilitation, to try to get people off addictive substances; rather, we were concentrating effort on a state-funded continuance of addiction.</p><p>One of the early challenges was the lack of information held centrally. At times, it was impossible to get basic facts. Much information was patchy, incomplete or anecdotal. I pay tribute publicly to Professor Neil McKeganey of the University of Glasgow, who with his research both added significantly to the information bank and brought out into the open the fact that more than half of methadone patients wanted to get off drugs altogether. Professor McKeganey's research also exposed the myth that most people on methadone stop using illegally. Every drug addict whom I have encountered has confirmed that, although they were mainly on methadone, initially they continued to use illegally.</p><p>We knew that all around us drug misuse was like a contagion, raging through every community in Scotland. Drug-related deaths were increasing, instead of reducing, and our courts and children's hearings were experiencing increasing evidence of drug abuse in the people who appeared before them.

They could help and wanted to help, but they did not seem to be allowed to provide help because they did not fit into the official structure. I am immensely encouraged by the fact that in the new strategy there is a visible change in political thinking, which has taken us from a cul-de-sac on to a road to recovery. That road will be challenging and in places very rocky, but at least we are on it. I commend the Minister for Community Safety for embarking on that journey and hope that everyone in the Parliament will support it.</p><p>People should not be precipitate in demanding detail on the new strategy that cannot be provided at this stage. What matters is that we should all sign up to the new direction towards recovery and allow the Audit Scotland inquiry that my party insisted was an essential component of any new strategy to take place. Vast amounts of money are currently spent through multiple channels with the intention of dealing with drug abuse, but we do not know how much is spent, where and to what effect. It is imperative that those questions are answered, with the publication of the Audit Scotland report early next year, before we rush to judgment on how the strategy will be implemented in detail. I listened carefully to what Paul Martin said but, for the reasons that I have just articulated, I consider the Labour amendment to be premature.</p><p>I am pleased that the strategy has been informed by input from diverse groups, organisations and individuals who have direct experience of dealing with drug abuse in Scotland and whose contribution has been allowed to influence the way forward.

I am proud to be a Scot and I am proud to be British. The two are not mutually exclusive&#8212;indeed, they happily co-exist. During the Scottish Parliament elections, I argued that being part of the United Kingdom opens doors for Scotland, that it gives us influence in world affairs and that that influence, if wisely exercised, gives us authority in world affairs. At the same time, devolution has responded to our country's desire for a greater say over its domestic issues. As a Scottish Conservative, I am driven by an overarching goal of creating a strong and prosperous Scotland within a strong and prosperous United Kingdom. I am driven by what unites us in these isles, but the nationalists are driven by a desire to divide the nations of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Rejecting independence is not anti-Scottish or unpatriotic; it is quite simply wanting the best for our country. I say clearly to Alex Salmond&#8212;wherever he is&#8212;that the Scottish National Party does not have the monopoly on Scottish patriotism. It is a proud and deep emotion, shared by millions of people outwith the Scottish National Party. Our saltire and the lion rampant are the symbols of our nation, not the badges of nationalism.</p><p>The Scottish Government's nationalist conversation is not the one that matters; what matters&#8212;the real debate and the real challenge&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"4143\"/> is taking devolution forward. Independence is a minority aspiration, and the Scottish Conservatives represent the majority aspiration. Precisely because of that, we acknowledge that, after eight years of devolution, it is appropriate to examine where the process has got to and to support debate about where it goes. That was our manifesto commitment in May. The Liberal Democrats also considered such a review timely, and I commend the Labour Party for now recognising the merit in, and need for, such a review.</p><p>This tripartite agreement is significant. Strengthening devolution while continuing to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom is not just an honourable but a highly important commitment. It is bigger than any one political party, because it dwarfs party politics. We are talking about shaping the constitutional direction of travel of our nation for the future, not just because it is sensible and pragmatic to do that eight years on, but because it overwhelmingly reflects what Scotland wants to happen.</p><p>Today's debate gives Scottish parliamentary breath to that overwhelming public aspiration. I thank Jack McConnell for his initial support of the process and I thank my counterparts, Wendy Alexander and Nicol Stephen, for the constructive discussions that have brought us to the stage of agreeing the need for an independently chaired commission to review devolution in Scotland. I also thank them for agreeing that the remit of the commission should be to review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of Scotland better, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament or that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom. This debate and tonight's vote represent significant political progress for Scotland.</p><p>It is not for us to prejudge the outcome of the commission or any of its recommendations. When the day comes, the Conservatives will give serious and careful consideration to those outcomes before judging what will best serve the interests of Scotland and what will continue to secure our position within the United Kingdom.</p><p>I said earlier that this is the start of devolution phase 2. The next stage will involve our colleagues at Westminster. However, today is about a new watershed in Scottish politics as we embrace the political reality of 2007 and the desire of the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland to take devolution forward.

I also feel comforted. Scotland has entered a new political age, and there can be no dispute about the new political mix and attitude in the Parliament. I genuinely detect a change in political will with regard to drug abuse. At this point, I put on record my respect for and acknowledgement of the First Minister's role in that change of direction. The launch of the directory to which Mr Ewing referred is indicative of such progress, and I am encouraged by the willingness to consider the possibility of extending the ability to issue DTTOs to district courts, which is something that my party advocated in its manifesto. I accept, however, that that will have resource implications.</p><p>It is vital that we put past failures behind us. We have spent far too much time ignoring direct evidence not only from the wide range of people who work with addiction but from addicts themselves, and we have been far too reluctant to challenge methods of and approaches to dealing with drug abuse that were conceived 15 or 20 years ago. Things must change&#8212;and quickly. However, I am confident that if members of the Parliament work together in the way that Mr Ewing has called for we can achieve real and lasting change.</p><p>We need to move into a new era in which none of us is scared to face up to the real challenge of eradicating drugs from our society. None of us is scared to face up to the reality of what is going on. As other speakers have pointed out, the situation in Scotland is singularly depressing. Indeed, Margaret Smith referred to the fact that the number of drug-related deaths has recently soared to 421.</p><p>However, as depressing as the picture is, I pay tribute to the outstanding professionalism and commitment shown by individuals throughout Scotland who fight drug abuse every day. We <place-holder colnum=\"1459\"/> should be very proud of their efforts at grass-roots level, and we must ensure that approaches and practices that demonstrably work are encouraged by recognition, support and resource.</p><p>As I have indicated, the Conservatives support the expansion of the use of DTTOs in our courts. After all, it is believed that 70 per cent of court cases have a drug-related aspect. That said, we must get things into a logical, sensible order. Although increasing and expanding referral and intervention facilities is an attractive option, unless we can get the basic rehabilitation sector ready to deal with individuals we will simply be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p>An important part of what we are trying to do involves our prisons, where I believe we need a comprehensive system of drug treatment and testing.

We will have lower levels of reoffending, less crime and a safer prison environment, which will be good for addicts, families and society as a whole.

For the past eight years, the political regime has been characterised by a condition that some may argue was consensus, but which, to others, was cosiness. It was an incumbency where the ruling politicians felt in control, unchallenged in their political administration. Consensus had become complacency.</p><p>The recent election shattered that mould. Some would say that a fresh wind has blown through the Parliament; some would say that pragmatism has entered the Parliament, as well as realism. I may stand here as a candidate for First Minister, but Scottish Conservatives are realistic: I do not expect to become First Minister&#8212;yet. The <place-holder colnum=\"21\"/> assumption is that Alex Salmond, as the leader of the largest party in the Parliament, will be selected as First Minister to lead a minority Government.</p><p>I think that the prospect of a minority Government is exciting. Almost a year ago, I broke another consensus&#8212;the consensus that coalition was the only way to form a Government in this Parliament. I pointed out that a single-party minority Administration was also an option. I said then&#8212;and I hold to this view now&#8212;that that could provide greater transparency and sharper political focus, and that there would be less political distortion and greater candour with voters. However, such an Administration brings with it great challenges, not just for the incumbents, but for the whole Parliament. A fresh wind can quickly become a chill one. Pragmatism can easily be replaced by paralysis.</p><p>I am quite clear about what Scotland is looking for at this time from her Parliament. She wants the political parties in this place to act on principle, and she wants posturing and petty playground antics to be left at the door. I understand that, and we in the Scottish Conservatives will respect it. We shall support a Parliament that decides issues on their individual merits, week by week; a Parliament that pursues the real goal of constructive agreement, not the charade of a contrived consensus; and a Parliament that strives for the highest political common denominator, not the lowest.</p><p>Scotland today needs a Government that recognises that delivery&#8212;not divorce&#8212;is the only way forward. It needs a Government that measures its success not by how much it can spend, but by how much it can achieve. We need smaller government, more focused government, far less legislation, fewer rules and regulations and a dramatic cut in state interference.</p><p>This Parliament and this minority Government must understand and respond to people's priorities. The Scottish Conservatives, as a principled and robust Opposition with a clear sense of what those priorities are, will argue relentlessly and tirelessly for more police on our streets; more drugs rehabilitation; more measures to cut crime; more affordable homes; more regeneration for our town centres; more real effort to cut costs for our small businesses; more determination to stand up for Scotland's families in child care, health care and wealth care; and more help for our older pensioners by cutting their council tax bills in half now.</p><p>I know that those are the real challenges and that they are the people's priorities. Those are what we shall fight for. If our new minority Government does the same, we will back it; if not, we shall oppose it and be vehement in that opposition.<place-holder colnum=\"22\"/></p><p>Members should be under no illusion: there is no mandate for constitutional turmoil. Scotland did not vote for it and Scotland does not want it. If the minority Administration does not recognise that, it will have the Scottish Conservatives to reckon with.</p><p>I recognise and respect the principle of minority government and I recognise and respect Scotland's demand for change. However, every MSP in this Parliament must respect the voters, who have had enough of posturing, politicking and process and who, instead, want policy, purpose and progress.

The family is the most important institution in Scotland, and it comes in many forms in the Scotland of 2007. The Scottish Conservatives will stand up for those families. We will help them with their child care, their health care and their wealth care. We will encourage parents to have more choice over who cares for their children and where they receive their nursery education. We will support local health and dental services and offer closer, faster, better health care. We will retain local emergency and maternity services and we will improve the system for elective treatments by allowing patients to choose which hospital will perform their operation. As increasing numbers of people become ill, Scotland needs a stronger focus on mental health care. My party will begin with a &#163;10 million investment to improve care for patients and support for their families.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383120", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Future of Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is predictable that Mr Purvis, a representative of the desperately failed pact that has presided for eight years over the disintegration of our criminal justice system, would seek to raise   a smokescreen.

However, it is not really part of the case that I am presenting to the chamber this morning.</p><p>Double jeopardy was an historical safeguard for the acquitted accused, as it ensured that a fresh prosecution could not be raised. Of course, such an approach derived from the days when evidence was either of an oral or tangible character, in which case it existed and was produced for the trial, or it did not exist. In the days before advanced technology, all available evidence was obtained after a crime was committed, and that complete body of evidence constituted the prosecution case. We now live in an age in which forensic science has become much more sophisticated and, even after many years have elapsed, it might be possible to find new evidence that is robust and might be probative of an individual's involvement with or connection to a crime.</p><p>Given Sir William Macpherson's recommendation and the subsequent change to the law of England and Wales, there is an imperative to consider such a change to the law in Scotland. The public will find it unacceptable that, faced with the possibility of a new prosecution, victims and their families are given an entitlement to justice in England and Wales that they are denied here. It is our duty in this Parliament to ensure that victims and their families in Scotland receive the same entitlement.</p><p>I fully accept that a rigorous assessment process would have to be gone through before any new prosecution could be raised, which is why I suggest that evidence would have to be not only new but compelling. Interestingly, I have tried to help the minister in the way that I have phrased my motion, because I felt that the wording in the 2005 Labour Party general election manifesto was too broad to be safe. We must be clear that there are two significant criteria in the proposal, and that they would need to be satisfied. In Scotland, the appropriate mechanism would be that the Lord Advocate would require to seek the consent of the Scottish court of criminal appeal to bring a new prosecution.</p><p>We would also need to consider what crimes should be competent for fresh prosecution. In England and Wales, schedule 5 to the 2003 act contains a lengthy list of qualifying offences. The matter should be the subject of thorough debate and it should, perhaps, encompass the issue that Mr Stevenson raised. I accept that, at <place-holder colnum=\"32375\"/> Westminster, my party thought that the offences should be restricted to murder and rape, but in Scotland culpable homicide is a serious criminal charge, as are arson and certain offences that are prosecuted under statute. The offences that would be included would require careful consideration, but that is a matter of detail. Today's debate is about the principle.</p><p>I submit that, under the criminal law of England and Wales, victims and their families enjoy an entitlement to see justice done. I want victims and their families in Scotland to have a similar entitlement.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the criminal law of Scotland be changed so that persons acquitted of serious criminal charges can be tried again if new and compelling evidence comes to light.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13379650", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Law (Double Jeopardy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Stevenson raises an interesting and important point that is worthy of consideration in the broader debate.

I want to make it clear that my concerns do not relate to his legal competence or professional experience&#8212;they relate to the disclosure that he is a current member of the Labour Party.</p><p>I am not alone in thinking that the role of the Solicitor General should be independent of party politics. On 28 November 2001, when Mrs Angiolini was being appointed to the post of Solicitor General, the First Minister, Jack McConnell, said to the Parliament:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The time is right to have a Solicitor General for Scotland who is not associated with a political party. The time is right to change the perception ... of the job and to focus on modernisation and reform of the prosecution service.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-11-28.4217.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 28 November 2001; c 4217.]</citation></p><p>If that view was right then&#8212;and I think that it was&#8212;it is right now, and Mr Beckett does not satisfy the First Minister's criterion.</p><p>I will deal briefly with the proposal to appoint Mrs Angiolini as Lord Advocate. My party recognises the need to fill the position of Lord Advocate without delay and will support that nomination, but that support is heavily qualified for two reasons. Mrs Angiolini has, with justification, been highly respected as a solicitor with a background in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and there is absolutely no question as to her professional competence in that role&#8212;I associate my party with the First Minister's comments in that respect. However, the Lord Advocate is essentially the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Executive for both civil matters and criminal matters that fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament. The question that is being asked is whether Mrs Angiolini possesses the breadth of legal experience to provide such advice. It would be appropriate for the First Minister to comment on that.<place-holder colnum=\"28325\"/></p><p>Secondly, in a devolved Scotland, there must be real concerns about the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Executive also being the chief prosecutor for Scotland. There is a real and visible conflict of interest, which has become more apparent as issues that are driven by political decision making and which affect reform of the court system or activities within the Crown Office have required a robust and independent response from the Scottish Courts Administration or the Crown Office. I suggest to the First Minister that the appointment of Mrs Angiolini should be concurrent with the setting up of a commission to examine and consider what the proper separation of powers, responsibilities and duties should be in appointing a chief legal adviser to the Scottish Executive and the head of an independent prosecution service. I hope that the First Minister will receive what I am saying as neither personalised nor party-political remarks, but as substantive suggestions to take us forward to a more open and healthy situation.</p><p>If the amendment in the name of my colleague Bill Aitken is defeated, my party will be confronted with a hybrid motion that does not separate the two nominations. In that event, my party will abstain in the vote.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-4924.1, in the name of Bill Aitken, to leave out from \"and that\" to end.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368803", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Law Officers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of my Conservative colleagues, I, too, pay tribute to Lord Boyd and wish him well for the future.

My Conservative friends and I are only too familiar with the caricature of the blue-rinsed old dear pottering around the house while her elderly husband in skip bunnet is puttering around the allotment, but that image is way off the mark. The majority of today's pensioners simply do not fit into that category.</p><p>For a start, many more people survive into their 80s and 90s. In days gone by, a typical 70-year-old might have attempted little more than a walk to the shops and a bedtime story for the grandchildren, but they now fit those pleasures in to a much busier schedule that is sprinkled with surfing the net and cruising the Mediterranean. Indeed, one of them is even standing for President of the United States, and we would not get away with telling him that he is too old to be the leader of the free world. In recent years, there has been a re-emancipation of pensioners, and all power to them.</p><p>Today, I ask whether our society does all that it can to acknowledge and reassure those men and women&#8212;the neo-pensioners&#8212;both the active ones whom I described and the ones who need more care and are not so independent. The answer is that we do not, but we should. Too often during the past nine years, our older people have been regarded as yesterday's business. They have been treated with disrespect and robbed of security and dignity by the Governments in Edinburgh and London.</p><p>However, Scotland's Governments north and south of the border do that at their peril, because it is only a matter of time before the older people of Scotland fight back at the ballot box. We saw a hint of that in 2003 with the election to the Parliament of John Swinburne.

Under the Kyoto protocol, Britain, led of course by a Conservative Government at Westminster&#8212;a fact that our opponents conveniently forget&#8212;committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Creditably, Scotland has already met that commitment. The latest statistics show that emissions from Scotland were 14 per cent below 1990 levels, an achievement of which we should be proud. I acknowledge that the Executive has played a part in that achievement. Businesses saw a drop in their emissions and removals by 41 per cent, which is another encouraging development.</p><p>We need to be aware of the increases in energy, transport and residential emissions. They highlight the need to change attitudes about the environment and to convince people to do a great deal more individually to help solve the problem of global warming.</p><p>I never cease to be astonished at the illustrations of what relatively simple changes to a domestic regime can achieve for energy conservation. If every household in the United Kingdom replaced just one 60W bulb with a new energy-saving light bulb used for three hours a day, that would be the equivalent of planting 10 million new trees. If every UK household filled the kettle with only the amount of water actually required, we would save enough electricity to power more than 50,000 homes for a year. That gets right down to matters under personal control. Those examples clearly illustrate the difference that each of us can make on a daily basis to protect the environment and, by saving energy, individuals obviously save money on their energy bills, which is a win-win scenario.</p><p>I accept that there is a limit to what Governments can to do to change attitudes, but I believe that political leadership does have a role <place-holder colnum=\"27723\"/> and that the Executive can help to encourage such changes.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greener, Fairer Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I have been generous and I would like to make progress.

I hope that that illustrates to Mrs Gillon how we view the eco-bonus scheme working. I applaud the scheme's principle, and it has been a sensible way to start providing political leadership, but we would try to take it further&#8212;to households and communities. We would make &#163;12 million per annum available for our eco-bonus scheme, which matches the Executive's total spending to date and triples its current annual spend. I believe that the eco-bonus scheme will help address cultural <place-holder colnum=\"27724\"/> attitudes and raise awareness, as well as encouraging the public to assume personal responsibility for contributing to a sustainable Scotland.</p><p>Returning again to Mrs Gillon's point, we should recognise that many businesses are helping to change the way in which we think about the environment. For example, Sainsbury's is now using biodegradable packaging, and Tesco is encouraging shoppers to reuse polythene bags. Those developments are important, if small, steps towards improving our environment.</p><p>To help heal the planet fully, we need seriously to consider new ways of developing energy. Wave power, small-scale hydro and decentralised energy all have great potential to offer us, but they require a lot of research and development. That was recently affirmed to me by a businessman who works in that field. Research and development into new ways to reduce carbon emissions is vital. I was sorry to see that the Executive had performed a U-turn on its promise of a business rates cut for companies engaged in research and development.</p><p>That brings me to my final point: politicians and double standards. [<em>Laughter.</em>] I suggest that there is a certain candour in any politician being prepared to accept the perception that many people have of politics and politicians as a whole. The braying laughter from the Labour and Liberal Democrat ranks is a mocking reflection of those parties' hypocrisy, duplicity and manipulation over the past seven years.</p><p>It would be totally unacceptable for MSPs to call on businesses and homes to help the environment when the Parliament itself is apparently energy inefficient. In March this year, thermal images of this building, which were commissioned by the BBC, showed that the Parliament is losing heat. It is certainly not losing any heat from Mr Tavish Scott and Mr Lyon, whose incessant chattering is adding to the already present hot air in the chamber. It is well known&#8212;indeed, it is visible every night&#8212;that a great number of lights are left on in the Parliament around the clock. How many televisions, computers and Telewest boxes are regularly left on standby? That is a waste of energy. I am not calling for the appointment of a parliamentary inspector of gadgets, as the Presiding Officer will be relieved to learn, but I point out that each of us has a responsibility to ensure that our offices and the Parliament itself are energy efficient.</p><p>I wanted to use the debate to outline the threat that we all face from global warming. It is imperative that we encourage everyone to work together to contribute to a sustainable Scotland. If, as we sit here in Edinburgh in September 2006 having what I hope will be a genuinely constructive <place-holder colnum=\"27725\"/> and helpful debate, we do not translate what we know now into a personal and collective change in lifestyle, we are contemplating a Firth of Forth where the Isle of May could disappear, a Scotland where shoreline settlements could regularly become the victims of tidal flooding&#8212;and where that could become the rule, not the exception&#8212;and a Scotland whose familiar physical face, which many of us have taken for granted, could suffer ugly and unwelcome change.</p><p>My party believes in trusting people. I believe that the Scottish people want to protect their planet for future generations, which is why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to enabling every individual to play their own part in meeting the climate change challenge.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes that, along with global poverty and terrorism, climate change is one of the three great challenges facing mankind; recognises that there needs to be a greater shared responsibility among government, business, individuals and families to meet this challenge; believes that combating the threat of climate change will require fresh ideas and radical thinking and, therefore, that the concept of decentralised energy should be seriously pursued; recognises that if we are going to achieve a sustainable Scotland we need to address culture and attitudes to raise awareness and encourage the public to be proactive and to assume personal responsibility for contributing to a sustainable Scotland, and calls, therefore, on the Scottish Executive to expand the Scottish community and householder renewables initiative to incentivise households, communities and small businesses to install modern energy creating and saving technologies as an important first step.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greener, Fairer Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry&#8212;I really want to make further progress.

Although the Executive has finally conceded the argument and reluctantly begun to reduce business rates, it was the First Minister who put up business rates in the first place.

In principle, I support the airport rail link. I am satisfied that the economic-benefits case has been made and I am aware that the project has the support of the Confederation of British Industry Scotland, the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and BAA. I have, however, concerns about the estimated positive impact in reducing road traffic&#8212;I am unconvinced by that argument. Regular M8 travellers west of Glasgow, of whom I am one, know that at peak times, which have stretched in duration in recent years, cars, buses and taxis face immovable congestion. If we add to that a projected residential development of 2,300 houses at Bishopton about five miles from the airport, the M8 is likely to become an historic exhibit of how road travel was once possible in Renfrewshire. A rail link will be the only transport service that can offer certainty in journey times to Glasgow airport.</p><p>Helpfully, the rail network to the south, east and west of Glasgow Central station suggests that other configurations of rail access to the airport via the proposed link are serious options that may fall short of the crossrail proposals, but which are active possibilities, because track exists already. They are serious goers for active consideration. That said, I have practical concerns about the proposal. I am not sure that the connectivity problem between Glasgow Queen Street station and Glasgow Central station is as significant as has been suggested&#8212;I say that as a regular commuter who uses the two stations&#8212;although there an express bus shuttle from Glasgow Queen Street station to Glasgow Central station will be needed. That prerequisite assumes greater importance for people who know where the proposed dedicated platform for the rail link at Glasgow Central station is to be located: the notorious platform 11a, which is so far removed from the main concourse that it might enjoy a postal address in Kilmarnock. The express shuttle bus will need to convey passengers from Queen Street station to platform 11a but&#8212;good news&#8212;the vehicle-access structure of Glasgow Central station makes that possible.</p><p>I am aware that the rail network out of Glasgow Central that serves Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and Inverclyde is heavily used. The additional imposition of traffic from the proposed link will require increased track capacity, which may offer opportunities for Braehead&#8212;I understand that there is already a freight spur. If we are proceeding along the lines of further development <place-holder colnum=\"26774\"/> of infrastructure and rolling stock, there are development potentials in that that should not be diminished or underestimated. The stock will also need to be tailored to accommodate the needs of luggage-transporting travellers who are bound for the airport. As a regular commuter, I know that it is not easy to store luggage in the current rolling stock. If the service is specifically for holidaymakers and other airport-bound commuters, that is a very serious problem that will need to be considered.</p><p>Comments have been made about the cost of the proposed project; there is no doubt that any amount between &#163;170 million and &#163;210 million is significant. That is another issue that requires serious consideration.</p><p>Some years ago, I raised with the minister's predecessor the viability of a monorail link from a newly constructed station west of Paisley Gilmour Street. The likely capital cost of that would have been very much less than &#163;210 million. At that time, there seemed to be a commercial appetite for providing such a service, so I ask the minister today whether that option is absolutely dead. Although I think that, with one or two exceptions, all of us are very much behind the proposal, there is no doubt that the capital costs will be significant and so require serious investigation.</p><p>I am interested in projected passenger use of the rail link, as disclosed in the committee report. I am surprised and intrigued by the analysis in the report that suggests that the proportions of the total GARL patronage by trip type in 2009 are estimated to be 33 per cent air passengers, 7 per cent employees and 60 per cent non-airport-related trips. That poses a basic question: If luggage-encumbered people who are bound for the airport are seeking as direct and as simple a service as possible from a point of departure at home, they need the simplest and most congenial form of travel. Why would luggage-transporting airport-bound travellers want to fight for seats with people who are commuting between Glasgow and Paisley? I ask because a train runs between Glasgow and Paisley about every 10 or 15 minutes, so the commuters seem to be well served at the moment. That is another issue that needs to be clarified.</p><p>In principle, the development offers an exciting prospect for Glasgow and it certainly offers an exciting prospect for the west of Scotland, Renfrewshire and Inverclyde, and potentially for Ayrshire. I therefore support the proposal.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill Committee for its thorough work.

In a number of debates in the chamber, we have discussed the damage that drug abuse causes in Scotland and what we can do to help an addict try to achieve a stable and drug-free lifestyle.</p><p>As members know, however, it is never simply the addict who suffers through drug abuse; some of the more heartbreaking stories that have been reported recently involved children of drug addicts. Fiona Hyslop mentioned Michael McGarrity. We also have Derek Doran and, of course, the tragedy of the 11-year-old girl in Glasgow. Those stories illustrate the impact that drug-abusing parents can have on children. That is why my colleagues and I welcome the Executive's \"Hidden Harm\" report, which was published on Monday.</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with the minister that the protection of children must always be top priority in such cases. However, I have some concerns. The Executive still cannot tell me how many individual rehabilitation places are available across Scotland. As we heard on Monday, there is a shortage of foster carers for children who must be removed from their parents. I am worried that the Executive's glossy document will turn out to be another bitter disappointment.</p><p>In 2003, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs published the original \"Hidden Harm\" report, in which it was estimated that between 41,000 and 59,000 children in Scotland have a drug-using parent, and between 10,000 and 19,000 children live with a drug-using parent. Vitally, one of the key findings of that report was that the number of children who are affected is likely to decrease only when the number of problem drug users decreases. I agree with that finding and it is why I am disappointed that the Executive's report does not put more emphasis on preventive measures.</p><p>I cannot understand why drug treatment and testing orders are available only to offenders who have built up a catalogue of offences, whereas individuals who have committed their first offence because of their drug addiction are denied any intervention. My party and I have continually argued that such interventions should be available in district courts and in children's panels so that <place-holder colnum=\"25583\"/> individuals can be helped and diverted from the path to crime. It seems absurd that, to get help, someone must become a serial offender. I know that that was not the principle that drove the concept of drugs courts, with which my party is content&#8212;we approve of that principle&#8212;but consequences are emerging that it would be foolhardy to disregard.</p><p>I am also worried about what will happen to the parents of any children who are taken into care. If the Executive does not have comprehensive information about what rehabilitation is available, what hope does an addict have? There is a danger that parents could try desperately to seek help to stabilise their lives and get their children back, but be unable to access the help they need. Even for accessing methadone, at the end of the quarter to September 2005, 130 people across Scotland had waited more than a year to get prescribed drug treatment.</p><p>I concede that none of us has all the answers, but is the Executive looking at practices and treatments elsewhere? Is it investigating what other countries are doing or what may be available within the United Kingdom? What about neuro-electric therapy, which was pioneered by a Scottish doctor? Is it available and could it work? Is the Executive prepared to look at that?</p><p>I think we all agree that prioritising the very worst parents for help so that they get their children back but giving the parents who are deemed to be not so bad no help at all would be unacceptable. If we intend to use the ultimate sanction of removing children from their parents and expect it to work as an incentive and as a deterrent, we will have to ensure that parents can get help with addressing their addiction.</p><p>I return to the basic principle that the advisory council highlighted in 2003: if we are to help to protect children of drug abusers, we will need to reduce the occurrence of drug abuse. Indeed, I agree with and applaud the Executive on three of the key priorities in \"Hidden Harm\": to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"increase the number of problematic drug users getting timely and effective treatment; reduce reoffending\"</p><p>by endeavouring to assist and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"reduce the availability of drugs\".</p><p>That has to be our goal and I believe that it can be done. More preventive measures need to be taken to stop people getting into the hellish environment of addiction in the first place. That is why I propose the addition of a couple of lines to the motion.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-4370.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but believes that progress will be impeded unless there is an increase in the availability of rehabilitation for those addicted parents, as well as a greater emphasis on <place-holder colnum=\"25584\"/> educational and preventative measures to stop people getting involved with drugs in the first place.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs and Hidden Harm"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome today's debate as an opportunity for the Parliament to address another side of drug abuse.

Drug abuse has spread and continues to spread misery throughout Scotland. It kills, destroys families, leads to widespread and recurring crime, breaks up communities and corrodes society. It is essential that we use all the resources of the state not just to discourage drug abuse but to do everything possible to eliminate it.</p><p>Like the SSP, the Conservative party recognises that there is no overall proper strategy for dealing with drug abuse in Scotland. I, too, am critical of the Scottish Executive for being over-reliant on methadone, which simply aggravates the problem. I have made it clear on many occasions that the Conservative party is not opposed to the use of methadone per se. However, unlike those who believe that methadone is some sort of universal panacea, to be taken indefinitely by increasing numbers of people, we believe that it should be available as part of a range of options. I share Rosemary Byrne's reservations about methadone.</p><p>Conservatives believe that it is imperative that drug addicts are given immediate support and rehabilitation, to help them to end their addiction and to get back to leading a normal life. Reference has already been made in this morning's debate to the drug outcome research in Scotland&#8212;DORIS&#8212;study by Professor Neil McKeganey of Glasgow University. That research is interesting, because it found that, according to those who took part in it, most drug addicts who seek help do so because they want to become clean and to change their lifestyle. The drug misuse statistics for 2005 showed that the majority of individuals who came <place-holder colnum=\"24770\"/> forward seeking help did not want a prescription-based solution.</p><p>Not only are individuals far too frequently left with methadone as the only option of help, but some individuals have to wait more than a year for that assistance. That cannot go on. In October 2004, the Executive published its review of drug treatment and rehabilitation services. The report highlighted the fact that more needed to be done to help those who wanted to be helped to obtain rapid access to treatment and rehabilitation. I suggest to the Executive that a simple way of providing access to treatment would be to set up a central directory of treatment and rehabilitation in Scotland, akin to that in England and Wales. The Executive has argued that similar information can be received from drug action teams in Scotland. I have tried to abstract that information from the reports of the drug action teams, but it is not easy, because they provide information only for their area.</p><p>For example, someone in Glasgow might be willing to travel to the Highlands to get help, which would remove that individual from the environment that has led to his or her drug addiction. I ask the Executive what hope an addict or their family has of finding a rehabilitation facility when the Executive does not have that information. Recently I lodged a written question asking how many places were available for drug rehabilitation in Scotland. The answer was that those data are not held centrally. That is not good enough.

I do not have enough time to address all the points that I would like to cover. However, before I close, I want to say that I cannot agree with the SSP's solution of decriminalising cannabis and prescribing heroin. I commend to Rosemary Byrne the studies that have been carried out in Sweden, New Zealand and the Netherlands in relation to cannabis. That research makes troubling reading. Cannabis is a dangerous drug. Not only can it be a gateway drug to other, more dangerous illegal substances, but it has been linked with various mental illnesses and causes harm to the heart, lungs and immune system.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359599", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Rosemary Byrne for bringing this issue to the chamber, because it cannot be debated too often.

However, such are the unpredictable quirks of times and events that the baby not only was to grow up as Princess Elizabeth, but was to find that her father was required to take on the role of monarch as King George VI when she was only 10; was to experience the second world war; and was to lose her father, whom she loved dearly, when she was 25, which required her to succeed to the throne. For anyone, that would be a challenging series of events to confront at a young age.</p><p>My first awareness of the Queen was when I was taken at the age of three to a fireworks display to celebrate the coronation.

Be that as it may, I accept the Presiding Officer's ruling.</p><p>The decision to debate drug abuse in our business time was taken long before the tragic death of little Derek Doran from methadone was made public. I make no apology for calling a debate on this crucial subject and I am pleased that the First Minister at least seems to have recognised the growing drugs problem in Scotland, which the state has exacerbated by its overreliance on prescribing methadone.</p><p>I do not have much time&#8212;I realise the pressure on time&#8212;so I will focus on methadone. I make it clear that my party has never called for that drug to be dropped. Unlike those who believe that methadone is some sort of panacea, we do not believe in a one-size-fits-all attitude to dealing with drug abuse. Unfortunately, the overwhelming response to addiction in Scotland is placement on a methadone programme.</p><p>When the Parliament debated drug abuse in 2004, many members of other parties hounded me for daring to challenge the use of methadone. The former Liberal Democrat drugs spokesman, Keith Raffan, said that we needed to shout about the benefits of methadone. He said:<place-holder colnum=\"23836\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Drug misuse is an addiction&#8212;a form of compulsive-obsessive behaviour. What such people want is different from what they can achieve.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-10-27.11191.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 27 October 2004; c 11192.]</citation></p><p>I challenge precisely that dismissive and patronising attitude, which leaves many people parked on methadone. Do we really want to continue a pattern that will lead to the prescription of more than 1 million methadone scripts a year by 2012?</p><p>It is imperative that those who find themselves addicted to heroin, methadone or any other substance are given immediate support and rehabilitation to help them to end their addiction and to return to leading a normal life. The Government's job is to help such individuals but, instead, they are trapped.</p><p>The drug outcome research in Scotland study by Professor Neil McKeganey of the University of Glasgow found that most drug addicts who seek help do so because they want to become clean and to change their lifestyle. The drug misuse statistics of 2005 showed that the majority of individuals who sought help did not want a prescription-based solution.</p><p>However, finding help is far from easy. England and Wales have a central directory of rehabilitation facilities, which includes those provided by the voluntary and private sectors. That gives individuals instant information about a variety of aspects, such as vacancies and locations. I reiterate my call for the Executive to establish such a directory for Scotland. We are a small country and surely that is not beyond the wit of man.</p><p>Alongside a central directory, a dramatic shift is needed towards offering individuals help and rehabilitation to come off drugs. I will quote a chilling passage from Professor Neil McKeganey's article in <em>The Herald</em> yesterday. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is a simple truth here but one that is rarely shared, namely that methadone has all too easily become the drug-addiction treatment for the masses. There are no superstar heroin addicts or drug-dependent doctors signing themselves up for long-term methadone programmes. Residential rehabilitation is the gold-standard treatment for those who can afford it\".</p><p>Rehabilitation and leading a drug-free lifestyle should not be an option that is open only to the well-off. Can we as a nation afford to leave so many languishing on methadone? If a person found that someone whom they cared about was addicted to heroin and that the only option open to that person was to be prescribed methadone, would they not worry and fear that the person whom they cared about was being consigned to a prescription prison? That is why I want the Executive to publish an analysis of whether the rehabilitation places that are available are <place-holder colnum=\"23837\"/> adequate to meet demands and to say what it is doing to increase the number of places.</p><p>As I said it would, my speech has focused on the use of methadone. Much needs to be done to help addicts, but if we are to conquer the drugs problem, we must stop people taking drugs in the first place. It is deeply depressing and distressing that 80 per cent of people who sought treatment for the first time last year started to take drugs when they were under 20.</p><p>As I have said many times, we need to abandon the softly-softly know the score campaign and deliver a simple abstinence message.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13357324", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drug Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Presiding Officer for his explanation of the technical point about the amendment in the name of Hugh Henry.

The matter is&#8212;or should be&#8212;above party-political divisions. I thank Nicola Sturgeon for her willingness to discuss the terms of the motion, which is not intended to be judgmental but is instead an attempt to bring to Parliament for responsible discussion the genuine alarm that is being sounded outside Parliament.</p><p>The Shirley McKie case has assumed huge significance for our criminal justice system. It has raised issues of practice, procedure and protocol that go to the heart of that system. It has implied incompetence, corruption and collusion and has raised suspicions of criminal conduct and cover-up, all allegedly within our criminal justice system. It has left question marks over police officers, fingerprint experts, the Scottish Criminal Record Office and, of course, the role of Scottish Executive justice ministers. The report of Deputy Chief Constable James Mackay raised significant <place-holder colnum=\"23683\"/> questions. However, as Colin Fox said, there are clearly conflicting opinions from fingerprint experts outwith Scotland, especially Peter Swann.</p><p>The Scottish Executive and the Lord Advocate have resisted calls for a public judicial inquiry, believing such an inquiry to be unnecessary and inappropriate. The minister reiterated that position this morning. I infer from the Executive's attitude that it believes that the crisis will subside, but it has not subsided and it will not go away. The storm clouds are still gathering around our criminal justice system and the Executive.</p><p>The minister's comments this morning were interesting. Her amendment concedes</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that action needs to be taken to restore public and professional confidence in the Scottish Fingerprint Service\".</p><p>She therefore accepts that such confidence does not currently exist. She also concedes the principle of an inquiry. However, she truly believes that a parliamentary inquiry is the correct approach. If she accepts that there is a loss of confidence in our criminal justice system, how can confidence be restored by a parliamentary inquiry that would be undertaken by a committee with a Scottish Executive majority and which would be prosecuted by people who&#8212;however well intentioned they might be&#8212;lack the necessary skills and technical expertise to do the job?</p><p>Today, the minister has failed to address the concerns that are properly expressed in the motion. Specific reference is made to the view of Lord McCluskey. However, as Nicola Sturgeon said, he is not isolated in his concerns. We have heard a host of opinions: from Derek Ogg, a senior criminal practice Queen's counsel; from John Scott, a human rights lawyer; from Maggie Scott, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association; and from Joe Beltrami, a highly experienced criminal solicitor advocate.</p><p>This morning, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the former Lord Advocate and Lord Chancellor, said that he thinks that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there should be an inquiry to look into the reliability of fingerprint evidence in Scottish court cases, and the implications for other cases on which such evidence depends.\"</p><p>He also said that what troubles him is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the question of whether the fingerprinting system is reliable for ordinary people.

I also thank my colleagues on the committee, our clerks and all the people who made written and oral submissions.</p><p>By any standards, the bill is a chunky piece of proposed legislation. It is in disparate parts but is a solid bill and required careful stage 1 scrutiny. The co-operation of all who were involved made that scrutiny easier and fruitful for the committee, and I hope that our stage 1 report has been helpful to the Executive. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland described the bill as the most significant proposed legislation to affect policing since the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. As convener, I reassure those who gave evidence to the committee that we treated all submissions with great seriousness and paid close attention to the views that were expressed.</p><p>Members who are present and the Executive will be aware that concern has been expressed in some quarters about part 1 of the bill, which deals with the police. The question has been asked whether the constitution of a Scottish police services authority and the creation of a Scottish crime and drug enforcement agency are healthy, workable or desirable. I reassure all those who gave evidence on that point that the committee listened to their concerns closely, that it reiterated those concerns to the Executive and that the Executive gave specific assurances. In particular, the Executive assured us that the Scottish police services authority will be a hands-on body that will provide police support services and oversee the Scottish crime and drug enforcement agency but will not affect the existing tripartite arrangement for our police forces. It is important to emphasise that existing unitary police authorities and police boards are not being abolished. There seemed, at one point, to be legitimate confusion over the possibility of that happening.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee listened carefully to concerns about those issues but, on balance, we felt that the Executive's reassurances were firm and clear and that the proposed structural changes offered a sensible way forward. The committee was in no doubt that the global challenges that Scotland now faces in relation to both national and international crime require specific structural processes to address them. We felt that the existing Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency has a fine record behind it, and that the proposals in the bill were a sensible recognition of the extremely important strategic role that we now ask the agency to perform and of the support that we think it needs if it is to continue with the very important task that we place on it.</p><p>As Stewart Maxwell indicated, the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is a wide-ranging bill, and it is impossible to comment on all its provisions in detail, but there are a few <place-holder colnum=\"23052\"/> areas that I wish to draw to the Executive's attention. We were struck by the evidence that we received on public processions, a subject on which emotions run high, as we recognise. I strike one slight note of demur: the committee felt that the guidance that is being prepared by ministers would have been most helpful to us if only it had been available for our consideration during stage 1, in time for the preparation of our report. I accept the practical difficulties of producing such guidance but&#8212;if I may recommend this as good practice for the future&#8212;we would have found it extremely helpful to have had sight of it prior to the conclusion of our stage 1 consideration. That would have allowed us better to understand the work that will confront local authorities when they receive applications for permission to hold processions.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson made some important points about the provisions in the bill relating to offensive weapons. The committee noted the ethical dilemmas that might arise regarding the mandatory reporting of non-accidental offensive weapons injuries and considered that the matter required further debate. In other words, there was no lack of sympathy, but there was a genuine feeling that there was a lack of education and information about the topic. It would have been premature for the committee to attempt to come to any view on that. I echo what Stewart Stevenson said&#8212;I beg his pardon: I mean Stewart Maxwell&#8212;about how the charges are to be proceeded with. We wish more charges to proceed on indictment.</p><p>The drug testing and assessment procedures are, in principle, to be welcomed. Genuine practical concerns were expressed about timescales, however, and it is right that ministers should be aware of them. This is not just some technical debating point; we are talking about a real issue. It important that anybody who undergoes a test is not left in limbo, that there is an understandable timescale within which the assessment is carried out and that the appropriate intervention or action is then determined.</p><p>The final area on which I wish to comment is the technical matter of offenders assisting with investigations and the proposals to give certain individuals immunity from prosecution. The Law Society of Scotland has circulated a letter to members in which the society inquires why the committee thought that there might be practical problems with implementation. I am mindful of any suspicion that phraseology may be used as a cop-out to spare us going into the detail, but our concerns were highly technical. Basically, having listened to the evidence and noted the concerns expressed&#8212;I direct members who have inquired about the matter to pages 54 to 58 of the committee's stage 1 report&#8212;the committee's view was that there was some merit to those concerns. <place-holder colnum=\"23053\"/></p><p>We felt it necessary to point out that subsequent criminal proceedings might well be prejudiced by the operation of natural justice in instances when an accused might be debarred from a fair trial or when issues might arise under the European convention on human rights. Given the technical nature of the relevant sections, the committee felt it necessary to signal the potential practical difficulty in implementing those proposals.</p><p>The Justice 2 Committee agreed by majority to the general principles of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Putting on my party hat, I can confirm that my party also agrees to the general principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes, I shall speak as the convener of the committee, adopt an attitude of irreproachable neutrality and be uncharacteristically benign to the minister and her deputy.

I am afraid that I had thought that the debate started at 3 o'clock.</p><p>With a projected financial deficit of &#163;100 million by 2007-08, the previous administration of NHS Argyll and Clyde faced significant financial and managerial problems and the urban and rural mix of the area contributed to the board's struggle. There is no dispute about that, but I have to say that we do not think that the any of the options that were presented in the consultation would necessarily solve the problems.</p><p>I say at once that my party wishes to commend the staff and the clinicians of Argyll and Clyde for their hard work and their efforts to carry on providing services for the area against the backdrop of uncertainty for residents and the workforce. The current state of morale makes it all the more frustrating that the Executive has allowed a period of consultation without clarifying the specific structural, financial and management issues that lie at the heart of Argyll and Clyde's problems, and without explaining in detail not only how the proposed changes would address those problems but what the future service plans of the successor boards will be.</p><p>On the consultation, we are primarily troubled about the absence of sufficiently robust information on the funding implications of each consultation option that was presented by the Executive. Given the fundamental importance of preserving confidence in the administration of health care in Argyll and Clyde, the Executive <place-holder colnum=\"21628\"/> should have extended the consultation until far more detailed information could be made available to the public to enable people to make a more informed choice from the options that were presented to them. Provision of information on the specific areas of failure and financial loss in Argyll and Clyde would have allowed the public to understand the extent to which better management in any option would contribute to financial and operational recovery.</p><p>There is no analysis or proposition in the Executive's consultation to clarify how changing the budgets will eliminate the deficit. The consultation paper suggests that part of the deficit arises from the mixture of urban and rural areas, but it does not really strip away the role that such incompatibility plays as opposed to poor management. If the problem is caused by geography, then changing the boundaries will only solve it if the funding mechanisms change. In fact, today's announcement is a geographical compromise; that is not a solution.</p><p>I understood the First Minister earlier to say&#8212;I might be paraphrasing him&#8212;that public services are not necessarily guaranteed improvement by changing boundaries. Perversely, that seems to be exactly what the Minister for Health and Community Care has put before us. It would have been appreciated if the consultation document had addressed the additional financial burdens that are projected for the short or long term for the prospective successor boards, and information concerning the specific sectors of Argyll and Clyde's accounting that made a loss.</p><p>Those concerns have been made all the more relevant with today's publication of the Audit Scotland report, \"Overview of the performance of the NHS in Scotland 2004/05\", which highlights some of the great challenges that the national health service will face in the future. We have seen those challenges for ourselves at first hand&#8212;long waiting lists, unpopular moves to centralise services and problems in rolling out NHS 24 and with finding dentists.</p><p>It is interesting that the Audit Scotland report recommends a review and improved financial management and workforce planning, which needs to improve if NHS bodies are to manage their finances properly, respond effectively to cost pressures and provide a health service differently in the future. The report even goes on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The NHS in Scotland faces a significant challenge in meeting savings as part of the Efficient Government Initiative.\"</p><p>In the face of all that, lack of analysis of problems in the consultation document is all the more significant. That is why my party is adamant that the consultation should be extended to ensure that that vital extra financial information is made <place-holder colnum=\"21629\"/> available to the public so as to better inform people's choices.</p><p>Having indicated our position, I will move on to highlight other concerns that the proposals have raised in the interim. At many of the consultation sessions, the recurring message was that some residents of Argyll and Bute felt that they were on the edge of the health systems of which they have been a part, and they perceive that their needs and priorities have not always taken centre stage for the NHS board.</p><p>On another front, community health partnerships are central to delivery of joined-up health and social care services. It is understandable that proposals for CHPs in Argyll and Clyde depend on the final consultation on dissolution of the board, but that might affect the development of CHPs in NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Highland. It will be a close-run thing if all those community health partnerships are to be established by April 2006. I would be grateful for further information from the minister on progress on that.</p><p>Given that centralisation and reconfiguration of acute services within an expanded NHS Greater Glasgow would be decided at board level, cuts in the current vulnerable acute services in Argyll and Clyde might take place in the interests of a cost-cutting agenda for the Greater Glasgow NHS Board. There is a fear that any change in administration would present an opportunity to further centralise and downgrade acute services&#8212;it is vital that that does not happen. Mr Tosh rightly alluded to that threat in his question to the minister. No one doubts the sincerity of the intention of the chairman of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board; it is what the board might be compelled to do that is troubling.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351852", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Services (Argyll and Clyde)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I apologise to you, the minister and Parliament for my late arrival.

It turned out that I was not in a time machine; the Executive was simply spinning things in that way.

Serious assault is up by 6 per cent; rape and attempted rape are up by 47 per cent; fire-raising and vandalism are up by 58 per cent; and drug crime is up by 38 per cent.

It abandoned the just say no drugs campaign, which was replaced with one that gives mixed messages. It has no idea how many drug rehabilitation places are available in Scotland for dealing with the growing number of addicts. It has presided over a burgeoning growth industry in methadone scripts and it abolished Scotland Against Drugs without any debate or explanation and without giving any notice to the Parliament. In the meantime, drugs-related crime has soared and our prisons are awash with drugs. Our overstretched police officers have been given so many new responsibilities that, according to the Executive's research, only about 145 of them are on our streets at any one time.

Surely the minister accepts that there is a public appetite for a change in that practice. Such a change must apply to all offenders, not just sex offenders as the criminal justice plan hinted. Just last week, Derek Ferguson was found guilty of the tragic murder of 16-year-old Steven Pettigrew. The stabbing took place in April this year, when Ferguson should still have been in prison for his brutal attack on a father and son in 1999. Surely the practice of automatic early release cannot continue to be acceptable.</p><p>Secondly, the Executive must learn from elsewhere by accepting the merit and wisdom of a zero-tolerance policing strategy and introducing genuine local accountability. I am aware that the public throughout Scotland are frustrated by a feeling of impotence about their ability to influence how general strategic policing is conceived and provided. The members of the public who pay taxes to fund our police forces do not know where they fit in. My party believes that some level of accountability could be achieved through the direct election of police board conveners and the publication of localised crime statistics. If the minister will not listen to me, perhaps she will listen to Chief Constable John Vine, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We still run our police forces in Scotland like social clubs. About 80% of our time goes on making life comfortable and the public out there are almost a bloody nuisance who get in the way. We need to change that culture. They are paying our wages and we need to be far more responsive to what they want. I think we need a new deal with them.\"</p><p>Well said, John Vine.</p><p>Thirdly, as I told the First Minister last week, we need to introduce a politically led strategy to deal with the scourge of drugs abuse in Scotland. After six years of devolution, the deficiencies and omissions in information to which I have referred can no longer be acceptable. The Executive needs to find out more information about what is happening in Scotland so that it can work out a strategy for those who need to find help, which they must be able to find easily. The Executive must also rapidly deploy strategies to provide vastly improved facilities for rehabilitation of drug-addicted people.<place-holder colnum=\"21545\"/></p><p>I have been able to make only those few suggestions in the time that is available to me this morning, but I urge the minister to listen to public opinion and common sense and to reverse the tide of rising crime in Scotland.

We are concerned by the introduction of the eight criminal justice authorities. In my view, we have achieved useful co-ordination of activity and co-operation between agencies since 2002, through the 14 funding and planning units that were constructed on the basis of local agreement and consensus. I should have thought that there was merit in allowing those partnerships to continue, because they meet the aspirations of and provide the necessary flexibility for different areas of Scotland. Mr Wallace's amendments highlighted that important dimension.</p><p>It is also the case that our social work departments are bearing an intensifying workload and that we expect them to discharge an exacting level of responsibility. Much of that is attributable to legislation that the Parliament has passed. Do we really need to impose further statutory bureaucracy on those hard-pressed departments? From the evidence that was submitted, it did not seem to me that the case had been made.</p><p>As has been signalled, our second objection is the introduction of home detention curfews, while automatic early release continues. That will simply allow prisoners out of jail even earlier. I do not accept that the people of Scotland regard that as desirable or sensible. During the debate on amendments, I was struck by the lively and robust contributions that weighed in from every sector of the chamber. Normally that means one thing&#8212;that a raw nerve has been struck. I express my profound disappointment that after trails in the media, hints from the Sentencing Commission and big words from our First Minister, at the end of the day we will be no further forward in ending the scandal that is automatic early release of prisoners in Scotland.</p><p>Quite simply, it is a disgrace that a prisoner serving less than four years is released halfway through that sentence, regardless of their behaviour, and that someone serving more than four years is released after only two thirds of it. That sends out a message about our justice system, and I do not think that it is a good one. I <place-holder colnum=\"20395\"/> certainly do not think that it is a deterrent message.</p><p>The Executive can come up with all the excuses that it wants. The fact remains that amendment 1 in my name would have allowed it to end early release on a day of its choosing. Mr Henry criticised that provision and seemed to regard it as a deficiency, but I was trying to address the specific concern that he articulated at stage 2. For the moment, the Executive is the devolved Government of Scotland, so for the moment it has the power to end early release. That is why I tried to give it the flexibility that it seems to think would be helpful.</p><p>Actions speak louder than words. Clearly, the Executive has no intention of ending early release for short-term and long-term prisoners. Through the bill, it will allow some prisoners out of jail even earlier.

That is a consequence of Westminster legislation that was introduced by a Conservative Government. The Conservative Government recognised that the system was not working and brought forward legislation to end it, but the incoming Labour Government of 1997 did not bring the legislation into effect, which is why we still have automatic early release.</p><p>The purpose of amendment 1 is to reintroduce a topic that I raised at stage 2.

I expressed concern in the committee about the application of home detention curfews under the current regime because if, as the Executive proposes, we do not get rid of automatic early release, the practical consequence of the provision on home detention curfews is that prisoners will get out even earlier. That is a matter of profound concern to the public of Scotland.

I am not in a position to comment, because I was not here, but another member indicated that they thought that Mr MacAskill thought the report was pretty tedious and boring. The report might not sound sexy, but I thought that it was spot on in that it considered what matters. It is not setting off rockets, ringing bells or blowing whistles, but it is shining a bright light over the canvas of youth justice. I will not regurgitate the report, but it is important to recognise how broad and intricate that canvas is; it is a very close weave and it is extremely difficult to come up with dazzling proposals for any one aspect of it. The report does not try to do that; it tries carefully to tease out difficulties and make what I hope are sensible observations about them.</p><p>I hope that Christine Grahame was reassured to see that one of the first things we did in the report was commend the children's hearings system and express our support for its principles. As far as multi-agency working is concerned, one of the most telling descriptions came from Perth and Kinross Council, which said that interagency service planning and delivery was like a three-dimensional game of chess&#8212;I really do not think it could be described better. That begins to indicate the complicated backdrop against which we were operating as a committee.</p><p>What has struck me about the speeches that I have been privileged to listen to is that they have touched on many of the themes that the committee picked up, such as concerns about stability of funding and the need for an holistic and coherent multi-agency approach. That was picked up by Mike Pringle, Susan Deacon and Donald Gorrie. Maureen Macmillan made a positive contribution and explained the value of a networking approach in the real sense, which has certainly been achieved in Moray. A number of contributors rightly highlighted literacy and the need for education to form part of the general backdrop for our young people if we want to try to provide them with a stable platform for life ahead. Maureen Macmillan mentioned Orkney, but other contributors such as Jackie Baillie, Kenneth Macintosh and Robert Brown made good points about the significance of that area of activity.</p><p>The committee thought that early intervention <place-holder colnum=\"19640\"/> was important. A number of members touched on that, but I thought that Susan Deacon made a telling contribution. Stewart Maxwell said that early intervention should happen almost before birth, but the point is that from the moment a young life in this country starts we have to be alert to how it will proceed. Scott Barrie said helpfully that if we are really going to try to achieve a corporate approach at local authority level, training will be required&#8212;it will not just happen.</p><p>During the debate, I was most struck by three issues: the role of the voluntary sector; drugs, alcohol and mental health facilities and services; and accountability, to which Stewart Stevenson alluded. I say to the minister that I was struck by the fact that there is a very real need for drugs, alcohol abuse and mental health facilities. My impression is that we cannot quite quantify what the supply needs for services will be to meet demand. The debate has highlighted that issue and provided a timely reminder to us all.</p><p>The committee was mindful of the role of voluntary organisations and specifically referred to that role in its report. Donald Gorrie pungently referred to that matter; he described the perceived hostility to the voluntary sector and talked about too much centralisation.</p><p>The debate has been useful. It has gone a long way towards further colouring what the committee has said.

As a first assurance, I give the chamber my undertaking that I will not break into song&#8212;either as a solo or in a duet&#8212;because I have no wish to prejudice the cause of Voices in Paisley.</p><p>It is often the case in life that some of our most enjoyable journeys have improbable starting points. In March last year, when I got an invitation to attend a choral evening on a Friday night in the Wynd Centre in Paisley, my interest was not immediately aroused. However, no one who underwent their primary and secondary schooling in the Renfrewshire and Inverclyde areas is unfamiliar with or immune to the pleasure of music. Both those areas have a very strong musical tradition, so I decided that I would go along to the concert; I was not disappointed, because musical talent from Paisley and the surrounding area was abundant. If that talent was exciting, no less refreshing was the enthusiasm of the participants.</p><p>At the end of the concert, I was approached by the organisers to see what I had thought of the evening. They also wanted to seek my views on a plan to have a choral festival in the following October, with a view to making that festival a cultural highlight for Paisley and putting Paisley on the cultural map of Scotland. I paused, but only momentarily, because it seemed to me that the talent and the focus and enthusiasm that I had just witnessed demonstrated that that idea was not only brilliant but sustainable.</p><p>Indeed, that first foot in the festival water in October last year made a very big splash. One of <place-holder colnum=\"19014\"/> my pleasures was to attend the schools concert part of the programme that had received great support from Renfrewshire Council. Some members might remember that the Renfrewshire children's choir under Christine Badger was a star turn at an Edinburgh carol service in which MSPs participated a couple of years ago. The same indefatigable Mrs Badger was to be found at that schools concert in Paisley. The display of young musical talent was breathtaking.</p><p>Voices in Paisley had organised other impressive events for that week and, building on that strength, the group decided to try to take things forward on a more structured basis. In January this year, it was my pleasure to chair a conference on proposals for the formation of a Paisley festival company. All of us who were there were startled at just how many people attended, and the obvious feature of that attendance was the breadth of appeal that the festival seems to hold and the breadth of interest in taking it forward. That has brought us to where we are now, with the prospect of an exciting and expanded choral festival being held between 30 September and 15 October, offering a wide diversity of rich musical entertainment. Perhaps equally important, the festival offers an opportunity to people of all ages and backgrounds to participate, either musically or as audience members.</p><p>My reason for bringing this evening's motion before the Parliament was threefold. First, I wanted to pay tribute to the spirit and determination of the musicians who created an exciting addition to the cultural calendar not just of Renfrewshire but of Scotland. It may be invidious to single out people, but the chairman of the organising committee, Tom Wright, and his lieutenant, Fred Hay, have been two doughty ambassadors.</p><p>Secondly, I wanted to acknowledge the vital support and encouragement that has been given by local organisations, led by Renfrewshire Council. The foreword in last year's programme, by Provost Ronnie Burns, said it all. It is right that we pay tribute to what local organisations have offered in support.</p><p>Thirdly, I wanted the Parliament to recognise that the festival, which had its origins in the celebration of music, has become a flagship for Paisley. We all know that Paisley has been buffeted by many challenges, and some would argue that it has had an unfair share of adversity, but the festival is providing a renaissance&#8212;a new banner of hope&#8212;and relaying a message that is positive and exciting. The festival has become bigger than a musical convention; it is putting Paisley back on the map. My message to the Parliament and those beyond is, \"Let's hear it for Paisley and wish the choral festival organisers <place-holder colnum=\"19015\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">huge success in October.\"</p><p>I thank those MSPs who have supported the motion and those who are taking part in the debate. There is a great deal that we can do as ambassadors for the festival. I also thank the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport for attending and I ask her to note that, although I have not come with begging bowl in hand, I ask the Scottish Executive to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that has been done by volunteers to make the festival happen. If there is any small gesture that the Executive might feel able to make to encourage a fantastic local effort, I urge her to consider that. If the minister's diary permits, I am sure that she would be very welcome at one of the festival events. I thank members for their attention and I look forward to hearing the other speeches.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345115", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Paisley Choral Festival"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with much pleasure that I speak to the motion in my name.

It was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a programme for justice and respect ... a vision to build safer, stronger communities\".</p><p>The First Minister's stated objectives included a pledge to \"support the victim\". Those brave proclamations were timely and encouraging, as well as much needed, for reasons that might be uncomfortable for the First Minister and his Scottish Executive.</p><p>In the six years of devolution, the number of recorded crimes and offences has increased. Mr Purvis does not like statistics. No giddy wonder; if I was part of the Executive, I would not like the statistics. The recorded crime in Scotland bulletin of June 2004 shows that fire raising and vandalism have increased; rape and attempted rape have increased; offences involving the handling of offensive weapons have increased; and drug-related crimes are up. Recently, indeed, there was a tragic disclosure that drugs deaths in Scotland are now running at about one per day. That reflects a lot of misery in many of our communities.</p><p>What about the Scottish Executive's attempts in the past six years to ensure that our criminal justice system deals robustly with persons who are charged with committing a crime and with persons who are convicted of committing a crime? Currently, as we have heard, those who are sentenced to imprisonment get out early automatically and there is disturbing evidence that serious crimes have been committed by certain individuals who got out early and were therefore free to commit those crimes.</p><p>Furthermore, there is the turbulence&#8212;there is no other way to describe it&#8212;of the operation of the bail system. In 1999, the system saw fit to allow only three persons who were charged with murder out on bail, but by last year that figure had increased to 55. I agree with Kenny MacAskill that that is unacceptable, because if someone is charged with murder there is a victim, there is a victim's family and friends and there are prosecution witnesses who might all live in the same community. That represents a situation to which most right-thinking members in the chamber would be deeply opposed. I suspect that, in the chamber, there is already universal disquiet at what has been happening.</p><p>The Lord Advocate may want to investigate how many bail applications are opposed by the Crown. As we know, the judge is powerless if, on application, the Crown offers no opposition. The judge cannot intervene of his own volition. I suspect that there are many cases in which, privately, the judge is deeply unhappy that no opposition was offered.</p><p>The Sentencing Commission estimates that the <place-holder colnum=\"18826\"/> bail system allows 9,000 people per year to reoffend, of whom 4,000 offend more than once, and the bail system in Scotland has resulted in 30,000 outstanding warrants for arrest for people who failed to return to court. According to the Sentencing Commission&#8212;as we have already heard&#8212;those failures are \"endemic\" I suspect that many MSPs' constituents have come to them to voice the very concerns that are the human face of what the statistics mean. They might include victims' relatives who are appalled that the accused is free in the community and is living a few doors away, in the case of a murder charge. There are witnesses who are frightened to go out in their own communities for fear of being intimidated and threatened.</p><p>Those concerns arise in cases in which people have been through the system and allowed out on bail, but what about people who have been convicted and given an alternative disposal rather than being detained in custody? Robin Harper was vociferous in his support for such solutions, but the facts are again troubling. In 2003-04, 18 per cent of community service orders, 33 per cent of supervised attendance orders and 34 per cent of probation orders were breached.</p><p>If we add to that troubled picture the fact that three crimes in four are no longer reported because people have lost confidence in the criminal justice system&#8212;I tell Mr Purvis that that figure comes from the Scottish crime survey&#8212;it becomes clear to me that a programme for justice and respect is overdue and that a pledge to support the victim has never been more necessary.</p><p>There are positive areas in the legislative programme that the First Minister announced this morning, but unfortunately they are at the margins of the problem that I have just described. The Scottish Executive is allowing our once-revered criminal justice system to sink in quicksand. Without more police officers back in our communities and without their being visible regularly, the depressing increases in criminal activity will not be reversed. Without a pledge to stop automatic early release from prison, our criminal justice system will not enjoy respect, our victims will not be supported and our communities will not be safer and stronger. Without a radical review of the operation of bail, the same will apply.</p><p>If the First Minister really wants to convince people that when he talks tough he means business, he needs to take action now to end automatic early release. His Minister for Justice says that that is a priority; he can show that by supporting the Conservative amendment on that to the Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Bill. We shall make our own judgment according to the response to that amendment.<place-holder colnum=\"18827\"/></p><p>If the First Minister really wants to stop the abuse of bail, he can enlist the co-operation of his colleagues at Westminster to review the operation of the European convention on human rights with reference to our criminal justice system.

I should also declare an interest as an enrolled solicitor in Scotland.</p><p>Public funding of legal services is not, I admit, a subject that is likely to have people on the edges of their seats, but it is vital for three reasons. First, it is right that people who need advice to ensure that justice is done are able to get that advice. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that a reasonable scheme operates to assist in funding procurement of that advice for individuals who have little or no means with which to pay for it. Thirdly, without such a scheme, the main providers of that advice&#8212;lawyers&#8212;will wither on the vine and the quality of the service is likely to deteriorate, which would lead to the shrinking of Scotland's legal profession. The losers would be the very people who need the advice and assisted funding in the first place.</p><p>I will deal first with that last point. I am aware that emerging evidence suggests that the number of solicitors who are willing to undertake criminal and civil legal aid work is declining; already, there are indications that people are unable to access justice and advice when they need to do so. Alarmingly, clear evidence suggests that law graduates are increasingly opting not to do that type of work. Indeed, that view was declared to me during a recent visit to a university.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's motion. My party will support the motion even though it is perhaps a little bit premature, given that the consultation was launched only on 17 June. I believe that the issue requires broad discussion and debate, so it will be instructive to read the responses to the consultation.</p><p>I am aware that a report on legal aid was published by the Justice 1 Committee in 2001 and that the then Minister for Justice announced a strategic review of the matter on 24 October 2003. The Justice 1 Committee report floated some useful ideas that merit attention. I shall return to those in more detail in a moment.</p><p>Legal aid and legal advice and assistance cost a lot of money&#8212;approximately &#163;150 million per annum. Some people will find it tempting to approach the debate from the simple standpoint that lawyers get far too much money, whereas others&#8212;not surprisingly, they will predominantly be lawyers&#8212;will say that lawyers find that legal aid work is not worth doing. Such simplistic approaches lead to the equally simplistic and misguided conclusions that we should either cut the money or provide more money on the basis of <place-holder colnum=\"18327\"/> current structures. I disagree with both of those conclusions. I was interested to hear the minister's comments on that issue in her speech.</p><p>We need to analyse radically not only how we provide advice and assistance and representation in court, but whom we ask to provide them. Mr MacAskill made a similar point, but I do not support his idea to establish a commission, because that would result in unnecessary delay and possible expense. I actually believe that effective change can be made on the back of the consultation and that such change could be made quickly.</p><p>Most lawyers would agree that the initial guidance and advice that many people seek in respect of everyday problems can probably be conveniently and competently provided by a range of organisations, such as citizens advice bureaux, law centres, certain local government advisory facilities and, indeed, organisations such as Shelter. It may be more sensible to use such sources of advice than to expect individuals to seek out solicitors, fill up legal advice and assistance forms and enter into the now necessary protocols for someone to become a client of a solicitor.</p><p>Mr MacAskill is correct to say that such sources need to be resourced. It must be recognised that those advisory sources, although they are in many respects excellent, have limitations. If it is clear that the individual has a problem that might have significant personal or financial implications, legal advice may be necessary, and the sooner it is obtained the better. It seems to me that, if we can clear our minds about what may be appropriate for that stratum of general provision of advice, which is sought and required throughout Scotland, we may be able to leave solicitors to concentrate on clients for whom specific legal advice is required. It is certainly worth examining the current structures that govern funding of such advice.</p><p>As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is not in the interests of the public or of justice as a whole if solicitors are walking away from legal aid practice. It is also not in the interests of the legal profession if good court lawyers have no interest in staying in that area of practice. I know that it is popular to disparage and denigrate lawyers, but the great majority of lawyers do a good job and bring much comfort to clients. In my opinion, the Justice 1 Committee's report was on the right lines in suggesting that payments under the legal aid and legal advice and assistance schemes should be linked to introduction of a quality assurance scheme. I support that, as I support peer review.</p><p>Lawyers are no different from any other group of workers. When they are young, they are inexperienced, and they need to acquire experience. When they have acquired that <place-holder colnum=\"18328\"/> experience, they are a valuable source of advice to clients and of education to the legal profession. The best example that a young lawyer can have in the profession is an older, more experienced and wiser colleague. It seems to me&#8212;these are my personal suggestions for consideration&#8212;that we need to move on to a system in which the level of payment depends on the seniority and accredited expertise of practitioners. To give a purely illustrative example, the first level might be for solicitors with five years' experience or less, the next for five to 10 years' experience and the next for perhaps 10 to 20 years' experience. That could be conjoined with higher payment for accredited expertise in specific areas of practice, such as medical negligence cases.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343492", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Aid Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to the Minister for Justice for arriving after the commencement of her speech, but I was at a meeting with my Justice 2 Committee clerk.

If a practitioner specialises and qualifies in a certain area of work, I think that that practitioner would want accreditation, which could be acknowledged in any consideration of a legal aid formula.</p><p>My suggestion would mean that, from the earliest stage, a client had the option of seeking general or more specialised advice. I would have thought that that could only be helpful to the process of a case and to the Scottish Legal Aid Board's having confidence in the suitability of the practitioner to handle the case. That approach may be particularly relevant at the legal advice and assistance stage. We tend to get hung up on legal aid and funding of cases in court, but if an expert experienced solicitor advises a client early, the advice may be that there is no case, so the matter will never proceed to court. The advice might also be, \"There is a case, and with my expertise I can negotiate a settlement.\" Such a settlement could be successfully effected without a case going to court, which would mean that the legal aid fund was not required or accessed to fund litigation.</p><p>I see no reason why that general approach could not work equally well for civil and criminal cases. What is becoming unsustainable is a set payment for work, regardless of whether a solicitor is 23 or 43 and regardless of whether a solicitor <place-holder colnum=\"18329\"/> has no specific expertise or professionally acknowledged and accredited expertise. That system is no longer serving the public interest or the public purse, and it is no longer serving a soundly based, roundly qualified legal profession.</p><p>Change can be made, and I think that it can be made without another national body being set up. In that connection, I sound a cautionary note. I am a little apprehensive about any proposal to introduce bureaucracies. All the components exist to effect and deliver change, provided that we are able to give political leadership on what form that change should take.

It <place-holder colnum=\"17761\"/> would have been helpful and timely if the Executive had offered such an opportunity sooner.</p><p>As someone who lives in the middle of the beleaguered Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area, I am no stranger to the challenges and difficulties that confront the NHS in Scotland and I am certainly no stranger to the frustration, bewilderment and anger that constituents who live in that area have expressed about an administration that, over the past four to five years, has been characterised by crisis and dogged by lack of confidence.</p><p>Let me outline the damning chronicle of events. In 2001, the Minister for Health and Community Care had to send in a management task force to investigate the scale of mismanagement. That team found a culture of managerial and financial incompetence and a deficit that was projected to rise to &#163;100 million in 2007-08. In 2002, four senior managers resigned. As Audit Scotland's report and the recent report by the Audit Committee disclosed, matters deteriorated further. The ensuing crisis induced the recent ministerial statement.</p><p>The human face of all that is represented by the patients who have grappled with threats to maternity services at Inverclyde royal hospital and Vale of Leven hospital, the closure of A and E services at Vale of Leven, the removal of consultancy-led maternity services from both hospitals and an ever-increasing reliance on the already overstretched resources at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley. That outcome presented tensions and anxieties for patients, not to mention the sheer practical challenges of transportation.</p><p>A deep-seated and corrosive lack of confidence in governance at both Scottish Executive and local levels has developed among patients and professional workers in the NHS. I commend the professionalism and dedication of health service workers in Argyll and Clyde during what have been very trying times. The malaise to which I have referred is accompanied by a palpable cynicism that no one is listening and no one cares. Six years down the road of devolution, who would have thought that such an impasse could have been reached in the delivery of such an essential public service?</p><p>The recent declaration that the days of NHS Argyll and Clyde are numbered has simply exacerbated the low morale and cynicism. I repeat the call that I made on the day of Mr Kerr's statement for the Executive to assume interim responsibility for the administration of the board's affairs&#8212;that is the only acceptable way forward.</p><p>Quite simply, we are in a state of flux. There is no doubt that the Kerr report has implications for <place-holder colnum=\"17762\"/> the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area. The former regime drew up proposals for the closure of the Victoria infirmary in Helensburgh, the Dumbarton joint hospital, Ravenscraig hospital in Greenock and the mental health hospital at Lochgilphead. Are those proposals to be withdrawn or are they to be put on ice and, if so, for how long? How can the Kerr report be considered for the Argyll and Clyde area, who is to do that and what strategy is to be deployed?</p><p>For all those reasons, the only sensible way forward is for the Executive to run an interim administration. We are talking about the most crisis-fraught health board in Scotland. The people in the area and the professional workers who work in the service need leadership, guidance and reassurance. Heaven knows, the people of Port Glasgow, Greenock and Gourock are due that minimum reassurance after all they have been through, as are the people of the Vale of Leven, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire and the surrounding area.</p><p>I turn to the broader platform of the debate. There must be a genuine debate on whether the present system of governance of the NHS and the mechanisms for the delivery of health care in Scotland are working. The patients of Argyll and Clyde would say resoundingly that they are not. They want more control over and a greater say in how and from where their health care services are procured. At the moment, they feel uninvolved in, disengaged from and powerless to influence such matters. That situation is unacceptable and, in a devolved Scotland, unsustainable.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the motion in the name of my colleague David McLetchie makes clear, this morning's debate provides a welcome and necessary opportunity to debate the structure of the national health service in Scotland post the Kerr report.

Similarly, we welcome the Executive's efforts to work with European and international criminal justice agencies to catch more big-time criminals. We have no difficulty in supporting those aspects of the Executive's motion.</p><p>I am also pleased that the minister is talking about strengthening the SDEA. A good first step would be to rename that organisation more accurately. I wonder how many members of the public have any idea that the Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency deals with much more than drugs; indeed, it deals with some of the most serious crime in Scotland. Perhaps its previous name&#8212;the Scottish Crime Squad&#8212;was more fitting.</p><p>That technicality aside, I remain worried about the impact on the SDEA of the new serious and organised crime agency; I think that Kenny MacAskill alluded to that. I have one or two questions for the minister that I hope will be addressed later on in the debate. I am still not clear how the SDEA is expected to interact with the new body, because the new body will also be present in Scotland. I am also interested to ascertain whether the minister anticipates having <place-holder colnum=\"17006\"/> regular meetings with the Home Office to ensure that she and her colleagues are not left out in the cold.</p><p>Another way in which we should clamp down on criminals and on drugs entering the country is by improving policing at our borders.

Prison will not work if there is automatic early release and if rehabilitation <place-holder colnum=\"16571\"/> provision in prison is not sustained and effective.</p><p>I deplore the decision to stop mandatory random drug testing in our prisons. I know that the Executive is concerned about the high rate of reoffending by discharged prisoners, but if they emerge without the education and training that they need to re-enter the community, reoffending will be a risk. If a drug addictive prisoner who is still dependent on drugs re-enters the community, reoffending is an even higher risk. Unless such issues are addressed, discharged prisoners will continue to reoffend and it will be tempting for people to say&#8212;although it would be misjudged&#8212;that prison per se does not work.</p><p>I conclude by urging the Executive to prioritise the fundamentals of all criminal justice systems: improving policing levels; reducing the crime that is committed; and identifying what makes certain individuals repeat their criminal activity. That might be dealt with outside prison, but if prison is the court disposal, the Executive should prioritise ending automatic early release and create a regime in the prison that will reduce opportunities for reoffending and improve meaningful rehabilitation by steering convicted criminals away from crime.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-2736.1, to leave out from first \"believes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the unacceptable rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today; accepts that there is a place in our criminal justice system for a range of different sentencing options to address this problem but recognises that, when a prison sentence is the appropriate disposal, then prison is not simply a punishment but is intended to rehabilitate, deter and protect the public; believes that the way to reduce reoffending and subsequently the prison population is to reduce the overall incidence of crime in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the police presence in our communities to deter and detect crime and to end automatic early release from our prisons to ensure honesty in sentencing.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13339156", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. I have been generous.

In February last year, the inspector of prisons identified that, of women who were admitted to Cornton Vale, 90 per cent had addiction problems, 80 per cent had a history of mental illness and more than 60 per cent had a history of being abused. Those statistics build a helpful, albeit depressing, picture of why certain women are drawn into a pattern of petty crime followed by more serious crime that results in a prison sentence.</p><p>As the Executive can see, my party is not at variance with the terms of the motion, which identify existing deficiencies in the handling of women offenders, in the facilities that are currently available to such offenders and in the sensitive balance that is involved in preparing women offenders for re-entry into the community. Just as it would be wrong not to recognise the praiseworthy dedication of prison governors and officers in dealing with the female prison population, it would be wrong not to comment on the positive improvements and innovations that have taken place in the way in which Cornton Vale deals with women in prison.</p><p>However, there is no doubt that there still exist barriers and challenges to women when they <place-holder colnum=\"15910\"/> leave prison and seek to re-enter society. In my view, there must be a far better linkage between the tackling of drug addiction, mental health problems and the personal frailties of women when they are in prison and the environment that the women will encounter on leaving prison. From a position of support, I say that it is not just necessary but absolutely essential that we improve those linkages.</p><p>I want to pay tribute to, and promote the cause of, prison chaplains. They do a tremendous and largely unsung job that brings a unique dimension to the prison environment. By offering a point of contact to prisoners and prison staff that is not compromised with the taint of authority, regime or institution, prison chaplains can give comfort and support in situations in which anyone else would be intrusive.</p><p>I turn to the amendment in my name. Although the motion is principally concerned with the position of women in prison, many important additional elements must be considered in relation to female offending. There will be situations in which a judge seeks to find an alternative disposal to prison that will offer a woman a real chance to address the issues that are contributing to her criminality. The minister referred to the 218 time-out centre, which operates in Glasgow. It is an interesting innovation that is already benefiting many women. However, it will be important to track the progress of women going through the centre. In particular, we must determine whether the support and help that they receive at the centre has a long-term benefit once it has concluded.</p><p>Clearly, however, that facility can deal with only a small proportion of women offenders suffering from drug, alcohol or drug and alcohol problems. That is why my amendment attempts to expand the worthy intentions of the Executive motion with a view to recognising that, with early intervention, support and advice, there is a great deal that can be done to steer women away from a path of criminality.</p><p>Anyone who has appeared in Glasgow district court on a Monday morning&#8212;and seen me in my role as a solicitor, or my colleague Bill Aitken sitting on the bench&#8212;cannot help but be distressed by the spectacle of women who have found themselves in an extremely distressing situation. It is a dreary and deeply upsetting prospect. Better by far that young women who are developing chaotic lifestyles are identified and supported rather than left to exist in chaos until the necessary and inevitable intervention of the criminal justice system. I urge the Executive to consider again how we approach the issue of drug and alcohol abuse in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"15911\"/></p><p>We have to be able to provide, on a universal basis, swifter referral from social workers, general practitioners or the police to advice, counselling and supportive rehabilitation. Further, we must respect the wishes of people with addictions who do not want to be put on methadone or, if they are on methadone, want to be taken off it. We would all agree that Professor McKeganey's research, which was published last October, disclosed a situation that, at best, commands further discussion and debate and, at worst, is deeply troubling. I urge the Executive to consider a sensible response to that research and also to consider ensuring that there is a far greater involvement of the voluntary and charitable sector in trying to frame that response.</p><p>I said at the start that I welcome this debate. I hope that all parties will feel able to support my amendment.

Gun control is a serious issue and I believe that it is best served by there being a uniform approach throughout the United Kingdom, although I concede that there are practical differences to be found between Scotland and England.</p><p>Thankfully, we have not seen the surge in gun crime and gang warfare that has been witnessed in England. In the past week alone, we have seen four men convicted of the shootings of Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, which occurred last new year, as well as the conviction of Peter Williams for the murder of the jeweller Marian Bates. Gun crime, involving both banned and legal guns, has doubled in England since 1997. I am pleased to note that that trend has not been replicated in Scotland, and I think that we should be prepared to speak about that, as it highlights the fact that firearms legislation, which applies equally north and south of the border, cannot guarantee a consistent response. Although Scotland has not seen the surge in gun crime that has taken place south of the border, that is not to say that there is room for complacency. On the contrary, despite the introduction of the handgun legislation at Westminster, there continues to be handgun-related crime in Scotland. I draw members' attention to the fact that, tragically, since 1998 there have been 259 murders, attempted murders and robberies involving pistols and revolvers, the vast majority of that category of weaponry being banned. Sadly, banning those guns did not prevent those crimes from occurring. Indeed, there have been more crimes of that type involving pistols and revolvers, which are largely banned, than crimes of that type involving air-guns.</p><p>What it is vital to remember, and what those statistics demonstrate, is that bans and legislation do not on their own prevent tragedies and crimes from occurring. In Scotland today, drink-driving is banned, but in 2003 more than 11,000 drink-driving offences were recorded. Drugs are outlawed, yet we have a growing drugs problem. Last year, almost 1 million crimes and offences were committed in Scotland&#8212;all incidents in which the perpetrator broke the law. Legislation alone will not prevent individuals who are intent on breaking the law from breaking the law.</p><p>In tandem with the law, we also need a robust enforcement regime. That means that we must have police out and about in our communities deterring and detecting crime. I know that the minister is now persuaded of the wisdom of what has been happening in New York, where crime fell dramatically when a zero-tolerance approach to crime was adopted, along with an increase in the police presence on the streets. Low-level crime <place-holder colnum=\"15680\"/> and antisocial behaviour cannot be tolerated. Whether they involve broken windows or attacks on firemen carrying out their lawful duty, such offences are simply not acceptable. However, if they go unchecked, they create a breeding ground for more serious crime. What we need at the moment is not so much more law as more police officers on our streets. I know that the Executive disputes the statistics, but how can the 140 police officers who are on our streets at any one time possibly achieve the required community coverage? Mr Henry disputed those statistics, but I refer ministers to their own document, \"Narrowing the Gap\".</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is inevitable that, in a debate of this nature, attention is focused on the recent tragedy of the death of two-year-old Andrew Morton.

I, too, will concentrate my attention on that yard.</p><p>As a lawyer, I was often asked to plead cases that, on frank inspection, were perhaps less than robust, but it would have been a joy to be asked to plead the case for a company such as Ferguson Shipbuilders. As has been said, the company has a proven reputation of skill and experience in building quality craft. As Bruce McFee said, the company has not lacked customers elsewhere. We know that Western Ferries, which is not a public sector company, procures ferries from Ferguson's, so pricing seems to be acceptable.</p><p>Ferguson's has a highly trained and experienced workforce that has a good contract performance record. We also know of Ferguson's significance <place-holder colnum=\"15661\"/> to the local economy. Its wages bill is estimated at some &#163;7 million per annum, but that excludes local suppliers, who probably account for the employment of another 100 people in the local economy. The two local colleges&#8212;James Watt College of Further and Higher Education in Greenock and Reid Kerr College in Paisley&#8212;are used to provide training and skills for the apprentice workers who start off in Ferguson's.</p><p>The case for Ferguson's is not difficult to prove; the difficulty lies with the people to whom we need to prove it. I will try to observe the tradition that members' business debates should not be hostile or contentious, but in the speeches that have been made I detect the most concerted and obvious desire to ask the Executive to show political leadership. There are unexplained questions about why countries in other parts of Europe manage to place their contracts with their own yards. Concerns have been expressed by Ferguson's about how other yards have managed to secure contracts when, on a price-comparison basis, there is apparently no contest.</p><p>If people such as Robert Breckenridge, Crawford McKechnie, Alex Logan, Sean Finke and William Small&#8212;who are all workers at Ferguson's and members of the GMB union&#8212;can fight for their yard alongside the company's chief executive, Alan Dunnet, and managing director, Richard Deane, questions must be posed about the role of the Scottish Executive. I ask the minister to give us evidence that the Executive is prepared to fight for the precious, precious shipbuilding industry on the lower Clyde.</p><p>Let me quote something that I read in today's <em>Evening Times</em>:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need, in Edinburgh and Westminster, the clear demonstration that there is the political will to ensure the yards on the Upper and Lower Clyde, are given a fair deal - the kind of treatment our neighbours in the EU give to their shipyards.\"</p><p>That quote comes not from one of the Executive's political opponents but from Trish Godman, who is a member of one of the Executive parties.</p><p>I also refer members to Jack McConnell's response to my question at First Minister's question time on 3 February, when I raised the issue of Ferguson's.

In an increasingly complex technological age, the law must develop to meet new challenges. I read the bill before I read the Justice 1 Committee's report, which is a very good piece of work. My first realisation was that section 1 of the bill does not deal with what I would describe as questionable communications; rather, it defines an offence that is constituted by a series of events. Therefore, I was comforted by the committee's sensible observations in paragraphs 81 and 82 of its report, which recognise that gap.</p><p>A political decision is needed about striking at communications to a young person that would, if they were known about, cause concern to the young person's parent or guardian. The question is whether we should strike at any communications between an individual and a young person or only at communications that contain sexual allusions that are likely to corrupt and deprave. The first option is impractical, but the second is not. Most parents and guardians would be deeply concerned if a young person was receiving such material. Stewart Stevenson graphically described how quickly such communications can materialise through the internet. In such situations, a parent or guardian would&#8212;not unreasonably&#8212;think that criminal law would intervene before completion of the series of events that is required to satisfy section 1. We know that communication on at least two occasions, a meeting with the child with criminal intent and unreasonable belief that the child was over 16 would be required. There is an argument that the existing criminal law covers such communications; indeed, lewd and libidinous conduct has been invoked as a charge that has led to conviction and the committee's report refers to such an incidence. However, the legitimate question that the Executive must answer is whether the common law is sufficiently robust. If it is not, statutory support would seem to be necessary.</p><p>The committee proposed that one option would be to include breach of the peace in the list of sexual offences in part 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 where the nature or circumstances of the offence are clearly sexual. A number of members have referred to that. I agree that the option is worth considering, but my concern is that there may be difficulty in that the basic common-law crime of breach of the peace was not intended to cover such situations. It could be more difficult to prove the charge in the context of a sexual <place-holder colnum=\"15556\"/> communication and to secure a conviction. Members are interested in creating law that allows the Crown a reasonable prospect of conviction when prosecuting cases.</p><p>I have a suggestion to make, which is that it may be possible to draft a simple statutory offence that is constituted by a person's sending to a young person a communication that contains material that is likely to corrupt or deprave. That would allow objective assessment of the circumstances by the courts and it would present simpler cases for prosecutions to prove. The obvious attraction is that, whether by common law or statute, such communications would constitute criminal activity, which would mean that on conviction the offender could be placed on the sexual offenders register and the offence would be constituted without there having been a meeting or series of events.</p><p>I turn briefly to the serious offence that section 1 of the bill will create. My reaction is that it will be difficult for the Crown to cover all the steps that are envisaged by section 1, which is all the more reason why we should consider the communication stage of contact.</p><p>On risk of sexual harm orders, much attention has already been focused on the onus of proof and the balance of evidence and on whether it is to be criminal or civil evidence; the clear intention is that civil procedure be used. The committee has signalled concerns about the appropriateness of civil procedure; I echo those concerns.</p><p>I will pose some questions about the procedure for an RSHO and the evidence requirement. If I read the section correctly, there is no provision for serving the application on the respondent and it creates no right of response to, or justifies appearance by, the respondent. Is the application to be in the form of an initial writ, for example? Will that mean that it will then follow standard sheriff court procedure? It seems to me that if there are parties with malign intent who are anxious to discredit an individual, they could present fictitious information that the respondent would be powerless to question. Under the bill as it stands, the respondent's rights are restricted to appeal of the order. If section 2 does not require appearance by the defenders, will cases proceed as undefended civil processes and could the chief constable produce his evidence by affidavit? Those are important questions because the chief constable has to produce evidence that on at least two occasions the individual has&#8212;to quote section 2(1)(a)&#8212;\"done an act\". Does the chief constable simply say by affidavit that he is satisfied that on two occasions the individual has \"done an act\"? Is that to be the evidence? If it is, it is very frail.</p><p>I have genuine concerns about what section 2 of the bill means in terms of the technicalities of production of evidence and the rights of <place-holder colnum=\"15557\"/> respondents to question legitimately what evidence might amount to.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336575", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Pauline McNeill's fright was nothing compared to mine.

I realise that such extramural activity is regarded as positively provocative in certain quarters, but I am unyielding.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to modernise and reform charity law in Scotland. However, it is quite wrong to assume that no previous law existed&#8212;I shall come to that later&#8212;or that the previous law contains no important components that might continue to be relevant. Given the purpose of charitable endeavour&#8212;particularly with regard to the people whom it seeks to assist&#8212;it is important that we do not in legislation make that task more difficult, more burdensome and more expensive than at present. If we do, the losers will be the very people who are in need of help.</p><p>The extreme prospect&#8212;if the bill were to create confusion, duplicate obligations for charities operating in other parts of the United Kingdom and confront charities in Scotland with unsustainable costs&#8212;is that some charities would cease and, equally alarmingly, that others would not start. It is from that perspective that I wish to make the following points, which, in essence, are technical.</p><p>The first question that will confront any charity in Scotland, either existing or proposed, is what it is required to do if the bill becomes law. I am not clear about the answer to that. Although the bill will set up a charity regulator, a Scottish charity register and an application framework and give guidance on how applications are to be dealt with, <place-holder colnum=\"15121\"/> I see no obligation requiring every charitable organisation to register. The sanction for an organisation that does not register may be that it will lose its status as a charity for Inland Revenue purposes, but that is not stated in the bill. Indeed, the evidence taken by the Communities Committee confirms, as far as I can understand, that a charity might satisfy the Inland Revenue test but not the test under the bill. If so, that raises two questions. First, why would a charity bother registering under the bill as long as it has Inland Revenue approval? Secondly, is it not our desire, within reason, to bring all charitable organisations within a framework of light-touch regulation and accountability? The Executive needs to put those points beyond doubt on the face of the bill.</p><p>In evidence to the committee, the chief executive of OSCR said in response to questions from my colleague Mary Scanlon about the Inland Revenue and OSCR:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is like three-dimensional chess. I can say only that we are doing our best in discussions to ensure that there is alignment of definition and practice.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 26 January 2005; c 1688.]</p><p>The purpose of the Parliament is to produce not games of three-dimensional chess, but lucid legislation that meets the objectives that it is intended to meet. The Executive must clarify those issues.</p><p>I have a specific concern about section 7, which sets out the criteria for the charity test. The danger of resorting to subject-specific definition is the high risk of omission, to which Donald Gorrie rightly alluded. Given the criteria, it seems that certain organisations will be excluded. The question has already arisen in relation to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, but what about Hearing Dogs for Deaf People and Guide Dogs for the Blind? I assume that the fact that those charities do not specifically address the health issues of hearing and sight impairment excludes them from the charitable purpose of advancement of health, although they provide essential services to people who are affected by those conditions.</p><p>What about the animal welfare criterion? Does that relate to domesticated animals or wild animals and does it cover wild animals in captivity? I do not know, but I have serious concerns, particularly given the evidence to the Communities Committee that the bill repeals all existing charity law, in contrast to the Westminster Charities Bill, which will retain existing common law and the charitable status of existing charities. That evidence is extremely important because it also relates to the public benefit and charitable status issues. Ann Swarbrick, a solicitor with Anderson Strathern, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The common law that has decided what is charitable is rather far-reaching and complex. Part of the common law <place-holder colnum=\"15122\"/></p><p>defines public benefit. There are two strands. The first is public benefit tests, some of which are in section 8. The second defines types of charities, such as those for promoting the charitable sector and the relief of unemployment.</p><p class=\"indent\">If we swept away the common law, as the Scottish bill proposes to do, we could jettison such types of charities, unless they are specifically covered by the 13 purposes in the first part of the Scottish charity test. I am afraid that the answer to whether such charities are covered is that that is, at best, uncertain. In many cases, the problem is not that they definitely would not be covered by the Scottish charity test, but that the whole thing is uncertain, which potentially leaves many charities in Scotland uncertain as to whether they are covered. That is not good enough.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-12-15.12920.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 15 December 2004; c 1504.]</citation></p><p>I strongly urge the Executive not to jettison the common law, which has a helpful and important role. As the Law Society of Scotland said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"pre-existing charity law and charities recognised under that law should be acknowledged and specified in the Bill.\"</p><p>That is not just sound legal advice; it is overwhelming common sense.</p><p>We should take a closer look at what is happening at Westminster and ensure greater alignment with the Westminster proposals and total alignment with the Inland Revenue. That may mean that, if an organisation has charitable status under United Kingdom revenue law, that would justify its inclusion on the Scottish register. There must be far greater cohesion between what we seek to achieve through the bill and its current text.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335321", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I should declare certain charitable activities.

It is only right to acknowledge that: it would be inappropriate to expect the minister to make any specific commitment this evening. However, I hope that the debate will provide an opportunity for those of us who, like Bruce McFee, are aware of what our <place-holder colnum=\"15085\"/> scouting movement achieves in the Renfrewshire area, and particularly what the Lapwing Lodge facility provides in the pursuit of that endeavour, to tease out some issues that the minister will find informative.</p><p>Bruce McFee referred to the exemplary definition of voluntary activity given by the First Minister on 7 June 2002. It is against that encouraging backdrop that I make the following observations. Where we have such a reservoir of good will, commitment and community public-spiritedness as we find among those who work with our scouts, the Scottish Executive's providing some help would be a gilt-edged investment: the Scottish Executive would be adding to a proven investment of worth and achievement.</p><p>I am also aware, from meetings with representatives of the Scout Association in the Renfrew and Inverclyde area and from a voluminous exchange of correspondence with Mr McCallum, who is a veritable latter-day Pepys when it comes to communicating with members of the Scottish Parliament and keeping them aware of the details, that there is genuine frustration about how resource can be accessed for such worthy projects as Lapwing Lodge in Renfrewshire.</p><p>I met officials from the national lottery community fund in Glasgow. It appears that there is a certain rigidity in how lottery funding is to be made available, which has the very undesirable consequence that excellent projects such as the modernisation and expansion of the facilities at Lapwing Lodge might not have a clear application path to follow.</p><p>The Scottish rural partnership fund, which is responsible for the local capital grants scheme, is a desirable and necessary source of provision, but whether it offers the best way of dealing with funding for a volunteer community project is perhaps another matter. However, it seems to be the only game in town. I know from parliamentary questions and correspondence with the minister and his predecessor that ministers are confronted with genuine technical difficulties. In June, I received a letter from Mr Allan Wilson in which he said, in reference to an unsuccessful application for help:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Projects which are solely or predominantly for the benefit of one organisation or group within a community, e.g. young people or older people, are not eligible for LCGS funding.\"</p><p>I reiterate the point that Bruce McFee made about the organisations other than the Scout Association that use Lapwing Lodge. According to the information that I have, 22 uniformed organisations, 56 community organisations and seven international organisations use the facility.

This debate has already reflected that. On one side, people argue about the defence of civil liberties; on the other, people argue for the maximum protection of the state. However, it is fair to say that we would not be debating this issue were it not for the events of 11 September 2001.</p><p>Conservatives would not have countenanced compulsory ID cards before 9/11, but since 9/11 it has been incumbent on all of us to examine carefully any measures that might enhance the nation's security. Identity cards, if introduced properly and effectively, might indeed help to do that. However, it should be remembered that, even if the Identity Cards Bill is passed at Westminster, the introduction of ID cards will take years. It is vital that any legislative proposal be subjected to searching scrutiny and thorough debate.</p><p>We have to accept that a modern world, with the increasing use of new and emerging technologies, requires new safeguards and frameworks to govern how information is used. We have to listen to the views of people such as the police, who tell us that the cards will help them to wage a war on crime, and the security services, who tell us that the cards will be a useful weapon against terrorism. However, we must be sensitive to the legitimate privacy of the law-abiding individual and ensure that fundamental issues of liberty are adequately addressed.</p><p>Although Conservatives support the principle of ID cards, we have a great deal of sympathy with the Green party motion. The Government has failed to give enough time for proper scrutiny of this important bill. During the committee stage of the bill, six and half of the clauses were not even debated and much of the remainder was rushed through.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of key questions have not been answered. First, we must be clear about the purpose of ID cards. As Patrick Harvie said, <place-holder colnum=\"14721\"/> one of the main objections to the wartime identity card was mission creep. The card began with three distinct purposes and ended up with 39. In the debate on the current bill, the Government has claimed that a national identity card is needed for everything&#8212;from benefits and services to dealing with people trafficking. It is important to understand precisely what the Government's priority is. The Government must make clear the specific purposes for which an ID card is required.</p><p>Secondly, we must be clear about the capabilities of the technology&#8212;a point that Stewart Stevenson raised. Biometrics technology is not infallible. The system must be robust&#8212;from the card and biometric reader, through to the communications system and right into the central computer, database and software. I have to say, Presiding Officer, that if electronic data in this Parliament can confuse me with Robin Harper, such frightening technical frailties would be completely unacceptable in any system for ID cards&#8212;I see the members of the Green party applauding; I did not expect my point to be so warmly received.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson made a very good point when he suggested that the bill, once enacted, could give legal effect to technical error. That is a troubling thought.</p><p>Thirdly, we know that what the Government is proposing is one of the most ambitious technology projects that this country has ever seen. The Government therefore has to have in place the organisation capable of introducing the scheme. There is no evidence that that is yet the case.</p><p>The scheme will have to be cost effective, but we know that costs have already soared. They have almost doubled overnight, from &#163;3 billion to &#163;5.5 billion.</p><p>Finally, we have to examine the very real concerns over civil liberties that are at the heart of the anxieties that many members have expressed&#8212;especially as this scheme comes from a Government that seems to have no concerns for civil liberties whatsoever and that displays an increasingly sinister obsession with political control, with a consequent disregard of individual freedom.</p><p>In an ideal world, we would not need identity cards. Sadly, our world is not ideal but increasingly dangerous. It may be necessary to legislate for the possible introduction of ID cards. However, because the Government has failed to answer material questions on the issue, the Scottish Conservatives will support the Green party motion.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334301", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Identity Cards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that we have all noted the irony in Mr Purvis's concluding remarks.

As I did at the stage 1 debate, I pay tribute to our fire service in Scotland for the work that it does. At stage 1, I said that I have been the beneficiary of the service's skill and expertise. We should be under no illusions about how vital the service is to Scotland.</p><p>In consideration of any legislation, it is important that we are clear that attempts to modernise services are proceeding in a reasonably transparent and readily understood fashion. I thank the minister for his comments in respect of the Justice 2 Committee and repeat my thanks to members of the committee, of which I am the convener. The committee found the bill an interesting piece of legislation to scrutinise and we had good debates. At stage 2, the Executive made considerable progress in allaying legitimate concerns that existed at stage 1.</p><p>The Conservative party was sufficiently unclear about the Executive's intentions in the text on the face of the bill to feel unable to support the bill at stage 1. We lodged an amendment that was not agreed to, which left us unable to support the bill at that stage, because of genuine concern about lack of clarity. However, I am grateful to the minister for emphasising at stage 2 his desire to achieve a degree of transparency and for giving members of the Justice 2 Committee certain welcome reassurances that we accepted in the spirit in which they were given. As our doubts have been reasonably dispelled, Conservative members intend to support the bill this afternoon.<place-holder colnum=\"14620\"/></p><p>As has been mentioned in the debate and during consideration of amendments, there are some residual concerns about the bill. I refer to the briefing from the Fire Brigades Union. The FBU may be surprised to hear this from someone such as me, but I thought that its briefing, as a model of lucidity, took some beating. It was a very clear piece of work. I might not have agreed with everything in the document, but I certainly felt that it was very well prepared.</p><p>Shona Robison has referred to control rooms, and so shall I. The minister said in his response that the consultation is still to happen, but he said specifically that the matter would come back to Parliament via the committee. Although that is reassuring in a general sense, we would all welcome a slightly more specific indication of what form that return of information will take. Perhaps the minister will expand on that when he winds up.</p><p>The other relevant issue that the FBU raised concerns the national framework document. I expressed concern during the stage 1 debate that the content of that important and significant strategic document was still pretty vague at the time of the bill's drafting and that it would be subject to consultation and final clarification before the Parliament. I accept that that parliamentary scrutiny will be a safeguard, but the FBU makes some legitimate points about the need to ensure that the document reflects slightly greater diversity in policies and procedures. I was sympathetic to some of the points that the FBU raised in that regard and I draw to the minister's attention the need to be sure that the document takes a truly comprehensive and holistic approach. If we want the legislation to provide the most modernised service that we can achieve, the content of that document will be pivotal in trying to attain that objective.</p><p>Some of the Executive's amendments at stage 3 did a lot to dispel residual concerns. I am pleased to see that there will be a reliance on affirmative rather than negative procedure in the Parliament for certain provisions. That is a conciliatory sign from the Executive and I receive it as such.</p><p>In short, my party welcomes the bill&#8212;it is a solid piece of work for the future. I hope that it will create the type of modern conditions that we all want for our fire service personnel.

To be frank, it is allowing the <place-holder colnum=\"14451\"/> Parliament to be used as an expensive and impotent social salon. We should be discussing subjects such as drug abuse, to which Stewart Stevenson has referred. Nobody is in any doubt about the seriousness of drug abuse in Scotland. Although there has been an increase in the number of drugs-related crimes that are recorded, there has been a drop in the number of such crimes that are prosecuted. Perhaps the minister, or whoever closes the debate for the Executive, might wish to comment on that. In 1997, 8,219 people were proceeded against in Scottish courts for drugs crime; by 2002, the figure had fallen by 16 per cent. Does the Lord Advocate wish to comment on drugs-related deaths?</p><p>I merely articulate those issues, because I do not expect the Executive to agree with my views on them and it would not expect me to agree with it, but at least we could have a debate on a number of them, all of which are hugely relevant to Scotland today. We could consider various other issues, such as policing. Proposals on policing are on the table, but there is no agreement on them in the Parliament. My party's proposal for elected conveners for police boards is attracting interest in communities that are plagued by disorder and, although the Executive does not agree with that proposal, the subject could still be debated.</p><p>We could also debate sentencing. The public have lost confidence in sentencing policy. It is all very well for the Lord Advocate and his colleagues to do their best to deliver an efficient, modernised prosecution system in Scotland, but if confidence in the whole criminal justice system dissipates because of an inability to understand how sentencing works and why prisoners get out early automatically, we are not assisting the public to understand the totality of our criminal justice system&#8212;all they know is that sickening crimes have been perpetrated by people who were free to commit them because they were released automatically.

I speak as someone who has been a victim in a criminal case in which the accused was duly convicted. Not only does such support provide individual reassurance; it plays an important role in encouraging people to do their civic duty. There is no doubt that significant progress has been made in the past 20 years. A courtroom is a serious forum and it is inevitable that the atmosphere will be austere and sometimes forbidding, but it is vital that no witness should be so intimidated that the giving of essential evidence is inhibited or impaired. In that event, justice will not be served and the criminal justice system will be discredited.</p><p>It is right to acknowledge the progress that has been made, to which the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 has made an important contribution. There is no doubt that special measures such as closed-circuit television, video evidence, evidence on commission, the use of screens and the use of a supporter do much to dispel austerity and apprehension and to offer reassurance. However, the 2004 act is in its early days and the minister will be aware that the phased implementation defers certain measures. It is also right to acknowledge the Executive's strategy for victims, which was launched in 2001. A report in November showed the progress that had been made on that issue.</p><p>I have several observations. First, delays still occur. Nothing is more irritating or off-putting to witnesses and victims than to be subjected to abortive court proceedings because a witness cannot be found or the accused has not turned up. Such delays still take place and too many of them lead to proceedings being abandoned. Written answers to parliamentary questions have shown that, last year, 9,000 cases in the sheriff courts were marked \"no proceedings\" because of delay or the time bar. For every case marked \"no pro\", there is a potential denial of justice and a frustrated and angry victim and, probably, frustrated and angry witnesses.</p><p>Secondly, the victim information and advice service may have been extended to all 11 procurator fiscal areas, which is welcome, but who is monitoring the system and is it operating consistently throughout those areas? For example, <place-holder colnum=\"13536\"/> are victims being told when a petition is going to be served and, which is important, when it has been served?</p><p>Thirdly, we now have a presumption in favour of bail, which is allowing many individuals who have been charged with serious crimes to walk the streets. That leaves many victims and witnesses feeling frightened and vulnerable, results in accused persons not turning up for trial, which causes adjourned trial diets, and allows reoffending during the bail period. The interference in the court's primary responsibility to ensure the victim's peace of mind, to protect the public, detain an accused person who is likely to abscond and to exercise judicial discretion accordingly is intolerable. The availability of bail to people charged with serious crimes is utterly unacceptable. When such individuals, many of whom offend on bail and fail to appear for trial, are cosseted with rights while victims are left afraid and the law-abiding majority is put at risk, we have reached unprecedented levels of absurdity. Something has to be done about that, which is why I refer to the matter in my amendment.</p><p>Implicit in any discussion of witnesses and victims is the acknowledgement that crimes have already been committed. In that regard, I will deal with the criticisms of my amendment that were proffered by the minister and Mr MacAskill. Surely a priority should be given to trying to reduce violent crime, drug crime, rape, attempted rape, handling of offensive weapons and criminal homicide, the incidence of all of which is well up on 1997 levels. If we can reduce such crime&#8212;and I am responding here to Mr MacAskill's challenge&#8212;we will have safer communities, fewer victims and, therefore, fewer witnesses. There have to be more police officers in our communities to deter the commission of crime and detect it more swiftly when it is committed.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331299", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If our criminal justice system is to be effective, it is important that vulnerable witnesses and victims are supported throughout the process of cases.

It should come as no surprise at all that on 6 December the Minister for Justice launched Scotland's new criminal justice plan by press release. One might have thought that a plan that was described by the minister as \"ambitious and wide-ranging\" and that comprises five sections and 23 proposals would have merited at least a ministerial statement in the Parliament or an Executive debate. We all know that the Executive has debated far less important issues in the past, so surely an \"ambitious and wide-ranging\" plan merited parliamentary attention. Unfortunately, however, Executive arrogance transcends Executive accountability and, of course, parliamentary debates have the tiresome habit of being embarrassing for the Executive, which is certainly not part of the devolved governance game plan. Therefore, the Conservatives are pleased to rectify the Executive's omission and to bring the Executive's proposals to where they should have been brought in the first place&#8212;the floor of the chamber.</p><p>Of course, we should not be surprised that the Minister for Justice felt impelled to launch her criminal justice plan, but the public could be forgiven for asking where it has been. The Executive's record on crime is appalling. A crime is committed every 78 seconds. Since 1997, violent crime is up 16 per cent, vandalism is up 23 per cent, drug crime is up 38 per cent, figures for handling offensive weapons are up 49 per cent, figures for rape and attempted rape are up 34 per cent and homicide is up 20 per cent. Significant levels of unreported crime must be added to those figures. I am talking about retailers who cannot cope with the hassle of reporting shoplifting and about incidents involving broken windows, dented cars, disorderly behaviour and mindless acts of petty vandalism. Levels of reoffending are also giving cause for concern.<place-holder colnum=\"13006\"/></p><p>Therefore, an Executive criminal justice plan is overdue. Unfortunately, the plan is indicative of confusion, incoherence and paradox. For example, what is the underpinning strategy of the plan? I do not know and I suggest that no one else knows.

That is why we must prioritise the provision of more police officers, which alone would deter first offenders and repeat offenders from committing crime.

The committee has played a useful scrutiny role and, from the minister's comments, I think that he has understood that there is no acrimony around the bill and that there has been a genuine attempt to be constructive. However, as Mr MacAskill said, we have an obligation to test and probe when there is legitimate doubt about the Executive's ultimate intentions.</p><p>The Fire (Scotland) Bill is an important piece of <place-holder colnum=\"11996\"/> legislation. Our fire service is professional and dedicated and I know that I am not alone in the chamber in being in a position to say that I have had occasion to rely on that professionalism and dedication. I pay tribute to the men and women throughout Scotland who demonstrate those qualities day in and day out.</p><p>In 2004, it is fitting that we should review the legislative framework as, in effect, that was last done in 1947. Since then, times have changed. We are in a different environment and there are new duties, challenges and threats, not the least of which is the unwelcome emergence of global terrorism. The Parliament owes it to the men and women of the Scottish fire service to scrutinise the bill carefully. We also owe it to the Scottish people to ensure that the legislation is clear and sufficient to meet the complexities of today's world.</p><p>Much of the new strategy and framework will be set out in the national framework document. Although my committee has seen a draft of that paper, it is private and consultation is to follow. It might have been more satisfactory if the production of the document had been accelerated so that the committee could have fully considered the framework at stage 1. Similarly, the bill depends heavily on secondary legislation and further consultations in relation to control rooms, the firelink project, integrated risk management plans, fire safety regulations, charging and the new advisory structure. Therefore, it is difficult to get a comprehensive or complete view of what the legislation will be like in practice. I simply ask whether that is fair to everyone who will be affected by it. Perhaps it is not. The lesson is that if what has been proposed is worth doing&#8212;and it is&#8212;more detail at the drafting stage and less haste might be beneficial.</p><p>Before dealing with my amendment, I will acknowledge what is positive in the bill. Part 1 contains a clear restatement of the structure of the fire and rescue service, which is clarifying and helpful, and part 2 gives a helpful redefinition of the principal functions of the service. The Executive's intention to lodge an amendment at stage 2 to include offshore firefighting is sensible and welcome. Nowadays, the provisions for emergency direction are&#8212;unhappily&#8212;necessary and the minister has sought to reassure the committee that they are last-resort powers. We accept that reassurance. The consolidation of fire safety legislation in part 3 is certainly complex and technical, but it is also welcome, as it represents a helpful attempt to codify the law and to achieve a degree of consistency throughout the United Kingdom. I would certainly underline the committee's caveats on aspects of all those provisions, but I welcome the minister's comments on chief fire officers and senior fire officers, for example.<place-holder colnum=\"11997\"/></p><p>As for my amendment, I supported the general principles of the bill in committee for the reasons to which I have referred, but I revert to the issue of clarity. The bill will be a powerful and influential measure. That is particularly demonstrated by the creation of a range of ministerial powers. In his evidence, the minister sought to reassure the committee that the exercise of those powers would be highly unusual. I do not impugn his integrity or doubt the sincerity of his remarks&#8212;indeed, he repeated them this morning&#8212;but I believe that legislation must stand clearly on its own merits.</p><p>Let me deal first with the powers that are contained in part 1, in particular the ministerial power to amalgamate fire boards. By any construction, that is a potentially centralising measure, the possible consequence of which could be to reduce the number of boards and brigades. Whatever the nuances in debates about the current situation and what is being proposed, the bill will change existing law.

A facility preserved that cannot cope is just as useless as a facility that is not there at all.

I certainly would not like to see the Parliament with a passive Margaret Curran in non-feisty guise. That would be a deterioration of the situation. I say to her that she should keep her pecker up and we will look forward to continuing exchanges. This may be a rare occasion on which we are significantly in agreement about a piece of legislation. It is good that we are, as the legislation will make a significant difference to property ownership in Scotland.</p><p>The amendment to section 11 was an important recognition by the Executive of something wider than just the position of a purchaser buying a flat and finding it incumbent on them to pay for repairs of which they were completely unaware. It is right <place-holder colnum=\"10350\"/> that, whenever possible, the Parliament tries to recognise and uphold good principles of Scots law. There is much in our Scots law and Scottish legal system that is unique and distinctive. Perhaps more important, it works well and has worked well over centuries. The fundamental principle of buying property has been based on our registration of title system that was the envy of the world for many years. One of the cardinal principles of that was transparency&#8212;long before devolution was ever heard of&#8212;which meant that someone could go to that register and know exactly what burdens, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities went with the property that they proposed to acquire. It has been very important that that principle of Scots law has been recognised and honoured in the bill.</p><p>I hope that the bill will make a significant contribution to improving the regulation of arrangements for those who live in tenement properties and properties of the type defined in the bill. It is a good, solid step forward. As Kenny MacAskill said, there may be technical aspects that we have not got right or aspects about which only time and practice will tell. However, one of the features of the Parliament&#8212;especially in its committee system&#8212;is its review of legislation. That may be a legitimate task for us in future.</p><p>I commend the bill, which will certainly have the support of the Conservative group.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13323318", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tenements (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Tenements (Scotland) Bill probably does not have the people of Partick raising their glasses or the folk in Auchtermuchty jigging in the streets.

Of course, those figures cover only reported crimes. I am not alone among members in having heard first-hand accounts from individuals in our communities who are so fed up with the lack of police and delays in the system that they do not report crimes. Johann Lamont was right to refer to unreported crime, which is now the lurking ogre in every community in Scotland. It is small wonder that 22 per cent of Scots do not feel safe in their neighbourhoods, which is the point to which I think Mr Rumbles alluded. Sadly, throughout Scotland there are only 140 police officers on our streets at any one time. There is no disconnection between what is happening and why people feel apprehensive. Unlike the Executive, people in Scotland still think that lawlessness, disorder and criminal activity are rampant; they know, because they live with it.</p><p>I listened to the First Minister's statement yesterday and to the Minister for Justice today and I by no means discount some of the proposed measures.

I urge the Executive to remember that everything that we do must be with the best interests of children at the fore. To the minister's credit, she acknowledged that, but the Executive must recognise the evidence that a child who is born to a married couple will do better at school and is less likely to suffer from emotional problems. It is wrong to imagine that, because we applaud and recognise the virtue of marriage, we stigmatise other relationships. That is not the consequence.

Those of us who attended the meeting of the save Stobhill campaign on Monday evening will be aware of how intense passions are in respect of Greater Glasgow NHS Board's proposals. That situation is echoed throughout Scotland. The minister must be sensitive to that and be willing to show a listening ear, because the themes that are emerging on this broad base are common to all areas.</p><p>Health care for local communities is disappearing or is in threat of disappearing and local communities feel more and more distant, not just from the care but from having a say in the kind of care that they need. There is increased centralisation. Questions arise, such as what the role of the health boards is, what the role of Government is, and what the role of clinicians is. There is a feeling that patients have too little say and Government has too much control. For that reason, my party supports foundation hospitals. We believe in trying to offer greater choice and giving patients the opportunity to have a greater say on the provision of care. It is important that we understand the general backdrop against which the debate takes place. It is easy to be critical of <place-holder colnum=\"9852\"/> Argyll and Clyde NHS Board&#8212;I share many of the criticisms that Frances Curran articulated&#8212;but the board is purely a bureaucratic deliverer of what it is told to provide within a fixed package of resource. That goes right to the heart of who the provider is&#8212;it must be Government.</p><p>I have read the summary of the consultation document and it seems to me that the proposals are a threat to six hospitals, which will affect hundreds of thousands of people in an area with difficult geography. We should not forget that the geography of the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area is particularly challenging, which gives rise to problems for communities in accessing the care that they need. A three-month period for a consultation on such proposals is simply unacceptable.</p><p>I turn to the specific proposals for Inverclyde royal hospital and the Vale of Leven hospital. We cannot deny those areas the hospital care to which they are entitled. The consultation presents the proposals as an option, but I share Frances Curran's concern about what people are being consulted on. People are being told, \"Here it is&#8212;take it or leave it.\" That is not good enough. There are legitimate arguments about the kind of care that the population mass in Inverclyde and in the Vale of Leven are entitled to expect. The proposals place a question mark over the current provision from those hospitals, with a view to concentrating everything in the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley. In my opinion, that would be impossible because the location of that hospital is difficult, development is constrained by the site and access is problematic&#8212;it is one of the most difficult hospitals to get to.</p><p>The review is not shaping the future; for the area concerned, it is hospital provision meltdown. The proposals are not safe or accessible and they are not acceptable. The consultation should be extended to at least six months. Ideally, the minister should intervene to revisit what the health board is talking about before the consultation process continues. What is at stake is far too important and enduring for the future of the area concerned to leave to something as unacceptable and inadequate as the current proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2004-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322103", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Argyll and Clyde Clinical Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, commend Frances Curran and congratulate her on the passion of her speech, because she is striking a chord that resonates within every person in the chamber and in the areas that are affected.

I would have a deep apprehension about such intervention, because parents may, for very good reasons, decide what access by grandparents is appropriate or not appropriate. If we try to confer rights on grandparents&#8212;rights that are enforceable by law&#8212;we could get into extraordinary situations in which parents have refused to give access and grandparents have gone to law to seek to enforce their right of access.

The Tenements (Scotland) Bill <place-holder colnum=\"8931\"/> helped us to maintain that racy pace. As Nicola Sturgeon indicated, many an afternoon was happily whiled away mulling over the delights of chimney heads, stacks and flues and other riveting integral parts of tenemental property law.</p><p>It would be wrong to say that the exercise was one only for the conveyancing anoraks because, as the minister and Nicola Sturgeon have already indicated, the bill is a watershed in conveyancing law in Scotland. I, too, not only thank the minister for her warm words about the committee and its preparation of the stage 1 report, but pay tribute to the early work that the Scottish Law Commission did on drawing up the bill and thank my fellow committee members and our clerks for their robust work on the stage 1 perusal of the bill.</p><p>My party supports the principles of the bill and considers it to be an important piece of progress, but I will comment briefly on some specific matters. I am glad that the principle of free variation has been recognised. Some people were nervous that the bill would seek to be prescriptive and didactic and to lay down compulsory measures rather than say that it is sufficient if the title deeds do the job adequately. It is right that, if that principle fails, the bill should step in.</p><p>The minister specifically mentioned three points and I am comforted by what she said. I look forward to seeing the amendment on small tenements, but I think that it will remove a possible unfairness and anomaly.</p><p>The question of a purchaser's liability for repairs is perplexing. I noticed that, when the minister referred to the possibility of registering a notice against a title, she said that it was complex, but I argue that it need not be complex. There is a precedent for it: in circumstances in which local authorities have carried out mandatory repairs under statute, notices are recorded against the titles of all the flats, which mean that no seller can give a good title without discharging the debt. It is not rocket science; it is a fairly straightforward procedure, and I urge the minister to consider that carefully.</p><p>Cathie Craigie raised a good point about a sinking fund, or what would be more colloquially described in the trade as a float. That is how many factors operate; there is a practice whereby, when somebody purchases a flat in a tenemental property, they are required to contribute a sum up front as a float to deal with on-going repairs without a debt arising or continuing. Therefore, it is possible to contemplate a scenario in which, to protect the hapless purchaser&#8212;who is totally dependent on a seller's honesty&#8212;from being led up the garden path and having a bill that has nothing to do with them foisted on them, protection is afforded for repairs over a certain level. The <place-holder colnum=\"8932\"/> mechanism for doing that need not be complicated.</p><p>I am comforted by the comment that was made about the proposed amendment on the return of moneys. That issue gave rise to interesting discussion among all members of the committee. We saw what the bill was aiming at but felt that in practice it might achieve unfairness. It tends to be the case that no factor will instruct a contractor to carry out repairs until the factor has all the money in his or her hands, so before that point there is no commencement date. There is something of a chicken-and-egg situation&#8212;what comes first? Although people may want to talk about a commencement date, they do not have that in their hand until the contract is instructed. That is why the committee thought that it was sensible to distinguish between a commencement date and a genuine refund date by which a proprietor would be entitled to recover moneys if there had been an unacceptable delay. I look forward to seeing the proposed amendment.</p><p>I also raised the issue of insurance. The bill seemed to make it mandatory for proprietors to have common insurance when perfectly adequate individual flat insurance might be in place. The committee regarded that as a slightly unwelcome usurping of adequate arrangements and, for that matter, of individual proprietorial rights to make such arrangements. Under the bill, proprietors are required to make arrangements, but there seemed to be an attempt to impose a common insurance policy en bloc, which might not be necessary.</p><p>Subject to those comments, I applaud the bill, which represents a significant step forward.

The first stage of that review concerns principles and objectives and will conclude by mid-July. The second stage is to be a consultation on how we deliver those objectives and will commence in the autumn. In addition, the Justice 2 Committee, of which I am convener, is embarking on a youth justice inquiry. A great deal of useful activity is taking place; therefore, I question the usefulness of our spending a whole day talking about the <place-holder colnum=\"8304\"/> subject&#8212;and talking is what we are doing; we are not even debating the matter. It seems to me that the ground has already been ploughed and harrowed to considerable effect, and I am concerned that, by the end of today, we will be groping through dust. I hope that the Executive will have the sense to allow that dust to settle and let the established lines of investigation run their course.</p><p>I cannot help feeling that what might have been debated today to good effect would have been, for example, what is happening to stop slopping out and when that is going to happen; the rise in violent crime; automatic early release; the fact that we have only 140 police officers in our communities at any one time; or the escalation in drugs-related crime. Those issues are close to the hearts of the people of Scotland and matters of great concern to them. In talking about young people, should we not be considering why, according to a recent study by the University of Glasgow, children as young as 10 are dabbling in cocaine and heroin? To my mind, there would be a certain purpose in debating such issues. However, we are where we are, and it is important to be as constructive as possible. This opportunity permits us to state some general principles.</p><p>It is important that the Executive is more direct about its opinion of the Kilbrandon principles than recent newspaper leaks have suggested.

Since the publication of the Kilbrandon report, we have certainly been confronted by new practical challenges, which I will come to in due course.</p><p>We should also use this opportunity to talk about the panel members. I am deeply concerned at what I can only describe as the low level of morale <place-holder colnum=\"8305\"/> that has existed among the panel members whom I have met in recent months.

The Parliament must send out an unequivocal message that we laud and respect the work that children's panel members carry out and that they have our support.</p><p>Recruitment of children's panel members has already been referred to in passing, but I maintain that recruitment is an issue. We need to be clear about the reasons behind that problem. If people are minded not to participate in the children's hearings system because they are apprehensive about how they will be regarded or about how they will fit in and how the system operates, that is a serious flaw that needs to be addressed.</p><p>The other side of that coin is public confidence in the system. In various communities, I have heard acerbic comments from members of the public who clearly think that the children's hearings system is an unworkable soft option. I do not share that view, but the fact that such a view is abroad demonstrates that there is a need to reassure the public that the system can be made robust enough to deal with today's challenges, which did not exist in the late 1960s.</p><p>The challenges that confront us are alarming and they are very real.

Disturbingly, just under 38,000 children were referred to the children's hearings system in 2002-03&#8212;the highest figure since the system began in 1972. According to the 2000 crime survey, half of all 12 to 15-year-olds have been victims of crimes such as harassment, bullying, assault and theft. In sum, the picture is far from attractive and it is clear that times are turbulent. No one disputes that those challenges exist, but the question that faces us all is how we meet them.</p><p>The challenges comprise two distinct issues. The first is that of the practical problems that arise from the failure of the existing system. Reference has already been made to the Audit Scotland report, but the follow-up report that was published in November last year detailed an alarming sequence of failings at every level. I will not rehearse those issues&#8212;as Fiona Hyslop said, the facts have been brought before us in several <place-holder colnum=\"8306\"/> debates in the chamber&#8212;but that report indicated some serious issues. If those failings are not addressed, neither the existing system nor any reformed system will be able to work. My desire is that the Auditor General for Scotland should command a six-monthly audit of the failings that were identified in his follow-up report so that we might ascertain whether any improvements are being effected. It is important to know what can be fixed and made better before we start tinkering with wholesale change to the system.</p><p>Secondly, some sensible suggestions are required about the structure and powers of the children's hearings system, given the completely changed circumstances that confront young people and children's panels nowadays.

Our proposal tries to fortify and support the children's hearings system. We all recognise that early intervention is key. If the children's hearings system is distracted because a hard core of persistent offenders prevents our dealing with the category of young people who, as Fiona Hyslop mentioned, already demonstrate a disturbing pattern of behaviour at the age of eight, it is absolutely vital that we concentrate on those young people and get involved with them on a broad basis. It is right to remove the hard core of persistent offenders&#8212;who are a very small proportion of the troublemakers&#8212;and deal with them under a different arrangement. I defend our proposal as one that would greatly assist and strengthen the children's hearings system. I also think that 16 and 17-year-olds who display a recidivist pattern of behaviour should be sent to the adult courts as persistent offenders. However, that is a different issue.</p><p>Parenting orders will certainly have an important role to play, but we need to consider who will issue such orders and who will be responsible for their enforcement. That is a key issue. It is inappropriate to ask the children's hearings system to be responsible for imposing parenting orders because if there is to be enforcement, there must be sanctions. The sheriff court needs to undertake that obligation, although the children's hearings system should remain at the heart of the <place-holder colnum=\"8307\"/> information exchange process and be kept aware of what is happening. Many children's panel members would be understandably apprehensive about the prospect of issuing and enforcing parenting orders.</p><p>On the powers that children's hearings should have, a range of activity needs to be considered. We need more secure places, but we are all aware that insufficient numbers of places have been pledged by the Executive&#8212;no doubt the minister will comment on that when he winds up. Given the drugs problem confronting young people, we need to consider making drug treatment and testing orders available to children's hearings. Without such powers, it will be difficult for children's hearings to make informed decisions on the nature of the problems that they are asked to deal with.</p><p>My party also supports giving children's hearings powers of weekend and evening detention as well as powers to impose community service and supervised attendance orders. We need to ensure that young children are given a sense of their obligations towards their community and society. They need to be made to understand what the effects are when they breach the fundamental rules of orderly behaviour that we expect them to demonstrate. When my party first supported electronic tagging, we were derided by our opponents for doing so, but I am glad that the Executive parties have now seen the wisdom of our argument and conceded that point.</p><p>If the children's hearings system is under-resourced&#8212;like Fiona Hyslop, I contend that it is&#8212;we have a serious problem. If law and order and safe communities are the priority that the Executive frequently claims they are, there is no doubt that additional budgets and resources will need to be pledged to the children's hearings system. As Fiona Hyslop rightly identified, the social work element in the system is a concern.</p><p>Let me say that I applaud the provision in the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill that will impose a more demanding obligation on local authorities to comply with the requirements of the children's hearings system.

Today I can praise the candid language of the motion, in particular the phrase</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament notes the publication\"</p><p>of the consultation document. The motion does not invite us to welcome or praise the publication. I have to say, however, that it is hardly written in the spirited language of ringing endorsement. The rest of the motion is also frank: it recognises the need for significant improvement and change and accepts the need to step up efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>Far from being a clarion declaration of success, I have to say that the motion is a frank admission by the Scottish Executive that little has been done in the past five years to try to deal with the genuine problem of reoffending. It may be that Labour is content to let the blame for that lie with its Liberal Democrat partners because, of course, responsibility for justice in the first session of the Parliament rested with Mr Jim Wallace, who was then the Minister for Justice.</p><p>Having looked at the consultation, I have to say that it is difficult to welcome something that contains no proposals, but merely sets out the difficulties that prevail in Scotland. The reality is that, since 1999, the Scottish Executive has deluged Scotland with consultations. We have just about reached consultation burnout and, once electoral opt-out is added, we have an unfortunate <place-holder colnum=\"7966\"/> tandem. People are fed up with Scottish Executive blether; they want some Scottish Executive bottle in the form of proposals and solutions.</p><p>I have listened to what the minister said about the prospect&#8212;I accept that it is no more than that&#8212;of a single national corrective agency. I share the reservations that Nicola Sturgeon expressed, but I feel a little more strongly about the matter. There is evidence that public sector departments have been slow to speak to one another across a wide range of topics over the past decade. That problem has been compounded by disparate technology systems that have, in fact, further impeded the process of communication.</p><p>A rigorous audit is required of the individual departments that are involved in the whole matter of offending and reoffending, in order to establish how they deal with technology, what the efficiency of their operations is and how their management structures attend to authority, responsibility and oversight. It seems that if we are prepared to look at the individual structures and the individual sectoral players, we could go a considerable distance down the road of improving communication of information. That would be a vital step to take; it would address what I consider at the moment to be a deficiency.</p><p>I also think that solutions can be implemented now. I do not expect the minister to agree with the solutions, but my party believes that measures could be taken at the moment, one of which would be the ending of automatic early release from prison. That in itself is only a part solution; the other part of the equation is improved rehabilitation. I am acutely aware that many prisoners on early release are victims of drug abuse and drug addiction. We have to make a marked improvement in how we cope with this situation.</p><p>I also think that there is a strong case for investigating the availability of drug treatment and testing orders for offenders whose cases are heard in the district courts. A huge number of offenders who come before those courts suffer from substance abuse problems. At the moment, it is only when that person graduates&#8212;ironically, because of a more serious crime pattern&#8212;to the sheriff court that that drug problem is addressed.</p><p>The idea of electing conveners of police forces to ensure that more police are put on the beat met with derision in this chamber when it was advocated by the Conservatives previously, but I think that the need for such action is becoming increasingly clear. The minister would, I am sure, accept that the Executive cannot ensure that more police go into our communities. The Executive might endeavour to allocate additional resources but, at the end of the day, we are in the operational hands of chief constables. There is a <place-holder colnum=\"7967\"/> genuine concern in the chamber&#8212;certainly on the part of the Conservatives and the SNP&#8212;that there are not enough police in our communities.

Nothing has offended the public more than the faltering and expensive progress of the Parliament building project. It is sad to say that the project has become an icon for the public of all that is <place-holder colnum=\"7248\"/> provocative, frustrating, enraging and incomprehensible about the political process. That angst and rancour have struck at the core of public regard for devolution, and, as one nightmare scenario after another has emerged from the Fraser inquiry, the public ire has intensified.</p><p>To be frank, the public have an appalling opinion of MSPs; they want both an explanation and the facts. An inquiry without the tapes is tainted, and the public know that. The vision of politicians dancing on debating pinheads that we have seen today&#8212;be it Robert Brown and his literary eau de Nil emulsion or the deferential apologist for the BBC in Ken Macintosh&#8212;is calculated to provoke further public wrath, and if the public is hostile to the political process, it is no less disaffected by the BBC. If the inquiry is to avoid being discredited, the tapes are required, and Lord Fraser knows that. The disaster of the expensive and tardy progress of the building project is unique&#8212;we must be clear about that&#8212;but perhaps it is that uniqueness that explains why it has monopolised public interest.</p><p>None of us wants a project of that type ever to be repeated or an embarrassment of that sort ever visited on the Scottish public again. Politicians can step in today and do two things: something to try to retrieve their badly damaged public image; and something substantive and constructive to try to procure the tapes.</p><p>If the BBC can volunteer a tape to the Hutton inquiry and can be compelled by an inquiry under tribunals legislation to give information, it is difficult to see why, in the case of a unique, unusual and extraordinary incident of this type, the BBC cannot volunteer to make its tapes available, particularly given that one of the parties that is associated with the tapes was involved in the initial part of the project and herself gave evidence to the inquiry.</p><p>I support the motion because I think that it will do two things: it will do a lot to justify our belief that the Parliament is worth while; and it will explain to the public that the Parliament can actually do something useful that they want it to do.

That demonstrates my ambivalence towards the report, because, for example, it is Conservative party policy to deal with fine defaulting by more efficient collection of outstanding fines rather than by resorting to custodial sanction; I have spoken about that in the chamber. Equally, it is our policy to modernise our courts to meet the needs of society as it is structured today and to introduce weekend and evening sittings to reduce the current backlog; my colleague Bill Aitken has spoken about that. I am delighted that the McInnes report endorses our thoughts on those issues.</p><p>There is compelling common sense about a mandatory discount in sentence following an early guilty plea; about relaxing rules of evidence when introducing closed circuit television or other recorded evidence; and about taking a much more pragmatic approach to social inquiry reports. Those are all positive suggestions and, on their own, they would facilitate the improvement of summary criminal justice.</p><p>The minister alluded to what we mean by summary criminal justice, and I think that that is an important point for us all to bear in mind. Summary justice is meant to deliver swift and local justice within a procedural framework that is simpler than that attaching to more complex and serious criminal cases. That is why I would be strongly influenced by public opinion on its delivery; we have already referred to that in this debate. Public perception is important and perhaps it should be instructive, because what it may suggest is that there is nothing wrong with the role of the summary courts, but that we ought perhaps to reform the function and administrative operation of those courts.</p><p>I say that for two reasons. First, there may well be merit in reviewing how district courts operate. Perhaps there is a need to examine consistency of sentencing, and that is brought out in the McInnes report. Perhaps it would be desirable to bring those courts under the Scottish Courts Administration; I can see attraction in that. Perhaps there is an overdue need to allow district courts to impose drug treatment and testing orders. Most drug-dependent offenders appear before the district courts, not the sheriff courts. At the moment, only when an individual graduates to the sheriff court after committing more serious offences is their drug problem assessed under the criminal justice system. There are certainly innovations, changes and improvements that can now be brought to the operation of the district courts.<place-holder colnum=\"7130\"/></p><p>My second reason for thinking that we need to look at function and administrative operation rather than at role is the reason that Michael Matheson referred to by asking about the practical effect of merging the district court case load into the sheriff court. We know that the consequences of the Bonomy review, which will be implemented under the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, will increase that case load. Estimates vary, but there is no doubt that there will be a significant increase to sheriff-and-jury work.</p><p>If we look at that increase against a current sheriff summary case load that has shown a pattern of increase over 2000, 2001 and 2002, and if we also study the similar pattern of increase for the stipendiary magistrate courts, we see that there is a pressure point. That pressure point will certainly be brought to bear in the sheriff court system if there is amalgamation.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13315029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Summary Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as an enrolled solicitor in Scotland.

We should not be gulled by jargon into thinking that it is. Sadly, behaviour that is offensive or causes distress to another citizen has been a fact of life for centuries, hence the development in Scotland of a comprehensive criminal justice system.</p><p>Indeed, the definition of antisocial behaviour that is used in the bill was devised for the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. What seems to have changed is the apparent mushrooming of the number of people who behave more often in a manner that is unacceptable to law-abiding citizens. The kernel question that has to be asked is whether that pattern of behaviour arises out of too little law or because there is not enough enforcement of existing law.</p><p>I want to make clear that my party agrees, as does every other party, that antisocial behaviour is the blight on and a nightmare for too many of our communities. For that reason, we will support the general principles of the bill, which we recognise as a genuine and sincere attempt to address the problem. However, the answer to the question whether the bill is regarded as a landmark piece of legislation or as window dressing that simply slaps on a bit of lipstick to the face of our criminal justice system depends on two things: first, the extent to which our law is enforced, the new provisions are monitored and the breaches are enforced; and, secondly, the substantive content of the bill.</p><p>The Executive will not be surprised to learn that I have grave reservations about the first aspect. Those reservations are not borne out of some bilious party-political prejudice, but are founded on fact. Mr Douglas Keil told the Communities Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We can have as much legislation on the statute book as we like, but unless we have police officers to deal with the problem, there is little point in that legislation.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 21 January 2004; c 479.]</p><p>A further fact for the ministers is that, at the moment, only 140 police officers are on our streets at any one time throughout Scotland. Many of them are doing things in other places, but they are not out on our streets. A final fact on this subject is that, in New York, the template for the reduction of crime and the restoration of law and order is for <place-holder colnum=\"6450\"/> there to be one policeman for every seven committed crimes, whereas in Scotland there is one policeman for every 27 committed crimes. That is why I have very serious concerns about the capacity of our Scottish police forces to deal with the enforcement of existing law, far less to cope with the deluge of new statutory obligations.</p><p>I turn to the substantive content of the bill. In that connection, I thank and pay tribute to my colleagues on the Justice 2 Committee. However the bill may be painted, in essence it is a justice bill&#8212;the majority of its provisions relate to law and order. The Justice 2 Committee carried out a robust and forensic scrutiny of the bill and I hope that our stage 1 report was of assistance to the Communities Committee.</p><p>The issue of principal concern to me and my Conservative colleagues is part 3, which I was unable to support. We are not concerned because we think that groups of two or more persons who are breaking the law should not be dealt with&#8212;they should be dealt with, and under current law they can be dealt with if there are sufficient police officers in our communities to enforce the law.

There is no doubt that for witnesses who come forward and who are vulnerable and in need of support, the bill offers more structured and certainly more extensive measures than have previously been available. The bill is to be welcomed as a worthwhile contribution to improving the court environment for vulnerable witnesses.</p><p>I thank the minister for her remarks about the Justice 2 Committee. I think that I speak for all members of the committee when I say that we found it an interesting bill with which to be involved, and I am glad if our scrutiny and discussions assisted with the clarification and drafting of the bill.</p><p>There is an important issue in relation to resource, and I reiterate the concerns that were expressed at stage 1 by both the Finance Committee and the Justice 2 Committee, and indeed the admission of the Executive even at that stage that some of the costs might be higher than the estimates. It would be regrettable if the legislation ended up being either obsolete or unworkable because proper resourcing was not in place, and I urge the minister to be cautious and careful about ensuring that resource is there when the bill is enacted and its provisions are implemented.</p><p>In relation to the point that Nicola Sturgeon mentioned, evaluation will also be important. I would welcome a commitment from the minister if, for example, the Lord Advocate was prepared to assess the working model of the legislation as it proceeds, and if any difficulties are identified they should be quickly picked up on and noted. I hope that the absence of the right of the accused to question an application for a witness to be treated as a vulnerable witness will not impugn the integrity of the succeeding trial, but only time will tell&#8212;there are important issues lurking in that.</p><p>In conclusion, I make a plea about draftsmanship; I raised the point at previous stages of the bill. I have to say that, as a working tool for practitioners and judges in court, it is not user friendly. About 14 fingers and 10 pairs of eyes will be required to assimilate the provisions quickly, particularly where practitioners refer to the provisions in submissions to judges, and similarly <place-holder colnum=\"6320\"/> where judges consider the submissions of practitioners. If I have a plea to the parliamentary draftsmen, it is that it is far better to be simple, even if that extends the length of legislation, because that makes bills simpler to read and more readily understood.</p><p>As Nicola Sturgeon indicated, the bill is part of the broader framework of the criminal justice system in Scotland. The legislation is predicated on witnesses being available. Of course, witnesses will not be available if the law-abiding public is in any way apprehensive about the efficacy of our criminal justice system and if, having witnessed an offence, they are concerned about whether it is worth while to come forward. Delays, lack of resource and&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;the prospect of automatic early release are all factors that influence the law-abiding public's willingness to be witnesses. I urge the minister to have regard to that broader picture.</p><p>The bill is welcome and I have pleasure in supporting it on behalf of the Conservatives.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13312577", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, shall be brief.

We would all agree that the administration of criminal justice in Scotland has, in recent years, become a field that is increasingly strewn with boulders and that among the significant boulders are, undoubtedly, the problems of delays, adjournments and lack of preparation, to which numerous speakers have referred, including the minister, Michael Matheson, Pauline McNeill, Margaret Mitchell, Bill Aitken and others. That issue is at the heart of the embryonic formation of the problems.</p><p>The bill tries sensibly to address some of those issues. The mandatory preliminary diet is sensible but, if that diet is sensible, it is my view that the managed meeting is absolutely critical. Nothing will focus the minds of the accused and his law agent more than a fixed trial date: lawyers and accused persons are human beings and&#8212;unless they are aware of when the sword of Damocles might fall&#8212;they are unlikely to consider with urgency when preparations should be made, when thought should be given to certain matters and when questions should be asked.</p><p>Critical to how we address the matters of preparation and early disclosure is a change of attitude on the part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. I was having a look at the increased volume of work in the High Court between 1995 and 2001, which saw an <place-holder colnum=\"5984\"/> approximately 23 per cent increase in new indictments. That increase is significant, but I say to the Lord Advocate that it is not formidable; it is no more than many other organisations have had to cope with. In coping with such increases, those organisations have had to consider their procedures, management, technology and so on and they have had to think about how they can better progress and more swiftly process their business. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is no different and issues that relate to such aspects need to be considered.</p><p>I have a lot of sympathy for early disclosure's being included in a mandatory framework. I have an uncomfortable feeling that a code of practice might prove to be a limp directive&#8212;again, the matter is about focusing minds and making people who are crucial to the provision of this vital service for society realise that there are specific checks and balances that must be observed.</p><p>Capacity is another boulder. The High Court has been under strain and it may be that, in theory, transfer of business to the sheriff courts is the way forward. I do not disagree with that in principle, but the biggest boulder of all would then roll into place. That boulder is resources. Without significant resources, the transfer of business simply will not work. Pauline McNeill and Bill Aitken spoke eloquently to that point.</p><p>Although I accept that the bill genuinely seeks to get some of the boulders out of the field, it is important that we do not crush healthy activity in the process or&#8212;which would be equally alarming&#8212;deposit other rubble in place of the boulders that we remove. I will consider one or two of the bill's specific proposals. I have concerns about the proposal to allow those who are refused bail to apply for bail while they are electronically tagged. It seems to me that an individual who has been refused bail and who has been deemed to be a danger to the public will be a danger with or without a tag.</p><p>Like Mike Rumbles, I am concerned about the provision to allow a trial to go ahead in the absence of the accused. Important principles are at stake and there is a grave danger that the accused would not receive a fair trial in his or her absence. I also have difficulty with the plans to force judges to give discounts for early guilty pleas. Again, that might be a sensible proposal, but surely it is watered down by the current system of automatic early release. If offenders know that they will get early release, they might be less likely to plead early because they will not serve the full sentence that is handed down by the court.</p><p>I turn to one of the most significant areas that is at risk and which is in danger of being crushed under the bill; that is, the removal of the 110-day rule. I understand that Lord Bonomy found that <place-holder colnum=\"5985\"/> only 25 per cent of cases require extensions to the 110-day rule, which does not seem to me to justify abolition of the rule; it means, rather, that 75 per cent of cases proceed timeously under the current arrangements. It seems to me that with early service of the indictment, managed meetings and preliminary diets can be adjusted to cope with the procedure. Colin Fox made that point well. I say to the Executive only that the 110-day rule is one of the most valued and respected embodiments of our criminal justice system in Scotland. Fairness to the accused is vital and it seems to me to be illiberal for an innocent accused person to be detained for longer than is necessary. I must say that the proposal is regrettable and that I have not heard any compelling argument that justifies removal of this essential safeguard: I do not think that there is any problem that cannot be addressed intelligently by other mechanisms. We would thereby retain something of which we should be proud. The 110-day rule is an important component of safety for the accused in our criminal justice system.</p><p>That said, the bill offers a variety of mechanisms that will improve the administration of justice in Scotland so&#8212;subject to my earlier comments&#8212;I endorse and welcome its general principles.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a useful debate, even if it has been held under unfortunate time constraints.

Those reasons are multiple. The Scottish Police Federation is saying that we need more police officers. The Scottish Executive is saying, \"It is not our fault. We have an excellent record of providing police.\" I do not think that having 140 officers on the beat at any one time substantiates that view. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has another, starkly different view from that of the public. An ACPOS representative indicated that the association has a certain antipathy to beat patrols or, at best, a lack of enthusiasm for them.</p><p>Are the Scottish Conservatives being radical agents provocateurs for leading this debate and for suggesting that accountability lies at the heart of the problem? It seems that, in principle, the minister, unlike the Scottish National Party, is prepared to accept that that is the issue.

It is easy for Mike Rumbles to be snide and sneering about that&#8212;acting entirely in character&#8212;but that is to be entirely blind to the germane principles of what I think is a very important argument.

There have been challenges to that view, but democratic accountability is not political interference. A structure in which the public have a rather greater say about the provision of policing at a local level, in terms of control and accountability, does not, in my book, need to be inimical to the professional operational activity of the police force.

She has&#8212;and I accept that her conviction is sincere <place-holder colnum=\"5431\"/> and well held&#8212;deep concerns about the concept of private prison provision and she maintains that others share her concerns. I accept that she holds that view, although I do not agree with it, but the matter perhaps serves to indicate the kernel issues in a debate on the topic.</p><p>Two fundamental factors in relation to the provision of prison facilities in Scotland must be recognised by politicians. I say that not merely from my experience of the justice portfolio, but because I have visited various prisons in Scotland during the past six to eight months. First, it is perfectly obvious to me that we need more capacity, whether we think that that is good, bad, right, wrong, reprehensible or otherwise. That is the tragedy; we need more capacity now and we need to be taking the necessary action to provide it as soon as possible.</p><p>Secondly, the environment in a number of prisons that were constructed in Victorian times is oppressive, unproductive for prisoners and difficult to manage. I have visited Low Moss prison within the past few months and I urge members who have not been there to go. I maintain that members would be aghast at the conditions there. They would be astonished by staff morale and by the success the regime achieves, but they would be simply appalled by the prison's infrastructure and environment. Jean Turner referred to the background to that and, as far as I am concerned, anything that can be done to renew and refresh that facility is overdue.</p><p>When we consider the issues to which Fiona Hyslop alluded, it is important that we are clear about what we are talking about. If we are determined to identify priorities&#8212;and I have just outlined what must be the priority for politicians&#8212;we must accept that other, broader political issues should be considered and addressed at another time. I accept that Fiona Hyslop has articulated issues that are genuine for the purposes of debate, but I believe that such issues are genuine for debate, for example, as we approach local council or, for that matter, Scottish Parliament elections, when people can make their own judgment about what the different political parties offer and consider whether their policies serve their aspirations and create the kind of Scottish society they need. It is dangerous to try to cloud the issue of the provision of an overdue facility with debate on more esoteric matters that might be legitimate matters for debate, but which in the germane consideration of what is needed now are no more than that.</p><p>I shall briefly consider Alex Neil's contribution to the debate. Of course, Alex Neil's antipathy to private prisons and in particular to the manifestation of that system in Kilmarnock is legendary. In defence of the Kilmarnock prison, I <place-holder colnum=\"5432\"/> should say that when I visited it a couple of months ago I found so many positive features that I was anxious to ascertain how some of those features might be replicated elsewhere in the prison service. I quote from the 2002 Scottish Prison Service estates review:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It has been recognised by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons that Kilmarnock can deliver not only effective services, but can often be innovative. For example, this resulted in the formal recognition of twelve items of best practice in the formal inspection report (March 2001). This compared to eight at Edinburgh and four at Greenock, both of which had inspections during the same period.\"</p><p>My impression of Kilmarnock prison was that the environment was beyond comparison with other prisons' estate. It was bright, modern and manageable. The prison population confirmed that they found it agreeable&#8212;in so far as it is possible to find a prison environment agreeable&#8212;and their morale seemed good. There is much to commend in the provision of private prison facilities in Scotland. Politicians urgently need to address what society needs now. In doing that, we must have strong regard to the best interests of prisoners&#8212;believe it or not&#8212;and we can do more and better for prisoners than we do just now.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13310334", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Prisons (Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

I make that general point from the beginning.</p><p>The general proposition in the Executive's motion is that the judiciary should be separated from the legislature. If that means that the judiciary should be free from Government interference or influence&#8212;or both&#8212;and should feel able to discharge its judicial obligations freely and impartially, there is not a scintilla of difference between my party and the Executive. What I do not know is whether that aspiration will be served by the proposal&#8212;in so far as it exists&#8212;to create a supreme court. It is just a proposal; there is no draft bill.</p><p>I want to consider the process that has brought us to this point. I am not in the habit of conferring credit on the Scottish Executive, but if the Scottish Minister for Justice or the Lord Advocate had contemplated a change to our legal institutions, particularly to structures that have existed for centuries, I think that there would have been what is by now a familiar process. The First Minister would have given a well-trailed speech to a community. That would have been followed by a ministerial odyssey as his colleagues rushed off around Scotland to speak to people. Then we would have had a consultation process. We might even have had a general debate in Parliament on the proposed principles of change. Indeed, one of the justice committees might have been asked to undertake an inquiry. Finally, a bill would have been published. I probably would still have disagreed with the Executive, but at least a debate would have taken place, nobody would have been ignorant of what was proposed and an extensive range of views would have been exchanged before the parliamentary process commenced.</p><p>What is proposed in the case that we are considering is one of the most substantial and radical reforms of the constitution and the British legal system for centuries. Has it proceeded on the report of a royal commission? No. Is it in response to an escalating wave of discontent <place-holder colnum=\"5308\"/> about the current system? Not as far as I am aware. The only specific instances of discontent that we have heard are that Nicola Sturgeon just wants rid of the House of Lords and the minister does not think that the current system is good. Is the proposed change a consequence of joint representations from the law societies of Scotland, England and Wales and their respective judiciaries? I do not believe so.</p><p>As we are well aware, the proposals stem from a Cabinet reshuffle at Westminster last summer, which abolished the ministerial office of Lord Chancellor and created a vacuum that necessitated a consultation&#8212;of four months, no less&#8212;to consider how to replace structures that have been in place for centuries. I do not make my points in a mood of trite humour. It is important to understand the process that has brought us to this stage. Unless we are alert to the process's manifest deficiencies, we are in grave danger of coming to simple and, arguably, erroneous conclusions.</p><p>I will consider briefly the current structures. The highest court of appeal for civil cases in Scotland is the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. There are 12 law lords, of whom two are usually of Scottish origin. The special nature of Scots law and the need to protect that within the UK was enshrined in article 19 of the Act of Union 1707, which specifically excluded the jurisdiction of English courts over Scottish cases. That is not just a tedious historic statistic; it is one of the all-protecting guardians of the stature of Scots law.</p><p>On a broader front, as members of the House of Lords, judges, like appointed bishops, are free to take part in debates. Far from regarding that as a deficiency, I think that it is an attribute. It is not a coincidence that many people consider the debates in the House of Lords to be well informed and eloquently argued and that that chamber benefits from the constituents of intellect, wisdom and experience. Under the current proposals, that will virtually be lost. Further, we should not underestimate the significance of judges' being able to express in debate views and opinions for the record. There will be no channel for that to happen under the new proposals.</p><p>What I would like is specific evidence of how the current system is failing.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13309956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supreme Court"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to expand my point.

Of course he did not.</p><p>I turn now to the proposed change in the appellate function for Scottish cases. Because the proposed new structure would exist predominantly to serve England and Wales, it is vital that its Scottish component should be based on an informed appointments system that is knowledgeable about the Scottish judiciary. The appointment of any Scottish judges or panel members should require, at best, the knowledge of the First Minister. Indeed, there is an argument that the appointments should emanate from the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland and not from the proposed appointments commission. Surely a mechanism could be found to achieve that, because only in a structure such as that could there be confidence in the ability of the proposed new supreme court to determine Scottish appeals and devolution cases fairly and competently.</p><p>I turn now to my amendment. On the effect on Scots law of appeal decisions emanating from any supreme court, it is essential that decisions that are appropriate only to England and Wales are not binding in Scots law&#8212;hence the amendment in my name. That simply reaffirms existing practice. We must make it crystal clear that unless specific provision is made, that will not happen.

However, in Scotland criminal law is significantly founded upon common law, which is completely different from that in England and Wales, and on the principles of Justinian, which are also irrelevant to the legal system of England and Wales. Therefore, I have always been able to make a complete separation between how the two systems in Scotland are treated. The criminal appeal court in Scotland has worked well, and we must recognise that it was introduced&#8212;heavens above&#8212;getting on for nearly 80 years ago.

If, as has been demonstrated by evidence from the United States, early intervention is the key to dealing with young offenders&#8212;and particularly with persistent young offenders&#8212;our children's panels have an immensely important role to play. I should like to pay tribute to the many dedicated men and women who voluntarily contribute to that important task throughout Scotland. In this debate, I want us to consider what we might do to assist them in delivering a quick and effective youth justice system. Not only is that our fundamental obligation to society, but we must ensure that our panel members remain motivated and interested and have the satisfaction of knowing that their contribution is not only vital but valued.</p><p>There has to be clarity in the role that we expect our children's hearings to perform. To assist in creating that clarity, I would remove from children's hearings persistent 14 and 15-year-old offenders and would bring them before the youth courts&#8212;although I know that that proposition does not meet with the agreement of other members in the chamber. I welcome the extension of the pilot scheme for youth courts to Airdrie, as announced by the minister.</p><p>There is a strong argument for retaining adult courts as the forum for 16 and 17-year-olds. If people are, regrettably, law breakers by that age, they are adults and fully aware of their circumstances. Therefore, I would consider the adult court system to be appropriate.</p><p>In connection with that, I refer to the issue of secure places. Persistent offenders will require to be placed in secure accommodation. We need <place-holder colnum=\"4600\"/> those places now; we have needed them since late in September 2002 when the Scottish Executive promised them. The matter is overdue for consideration.

Nowhere is that more relevant than in the obligation of Government to preside over a safe society in which the rule of law is both respected and enforced.</p><p>Few people, not even the Executive, would agree that we live in a safe Scotland in 2003. A crime is committed every 1.2 minutes and there is a violent attack every 32 minutes and a drugs-related death every day. Nearly a quarter of Scots do not feel safe when walking alone in their neighbourhoods after dark.</p><p>Depressingly&#8212;and contrary to what Mr Rumbles was saying&#8212;all serious crime is up since 1999 and, with the exception of fire-raising and vandalism, it is up dramatically since 1997. The EU average of crimes per 100 people is 5.9. In Scotland, it is 8.3, which is exceeded by Denmark, where it is 9.4, and England and Wales, where it is 9.8.</p><p>As I have previously demonstrated in this chamber, all the evidence from New York and, indeed, Middlesbrough confirms that crime levels fall in the face of neighbourhood policing. Despite the best efforts of a committed and courageous Scottish police force, we do not have neighbourhood policing. The first people to confirm that would be the police officers themselves. That is why my party is calling for an expanded neighbourhood policing presence. That will be the first step towards restoring the rule of law and respect for the rule of law, reassuring the law-abiding majority that they have a role to play and deterring the potential law-breakers from their pattern of crime.</p><p>Another vital component in the delivery of law enforcement is the combination of accountability and visibility, as Mr McLetchie's motion suggests.</p><p>According to the Executive's publication \"Narrowing the Gap\", published in 2002, only 22.6 per cent of the total number of Scottish police officers are available for patrol or to attend incidents at a given time and, disturbingly, only 4 per cent of duty time is allocated to foot patrol. That means that only 138 police officers are on foot patrol across Scotland at any one time.</p><p>That useful report also said that more than 80 per cent of people agree that an enhanced targeted and visible police presence would make people feel safer and would reduce crime. However, that is not happening and that failure is fuelling frustration, cynicism and disillusionment.</p><p>The current governance regime for the police force is provided by the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, which provides for a tripartite sharing of legal responsibility for policing by police authorities or joint boards, chief constables and the Scottish ministers. As we know, many of those boards <place-holder colnum=\"4172\"/> straddle three or more local authority areas and, to most members of the public, the members of the board and the chairman are unknown and completely anonymous.

However, if we are being honest, I suspect that many of us have been unaware of the good work that it does. It was, of course, initially an inter-church initiative, which gave it strength when it was first formed.</p><p>I have been struck by the extensive work that the charity has discharged, and not only in relation to the age groups and categories of young people that it helps. It has been forward looking in considering the issue of integration with society. In respect of its core values, it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe that every person has an equal right to participate in the economic and social life of our society.\"</p><p>Nobody would disagree with that, but the challenge sometimes is how to give effect to that aspiration: the charity demonstrates impressively exactly how effect can be given to that.</p><p>I am aware from my experience with the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust&#8212;which is also a charity&#8212;that some of the most interesting developments for young people come in the most unexpected ways. Often, they happen because young people in particular circumstances and situations are provided with a medium through which they have an opportunity to show what they are capable of contributing. They are given a framework within which that contribution is encouraged and in giving that framework, we hope to nurture their confidence in how they will proceed through life, and contribute to society.</p><p>Trish Godman will be aware that I have not signed the motion. There is a reason why I have not done so, to which I shall come. My remarks are not meant in any discordant sense, but I have four slight concerns that I thought it necessary to articulate.</p><p>It seems to be important that the voluntary and charitable sector is seen to be independent and not to be associated with the Executive. I say that for no narrow party-political reasons. One of the strengths of the voluntary and charitable sector is that participants feel that they are doing their own thing. Equally important, perhaps, is that the public acknowledges that they are doing their own thing and are not being propped up by the Executive, which could have a negative effect on perception of them. It is important that the charities are autonomous in their operation. It is right that Unity Enterprise should make decisions about how it wants to work, where it wants to work and how it should set about discharging its responsibilities <place-holder colnum=\"4054\"/> and implementing its aspirations under its charitable purposes.</p><p>The invitation at the end of the motion is for the Scottish Executive and other appropriate agencies to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"do what they can in order to extend similar services to other airports, bus terminals and railway stations.\"</p><p>However, I am not sure that I think that that is the role of the Scottish Executive. Although it is certainly the role of the charity to do that&#8212;Unity Enterprise is to be commended for what it is doing and encouraged to investigate the possibilities&#8212;I do not think that it is appropriate for the Executive to play a lead role in that task.</p><p>It is important to mention another implication. Throughout Scotland local charities do extremely good work. It is important that we recognise and respect their independence and their right to contribute to their communities in whatever ways they think are fit. We need to be careful, before we set out too prescriptive a direction for any one charity, that we do not prejudice the work of other charities.</p><p>I thank Trish Godman genuinely for bringing Unity Enterprise to Parliament's attention.

Lawyers have tended not to be high in the public affection stakes and the provision of legal services is pretty dry fare as a topic for discussion. Of course, that is until an individual needs advice, when a different attitude prevails.</p><p>The debate is timely. Devolution has offered an opportunity to consider in detail the provision of legal advice and information and the delivery of legal aid. Post devolution, some interesting information has emerged. The strategic review that the minister announced on 24 October this year is welcome. It provides a sensible opportunity to take stock.</p><p>A strong, independent and flourishing legal profession will be a core component of any civilised and democratic society. For decades and centuries, Scotland has been revered for possessing such an attribute. On the broad front, we have a legal system that has been not only admired, but emulated abroad and, interestingly, south of the border in some respects. The Executive and the Parliament should be the passionate and vigorous custodiers of that gem.</p><p>In passing, I say that I have concerns about the proposed supreme court that is being considered at Westminster. I urge the Executive not to spare the baring of its teeth about that proposal if the danger exists that the court of ultimate appeal for civil matters in Scotland will move from the judicial independence of the House of Lords to the more questionable structure of a political creation whose <place-holder colnum=\"3840\"/> purpose and relevance to Scotland are less than clear.</p><p>Our independent legal system has created a legal profession that, for decades and centuries, has been an important source of fearless and independent advice to generations of clients and has played a significant part in maintaining a strong and cohesive civic community throughout Scotland. Therefore, in any consideration of the provision of information and advice throughout Scotland, we need not only to identify what the public needs&#8212;and how best to serve those needs&#8212;and to distinguish between general provision and the specific requirement to procure legal advice, but to be mindful of nurturing and safeguarding the best elements of a strong and independent legal profession.</p><p>As has been indicated, we need to distinguish between the public's needs. At any one time, members of the public may need guidance, advice and information. However, those needs might not be the same as the requirement to have access to legal advice under Scots law.</p><p>At the simplest level, people may need to speak to someone about debt, faulty goods or services. They might require information about the court system or court procedures. They might need guidance about where they can go to seek the help that they need for their specific problem. In fact, in the first instance, all of those matters could be&#8212;and very often are&#8212;addressed by a variety of solutions.</p><p>For example, tribute should be paid to citizens advice bureaux, law centres and the Executive's public information websites on justice. However, the Executive does not have a simple website that contains basic facts, such as what happens if someone reports a crime, the role of the police or the procurator fiscal, what court procedure involves or what powers the court has on conviction. All of those are areas on which the public would welcome more information.</p><p>There is merit in continuing to develop those facilities. The four pilot projects under the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, which involve partnerships with local agencies throughout Scotland, are an interesting contribution to the debate. The pilots should be rigorously assessed so that they can inform future thinking.</p><p>It would also be worth while to examine the community legal service that is being developed by the Executive, again on the basis of four pilot partnerships. Similarly, the in-court advice service, which has been available in Edinburgh sheriff court since 1997, merits examination in the light of the announcement in March of this year that the service was to be the subject of further pilots.<place-holder colnum=\"3841\"/></p><p>The Executive is to be commended for being prepared to test those innovations. However, it should not be scared to review how they operate if the evidence shows that they are not meeting need.</p>", "hdate": "2003-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306347", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Advice, Information and Representation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In no way do I impugn Ms Sturgeon's speech.

I want to emphasise to the minister that, although a bridging presence is essential for many people, it should be regarded as just that&#8212;a bridging presence. The next destination is always going to be a solicitor who is competent to give independent advice and who is regulated by a rigorous mechanism in respect of their conduct, the handling of their clients' finances and the advice that they give. That mechanism is in place solely for the consumer protection of the client.</p><p>The public is entitled to independent advice that is given without fear or favour, and that advice demonstrably available from a solicitor in private practice.

On a highly-charged issue such as this, it is important that we consider the facts, disturbing and alarming though they are, because from them we may be able to reach some conclusions to instruct us, as politicians, about what we should be trying to do. Reference has already been made to statistics, according to which more than 36,000 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded in Scotland in 2002. That is the equivalent of 99 incidents of domestic abuse a day, which all of us would agree is a very troubling statistic.</p><p>The Executive's statistics show that domestic abuse is increasing. Even more alarmingly, the number of incidents against the same victim is increasing, highlighting that more women are trapped in abusive situations. It is that pattern that I want to consider in more detail. For the period 1 April 1999 to the end of 1999, 33 per cent of victims of domestic abuse had been involved in previous incidents. For the year 2000, the proportion in that category had risen to 42 per cent. For the following year, 2001, that category had risen again to 49 per cent and, sadly, for 2002&#8212;by which time, the number of recorded instances was more than 36,000, as Nicola Sturgeon said&#8212;the number in the previous incidents category had reached 50 per cent.</p><p>I do not think that anyone in the chamber is comforted by that; all of us are deeply disturbed by that pattern. Nicola Sturgeon raised an important point about the relationship between reported incidents and prosecution. I suggest that we should be careful before we lurch to simplistic analysis of the problem or simple solutions to it. I know, from my years in practice as a solicitor, particularly when I had occasion to handle matrimonial work&#8212;some of which involved very distressing instances of this type&#8212;that one of the <place-holder colnum=\"3688\"/> most difficult issues to surmount is persuading the abused person to go forward with a court case.</p><p>Calling the police provides immediate reassurance and comfort and is the first step in dealing with a threat to safety or security or a threat to children. However, for many reasons, victims are understandably concerned about proceeding to criminal prosecutions. We must be sensitive to that. A domestic abuse victim's situation is unique. We must approach it with encouragement and, as the minister said, a combination of procedures that shows the victim that he or she is not alone and that the procedures and facilities out there can give help and support.</p><p>I will return to the statistics, about which I am especially concerned. All parties in the Parliament have made a genuine attempt to bring to public attention the enormity of the issue and to invoke measures to increase support for the victims of such abuse, including the \"National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland\" and \"Preventing Domestic Abuse: A National Strategy\". The motion refers to the work of the national group to address violence against women, which is another welcome initiative. Of importance is the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001, which the Parliament passed with all-party support.</p><p>All that is commendable, but when the Executive's research report on the 2001 act shows that many victims were not aware of it, it is clear that much still has to be done. I have reluctantly reached the inescapable conclusion that a culture remains in Scotland in which, for some cowardly and contemptible individuals, violence against spouses and partners&#8212;if behind closed doors and in the privacy of the home&#8212;is acceptable. The Parliament should collectively condemn that barbaric, primitive and repugnant culture. For as long as it endures, Scotland is stained and diminished.</p><p>Is it a coincidence that, as domestic violence has increased, serious crime in Scotland has gone out of control, as the figures that were released yesterday show? I regret to say that that is not a coincidence. We have a wider crime culture that only enhanced law enforcement and tougher court sanctions will address. I realise that the minister is not responsible for the justice portfolio, but I suggest that the Executive is collectively derelict in respect of its obligation to maintain wider law and order in our society. If law and order appears to be dissembling, there is&#8212;sadly&#8212;an inevitable implication for domestic abuse.</p><p>As politicians, we need to send out from the Parliament a message to victims, their children and their wider families that we have the political resolve to rid Scotland of this curse and to support victims with help, advice and practical measures. I welcome the minister's obvious commitment to <place-holder colnum=\"3689\"/> attaining that objective. On domestic violence, we need to improve the transmission and dissemination of the messages of condemnation to perpetrators and of support to victims. We need to get those messages to where victims are, bring information to them about available help and advice and tell them what practical measures are on offer.</p><p>Two obvious examples of such measures are refuges, which I praise, and the proposed pilot domestic abuse courts. It is important that the procedures are dealt with through the sheriff court system and it is vital to ensure that procedures are as swift and efficient as possible, because otherwise, we shall discourage victims from taking to the criminal process their rightful charges against perpetrators. The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill will also have an important role to play.</p><p>I commend to the minister an initiative that my party launched at UK level last Christmas, when 10,000 posters about domestic violence that carried helpline numbers from Women's Aid and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children were placed in general practitioner surgeries, hairdressers' salons, police stations and other locations where women could discreetly write down the numbers and seek help. Why do we not consider our own Scottish version of those posters, which could include the number of the domestic abuse helpline? That would give hope to victims at this pressure-point time of year&#8212;that is another factor of which we are all conscious. Such posters would also serve notice on perpetrators that no longer are their evil deeds invisible behind closed doors and that their nasty little secret culture is being brought to an end.</p><p>I am aware that legislative proposals at Westminster may include a register of those who are convicted of domestic abuse and that the Executive may be interested in replicating that proposal in Scotland. I urge considerable caution in examining that. I have referred to one difficulty that has dogged the prosecution of domestic abuse cases&#8212;victims' understandable reluctance, for many reasons, to bring criminal charges. If a victim felt that an additional penalty might attach over and above the court penalty, they might be uneasy about being responsible for that further imposition, especially if it could affect employability and stigmatise children.</p><p>I support the motion but warn against complacency, which is why I lodged the amendment in my name. The statistics do not permit complacency and the minister acknowledged that honestly in her speech.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-660.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but notes with grave concern the escalating pattern of <place-holder colnum=\"3690\"/> repeat victimisation highlighting the fact that more and more victims are trapped in abusive situations.\"</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306010", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is not with pleasure that I take part in the debate, but with a sombre sense of awareness that violence against women and domestic abuse are still the reality for far too many families in Scotland.

For witnesses who come forward and are vulnerable, the bill offers more structured and extensive support than has formerly been available. I echo the comments of Nicola Sturgeon and welcome that as a positive step. It is only part of a very big picture, but I am prepared to commend the bill on its merits. It is a worthwhile contribution to improving the court environment for vulnerable witnesses.</p><p>Although I speak as a Conservative front-bench spokesman on this issue, I am also convener of the Justice 2 Committee, which was responsible <place-holder colnum=\"3360\"/> for stage 1 scrutiny of the bill and the ultimate publication of the stage 1 report. I take this opportunity publicly to thank our clerks for their invaluable support and guidance to the committee. They have shown remarkable capacity for unstinting work in the face of formidable time-scale challenges and displayed exemplary diplomacy in dealing with a convener of whimsical and carnaptious disposition. I am sure that the minister will not disagree with one word of that. I thank the members of the committee who are present for their constructive approach and the witnesses who made time to give evidence.</p><p>As I have indicated, the general principles of the bill have my party's support. Although my colleagues will wish to address particular areas, I propose merely to comment on the broad aspects of the bill, as indicated in the committee's stage 1 report, that require the Executive's careful consideration and which I hope will merit specific comment by ministers at the winding-up stage.</p><p>My first comment is a general housekeeping one&#8212;I am speaking as a lawyer who has practised in the Scottish courts&#8212;on the structure of the bill and the drafting, which is referred to in paragraph 90 on page 16 of the Justice 2 Committee's report. When the bill is enacted, it will be held in the hands of prosecution and defence lawyers or pored over by the presiding judge as arguments are addressed by solicitors. It is not user-friendly as a working tool in that environment. My plea is that the Executive has its drafting team examine the cross-references and consider whether greater clarity and transparency might be achieved by simply repeating ad longum the parts of the bill that are incorporated by cross-reference. It is extremely difficult to read the bill in a continuous manner as it is not cohesive.</p><p>I turn to what is critical to the success of the bill, which has already been alluded to: the early identification of vulnerable witnesses. Although the bill will extend to civil proceedings, I think that everyone anticipates that the provisions will be invoked most frequently in relation to criminal proceedings. The first point of likely identification of a vulnerable witness in that context will certainly be at the stage of the police's initial involvement when an incident is first reported or investigated. That will then have an on-going implication for the transmission of information to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p><p>The committee report acknowledges that other agencies will have a role to play, but the two vital components of the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in the criminal justice system will be the key to whether the bill will work without the introduction of further delays to the system. I draw to the minister's attention the <place-holder colnum=\"3361\"/> paragraphs on page 6 of the report that cover that aspect.</p><p>The other component that is essential if the bill is to work is resource. The minister will be aware that the Finance Committee flagged up that aspect on page 38 of its report and the Justice 2 Committee has drawn particular attention to it in paragraphs 98 to 103 of its report. There are two important aspects to the resource and implementation issue. One is that the resource must be in place to deal with the immediate consequences of the bill when it is enacted. The other is that, given the phased implement of the bill, there must be total clarity on the part of the Executive in identifying the funds that are needed to meet its requirements.</p><p>In the time available, I have dealt only with broad issues, which are of singular importance if the bill is to work. I welcome the Executive's comments on those aspects. Three specific matters are of concern to me. One, which Nicola Sturgeon raised, is the important matter of the fair trial element to which the Faculty of Advocates referred. I do not think that that is a meaningless exercise in semantics; the faculty made a genuinely important point and I would welcome its being given further thought. The application form to have someone considered a vulnerable witness should have within it the specific reasons why the applicant seeks to have that status accorded. That is important, because unless the other side knows why the application has been made and understands the reasons behind it, we build in the potential for delay and disputatious conduct in the procedural aspects of the case. Nicola Sturgeon also covered the rights of parties to a hearing, which is another important technical element.</p><p>Subject to the comments that I have made, the bill is worth while and it will be helpful in encouraging witnesses to come forward. My party supports the general principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13305174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Nonetheless, it is immensely enjoyable.

Sadly, this is a Scotland where a quarter of our people do not feel safe outside their own front door.</p><p>The most important question to be answered is why the Executive is not tackling that problem at grass-roots level by providing more police in our communities to catch those who commit crime and to deter those who are tempted. Our police numbers are now only marginally greater than they were in 1997, but many more obligations fall on our police, which take them out of operational duty. I have referred before in this chamber to the New York experience. We should draw from that the fact that in New York there is one police officer <place-holder colnum=\"3152\"/> for every seven recorded crimes, whereas in Scotland we have one police officer for every 27 recorded crimes.</p><p>Of course, although by taking the same approach we could reduce dramatically the incidence of crime, we shall always have to consider appropriate disposals for those who commit crime. In my judgment, the court has to be the sole determinant of what is an appropriate disposal. As I have stated frequently, if that is a custodial sentence, the sentence served should be the sentence imposed and any element of remission should be earned. Indeed, one of the important views to come out of the Justice 1 Committee's report was the reflection of public attitudes to sentencing, which ranged from public backing for greater truth in sentencing to a lack of understanding by the public about early release, and an increase in cynicism about and distrust of the system.</p><p>Among other disposals, we have fines, about which the Deputy Minister for Justice has been voluble. Inevitably, his press release focused attention on that issue, and it is to that issue that I wish to address my remarks. According to a parliamentary answer, the amount of outstanding fines in 2001-02 was &#163;11,533,923. We know from the former minister Richard Simpson that many people expunge their fines by presenting on a Thursday morning, and they are out by Friday&#8212;in other words, there is a 24-hour write-off of liability, which is a very smart option. Incidentally, that process costs the taxpayer somewhere between &#163;400 and &#163;500.

Again, however, <place-holder colnum=\"2413\"/> the men and women in the fire service have an obligation to acknowledge that, in a changing world with challenging demands and constant technological innovation, the fire service is no more immune than any sector, private or public, to the need for vision, change and flexibility in how its service is provided.</p><p>Of course, as countless people in other sectors have found, those demands bring uncertainties, turbulence and disquiet.

On the merits of the issue, it is our view that the repeal of section 19 of the 1947 act is to be welcomed, because it will end the process of bringing ministers into local decision making.

I accept that at some point there has to be a co-ordinating strategy to cope with that, but it remains to be seen exactly how the balance falls in relation to the details of those proposals.</p><p>Sensible progress can be made&#8212;indeed, I think it is already being made&#8212;with a fully co-operative approach in partnership with all the stakeholders. Rather than be in any sense prescriptive, that may be a more constructive way forward. It is paradoxical that the Executive's proposals to which I have referred go against the grain of decentralisation and more local control by local fire service authorities. There are implied concerns in the proposals. For example, the integrated risk management plan reeks of centralisation but also presents an untested, and therefore unquantifiable, operational strategy for fire authorities. Frankly, far from managing risk, such a plan seems to me fraught with risk. It is essential that such a radical change to operational activity is piloted.</p><p>By their nature, the proposals are heavily flavoured with centralised&#8212;[<em>Interruption.</em>] I am sorry, Presiding Officer&#8212;I have gone backwards in my speech. I am pleased to say that it made as much sense the second time as it did the first time.</p><p>On the centralised nature of the proposals, my party's overriding concern is with the whole thrust of what is being contemplated. If one examines the practical framework within which the fire service in Scotland has to operate, a markedly diverse pattern emerges, which is partially attributable to the geography of Scotland and partially attributable to varying population densities. The 2001-02 report from Her Majesty's chief inspector of fire services for Scotland graphically illustrates that diversity. Of the eight brigade areas, geographical extent varies from Fife, with 1,323km<sup>2</sup>, to the Highlands and Islands with 31,348km<sup>2</sup>. After Fife, the second smallest geographical area is Central Scotland with 2,652km<sup>2</sup>, but while Fife serves 350,400 people and Central Scotland serves 278,000, the vast area of the Highlands and Islands serves 277,700 people.<place-holder colnum=\"2415\"/></p><p>Within that configuration, local decision making, local operational autonomy and flexibility are absolutely vital, which is why my party has a sense of suspicion and opposition to any framework that includes top-down targets and performance indicators and which interferes with the local autonomy of our fire services.

If the issue that is hot on the lips of Scotland is the cost of the new Parliament building, the second most frequently voiced concern is undoubtedly the state of law and order in Scotland.</p><p>In my experience of speaking to audiences throughout Scotland, I have found that two particular aspects of the problem are preoccupying the minds of the public&#8212;sentencing and policing. I therefore welcome the fact that those concerns have been recognised by the First Minister, who has rightly identified as critical the regaining of trust and confidence in our criminal justice system. Equally, I am pleased to propose for genuine debate the other issue that is critical to public confidence&#8212;policing in our communities.</p><p>Implicit within the phrase \"regaining trust and confidence\" is recognition that somewhere along the line, trust and confidence have gone. Sadly, gone they have, in a big way. According to the 2001-02 Scottish household survey, a crime is committed every 1.2 minutes&#8212;in the time that this debate will take, 62 more crimes will have been committed&#8212;a violent attack takes place every 32 minutes, and every day there is a drug-related death. Disquietingly, 24 per cent of Scots feel not particularly safe or not safe at all when they are walking alone in their neighbourhood after dark.</p><p>If we look at the Executive's crime statistics for 2002 and compare them with a base point of 1997, we see that rape and attempted rape are up 24 per cent, non-sexual crimes of violence are up 25 per cent and drug crime is up 37 per cent. From the prison statistics that are provided by the Scottish Executive, we see that that the number of persons who were recalled from supervision or licence is up 430 per cent and, according to the General Register Office for Scotland, drug-related deaths are up 70 per cent. Lawlessness in Scotland has reached unacceptable levels and public confidence has disintegrated.</p><p>That leads to yet another undesirable and unquantifiable consequence, which is that many people no longer report crime because they believe that there is no point in doing so. People <place-holder colnum=\"2069\"/> are unconvinced that the perpetrators will be detected and charged. Even if that is accomplished, they believe that the subsequent court process will be tortuous and unpredictable.</p><p>For many members of the public, the final straw is the prospect of automatic early release from prison. The public are as fed up with the situation as they are with the sight of ministers weeping, wailing and gnashing their teeth. The public want political leadership; they want action to be taken now.</p><p>The first step towards re-engagement with the public is higher police visibility in our communities. The best intelligence in crime detection comes from forming a relationship with the community. The police cannot detect crime and deter criminal activity by sitting with a laptop in a command centre. Of course, strategic intelligence policing has a role to play, but not in isolation.</p><p>The founder of the modern police force, Sir Robert Peel, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Police, at all times, should maintain a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are the police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\"</p><p>That is why my party has several suggestions to make. First, we would place before the police an additional resource of &#163;45 million to facilitate concentration on neighbourhood activity. If anyone seriously questions the wisdom of that approach, they need only look at New York. In the 1980s and 1990s, New York had an appalling record on crime and, interestingly, community policing had withered away. Rudolph Giuliani applied three principles to address the situation in New York: crime should be seen as a crime and not as a social statement; police should be deployed in the streets, working in partnership with communities; and the criminal justice system should work swiftly, with effective action being taken against reoffenders. During Rudolph Giuliani's eight years in office, crime fell by 60 per cent.</p><p>Secondly, we would require all police boards, through their chief constables, to prepare a neighbourhood protection plan that was designed to deliver a zero tolerance approach to crime.</p><p>Thirdly, we would require regular publication of localised crime statistics to highlight areas that were in need of attention and methods of best practice. Given that that information is currently available to crime prevention panels throughout Scotland, I fail to understand why it cannot be made available to the public at large.</p><p>I call on the Scottish Executive to comment on our proposals; I urge its members to come forward <place-holder colnum=\"2070\"/> with their own thoughts. There is capacity for debate in this area and I hope for some constructive distillation of thoughts.</p><p>It is not enough to reconnect the police with communities. I welcome the intention to reform High Court procedure in Scotland. Indeed, I am certain that the McInnes review will make proposals for summary court procedure. Those proposals, of themselves, will not reinstate public confidence in the criminal justice system. They are merely lubricants for a mechanism that has in part become rusted.</p><p>The nub of the problem is that, for as long as automatic early release applies to sentences that are imposed by the courts, the public will continue to have a major problem with the criminal justice system. I agree that it was a Conservative Government that introduced that well-intended measure. The road to hell is indeed paved with good intentions&#8212;as the Liberal Democrats frequently find out. However, it was the Conservatives who, recognising that the measure was not working, abolished automatic remission in 1997. The Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 laid down that early release would take place only if it had been earned by co-operation and good behaviour. It also set down that the maximum remission would be one sixth of the original sentence. However, the reprieve never happened. The Labour Government at Westminster repealed the provision, which is why we are where we are today.</p><p>If anyone has any lingering doubts over the continuing nonsense about automatic early release, they need only look at today's newspapers. They will see that appeal judges have doubled the prison sentence of a stealth rapist from 18 months to three years, which is good news, as far as the public and I are concerned.

It is a disgrace that a crime is committed in Scotland every 1.2 minutes. Violent crime has gone up 25 per cent since 1997 and vandalism has gone up over 18 per cent over the same period of time. Drugs crime has gone up an unbelievable and deeply disturbing 37 per cent.</p><p>Time and again the Scottish Conservatives have called for a commitment to responsive, accountable, zero-tolerance policing with a beefed-up Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. We believe in what works. Indications from places such as New York are that such an approach is successful in reducing crime and the fear of crime and thereby brings benefits to society.</p><p>Scotland does not need to see its Executive ministers engaging in cheap political soundbites. We must start offering real reform.

We also have the horrific spectacle of deaths and appalling injuries that are brought about by the irresponsible or untrained use of fireworks. The minister referred to the statistics for last November.<place-holder colnum=\"1151\"/></p><p>Increasingly, families who wish to celebrate Guy Fawkes once a year support organised displays in which responsible arrangements are put in place. That pattern should be welcomed. I am slightly uneasy about the concept of licensing such displays, because it may result in such bureaucratic regulation that responsible voluntary activists with a good safety record are deterred from continuing with them. The practical consequence of that would be for the multiple use of fireworks to return to streets and gardens.</p><p>I hope that common sense could be applied in order to permit organisations that have held regular displays to continue with them, subject to confirmation of the details of the display and an assurance that safety arrangements are in place. Most responsible users make such provisions. The displays could be covered by a permit along the lines of the licence that is granted to a voluntary organisation that seeks a temporary liquor licence for a social event.</p><p>It might seem oppressive to interfere with the right of parents to have a bonfire in their own garden and to allow the use of non-explosive fireworks, such as sparklers. What is more problematic in this day and age and with modern housing densities, is whether the use of noise-bearing explosive fireworks can be tolerated any more in residential areas.</p><p>I come to the issue that people in Scotland are utterly fed up with: fireworks being detonated in streets or other public places indiscriminately by individuals or small groups of people. I have no hesitation in saying that such practice should be made illegal and that that illegality should be enforced.</p><p>There may be issues with stricter controls over what types of firework are permissible for retail, who should retail them, to whom they should be sold and the possibility of training for organised displays.

The Litter Act 1983 is testament to how legislation can be well intended, completely ignored and virtually unenforceable.

I do not know what the watching public will make of three harridans occupying briefs on justice and home affairs. I should also declare my interests for the purposes of this debate, as I am a member of the Law Society of Scotland, an enrolled solicitor and a partner in a law firm in Glasgow.</p><p>Like Nicola Sturgeon, I welcome the opportunity to debate measures announced by the Executive to improve the delivery of justice in Scotland. I particularly welcome the opportunity to debate the white paper, \"Modernising Justice in Scotland\" and, in the time available, I will concentrate on it.</p><p>To some people, lawyers and modernisation might sound like improbable bedfellows, but Lord Bonomy's report raises important issues and modernisation, in its broadest sense, is overdue. I shall come back to that aspect later.</p><p>It is important that any proposals for change proceed on a proper analysis of the spectrum of justice and do not simply emerge from the powerful platform of lawyers talking to their own in a procedural microcosm.</p><p>The white paper commences with a commendable objective, stating that the aim is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to reduce crime and reoffending\".</p><p>My party certainly supports that objective. However, the objective also implies that the High Court element of the process is a part of a whole and not a free-standing component.</p><p>The process of criminal justice starts with someone with a sense of civic responsibility reporting criminal activity to the police and assuming that the police will be able quickly and competently to gather evidence and that the police will charge the perpetrator and set in train the necessary court procedure. The good citizen then assumes, likewise, that the court procedure will be discharged swiftly and that, if conviction of the perpetrator is the outcome, the conclusion will be the imposition of a sentence that fits the crime.</p><p>That process should produce fairness to the accused and reassurance to the victim and the civic-minded reporter of the incident that the criminal justice system works. However, I have to say that the public verdict on our criminal justice system is currently a little less charitable.</p><p>My party finds merit in the idea of increasing the sentencing power of the sheriff court in jury cases from three to five years. Equally, we acknowledge that that will place a more onerous responsibility on our sheriffs and will add a significant work load <place-holder colnum=\"1057\"/> to our sheriff courts, which already rank among the busiest courts in Europe. It is worth noting that such is the volume of criminal work in a sheriff court that a 20 per cent reduction in indictments in the High Court will represent only a 7 per cent increase in sheriff and jury cases. Against that, we have to consider a further increase in work load that will arise from the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill that is currently before the Parliament.</p><p>It does not take a mathematical genius to work out that the sheriff courts will grind to a halt unless much more resource is allocated to them. I noticed the minister's hooked comment that some people might choose to make this a debate on resources but, frankly, if seismic changes of the sort that are proposed in the white paper are made, the consequences will be an increase in work for the sheriff courts and the resource implications of that will have to be considered. Quite simply, the courts could not function without some augmentation of personnel and infrastructure. I would like the minister to comment on that aspect and to inform the Parliament what the current estimate is for additional personnel&#8212;including, perhaps, new sheriffs&#8212;in the sheriff courts, once the new provisions are implemented.</p><p>My party welcomes an increase in the sentencing powers that are available to sheriffs for summary cases. I hope that that will not be lost sight of. I share Nicola Sturgeon's interest in Sheriff McInnes's forthcoming report on summary justice in the sheriff courts.</p><p>We welcome the principle of a mandatory preliminary hearing, providing that it does not become the route to adjournment and delay, not only because that would be undesirable but also because failure to bring a case for trial within 140 days for full committal before a sheriff would mean the release of the accused on bail regardless of the charges that the accused might face. Naturally, the public might have an interest in that. Equally, we support, in principle, sentence discount for early plea, although the need for consistency is of paramount importance.</p><p>I noticed the minister's comment with reference to a judicial commission on sentencing. It will be interesting to learn the specific proposals for that commission, because a fundamental principle of the law of Scotland is that judicial discretion in sentencing is vital.</p><p>On the issue of the time that is spent by the accused on bail, Lord Bonomy proposed a new nine-month deadline for the case to go to a preliminary hearing, effectively requiring the Crown to issue the indictment within eight months. We support that and regret that the Executive has not had the courage to grasp that opportunity. If the Executive were to concede the principle of a <place-holder colnum=\"1058\"/> reduction being possible, the reduction of the existing period from 11 to only 10 months would be much more attractive. The opportunity should have been seized and Lord Bonomy's proposal implemented.</p><p>I now come to two issues of profound concern, which&#8212;the minister will be disappointed to hear this&#8212;concern resourcing. They are the overall resourcing of the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p><p>The availability and swift provision of evidence to the prosecution depends upon the police being able to do their job timeously. The appalling recent disclosure that, due to time bar and delay by police or reporting agency, more than 17,000 cases were marked no proceedings in 2002-03 is the measure of the problem. Unless we resource the police properly, we can reform the High Court until the cows come home, but there will be no improvement. My party, as the minister is aware, supports a significant increase in resources for the police&#8212;an extra &#163;45 million per annum.</p><p>The Lord Advocate described the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service as a cinderella department due to a great lack of resources. If lack of resources is masquerading as a catalyst for changes in procedure, that is not acceptable.</p><p>That brings me to the nub of my concerns&#8212;the proposal to extend the 110-day rule, whereby an accused may spend an extra 30 days in custody before coming to trial. A fundamental precept of Scots criminal law is that an accused person must not be allowed to languish in jail for an unreasonable time and that the prosecution should be given a reasonable time to prepare the case. That principle has reigned supreme for three centuries. The period was 100 days, and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887 increased it to 110 days. I find it remarkable that, in the days of Sir Walter Scott and the quill pen&#8212;before telephone, fax, e-mail and the internet had ever been heard of&#8212;prosecution and defence agents could bring cases to trial within 100 days, but in 2003, with communications technology undreamt of 300 years ago, we need 140 days to get a case ready for trial.</p><p>The reality is that an under-resourced police force and an under-resourced Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service are not being given the tools to do the job quickly. That is no excuse for sweeping away the 100-day rule. It is no justification for denying an accused, who may be innocent, his or her liberty for a further 30 days. That is not modernisation. It is repression and it is illiberal. I urge the minister to give that aspect of the proposals the most careful thought.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland, in its response to Lord Bonomy's report, did not support extending <place-holder colnum=\"1059\"/> the 110-day limit. I will quote from that response, which was prepared by the Law Society's criminal law committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee would suggest that the solution to the problem is not extending the time limit but rather in directing greater resources to solving the problem.\"</p><p>As a member of the Law Society, I am entitled to see that submission. I am somewhat filled with regret that the debate is taking place without full sight of a summary of the responses that were submitted to Lord Bonomy, although I appreciate that they are due to come out imminently.</p><p>The real modernisation that we need in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is the deployment of modern technology in all its forms to facilitate better and swifter engagement with defence representatives, professional witnesses and the panoply of personnel who are involved in a trial and thereby to expedite dispatch of cases comfortably within the 110-day period. That requires increased resources at every stage in the process. That is why I have lodged the amendment in my name.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-191.2, to leave out from \"supporting\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and, while welcoming proposals to make more efficient the processing and disposal of criminal cases, expresses concern at the proposed extension to the 110 day rule, the resources implication for sheriff courts of handling an increased workload and the continuing inadequacy of resources available to the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\"</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13299421", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, may I thank the minister for her kind remarks and wish her well in her ministerial position.

There are various forms of torture that one group of human beings may seek to visit on another, but the Scottish Executive subjecting the hapless group of souls called the wind-up speakers to four and a half hours of sitting in sepulchral Gothic surroundings on chairs akin to picnic stools while listening to 36 speeches is among the more excruciating. As a mechanism for debate, that structure has been cumbersome, unfocused and tedious and I hope that it is not repeated. Despite that, I agree with Mr Brown that there have been some excellent maiden speeches and some worthy contributions from all sections of the chamber.</p><p>The content of the legislative programme may also be described as unfocused. My colleague, Mr McLetchie, posed a general question: has the Executive analysed what the electorate told it on 1 May, when less than half the population voted? The population told us that there is disillusion with politicians, disillusion with politics and disillusion with devolution. Is that because of the flagship of Scottish Executive profligacy&#8212;the cost of the new Parliament building? Is it because of the money that is spent by politicians on politicians, on the number of ministers and on the size of Government? Is it to do with failure of delivery, whereby there are bigger waiting lists, longer waiting times, escalating crime, failing standards in education and mounting indiscipline in the classroom? The list could continue.</p><p>What is the Executive's analysis of the troubling malaise? Its analysis seems to be that Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians know best. Rather than radical, focused and prioritised measures to dispel the malaise, reassure the electorate and address the problems, there is in the legislative programme either silence or atrophy.</p><p>This morning, Mr Wallace said that the economy was the top priority. So it should be, as there is growth stagnation, the highest business rate in the UK and a seized-up transport system. What specific proposals does the Executive have? None.</p><p>Figures that were released yesterday disclosed an alarming situation in relation to law and order. Most disturbing was the increase in drugs crimes, but what specific proposals does the Executive have for improved drugs rehabilitation? None. Are there proposals for more police to address the rest of the turbulence in the law and order scene? No. <place-holder colnum=\"281\"/></p><p>Are there proposals for honest sentencing? No.</p><p>It is surprising that the Executive's focus turns on youth crime. Members may be equally surprised to learn that I agree with much of what Mr Fox said. The focus on youth crime is surprising for two reasons. First, other forms of crime are showing more marked increases than youth crime. Secondly, when in the previous session the Executive had the chance to support Conservative amendments to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill to achieve greater robustness in dealing with youth crime, it voted against the very measures that it now seeks to introduce.</p><p>More disturbing health statistics have been disclosed today. The reform that the legislative programme proposes is tinkering at the margins; the programme proposes no radical restoration of control to our health professionals and to patients, but a temporary adjustment of procedures and of some mechanisms.</p><p>The legislative programme does not answer the plaintive plea of the people of Scotland, which was so clamantly expressed on 1 May. Where the programme should respond it is silent and when it responds it either misses the mark or does not even reach the target. The programme is timid, because where it should shout it is mute and where it speaks it whimpers.</p>", "hdate": "2003-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13297163", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Brown has been the personification of tolerance and patience, but that is about as far as I can go on consensus.

I always feel that debates on committee reports are rather curious parliamentary beasts. Much prowling round the jungle has gone on, to the accompaniment of roars, grunts and snuffles, and there has been some locking of horns, but when the ultimate product is unanimous&#8212;as this report is&#8212;it usually means that no one emerges bloody and bitter.</p><p>I see the visible disappointment of members, who are no doubt asking, \"Does this mean the report is passive or inert&#8212;just another committee report?\" Nothing could be further from the truth, because the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee has a mind of its own. Indeed, it has been innovatory and, some would say, harbours its own idiosyncrasies. It is none the worse for that.</p><p>Before we proceed to the report, there are certain courtesies to be observed. First, I am not Alex Neil, the convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee&#8212;we are not quite that idiosyncratic&#8212;but I thank him for departing from traditional practice in allowing me as deputy convener to lead for the committee in this debate. That is an act of characteristic gallantry. I think that he took the view that as one of only two original committee members&#8212;Marilyn Livingstone being the other&#8212;our dowager status should be acknowledged.</p><p>If the Parliament will indulge me briefly, I will say that serving on the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee has been challenging but immensely interesting and pleasurable. The committee has been positive for the parliamentary process. It is pleasing that the media frequently accord the adjective \"influential\" to the committee.</p><p>I thank the clerking support team of Simon Watkins, Judith Evans, Jane Sutherland and Michael Govind for their advice and forbearance. Judith Evans and Jane Sutherland were the clerks for the case studies in Denmark and California, and I thank them for mothering beyond the call of duty. Our clerks have been of the highest calibre. The committee is also indebted to our adviser Roger Carter for his sage comments; to the many <place-holder colnum=\"18167\"/> organisations and individuals who gave the committee oral or written evidence; to Stevens and Associates for its immensely helpful and instructive research, which was commissioned pre-inquiry; to the Scottish Parliament information centre for welcome research support during the inquiry; and to the Parliamentary Bureau and the Conveners Group for making time available for the debate. I think that I am correct in saying that, with the exception of the Finance Committee, the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee has had more debates in the chamber than any other committee.</p><p>Alex Neil would wish me to express a final note of appreciation to the committee's members. A heavy volume of work had to be packed into a tight schedule. Four cross-party case studies were undertaken in Scotland. They covered VisitScotland's e-tourism venture; rural tourism issues and the impact of foot-and-mouth disease in Dumfries and Galloway; golf tourism in Fife and business tourism in Scotland; and urban tourism and dispersal issues in Edinburgh. Two cross-party studies were undertaken abroad, which involved myself and Tavish Scott&#8212;very agreeable&#8212;going to Copenhagen and taking in Malm&#246; in Sweden, and Alex Neil and Gordon Jackson going to California in the USA.</p><p>In short, much was asked of members, who responded spiritedly. The committee had a healthy and robust debate as it shaped its views, but all was achieved without our eating lumps out of one another. That is probably just as well&#8212;otherwise, the exercise might have been indigestible.</p><p>The report is the sixth full report that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee has produced after holding an inquiry. It is a thorough and robust piece of work. I intend not to go through the report ad longum, but simply to comment on pivotal processes and aspects of the report. I do not intend even to use the full time allocated for my speech, because it is important for other members to be given the chance to speak.</p><p>In June last year, the committee agreed that the inquiry's remit would be to inquire into the levels and effectiveness of Government support for tourism. The committee also agreed to pose a set of key questions to stimulate and focus debate. Those questions were singularly significant and can be found at paragraph 43 of the report.</p><p>Of undoubted assistance in pointing the committee in the right direction was the pre-inquiry research from Stevens and Associates to which I have referred. That research achieved a status in its own right and focused the committee on matters that merited investigation.</p><p>The external research is worth dwelling on. A <place-holder colnum=\"18168\"/> sample of countries and territories was identified for comparison with Scotland on five key tourism markers, which were the scale, nature and growth of tourism; the structure and nature of governance in support of tourism; the nature and level of direct and indirect support of tourism; marketing strategies and trends, whether niche or general promotion; and the perception of the country or region as a tourist destination. The report of the findings of those comparisons facilitated the identification of practice that was applicable to tourism in Scotland. It did not always produce an outcome that was entirely favourable to Scotland.</p><p>The research report identified five key lessons for Scotland. The first was that Scotland should create a clear and focused national tourism strategy that involves leading private sector representatives. The second was that Scotland should encourage different products and service providers to establish a strategic alliance that meets market demand. I think that I speak for the whole committee when I say that those two lessons were material in influencing the committee's approach to the inquiry.</p><p>The committee had a mission and a compass, but did not necessarily know what it would encounter on the journey. It soon became clear that the tourism territory in Scotland was congested and that numerous bodies, organisations and individuals were struggling to perform roles, provide advice and represent provider groups in the industry&#8212;not to mention the prominent roles that some providers play. All of that was set against a backdrop of various Scottish Executive strategies and initiatives.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the situation contrasted sharply with that in Denmark and California, where the lead position of the industry was not only prominent but unquestioned. It is no co-incidence that that situation forms part of our key recommendations: members will find them in paragraphs 172 and 173. It is vital that the industry's voice be clear, visible and articulate, and that there is not a chorus of collective contributions.</p><p>It was also clear that a critical factor in the success of competitor destinations was the attraction of new air links&#8212;that was an issue that weighed heavily with the committee. The committee agrees that the Executive's new route development fund is a sensible contribution to meeting that need, but further work needs to be undertaken by VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies to prosecute actively the case for such development.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13290485", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is my pleasure to open on behalf of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee this debate on the committee's report on the future of tourism in Scotland.

What is important is that we are where we are. We are working with a new devolved Parliament within the context of the United Kingdom. The BTA is a significant association and operator in the tourism field, and, from committee members' direct experience, I believe that the BTA has a positive contribution to make to the development of Scottish tourism. Perhaps Mr MacAskill will want to pursue those aspects further with either VisitScotland or the minister.</p><p>There were also key recommendations in the report on Executive strategies and targets for research, business tourism, e-tourism and skills.

Growth was stunted in 2002. The second quarter showed a rise of 0.2 per cent, and the third a rise of 0.6 per cent, and that after the first recession in 20 years. Furthermore, according to figures released today for the three months up to December 2002, we have higher unemployment than the rest of the UK. In 2002, we lost more than 7,000 jobs in manufacturing and, to date in 2003, total job losses are running at more than 2,400.</p><p>In the third quarter of 2002, the number of business start-ups showed a decrease of 22.6 per cent from the previous quarter. In 2002, the number of company insolvencies increased by 23.6 per cent. Business rates are almost 9 per cent higher than in England because of the higher Scottish business rate poundage. New regulations are piling on cost to business. According to the Institute of Directors, between 1997 and 2002, the annual cost to British business was &#163;6 billion.

We might have been prepared to listen to some of his arguments if he had communicated some enthusiasm for public-private partnerships or private finance initiatives to fund transport improvements, attempted to disguise the SNP's intrinsic hostility to the private sector or recognised that policies that have no costings or specification and that include higher taxation are unimpressive and unconvincing, but he did not do so. Instead, he tediously trotted out yet again the independence monologue. However, credit where credit is due. Mr MacAskill demonstrated one commendable piece of good sense: he did not talk about mutton dressed as lamb, whereas Mr MacKay was getting on to very dangerous ground.</p><p>It is my pleasure to wind up the debate on behalf of the Conservatives. David Mundell made a telling, eloquent speech. The motion in his name encapsulates the precise problems that surround <place-holder colnum=\"14176\"/> the Scottish Executive's transport strategy and plans. As he said, it is evident from the proposals, strategies, announcements and initiatives that there is no commitment and no specification. He said that we need to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"flesh out reality and fact\".</p><p>He also pointed out that we look to the Liberal Democrats to conjoin with us on the issue of transport and to provide a degree of opposition and was right to ask where the Liberal Democrat Opposition is in the Parliament. The Liberal Democrats' sycophantic fawning over the Scottish Executive is eclipsed only by the political flatulence that seems to accompany their contributions to our debates&#8212;great volumes of gut rumbling, but nothing of substance, significance or relevance emerges.</p><p>David Mundell focused on the complete lack of specification on transport. This is not year 1, year 2 or even year 3 of the Parliament. This is year 4, and the Executive's performance on transport to date has been, frankly, lamentable.</p><p>I looked forward to Mr Macdonald's opening speech with anticipation, but not for long. I jotted down the phrases that he was to repeat with great regularity: \"priority projects\", \"partnership\", \"missing links\" and the \"resources\" that are to be identified for those priorities. When Mr Adam intervened to ask about the western peripheral route in Aberdeen, Mr Macdonald had to be specific, but that was as specific as he got. He quickly went back to talking about projects, partnerships and availability of resources. He then uttered a telling phrase: apparently, \"over the coming months\", we are to get the detail of the grand plan that the Executive is hatching for transport. With that dynamic and rousing conclusion to a lacklustre and colourless performance, he sat down.</p><p>I thought that the minister's wind-up speech might afford some comfort, but it exceeded his opening speech in torpor, dullness and lack of specification.</p><p>I noticed that Bristow Muldoon criticised the Conservatives by saying that we do not want to discuss our record. I am happy to discuss our record. I suggest that Mr Muldoon should sit back&#8212;perhaps Mr McNeil will be able to provide comfort and support&#8212;while I tell him about our record. He will find the facts distressing. In the final four years of the Conservative Government, &#163;907 million was spent on new construction and improvements. That figure contrasts with the figure of &#163;603 million in the first four years of the Labour Government. It also contrasts with the figure of &#163;617 million for the first four years of Executive responsibility, which includes the 2002-03 forecast.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13279971", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport (Investment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with great pleasure that I rise wearing the national colour of the Scottish Conservatives.

Without the inheritance of 1997, it would not have been possible for him to do that.</p><p>Mr Wilson raised the issue of business rates. I was in business when the uniform business rate was imposed and as one of many hard-pressed business people in Scotland, I regarded it as an answer to a prayer. It is ridiculous to suggest that the absence of the uniform business rate is in any way beneficial to Scottish business.</p><p>Before I took Mr Wilson's intervention, I referred to the Scottish National Party's profound suspicion and distrust of the private sector. Despite everything that Mr Wilson said, one would have <place-holder colnum=\"13606\"/> thought that the SNP motion might pay lip service to some of the concerns that the business community has expressed recently. Mr Wilson says that we should get back to reality. What planet does he dwell on? The business community to which he refers is not the community with which I engage and that I meet. The chairman of the Confederation of British Industry Scotland, Mr Jack Perry, said at the recent CBI dinner:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need&#8212;</p><p>he is talking about now&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"increased investment in transport&#8212;both public transport and the long long overdue completion of our motorway network. Business rates is a classic example of public policy conflicting with a shared business and political agenda of supporting enterprise and growth.\"</p><p>If the business community is looking to the Scottish National Party for succour or support, the SNP motion is about as comforting as the throwing of a lifebelt made of cement would be to a drowning man. The amendment that I have lodged is intended to address the void in the motion. Since the Parliament was established, the Conservatives have been the only party to champion the uniform business rate and improved investment in transport infrastructure. Those two issues can be addressed now.</p><p>If the Scottish National Party has nothing to say, the Scottish Executive has no cause for complacency. New Labour at Westminster and at Edinburgh has presided&#8212;with its Liberal Democrat colleagues&#8212;over recession, poor GDP growth, poor business profitability and higher unemployment in Scotland relative to the rest of the UK. Most recently, it has imposed a tax on jobs, through the national insurance contribution hike. It is very troubling that since 1997 Scottish business has paid an additional &#163;3.3 billion in tax, which amounts to a staggering &#163;11,225 for each enterprise in Scotland. There has also been a steady decline in business start-ups since 1997. If we add to that the abolition of the uniform business rate by Mr McConnell, the neglect of our transport infrastructure and the imposition by the coalition Executive of almost 500 new regulations that affect business, we will have no difficulty in identifying Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Edinburgh as a nightmare proposition for business.</p><p>The Scottish National Party has nothing to say that would help. The coalition Executive says repeatedly that it will help, but it does nothing. I have a challenge for the minister. He should not pretend&#8212;as has been trailed in today's headlines&#8212;that not increasing business rates is a tremendous triumph for the Executive. By the same logic, the Executive would argue that its promise not to use the Parliament's tax-raising powers is a great prize for business. I challenge <place-holder colnum=\"13607\"/> the Executive to do something meaningful and to announce today in the comprehensive spending review that the uniform business rate will be restored, which would mean a cut in business rates for many businesses.

It enables <place-holder colnum=\"13535\"/> us to reflect on our special relationship with America, which is bound by links that have been close and enduring since Scots left these shores to carve a new life in that new country. When the appalling events of 11 September last year unfolded, and that savage barbarism was visited on innocent people, we felt with particular keenness the outrage, horror, bewilderment and dismay that was experienced all over the world.</p><p>Those of us who were at St Giles cathedral earlier today drew comfort from the service and from the presence of Scots, Americans and people from the rest of the United Kingdom and abroad. We joined together in a sense of human union to share our reflections and to look ahead. Members certainly drew comfort from Johnston McKay's words in the chamber earlier. That is why it is timely and fitting that we should remember those black and horrific events in the Parliament today. It is also timely and fitting that we in Scotland should reassure our friends that, as we reflect on our memory, we also reflect on our friendship with America and look to the future, mindful of the positive virtues and attributes of our friendship.</p><p>September 11 of last year is a date that is marked indelibly in the annals of history. It is unique for the most horrendous reasons, but it is also a catalyst for going forward positively. That is why I say with regret that the amendment to the Executive motion that has been lodged by the Scottish National Party seems to me to be in poor taste. The amendment is inappropriate to the debate and to the Parliament. The motion was an opportunity for the Parliament to demonstrate unanimity of sentiment and support for an old friend. It is unfortunate that the SNP has chosen to diminish that opportunity. If the SNP insisted on raising matters outwith the motion, it would have been sensitive for it to do so in its own debating time tomorrow, without intruding on this debate. It is my pleasure, on behalf of the Conservatives, to speak to and to support the motion.</p><p>I remember my first encounter with Americans. When I was a little girl, my father brought home two American sailors&#8212;naval officers, I presume&#8212;from the Polaris base on the Clyde. It was interesting for two reasons. First, my father was not in the habit of bringing home sailors. Secondly, when the two officers removed their naval caps, they revealed to my astonishment that their hair was cut short across the tops of their heads&#8212;to accommodate their caps, as I thought. Without realising that it was a crew cut, I assumed that America must be a very cold place where everybody had to have their hair shaved off to accommodate appropriate headgear. I also remember their geniality and warmth, which was obvious even to a small child. That is a hallmark of Americans. Certainly, the physical presence of Americans in Scotland&#8212;perhaps most notably <place-holder colnum=\"13536\"/> during the second world war and at the naval base on the Clyde&#8212;has been a tangible demonstration of the empathy that exists between our two countries.</p><p>That empathy is not surprising, however, given the strong Scottish influence that there has been on America. James Wilson, who was born in St Andrews and settled in Philadelphia, and Dr John Witherspoon, of whom mention has been made and who was also born in Scotland, were signatories of the declaration of independence. A further seven signatories were directly or indirectly descended from Scots. That got the States off to a good start. Another Scot, Alexander Hamilton, proposed the American national banking system and is now depicted on the American $10 bill. Thirty-five United States Supreme Court justices have been Scots, and numerous locations in America have been nostalgically named after places that Scottish immigrants left behind. There are eight Aberdeens, seven Glasgows and&#8212;here is a statistic to conjure with&#8212;eight Edinburghs. No fewer than 11 United States Presidents have been of Scots ancestry and one of them&#8212;Woodrow Wilson&#8212;said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every line of strength in American history is a line coloured with Scottish blood.\"</p><p>Small wonder that, with that pedigree and those influences, there is a special historical and genealogical bond between our two countries.</p><p>That enduring closeness continues in a physical form today. I am delighted that Liane Dorsey, from the United States Consulate General, is with us today. She has taken an enthusiastic interest in the Parliament since 1999&#8212;an interest that has been obvious to all members&#8212;and her presence here is very welcome. Another prominent American in Scotland, who is also a lady&#8212;I still distinguish ladies from women&#8212;is Susan Rice, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB Scotland. She is prominent in Scottish public life and has taken a keen interest in Scottish affairs. We are pleased that, after Alexander Hamilton explained banking to America, the United States has been able to send Susan Rice back over here to check that we are still on top of the game.</p><p>Besides those historical, cultural and personal links between our countries, there are some important business aspects. Figures for 2000-01 show that approximately 12 per cent of Scotland's exports go to the United States at a value of around &#163;2.5 billion a year. Visitors from the USA represent the largest source of overseas tourism in Scotland, accounting for &#163;189 million&#8212;24 per cent of expenditure by foreign tourists in this country. There are also roughly 287 American companies in Scotland. Naturally, the events of last year influenced the confidence of Americans in air travel, and that has been visible in Scotland. <place-holder colnum=\"13537\"/></p><p>We hope that renewed confidence will emerge, so that we can welcome more Americans to our country.</p><p>As those business links indicate, there is mutual opportunity to be developed. America has a remarkable entrepreneurial aptitude and a willingness to tackle things. Theodore Roosevelt said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\"</p><p>Scots adopt the same practical approach. Recently, Susan Rice said to me:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is a similarity of mindset. People in the US are brought up to believe that anyone can achieve anything they want. Common man makes good. In Scotland, people eschew airs and graces and make a place for anyone who has merit.\"</p><p>I agree with her. However, I think that the Scots would concede that we seem to lack the confidence that is so obvious in the enterprise of America, where there are examples for us to follow.</p><p>We should look at that unashamed, unabashed entrepreneurial attitude and emulate it over here. We should borrow from that confident, irrepressible energy. We should admire a political climate that nurtures and facilitates enterprise and does not seek to obstruct it. We should copy a model that says that business breeds business.</p><p>I am told that at the BIO 2002 conference in Toronto earlier this year, Lord Sainsbury, on behalf of the United Kingdom, indicated that research spending in the UK would increase by 5 to 7 per cent per annum. A delegate from the audience intimated that the National Institutes of Health in the USA would increase research funding by 10 to 15 per cent per annum and double the budget in five years.</p><p>What is our vision? What about our transport links? What about our physical connections with America? There must be improved transatlantic air travel. If we are to develop the marvellous opportunities that exist for both countries, we must find a way of physically manifesting them to enable that mobility of travel for holiday and business purposes.</p><p>The Parliament has certainly facilitated contact with the United States and tartan day is an obvious example of that. It has also led to parliamentary visits with reference to trade, research and development potential. Indeed, the Deputy First Minister referred to the Scottish affairs office. We applaud those initiatives, which are fruitful and worth while. We would like to see those links improved. The Parliament needs to direct its attention to how best that should be taken forward.</p><p>As America looks upward and forward after 11 <place-holder colnum=\"13538\"/> September of last year, Scotland looks upward and forward with her. In our respective domestic affairs, there is a special niche for our two countries and we look forward to that partnership going from strength to strength.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13278354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Links with the USA"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is timely and fitting.

The business community should be engaged in a corporate fandango of unfettered jubilation, but it is not.</p><p>The general sense of frustration and anger can be easily explained by such public relations nightmares as the new Parliament building and perverse priorities that place issues such as the banning of fox hunting and the smacking by parents of children ahead of creating a health service that treats ill people when they need treatment. There was also the recent embarrassment of MSPs voting on their salary increases. It is small wonder that the public are scunnered.</p><p>What about the business community? It can now engage in the political process with unprecedented ease. There is a Scottish Executive with 20 ministers and an Executive department that is devoted to enterprise that has legions of civil servants. There are 129 MSPs.

That gap is worsening and employers increasingly despair about that further challenge.</p><p>This is a picture of a country that does not have an enterprise culture, whose Executive displays an inability to understand business, and in which the economy is stagnating.

Work is being done by the enterprise networks and by some very good local authorities. I say to Duncan McNeil that Inverclyde Council and Renfrewshire Council deserve their share of praise for responding to extremely challenging situations. Mr Macdonald will confirm that the enterprise networks and local authorities receive the biggest chunk of the Scottish Executive's budget. Local authorities receive about &#163;6.2 billion. The Scottish Enterprise network, along with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, also receives a very considerable sum of money. If that is not working, what are the enterprise networks and local authorities being paid to do? To be honest, such a generalisation would be a little harsh on both the enterprise networks and local authorities.</p><p>I have not been diffident in being critical of the enterprise network. My principal concern is not that the enterprise companies do not have a job to do, but that I have not been able to perceive that they are doing that job to best effect. A valid question remains to be asked about that, given the resources that the enterprise network receives. Clearly, there are some areas of extremely good practice. I would like to think that that good practice would be replicated throughout Scotland. That would be the best way of contributing towards a regeneration programme.</p><p>Mr Campbell referred to the involvement of MSPs in regeneration. There are none so precious as those who belong to the same club, but if we were to ask the public what they think about the involvement of MSPs, the response might be problematic. MSPs have a role to play. Clearly we must be conduits of information, instruments for raising the profile of areas and authors of new ideas, suggestions and proposals. However, to be honest, the main hope for regeneration is to find sustainable enterprise, because that is the best way of bringing new life to areas. Both Colin Campbell and Duncan McNeil acknowledged that.</p><p>I was pleased to see&#8212;indeed, I lodged a motion referring to it&#8212;that last week <i>business a.m.</i> contained what can only be described as a glowing tribute to Renfrewshire Council and Inverclyde Council for their attempts to bring about regeneration in extremely challenging circumstances. Although we all applaud the concept of regeneration, I think that that is best achieved by solutions and proposals that are flexible. There was all-party agreement to a report <place-holder colnum=\"10133\"/> by the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee on the impact at local level of business development services. That report stated that the best provisions are those that are locally tailored. That was the rationale for the suggestion that local fora be created.</p><p>Much is already happening. The one aspect of the motion that makes me slightly uneasy&#8212;Mr Macdonald will probably share my unease&#8212;is the statement that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Scottish Executive should provide resources\".</p><p>I believe that the resources that are being provided are generous. I did not notice Mr McNeil calling on Mr Macdonald to increase those resources. The challenge is to ensure that the resources that are currently on offer are being used to best effect.

It is for that reason that the Conservatives wish to signal to the business community in Scotland that we consider the Scottish economy to be a priority, not withstanding the obscurity that seems to enshroud that topic in the list of priorities that were delivered to the Parliament yesterday by the First Minister.</p><p>Two needs are overdue. One is to signal to the business community in Scotland that the Executive has some sense of commitment to the economy and some idea about how to address current, cogent problems. The other is to try to illustrate to the business community that devolution can be a catalyst for a healthy economy, a dynamic for facilitating growth and investment and an instrument whereby some of the more pressing problems that affect business can be identified and addressed.</p><p>The needs are overdue because the factual backdrop to the debate is depressing. Last year, in excess of 20,000 jobs were lost to the Scottish economy. Labour has delivered to Scotland a higher business rate poundage than there is in England. The consequence of that is that Scottish business is paying 9 per cent more than its English counterpart. From 1997, business start-ups have been in steady decline. I wish that I could share the minister's optimism about start-ups over the past year but, with respect, the evidence on which to found that optimism seems insufficient.</p><p>Economic growth in Scotland lags alarmingly behind that of the rest of the United Kingdom. No member of the Scottish Parliament can afford to <place-holder colnum=\"5308\"/> feel uninterested in, remote from or complacent about that background. Unless that is addressed, the Scottish Executive's list of priorities that was launched yesterday will sound even more unconvincing and the stature of the Scottish Parliament will be diminished further.</p><p>Another disturbing dimension of the backdrop to the debate is the burden of red tape and regulation that strangles Scottish business. Those words tend to be uttered with a regularity that may make them sound like platitudes. Indeed, to people who are uninterested and uninvolved in business and who feel remote from it, they may sound tedious and boring.</p><p>For the benefit of such an audience, let me illustrate what red tape and regulation mean. For a small business with 10 to 14 employees, it means spending 31 hours a month complying with Government regulations and paperwork. For a business employing more than 50 employees, it means spending approximately 43 and a half hours a month complying with Government regulations and paperwork. It goes without saying that while such a burden is unwelcome to business of any size, it is particularly oppressive on medium-sized and small enterprises. Larger concerns can probably afford to fund the resource to cope with red tape alone, and many larger organisations do just that. While it is a sterile use of resource, benefiting neither the work force nor the generation of economic growth, at least the larger concern can manage the problem. However, that is not an option for medium-sized and smaller businesses, which account for nearly 90 per cent of the business community as a whole.</p><p>It is therefore no surprise to find in a Federation of Small Businesses survey that 83 per cent of small businesses were unhappy at the level of legislation encroaching on their firms and that red tape is annually cited as one of the biggest barriers to business growth in Scotland. Something has to be done about it&#8212;to do so is not beyond the wit of man. In fairness to the Scottish Executive, the creation of the improving regulation in Scotland unit&#8212;the IRIS unit&#8212;was an encouraging innovation. My Conservative colleagues and I welcomed the creation of that unit. Indeed, the initial omens were positive. The Executive described the IRIS unit as equipped to take speedy action and outward looking, and said that the unit would take on board the concerns of the Scottish business community, put a searchlight on business regulation and be serious about tackling unwanted burdens on business. In answer to a parliamentary question, the minister confirmed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Improving Regulation in Scotland (IRIS) Unit can make the most telling contribution by ensuring that the Scottish Executive takes fully into account the need for all regulations to be proportionate and fit for purpose.\"&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"5309\"/></p><p>[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Written Answers</i>, 11 October 2001; p 280.]</p><p>We all waited with excitement and anticipation for the newly created shining knight of IRIS to gallop forth on a white horse with sharpened blade to start slashing his&#8212;or, in this politically correct age, her&#8212;way through the jungle of stifling red tape that cocoons our business community. My first encounter with IRIS was not encouraging. It suggested that the horse was limping, the knight had become saddle-sore and the sword had been handed over to the theatrical props department. I make that comment because I was invited to and, with anticipation, attended a seminar organised by IRIS. On arriving, I found that there was a generous representation of civil servants and an audience of few people whom I recognised. When I perused the attendance list I found that the audience comprised multiple representations from some local authorities, representation from trade or business organisations and associations and, from what I could see, hardly anyone from business. The attendance complement seemed to number between 50 and 60 people, and when I inquired about the composition of the audience, I ascertained that approximately three people were in business in their own right. It was no surprise, therefore, to read the editor's comment in the December 2001 issue of <i>Business in Scotland</i>. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The IRIS seminars on red tape went largely unnoticed by business people, those who did attend as individual businesses were few and far between and came away with little hope that the Scottish Executive could do more than sympathise.\"</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13264096", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been a matter of concern to the Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament that debates on the Scottish economy are too few and that statements by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning in response to job crises are too infrequent.

If we examine that period of two years and seven months, the need for re-expression of those priorities can be explained.

Fuel tax, transportation costs and fewer economic levers combine to make those economies less tough and robust and more vulnerable than economies elsewhere. Many of those remote and rural areas depend on tourism and agriculture, but 2001 has been a bleak black year for those sectors.</p><p>The foot-and-mouth epidemic was particularly devastating in south-west Scotland and the Borders; it directly killed off some businesses and was a body blow for the rest. Tourism was a casualty and although the Scottish Executive's measures were welcome, there are continuing concerns over whether help is going directly to where it is needed.</p><p>I do not doubt that the terrorist atrocities of 11 September have had a further effect on tourism, which is the industry that many people in rural and remote Scotland hope might be the life-blood of their survival. Today's edition of <i>The Scotsman</i> states that Sir Walter Scott's home in the Borders underwent</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a disastrous decline in visitor numbers during the 2001 season\"</p><p>as a result of foot-and-mouth disease and the terrorist attacks in the United States.</p><p>Against that sombre and depressing backdrop, something lurks that sends a chill through those areas&#8212;the aggregates tax, which comes into force in April 2002. The tax will pound Scottish quarries, the majority of which are in rural and remote parts of Scotland. The tax is meant to help the environment by reducing demand for quarried aggregates and by encouraging aggregate <place-holder colnum=\"3968\"/> consumers to recycle existing materials. However, the result will be the opposite&#8212;in my judgment, it is a tax on the environment.</p><p>The aggregates levy masquerades as an environmental measure that is aimed at promoting sustainable development, but it has no environmental justification. It assumes that Scotland has adequate materials for recycling, but there are serious concerns about the basis for that assumption. The aggregates that are produced in Scotland are needed and the tax will make them too expensive to buy. The tax will not benefit responsible operators; it will clobber them and it will not reward operators that work to high environmental standards.</p><p>There are more anomalies. Aggregates that are dug out of the ground for export will not be subject to the tax, but aggregates for use in this country will be. Opencast coal mining will be exempt from the tax, despite the fact that it is regarded by some people as being environmentally damaging.</p><p>Ironically, the aggregates tax will damage the environment, because many small quarrying companies will undoubtedly be forced to close. That will inevitably force companies to transport aggregates over longer distances as the number of supply quarries decreases. That can only exacerbate the harm that is caused to the environment.</p><p>The economic argument against the tax is even more conclusive. Scotland has 224 quarries; many are hubs of economic activity in rural communities. The livelihoods of about 1,500 employees depend upon a thriving aggregates market. Quarries are also indirectly responsible for many other sources of employment, such as engineering, fabrication and plant hire. It is vital that the aggregates levy is viewed in that context.</p><p>There is an economic argument&#8212;I am sure that it will be stated by the minister&#8212;that the resultant redistribution of the tax will create a neutral effect. It will not. In Scotland, which is far more vulnerable to the implications of the imposition of this tax than any other part of the United Kingdom, essential sectors of activity within our rural remote areas will decrease&#8212;some might close and all will suffer&#8212;and there will not be a net benefit left for those areas. The redistribution element of the tax is, in my opinion, morally highly questionable. The revenue is simply to be returned in a universal random distribution of national insurance contributions, which reaffirms the view that this is not an environmental measure, but yet another stealth tax.</p><p>Not only will the tax have devastating implications for rural employment, it will increase the cost of essential investment in our wider economic infrastructure. I submit that Scotland is <place-holder colnum=\"3969\"/> more vulnerable in that respect than are other areas of the United Kingdom, because we have very long stretches of roads infrastructure in sparsely populated areas. Investment in areas such as the improvement of our roads and our rail networks will have to be increased to pay for such a tax. The much more probable consequence, of course, is that investment will either be curtailed or, in some cases, cease all together.</p><p>I submit that our rural and remoter economies, which are already battered&#8212;nobody can dispute that&#8212;will not cope with the aggregates tax. In Northern Ireland, attempts are being made to exempt Northern Ireland from the application of the tax. A very strong argument exists for Scotland's seeking to do likewise. I hope that that is something on which the minister will be prepared to comment.</p><p>I take pleasure in commending the motion in my name and I look forward to the speeches of other members, who I hope will be able to use more detailed instances to support the arguments that have so concerned me.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13260556", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of members, I welcome the representatives of the British Aggregates Association and the quarrying industry in Scotland, who are in the public gallery.

I make this speech as deputy convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.</p><p>Every cloud has a silver lining. The inquiry was brought about by, if not a crisis, certainly an attack of chronic indigestion in the higher education sector.</p><p>This has perhaps been the first opportunity in more than a decade for a parliament to consider closely the future direction and funding of higher education in Scotland. It was interesting and challenging to be a member of the committee involved in this inquiry.</p><p>I emphasise two points to the minister about teaching funding. First, paragraph 100 of the committee's report recommends</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the Minister establish an independent review body from outwith SHEFC with a remit to examine the costs of teaching, taking into account UK comparators across all subjects\".</p><p>That may sound like an unremarkable paragraph, but the tang&#8212;for some I expect it will be the sting&#8212;is in the independence element and also the recommendation that the review of teaching costs take place on a UK-wide scale. In my judgment, it would be unacceptable for SHEFC to undertake that review, as such a review would have no credibility. Examining teaching costs is sensitive, but it is vital. The sector deserves a reassurance of independence and objectivity in such a review. If one were to keep it in-house within the higher education sector, I envisage difficulties emerging. I have read the response from Universities Scotland to the inquiry report; it is clearly shy about an independent inquiry. It thinks that that would be an unfortunate slap in the face to SHEFC. Finer feelings on this issue are not <place-holder colnum=\"3571\"/> of particular significance. What matters is that we are talking about significant sums of public money and the need for reassurance that they are being effectively and properly distributed. I see from the response from the University Council of Modern Languages that Professor Millan applauds the idea of an independent review. Those two responses show the conflict that exists and the need to take this review outside the sector.</p><p>If I get a tang from that part of the report, what really whets my appetite is the issue of research funding. Research activity is the lifeblood of universities. It brings staff of high calibre to our institutions and maintains them there. That in turn is what attracts good students and helps our universities to maintain the highest academic performance.</p><p>It is worth considering current funding sources for research income in Scotland. It has been made clear in the debate that SHEFC accounts for approximately a third of that. The rest comes in varying proportions from research councils, UK-based charities, UK Government bodies, UK industry, the European Union, overseas and other sources. It is significant to pay attention to where those funds come from. Doing so allows one to make a great deal of sense of paragraph 135 of the report, which is the recommendation on how we might approach funding of research in Scotland in the future.</p><p>One of the most constructive suggestions by the committee is that the minister should establish a research and development strategy for Scotland, not only because that seems to marry well with the science strategy that she announced in August, but because it offers the opportunity for a focused and well-informed approach to the concept of research in Scotland. Research should not be viewed piecemeal according to what institutions are trying to do. We should take a strategic overview and focus on the areas in which funding should be sought.</p><p>I emphasise to the minister that if the strategy is devised and is good, sound and has credibility it is vital that the funding issue be sensibly addressed. What I like about paragraph 135 is that it is a sensible effort to devise a structure whereby funding may be properly and adequately considered.</p><p>I am not by nature diffident, but on this matter I have an overweening desire to be bold. I call on the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to be bold with me. I am putting my committee hat to the back of my head and donning my Goldie bunnet. The report is a good architect's plan for the future; it lays the foundations. However, we must be ambitious for the future, not for reasons of introspective self-indulgence&#8212;not a charge that I would care to have levelled at me or that I would <place-holder colnum=\"3572\"/> care to see levelled at any university senate. We must have ambitions and aspirations for our universities, for our economy and for Scotland.</p><p>When we consider what is happening elsewhere, there are reasons for concern and disquiet. As has been said, it is clear that in Europe certain countries are making significant increases in research funding. In the United States some individual university departments enjoy funding at a level that would make some of our institutions salivate.</p><p>I urge the minister to pay close attention to the recommendations in paragraphs 100 and 135. Dangers are lurking if we do not do so. One of the dangers is that our universities will face academic impoverishment. The other is less visible and far more insidious. It is that south of the border many people have no understanding of devolution and many people in the academic community are frightened to entrust their professional careers to a system that is unknown to them. The way to rebut that is to make a clarion call for the best possible approach to research in Scotland that the Parliament is capable of devising. I make no apology for being the siren to make that clarion call.</p>", "hdate": "2001-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13259647", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Teaching and Research Funding (Scottish Higher Education Funding Council Review)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, in that I am a member of the court of the University of Strathclyde&#8212;at least I am at the moment.

Perhaps it is always invidious to select individual areas of activity but, as other speakers have so eloquently indicated, the voluntary activity that takes place in Scotland is the backbone of much of our community and society.</p><p>In debates such as today's and in company such as this, it is tempting to ask, \"What can politicians do?\" Perhaps the more important question is, \"What should politicians not try to do?\" I recognise that the Scottish compact with the voluntary sector is a genuine attempt to identify the respective roles of the Government and the voluntary sector and to explore the mutual effort that may exist between those two agencies.</p><p>However, although the compact contains much that I believe to be good, it reflects the extent to which politicians expect to be involved. Therein lies the rub. It seems to me that people who engage in voluntary activity do so because they want to do it. They have a personal commitment, a conviction and an interest. They want to help. They certainly do not see themselves as Government agents or deliverers of Government policy.</p><p>I suggest that that distinction is important. Where public money is used, it is right that Government takes a proper interest in what that money is funding, but in my judgment Government should not have a prescriptive role or instruct a charity or other voluntary sector organisation how to spend money. The distinction is a fine one, but it is vital.</p><p>I was heartened that the minister said that she is committed to encouraging more volunteers to take part in Scottish life. That is a worthy sentiment, which I certainly applaud. However, people will not sign up if they think that they will become invisible, indirect agents of the Government. They will be resentful&#8212;that has to be avoided at all costs. The first question that such people will ask is whether they are being used to provide services on the cheap. Many others in the chamber who are involved in voluntary activity would echo me when I say that that is a patronising and insulting charge, but it is an understandable reaction from people who look at the spread of expenditure and say, \"Why am I doing this? Does the Government provide the money to me to do this only because it is a cheap way of delivering policy?\" I support the view that the voluntary sector should be as flexible and as autonomous as possible, so that it can do what it thinks it ought to do, in the best manner that it can. That is the most <place-holder colnum=\"2829\"/> effective way of allowing the voluntary sector to operate.</p><p>It is impossible to consider the issue merely in the context of Scotland; we have to consider the economic regime in the United Kingdom. Where the Government can help is by making some of the financial hurdles less challenging for the voluntary sector. Many parts of the voluntary sector pay VAT&#8212;many in the chamber would ask whether that is necessary. Is there not some mechanism whereby VAT is recoverable by those payers?</p><p>When the Conservatives were in power, they introduced gift aid and payroll tax. Those may sound like innocent, unimportant initiatives, but I think that they now represent the most common mechanism whereby funds are donated to the voluntary sector. That is indicative of a fine distinction: it is one thing for the Government to have a laudable intent about what should be going on and to be prepared to make money available to assist with doing it, but it is quite another for the Government to want to become involved indirectly in the discharge of that task. It is essential that, in our efforts to improve life for the voluntary sector in Scotland, we recognise that important distinction.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13257766", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to the minister for being slightly late for her speech.

Today, however, I have pleasure in saying that I think that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee's report is an exemplar of what devolution can do. It represents a good piece of work by members from all political parties, who have been looking at issues and focusing on a topic of vital significance to Scotland, and who have come up with a very constructive report.</p><p>The report is evidence-based, and I do not think that the significance of that should be overlooked. It was interesting to note that, when we summarised our recommendations, various issues fell out of the report. They included strategy, broadband, the digital divide, competitiveness with regard to an interconnector, skills issues, business support, culture and e-government. None of those things is in any way unimportant.<place-holder colnum=\"2341\"/></p><p>The real touchstone of what we were doing was ignited when we decided to have an interface with the business community. As Alex Neil said, that was achieved last week. Facts are chiels that winna ding and the business community was very quick to tell us that. Alex Neil was absolutely right, because the only thing arising from the report that the business community wanted to speak to us about, direct our attention towards, and emphasise to us the need for action upon was broadband, broadband and broadband.</p><p>I would like to indicate briefly how that message was delivered by giving quotations from the business persons present. One said, \"The new economy is more than making an old economy go faster. It is about the dynamics of skill that put us at the centre of the world.\" Others said, \"Connectivity is the key to the future,\" and, \"There is a danger of analysis paralysis&#8212;let us execute on priorities.\" Nick Kuenssberg said, \"Broadband is like a new transport and communications infrastructure. It means pace. Pace is vital. We are talking about a 28-day year.\" Those quotations put into context exactly what the nub of the report is about and exactly what the business community's message is. If we are to make meaningful progress, rather than just sitting back and talking about it and creating more words, we must come up with something, in conjunction with the Executive, that is workable, manageable and swiftly provided and which can take us on our next quantum leap forward.</p><p>The message of my winding-up speech is very simple. The primary, principal focus of everything that the report has produced is the provision of broadband. If I may say so, the Executive strategy's reference to speed, pace and the need for swift progress, which is being articulated by the business community, makes that strategy seem worthy. In many respects, it is worthy, and it is detailed. However, the business community would argue that it is plodding.</p><p>I return to what members of the business community had to say. I crave your indulgence for the use of language, Presiding Officer, but I am going to give you a quotation. The best conclusion that I can give is a quotation from Mike Hambly, who said, \"There is a precedent in Scotland for delivery of essential innovatory facilities to all. Let's bloody do it.\"</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13256328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry, Presiding Officer&#8212;the siren voice had lulled me into torpor.

As the minister and her colleague have failed to make it clear to the chamber that there is any justification for that discrepancy, I am left to conclude that she is not only unable to justify it, but that she may be planning to announce extremely bad news for the users of the Forth and Tay bridges.

However, the urgency now is to rectify a very unfortunate situation.</p><p>I have two points to make in my summing-up. First, the matter is a demonstration of grave managerial omission in the administration of the department. I urge the minister to inquire whether some form of formal audit has been put in place to ascertain&#8212;particularly with the benefit that we have nowadays of information technology&#8212;that check dates have been entered in the diary to ensure that if any such recurring orders must be reinstated it is done so timeously.</p><p>Secondly, although I endorse the need to address this as emergency legislation, I have a vestigial and lingering shred of sympathy with Mr Quinan's presentation. I choose my words carefully. It has struck me for some time that, although I have no objection to paying the tolls on the Erskine bridge, there is an anomaly in that the Erskine bridge is the only one of the older toll bridges&#8212;including the Forth and Tay bridges&#8212;that is tolled in both directions. A return journey on the bridge is more expensive than a return journey on the Forth or Tay bridges. If I have a slight concern about the matter being dealt with as emergency legislation it is this: it seems to me to preclude the opportunity to address that issue, which is significant to the people of the west of Scotland who might justifiably inquire, \"Why are we being subjected to a more oppressive toll regime than that prevailing in the east of Scotland?\" I would be grateful if the minister were able to comment on that aspect.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158297", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo the sentiments of my colleague Murray Tosh&#8212;this has been a regrettable omission on the part of the Executive and it should be addressed urgently.

It is the only presence to test this dogmatic Executive with its preconceived ideas of what it wants to impose on the people of Scotland.</p><p>If I sounded harsh when I spoke about the legislative programme earlier&#8212;I was careful to say that exceptions existed&#8212;I say also that elements of the programme are valuable and good, as David McLetchie said. I hope that they will improve the quality of life for people in Scotland. If I sounded harsh about the rest of the programme, it was because I felt frustrated. I sense that that frustration is not restricted to me because, as we know to our concern and disquiet, the Parliament is still on probation in Scotland.

More people wonder whether the best education is being offered to their children or whether they have a decent choice about how their children are educated.

It is good to have them here with us.</p><p>I have a broad political point to make for the last debate before the recess. It is a point in support and defence of our Parliament. By our Parliament, I mean not just the Parliament of the MSPs, but the Parliament of our visitors in the gallery and of people beyond. The point is that, this evening, we are debating in Edinburgh the condition endometriosis. Before 29 May 2001, I could not have told you what that was. I had never heard of it. I do not suffer from it. However, on 29 May I received an e-mail from two constituents&#8212;a husband and wife&#8212;that detailed the condition. It sounded deeply unpleasant, is clearly not well known and apparently affects 1.4 per cent of women of child-bearing age in Scotland. The age group of women between 25 and 44 is particularly susceptible.</p><p>I wondered about lodging a parliamentary question, but then I thought, \"No. Lodge a motion for debate and find out whether more MSPs can be involved, whether we can address points to the minister and perhaps open up the debate.\" Here we are, less than a month later, doing just that. Without a Scottish Parliament, that would have been impossible. I hope that our visitors, whatever their political beliefs, feel involved, noticed and relevant. I also hope that they realise that they have triggered the accessibility, accountability and responsiveness that the Parliament is intended to demonstrate. That seems a good footnote for the end of our second year.<place-holder colnum=\"2180\"/></p><p>The dictionary definition of endometriosis is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A condition in which tissue more or less perfectly resembling the uterine mucous membrane (the endometrium) and containing typical endometrial granular and stromal elements occurs aberrantly in various locations in the pelvic cavity.\"</p><p>We may not feel much the wiser after that. The reality of the condition for many women of child-bearing age is pain, possible bleeding, acute discomfort before and during menstruation, and in some instances symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, lethargy and even infertility. All that is accompanied by all the embarrassment and discomfiture that such an unpleasant condition induces.</p><p>The only compensation for getting on a bit is that the condition will usually disappear with the menopause. The only certain diagnosis is by a laparoscopy or, occasionally, by a laparotomy, which is a major operation and a very intrusive piece of surgery. The treatment for the condition&#8212;treatment, not cure&#8212;is principally either hormonal or surgical, but complementary medicine can also play a role.</p><p>I realise that many members want to speak, and it is not for me to outline the details of the condition and its many facets and forms. I am sure that other members will be able to give much more competent and personal contributions in that respect.</p><p>I will set out what it is important for this debate to achieve. I would welcome the minister's comments on how we bring a focus to tackling endometriosis in Scotland. I have ascertained&#8212;largely by e-mail, but I have spoken to one of them&#8212;from general practitioners that there is an awareness of the condition but that there is an acceptance that it is a difficult one.</p><p>I suggest to the minister that we consider some of the issues involved. That would raise public awareness of this unpleasant disease and, I hope, serve as a constructive influence in trying to widen the debate and assist with a more strategic attitude towards how we deal with it.</p><p>One question that springs to mind is whether we can assist GPs with training. Could we formulate guidelines, to aid diagnosis? That might help many women who know that they are suffering, but who have no idea what is affecting them. Perhaps we could instigate a specialist referral procedure. Could we perhaps build on the work of the health department's chief scientist office, which has already done excellent work in Scotland and has a database on the condition? We could perhaps also develop a national framework for the treatment of the disease in Scotland.</p><p>I have a message to women in Scotland: do not be put off going to the doctor because of shyness, <place-holder colnum=\"2181\"/> self-consciousness or embarrassment. Help can be provided, and the most important thing is for that help to be obtained when it is needed. Many of the unpleasant, debilitating and painful consequences of the condition can be alleviated to some extent.</p><p>I hope that by having this debate this evening we will make our contribution to the broadening of awareness and to a more informed debate about the disease: let us hope that the Parliament can be the instrument for delivering more help to those who are afflicted by it.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Endometriosis"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have pleasure in opening the debate on the motion in my name.

The exchange was brief. I said to him, \"If you were a squirrel, my dog would chase you up a tree.\" He took that in good spirit. I am now overcome with contrition: I had not realised that in his late teens he was subjected to such a searing experience as admission to the accountancy profession. Accountancy's loss is our gain. His champagne-style delivery was a welcome and sparkling innovation in what has tended to be the leaden tedium of finance debates.</p><p>The Finance Committee is to be commended for its constructive report on stage 1 of the budget process. As Donald Gorrie rightly said, positive comments can be made about that process. The annual expenditure report is a better document than last year's equivalent, \"Investing in You\". This year, subject committees were able to undertake a review of departmental activity, which was virtually impossible last year, owing to the deficiencies of \"Investing in You\". This year, an effort was made to increase the provision of disaggregated information, but it is still not sufficient. Progress is being made too slowly. It is only right to record that there was a helpful ministerial and departmental response to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee's requests for information. I endorse David Davidson's comment that the Finance Committee report should be used as a template for how the Executive deals with the budget process.</p><p>Those are the positives, but there are a considerable number of negatives that must also be highlighted. There is a lack of standardisation in departments' presentation of information and a shortage of specific information about departmental costs, which is unacceptable in a devolved Scotland. There is no mechanism to achieve outcome budgeting: what is spent means little unless it is known what is got and when. The budgets for health and enterprise are a prime example of that dilemma. The lack of performance comparators in those budgets means that there is no transparency and that it is not possible to compare costs between departments or quangos or local authorities. For example, are the administration costs in the department of enterprise and lifelong learning higher than those of the department of health? If they are, should they be? I do not know the answer, but the Parliament is entitled to ask such analytical <place-holder colnum=\"2086\"/> questions and, under the devolution structure, the people of Scotland are entitled to answers.</p><p>Donald Gorrie made a useful point about whether it is more expensive to repair a pothole in one local authority area than in another. It is right that that information should be available. The people of Scotland should have some basis on which to judge how well their money is being spent.</p><p>Another material omission in the annual expenditure report is its lack of information about sources of income. A much fuller picture of how expenditure is being set against the money that is available would be obtained if the annual expenditure report included information about whether the income came from last year's budget, from comprehensive spending reviews, from UK budget consequentials, from Barnett consequentials, from end-year flexibility or from the reserves. That would greatly assist us because we could determine whether we are talking about new spend or recycled money. That would assist us in identifying what items and elements of money are devoted to the provision of particular services or delivery of particular policies.</p><p>In short, I welcome the Finance Committee's report. The committee is to be congratulated on a constructive piece of work, but there is still a long way to go. Huge deficiencies still exist. Until they are addressed, the budget process will still be lamentably deficient.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255637", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Process 2002-03"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday, I had occasion to address the Finance Committee convener in the street.

That brings me to my questions, of which one is general and two are specific.

The statement mentions many abolitions, several reviews and unifications and one or two creations. I presume that, at the end of the day, we will satisfy one of the nine criteria, which is better value for money. Will the minister confirm to the chamber the exact cost saving of this initiative to the people of Scotland?</p><p>My final question relates to the composition of boards of quangos and the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000. The minister will be aware that, particularly in the context of boards of management for further education colleges, the act has already given rise to a practical difficulty. Many able and good members of local communities who serve on those boards are proving reluctant to continue their period of service because of what some regard as the oppressive inquisitiveness of the act, which seems to require disclosure of information at a level of detail that frankly is beyond the understanding of most sensible people. If the current effect of the act is to remove good and able people from the areas of activity where we need them, will the minister satisfy the chamber by reassuring us that the act is not a deterrent, but is instead beneficial and encouraging?</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13255191", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Government (Non-departmental Public Bodies)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister may consider that he was gagged back in January, but it seems to have induced a state of taciturnity.

It might be instructive for Parliament and helpful to the relevant committees to ascertain from Community Learning Scotland how it got on with adult learners week.

As is so often the case with the Scottish Executive, the words of its self-indulgent, self-congratulatory motion are a world away from what is happening in the business community in Scotland. Indeed, if one considers the text of the motion, it is about as exciting as inquiring whether someone takes milk and sugar in their tea. The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning's speech sought to liven up the motion a little, but in a sense the content disclosed the underlying problem. If I counted correctly, nine particular initiatives and entities were mentioned, all of which seek to address the problem of skills.</p><p>Out in the business community, influential members of that community are expressing real concerns about the fact that there is a skills shortage. That skills shortage is not currently being addressed. There is a concern that the skills that are being provided are not relevant to the needs of the business community and that, as Mr MacAskill indicated, the delivery of skills provision is variable throughout Scotland. Indeed, in some places, such provision operates on an apparently haphazard basis, with no audit of the final outcome to ascertain how many individuals have demonstrably benefited from the attempts to provide them with and improve their skills. That skills gap is threatening the future of Scottish business. Unless those deficiencies are addressed urgently, the Scottish Executive might as well ask Scottish business to run a car on a tank full of water.</p><p>What are the facts? Let me quote directly from business, from a meeting with Electronics Scotland, which I attended yesterday with some of my colleagues from the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee. The meeting was held at the Sun Microsystems plant in Linlithgow. We were given a clear and direct message. The three big issues confronting the electronics industry and presenting challenges over the next decade are skills, business climate and e-commerce. I will comment on the latter two issues briefly before turning to skills.</p><p>Business climate was mentioned in the context of representing the realities of taxation and regulation. Those are not imaginary political myths, used by nefarious politicians to cause embarrassment to opponents, but the oppressive and repressive stifling realities for many businesses in Scotland today. The comment on e-commerce was equally disconcerting. Although we <place-holder colnum=\"29\"/> may pride ourselves on being ahead of the game in Scotland and congratulate ourselves on having done a great deal to advance the awareness and implementation of e-commerce, the reality is that many of our international competitors are far more proactive in the use of e-commerce. They regard it quite simply as a tool of business, just as our predecessors regarded the broker market and the trading centre. For our international competitors, e-commerce is a means to go out and negotiate, carry out options, seek business and offer deals. In Scotland, we seem to be far less active in that respect.</p><p>Let me turn to skills, in particular to the views that were relayed by the influential group of people with whom we met yesterday. The message is stark: Scotland is not producing people with the right skills for the electronics industry. It is anticipated that over the next five years, that industry will need 5,000 engineers per annum. The current university output is somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000. It is clear that not enough youngsters of school age are being made aware of electronics technology when at school, partially because it comes under the general heading of engineering, which still has a spanners-and-oily-cloth image, and partially because of a bias on the part of parents in relation to engineering.</p><p>It seems clear that if we are to make sensible progress towards increasing the provision of youngsters with the necessary technical skills to enter industry, particularly the electronics industry, there has to be a change of attitude at primary and secondary school level. It would make a lot of sense if technology, and not computing&#8212;the two should not be confused&#8212;became part of the core curriculum as early as secondary 1 and secondary 2, because it is clear that if we plant the appropriate seeds we will get the right crop, and if we do not, we will not.</p><p>The reason for my amendment is not merely to address the blandness and nakedness of the motion, it is to point out where another area of deficiency is to be found. Not only is there a need to address the gaping void in the current provision of skills for business, but a hard look has to be taken at what currently masquerades under the banner of the provision of skills, be that by way of new deal, skillseekers, apprenticeships or whatever. Indeed, whatever spin the Executive may care to put on new deal in Scotland, the facts are unimpressive.</p><p>The Employment Service research report ESR33, published in December 1999, found that in the first year of new deal for young people, approximately 50 per cent of individuals leaving unemployment via new deal would have left unemployment anyway. Also of concern, as the report pointed out, is that of the people who left <place-holder colnum=\"30\"/> new deal for young people, a proportion rejoined the claimant count, so the current estimate is that as few as 40 per cent of youngsters may have been helped. That finding may be coupled with the April NDYP figures, which show that 27 per cent of jobs gained by new deal leavers do not last longer than 13 weeks. It is estimated that new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds has cost around &#163;20,000 per job.</p><p>In any debate about skills, perhaps the most depressing feature is that only 10 per cent of new deal participants complete their training courses and leave with a qualification. To suggest that new deal is an effective skills provider is frankly nonsense. If the response is that it is not meant to be a skills provider, the question has to be asked, what does it exist for, and is it a justifiable use of such extensive sums of public money?</p><p>On the matter of apprenticeships in general, not just modern apprenticeships, to return to the meeting with Electronics Scotland, I must ask the minister why one of the businessmen who was present at that meeting should express total scepticism about the effectiveness of the apprenticeship system? Analysis shows that only 50 per cent of apprentices actually pass. That is on the back of variable provision throughout Scotland as to the available funding for people who are seeking apprenticeships.</p><p>Clearly, that is a totally haphazard and random way to approach the provision of skills, and is an area that I suggest the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with the enterprise network, should urgently investigate. Indeed, if one examines the projected increase in the provision of apprenticeships in terms of the enterprise and lifelong learning budget, as recently disclosed, the demand becomes ever more clamant. The amendment in my name is an attempt to address the manifest deficiencies of the motion as it is currently framed.</p><p>I move amendment S1M-1857.2, to leave out from \"endorses\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises that investment in skills is the key to Scotland's future business success and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that the skills being provided are relevant to the needs of Scottish business and that the delivery of skills provision is monitored to ensure maximum effectiveness in skills enhancement.\"</p>", "hdate": "2001-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250266", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Skills for Tomorrow"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For a debate on a subject as serious as skills, the Scottish Executive's motion is disquietingly bland and complacent.

We embrace the principles of the draft bill and are glad to see it.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind the backdrop against which the draft bill is being published. In his opening remarks, the Deputy First Minister articulated the principles behind the draft bill, but I think that the backdrop should not be forgotten. That backdrop is the important one of the time-honoured and tested delicate balance that has always been struck among the three pillars of the constitution: the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. The great constitutional law cases that any law student is familiar with have always sought to protect the individual against the weight of the state, and that protection is currently available under existing law. The greatest test of balance has perhaps been on the issue of individual right against national security or material prejudice if information were disclosed.</p><p>At the levels of national and devolved government, there are important issues to be borne in mind, but there is also a need not to reinvent the wheel and to be cognisant of the <place-holder colnum=\"575\"/> strong virtues of existing law. Having said that, the draft bill addresses significant issues. There is a need to facilitate access to public information and there have been some shabby and furtive instances of wilful and unsustainable refusal to disclose information, as Mr McLetchie said. If those deficiencies are to be found in government, they are certainly to be found in local government and in other public agencies. Non-disclosure in those cases is probably more to do with discomfiture and indolence than with genuine issues of essential confidentiality or material prejudice. Any opening up of those dank and unlit corridors is welcome. In so far as the draft bill proceeds to address those areas, its provisions are to be commended.</p><p>The intended statute will be meaningless if the Scottish Executive is not prepared to lead by example, and the record to date is not impressive. At present, without any change to the law, voluminous disclosure can be effected, but the Scottish Executive has made little use of that facility. Contrary to the impression created by some persons in this chamber about the Conservative Government, the record shows that it made demonstrable progress in practising disclosure of information. In this respect, the Scottish Executive has been at best coy, at worst covert. I therefore support Mr McLetchie's amendment, because it seems to me that allowing the Scottish Executive to make Cabinet meeting minutes available is indeed a meaningful start.</p><p>On general disclosure, it is desirable that the Scottish Executive and the First Minister, who are publicly accountable, should perhaps have the predominant role over an unelected commissioner. Having articulated that reservation, that is why the Conservatives feel unable to support the amendment in the name of Roseanna Cunningham.</p><p>My party welcomes the bill and endorses its principles. We think that there will have to be rigorous debate at committee level to ensure that existing law is not overlooked and that its best virtues are recognised. We also think that there will be areas in which there has to be considerable debate about how we maintain a delicate balance. I am acutely aware that today is a good day for the very many people in Scotland who have felt frustrated, deprived of rightful information and impeded and blocked at every turn. In my professional life I have acted for many such people.

However, I must congratulate Mike Watson on a very competent presentation, even though he made the Rev I M Jolly look positively jaunty.</p><p>Any consideration of the budget process must examine the whole concept of that process. I was particularly struck by stage 1, which I found very healthy, and welcomed the public engagement, even though I detected some cynicism from those who participated. I was once asked whether anyone would pay a blind bit of attention to a word that was said. I also welcomed the committee involvement at stage 1 and felt that there was a very constructive dialogue between the minister and the committees.</p><p>Everyone, including the public, expected stage 2 of the process to shine a light on areas that had <place-holder colnum=\"941\"/> not previously been illuminated. Although I had hoped that that would happen, there seems to be darkness pretty much all around. That is not the fault of the Finance Committee. In noting this report, we should acknowledge the deficiencies of the budget process and, by doing so, put a torch in the minister's hand and tell him where to point it.</p><p>The whole process takes place against the backdrop of UK spending reviews. The fact that those reviews are undertaken every two years means that our stage 1 and stage 2 processes are out of kilter. The Executive must urgently address that issue and introduce proposals for a better dovetailing of the two processes.</p><p>The second area of concern is the absence of level III figures for consideration by subject committees, the technical word for which is disaggregation. I am concerned that, without sufficient disaggregation, the budget process will lurch towards disintegration. If it turns out that the Local Government Committee, the Rural Affairs Committee, the Transport and the Environment Committee and the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee were all unable to comment specifically on the budget proposals through lack of information, the budget process is hitting the buffers.</p><p>I listened with interest to Fiona Hyslop's comments about the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee, which has concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee has serious concerns about the lack of availability of detail of the Level III figures. This meant that it was extremely difficult for the Committee to form an opinion as to whether proposed expenditure and Executive policy commitments concurred. . . The Committee believes that this represents a piecemeal approach that does not provide an overall picture of the budget, does not allow scrutiny of how the latest spending figures have been changed as a result of the consultation 'Investing in You' and does not assist in the delivery of transparency of Government.\"</p><p>That very neatly encapsulates the difficulties.</p><p>The next area of specific concern is the impact of RAB on budgets, as it will vary tremendously between departments. It is particularly relevant to health, transport and environment budgets. The department responsible for the environment has large capital expenditure programmes and the Transport and the Environment Committee reported that the general information in \"Making a Difference for Scotland\" was inadequate as the document did not explain the implication of the new system for specific spending lines.</p><p>Indeed, the Health and Community Care Committee has encountered similar problems. The situation raises the issue of capital charges&#8212;which has already been alluded to in the debate&#8212;and poses the question of whether they should be <place-holder colnum=\"942\"/> split from service purchases. I think that they should, as that clarity would go a long way towards focusing minds and clearing the vision of those who are involved in these essential areas of activity.</p><p>The fourth matter of concern is the Scottish reserve, to which reference has been made. It is essential that we know what rules apply to the Scottish reserve: what money goes into it and in what circumstances departments can seek to access that money. It is vital that such information is provided. Additionally, cross-cutting initiatives that involve various departments are a notorious source of obscurity, and can screen what ought to be a clear accounting process. It is vital that there is transparency when various departments are involved in budgeting activities.</p><p>I have no clue how much time I have left, but I have come to the end of my speech. I said that I would help the minister to shine a torch, but I feel that I have lit him up like a Christmas tree.

That remit led us to consider the process of wider management of the SQA from the ministers through departmental civil servants, the chair and the board to the chief executive.</p><p>What emerged from our inquiry was a series of vacuums. The ministers and department were in one vacuum, and there was a separate, hermetically sealed SQA in which two vacuums <place-holder colnum=\"893\"/> existed, one at board level and the other in the rest of the organisation. Quite simply, a volcano was erupting in the SQA which the board and chief executive did not know about.</p><p>That is why in paragraph 37 on page 8 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee report, the committee concluded that the problem was not a deficiency of governance but \"a failure of management\", which&#8212;to anyone who has been in business&#8212;was on a scale beyond comprehension. The committee therefore concluded that the board had been negligent. The board should have had a hunger for information and explanation, and there should have been an unrelenting insistence on answers being provided by reaching down to all operational levels to find out what was going wrong and where it was happening. After all, the SQA had agreed a corporate plan that, although perhaps unrealistically onerous, had been signed off by ministers. Both board and ministers can be criticised for not having a clearer overview of the strains that the plan would impose on the organisation.</p><p>As a result, the committee focused on several essential issues such as an absence of a proper performance management network within the executive departments; an absence of an effective risk assessment process in the SQA; an absence of clarity about the role of SQA board members; and an absence of a lean, robust board structure with clarity about its role. I welcome Mr McConnell's initiative in taking steps in connection with the SQA board. The committee's specific recommendations address those points of concern, as do its suggestions for a better operational model. I very much hope that the minister will be minded to consider the committee's proposals and suggest that they be rigorously and positively pursued.</p><p>Three broad consequences flow from the report, the first of which relates to devolution. The arrival of the Parliament has changed for ever the relationship between NDPBs and Government. When things go wrong in Scotland, people will look first to this Parliament to put them right. The Executive must recognise&#8212;and, to be fair, has recognised&#8212;that that element needs to be considered. Indeed, further action might be necessary to regulate or determine how we deal with the relationship between NDPBs and the Parliament from now on.</p><p>Secondly, the improvements recommended in the report should certainly be pursued vigorously. Most important, the reports from the two committees should not be regarded as the end of the matter&#8212;they have to be the new beginning. That is essential for public confidence. This Parliament must hold a magnifying glass over the <place-holder colnum=\"894\"/> SQA and take on board the alarming and very real concerns expressed by Professor John Ward, to devise a structure that will allow the Executive to report to the Parliament regularly in the forthcoming year about what is happening in the SQA.</p>", "hdate": "2000-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13240824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Qualifications Authority"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As acting convener for the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee for most of the inquiry meetings, I want to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues; Simon Watkins and the clerking staff for a tremendous job; and of course all the witnesses who so willingly appeared before us at short notice.

All parties support the idea of a framework of some kind or another and, to that end, we support the principles of the motion. There is much to commend the framework and our amendment recognises that.</p><p>We welcome the notion of a framework and cautiously welcome the proposals. The reason why our support is given with a qualification is that, with respect, the Conservative party thinks that it understands the needs of the Scottish economy and I think that the business community would acknowledge that the Executive has still to prove that it understands that.</p><p>Supporting the framework is, in principle, simple, as it offers a reasonably sensible strategy for improving our economy, promotes a strong vision and offers strategic guidance for economic policy and the attainment of economic development throughout Scotland. The framework is aimed at eliminating duplication and ensuring value for money and is proactive in that it aims to enhance our knowledge of the Scottish economy. Naturally, we support all of that. However, our amendment makes two pleas: that the framework document should be rigorously reviewed; and that it should put the needs of the economy first. In business speak, we want measurement, priorities and response. That is what my party is about. We want businesses to flourish and our amendment proves that. We want the Executive to militate against the prospect of the framework becoming a vacuous and meaningless series of soundbites. That <place-holder colnum=\"575\"/> danger is obvious. I welcome the minister's indication of support for the amendment.</p><p>We want a document in which economic review stands out from technical mumbo jumbo. Strategies, frameworks and visions are all fine as long as there is substance behind the verbosity.</p><p>We want the Executive to put the needs of the economy first. Our vision is one of individuals being given back their freedom and not one of the Government taking it away. Conservatives would allow people to develop for themselves, as that is the only positive way in which to run an economy. Our record on that is proven. It may be unpalatable to record history, but the economy was revolutionised under a Conservative Government, which introduced privatisation and deregulation, giving us the modern economy that we are now debating.</p><p>Many of the statistics on which the minister based her argument came into being not just within the past three years; they were there many years before, under a Conservative Government. We presided over an economy in which 90 per cent of the population benefited from a growth in wealth, and in which the remaining 10 per cent had no loss in income. <i>The Economist</i> of 25 November 1999 is my authority for that view.</p><p>The number of Scottish companies in the FTSE 100 index has more than doubled over the past decade; the number in the FTSE 250 has risen sixfold. That is because we believed in empowering companies to develop for themselves, instead of telling them how to do it. Two signal examples are Scottish and Southern Energy and Scottish Power. Both those companies would not be where they are now if the Conservative party had not rolled back the frontiers of the state. We empowered individuals to think for themselves, but we were belittled by our political opponents for having the courage to take that view.</p><p>Our framework for economic development is very simple: to put the economy first and to cut red tape and bureaucracy. We also have to concentrate on a low-tax agenda. The party of the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and her coalition Executive purport to support that view. In fact, the burden of taxation has increased from 35.2 per cent to 37.3 per cent under Labour. Business rates are higher in Scotland than they are in England.</p><p>The Executive's plans for the Scottish economy are flawed. The framework needs a stronger focus on business and a greater emphasis on scrutiny. The Conservative party is determined that what is essentially a good proposition, a proper framework for economic development, perhaps a sacred cow for the Scottish economy in the future, should not <place-holder colnum=\"576\"/> become its Trojan horse.

Moreover, there would be an uncosted deficit if they removed the tax disc from cars with an engine capacity below a certain level&#8212;by their own calculations, they will not replace that lost revenue. That means <place-holder colnum=\"924\"/> more fuel tax for the road user. Perhaps Mr Ian Jenkins has revealed his party's position more patently than anyone else.

The minister has alluded to the figures involved&#8212;the 100,000 employed in the creative industries, a turnover of &#163;5 billion per annum and 4 per cent of Scottish gross domestic product. Those are certainly very important dimensions to take into account. That, coupled with the anticipated growth rates, would lead us all to agree that this is a huge opportunity for Scotland.</p><p>My slight quandary is on definition, which I think must be addressed. The Scottish Executive's definition of creative industries includes</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Design, games, film, new media, publishing, advertising, radio and television, music and architecture\".</p><p>Scottish Enterprise extends that to the arts and cultural industries and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to the traditional arts and music sectors.<place-holder colnum=\"661\"/></p><p>For someone who finds the high-tech, multimedia age abrasively challenging and at times downright frightening and who herself may never actually get funky or become a net head, I am immensely admiring of those who embrace such facilities, which have undoubted relevance to the expansion of the creative industries. I hope that something equally important will not be overlooked in this thrusting quest.</p><p>I return to the definition of the creative industries, at least as I have been best able to identify it. We have a huge and unexploited reserve of culture, arts, literature, music, tradition and history in Scotland. That reserve is unique to our country. If I may, I will follow in the vein that was set by Father George Thompson this afternoon. I will quote from the preface to a cookery book, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The object of this book is not to provide a complete compendium of Scottish Cookery, ancient or modern . . . but rather to preserve the recipes of our old national dishes, many of which, in this age of standardisation, are in danger of falling into an undeserved oblivion.\"</p><p>The same preface goes on to say that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the pageant of Scottish History is shadowed in the kitchen.\"</p><p>I think that there will be all-party agreement among the women in the chamber that there is a lot of sense in that.</p><p>Was that preface written last week or last year? No&#8212;it was written in 1929 by F Marion McNeill, who was a legendary figure in Scots cuisine long before Gary Rhodes and Gordon Ramsay had ever been heard of and certainly long before Delia Smith was eating lumps out of Anthony Worrall Thomson.</p><p>The book is part of our heritage&#8212;its content is certainly creative. The minister might care to brighten his day with some parlies or auld man's milk, recipes for both of which are included in the book. If he is fearful of trying them, parlies were a kind of gingerbread that was eaten by members of the Scottish Parliament. Auld man's milk sounds a little more hopeful&#8212;it is made from cream, rum, whisky, brandy, eggs, nutmeg and lemon zest.</p><p>My point is that the creative industries have a huge opportunity to re-explore, re-present and bring to a worldwide audience much of our history and culture, which is, as I said, unique to Scotland. We must be careful that in our thrusting quest for the new&#8212;which is necessary and desirable&#8212;we are ever mindful of what already exists. We must ensure that we use all our facilities and opportunities to advertise, re-present and repromote Scotland's rich creative reserves.</p>", "hdate": "2000-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13235671", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Creative Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We welcome the initiative and accept that it offers an exciting opportunity for Scotland, with a very particular significance for the creative aspect of the Scottish economy.

However, when I listened to his remarks, my spirits began to drop.

They cheered him to the skies; such was the fervour that met his concluding remarks, one would have thought that he had just won the Eurovision song contest.</p><p>I am therefore surprised that Mr McConnell chose to omit any reference to several factors. He chose to omit any reference to Gordon Brown's <place-holder colnum=\"482\"/> alleged threat to require the Scottish Parliament to use its tax-raising powers, or to what is technically a recession in Scotland&#8212;not a situation that I welcome. He chose to omit any reference to our productivity level, which is lower than that of the rest of the United Kingdom. Finally, he chose to omit any mention of the inflation risks that are implicit in a spending programme such as the one that he announced this afternoon and certainly such as Mr Brown's comprehensive spending review.</p><p>Those are not just my empty opinions. The Bank of England has warned that Government spending plans will send inflation higher unless consumer spending is reined in. Furthermore, the July monetary policy committee meeting reported that, given the likely increases in public spending over the next two years, private sector spending needs to slow further if inflation targets are to be met. I do not pretend to be an economic genius; however, those frank warnings must be taken on board, since they suggest that there must be a very cautious approach to the sort of financial programme that the Parliament might consider.</p><p>Although we welcome sincerely the spend objectives that the Minister for Finance has embraced, we must ask whether, given the rather alarming criteria to which I referred but to which the minister made no reference, those objectives are accompanied by the necessary prudence that Scotland is entitled to expect.</p><p>It seems clear that there are some alarming omissions in the areas of expenditure that Mr McConnell has outlined. One of those areas, which have been alluded to in the debate, is the non-implementation of the Sutherland commission's recommendations. Mr McConnell could promise our elderly people everything under the sun, but he would hit the button if he pledged to implement Sutherland.</p><p>Furthermore, the current allocation to transport is &#163;18 million. That is not what business needs. We are becoming uncompetitive and are experiencing problems in moving goods and services. Our haulage companies are finding it difficult to operate. The Minister for Finance's statement offers little comfort on that matter.</p><p>In short, although this budget statement might be laudable in intent, its implementation is potentially alarming.

Is that why wealth generation is listed fourth on the list of objectives on page 1 of the statement? Is that why the first political priority stated on page 2 is a \"dramatic increase\" in spending? Without wealth generation, spending is difficult. Wealth generation in Scotland is difficult, with a crumbling roads infrastructure, no integrated transport strategy and movement of workers, goods and services now to be obstructed by workplace parking charges and road user charges.</p><p>What about the legislative programme? Bill Aitken described it as anodyne. He is charitable. Worthy though the water services bill, the bill to strengthen rights under the ECHR, the international criminal court bill and the salmon conservation bill may be, they are hardly electric as far as the people of Scotland are concerned. As for the housing bill, that is fine, but in Glasgow, surely support of community associations would be the best way to nourish local and community endeavour. Would not that be preferable to stifling such initiative with a sprawling urban bureaucracy?</p><p>On the regulation of care, I know what the <place-holder colnum=\"420\"/> people of Scotland want.

Frankly, seeking repayment on a graduate income of &#163;10,000 per annum is beyond belief. Any student will affirm that.

There is much in the statement that is helpful and positive. However, I will share a reservation. The statement is entitled \"Statement for launch of the enterprise networks review interim conclusions\". I looked for something meaty; something I could grasp. I thought that nuts would be cracked, and kernels would appear. However, the statement falls slightly short of what I had hoped for in identifying the objectives of the announcement.

We should be adding value to the economy and getting value for the taxpayer.\"</p><p>I support that priority, as it is very important. Will the minister confirm that an outcome-led approach is synonymous with customer-driven requirements? In this case, the customer is the enterprise sector of Scotland&#8212;our businesses need to know where they are. Will the minister also confirm that there is not a danger of the whole brave new world of review of the enterprise networks being a mere systematic substitution of one form of bureaucracy for another? It is important that the minister can reassure the business community about that.</p><p>I listened carefully to what the minister said about structural change. Page 7 of his statement states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Structural change will be a distraction of management effort from delivery of our vision and strategy. Structural change misses the point. The focus is on customers, not on structures.\"</p><p>I agree with that conclusion, but I am slightly less easy with the definition.</p><p>Later on in the statement, the minister says that he is engaging in structural change of the local enterprise companies. Is it appropriate to have an unacceptable level of the enterprise budget being spent on administration? Of itself, that may not <place-holder colnum=\"1153\"/> merit structural change, but it does merit careful examination of what is happening in the provision of enterprise services through our enterprise network.</p><p>Page 9 mentions the minister's intended treatment of the LECs. The statement says:</p><p class=\"indent\"> \"I will remove the anomaly of the LECs' status as companies limited by guarantee.\"</p><p>I am, however, unclear what will replace the LECs' structure. There is a need to reassure not only the people employed in our LECs, who in many cases do a very good job at local level, but also local business communities that they are not losing out on an essential point of contact with like minds, and that they will not be confronted with some massive bureaucracy emanating from Bothwell Street.</p><p>Finally, I am reassured that the minister welcomes certain aspects of the report of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee on business development at local level. The minister embraces, in particular, the concept of local economic forums. However, is it not the case that the whole process would make a lot more sense if we waited until the autumn, so that the minister could give his full response to the report? Then, not only the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, but the business people of Scotland would know how all the bits of the jigsaw fit together. There is a distinct danger that this fragmented approach will lead to a dislocation of effort and, I suspect, an incoherent perception among the business community of what the minister is trying to do, however worthy it may be.</p>", "hdate": "2000-07-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13232935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Enterprise Networks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the minister's certainty of pronouncement that the talking will stop.

Let me explain further.</p><p>Mr Ewing's amendment was debated at stage 2, and I found that debate helpful. My recollection is that in view of the contributions that were made in committee, Mr Ewing revised his amendment slightly, and I now find merit in it. It is clear that the scheme could pose problems for applicants in remoter, rural areas of Scotland. The pilot schemes that are under way in Lochaber and the Scottish Borders may be instructive in that respect. Our support for Mr Ewing's amendment is principally in recognition of those parts of Scotland where problems could exist. It would be unfortunate if an applicant felt prejudiced or deterred from applying simply because distance and remoteness intervened. I do not need to say any more than that we find merit in Mr Ewing's amendment and we are minded to support it.</p><p>We are sympathetic to Fiona McLeod's amendment, as we were to the previous amendment. The distinction that we draw on her amendment is that the broader costs that she wishes to embrace within the scheme and put in the bill are just that&#8212;broader.

Having said that, although we are minded to oppose the amendment, I reiterate what I said earlier about the need to monitor the application of the scheme. If it were the case&#8212;either by virtue of operation of the pilot schemes or by the accumulation of evidence once the scheme is working&#8212;that persons in the classes mentioned in amendment 3 were being prejudiced or deterred from the proper uptake of individual learning accounts, that would be a matter for concern.

That is the difference between the two motions.</p><p>As Duncan McNeil knows, I was accustomed to strutting my sporting stuff in the Battery park in Greenock, but I have never strutted my stuff in Cappielow&#8212;who knows, the time may come, although the fans may flee.</p><p>I have been reading, with great interest, a wonderful book that will be familiar to the fans in the gallery, \"Greenock Morton 1874-1999\". It is a fascinating history, but it should not become the only remaining trace of that club. Everyone here tonight wants Greenock Morton to go from strength to strength.</p><p>The current dilemma of the club has illustrated two distinct issues. One is that the club is a priceless asset for the community. The other is that, without some definite control by the SFA or the Scottish Football League, people such as Hugh Scott have unfettered power over small clubs. The message that members are putting across tonight is that the SFA and the league are not simply official figures but have an important role to play as the custodians of football in Scotland. That means that they have to be prepared to take action when chairmen such as Hugh Scott impede the natural growth and development of the club.</p><p>People who buy football clubs should be allowed to do so. That is not the issue. However, their ownership of the asset should be closely regulated and they should have an obligation to work for the betterment of the club and the community. That might extend into planning law. It is entirely logical that, if the football authorities have a great responsibility for the continuance of our football <place-holder colnum=\"462\"/> clubs, our planning authorities should give greater priority to the planning and zoning of a football ground and make it an almost sacrosanct and protected facility in the area, which would be immune from transference as a normal asset disposal, but could be passed on only if it were to be used for the provision of football in the area.</p><p>I and the Conservative party are happy to support Duncan McNeil's motion.

I am concerned that the Justice and Home Affairs Committee has not been given a greater opportunity to consider the bill in more detail and over a longer time. Issues are emerging which that committee, with its expertise and the facilities available to it, could have expanded upon and clarified. I suggest that such an approach might make for better legislation. I wish to record my general concern about the approach that has been adopted, which is a consequence of the hefty legislative programme that currently prevails.</p><p>I was slightly concerned about the provisions of section 5 of the bill, which give Scottish ministers the power to designate, by order, those persons within the \"relevant public authorities\" who are to be entitled to grant authorisations for surveillance. I note the attempt in section 5 to define the phrase \"relevant public authorities\", but I would be grateful for guidance from the minister as to what he has in mind. For example, is the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency a public authority for the purposes of the bill? I hope that it is, but, on the other hand, if Historic Scotland is not so designated, I am not overly concerned. We would find it helpful if the minister could give guidance on which authorities that phrase is meant to embrace.</p><p>I note the reference in the bill to the surveillance commissioner. My attitude is clear: I want the bad lads to be nailed, but I do not want them to be nailed in a climate of zealous, enthusiastic discharge of regulatory powers by our authorities in a way that may contravene the fundamental freedoms of private individuals. I do not wish to shackle our police forces with cumbersome bureaucracy, but, at the same time, I do not want the procedures engaged in by our law enforcement authorities to be rendered nugatory because they contravene the ECHR. Again, a comment from the minister on how he envisages <place-holder colnum=\"272\"/> the role of the surveillance commissioner would be helpful. Does he think that the commissioner is necessary in order to keep us on the right side of the ECHR? What other advice has been made available to him?</p><p>I have a further, slight concern with section 3(3). Section 3 is concerned with the authorisation of directed surveillance, and section 3(3) states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"An authorisation is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">(a) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder\".</p><p>That seems to be a wide definition. What disorder is that intended to embrace&#8212;public or civil disorder?</p><p>Reference has been made to subsection (3)(c). The matter of E coli outbreaks, which that subsection is intended to cover, came up in the Justice and Home Affairs Committee.</p><p>I confess to slight alarm about subsection (3)(d), which allows the authorisation of covert surveillance for any purpose that does not fall within the other subsections. That seems a very broad power and we should receive some guidance from the minister as to what he envisages within the scope of that subsection.</p><p>We welcome the principles of the bill, which we consider a useful aid to the proper enforcement of law and order and the proper detection of crime. However, some serious concerns must be weighed against the virtues of the bill and I hope that the minister will address those in his winding-up speech.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13230518", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I shall attempt to compensate for Mr Neil's expansive loquacity by being relatively brief, as some of the points that I wished to raise have been covered already.

Indeed, I can see the unease almost rising in their gorges as I speak. However, at the risk of being fulsome, I want to echo John Swinney's comments that it was a pleasure to serve on the committee during the inquiry and to realise that all members were willing to focus on issues that were presented to us in evidence.</p><p>Evidence is a very compelling influence and we all found it refreshing to find out that committee members were prepared to be independently minded. In short, that is the report's strength. It is not so much that there was an unexpected cross-party consensus in identifying the problems as that all committee members were willing to examine the evidence and not dodge the issues raised by it.</p><p>By way of general background, I should say that the committee's early decision to inquire into the delivery of economic development, post-school vocational education and training and business support services at local level in Scotland, was sound and that the subject was an interesting first choice.</p><p>Scotland's gross domestic product lags behind the rest of the UK. Scotland has one of the lowest business birth rates in the UK; the service sector is weaker than in the rest of the UK, especially for business services; unemployment levels are still higher in Scotland than in the rest of Britain; and it has one of the lowest levels of research and development and innovation in western Europe. I do not think that any of us can dodge those issues. The essence of the inquiry and the report was not to lose sight of what we need to do in Scotland to improve employment opportunities and, as a result, the quality of life here.</p><p>There were more specific reasons for our desire to undertake the inquiry. First, we suspected that there was congestion in economic development in Scotland. It was known that there was cynicism in the business community about existing facilities and providers. Furthermore, it was apparent that although significant sums of public money were being expended on provision, there was a widely varying and fluctuating pattern of achievement and performance.</p><p>The inquiry was therefore timely. It is to the committee's credit that it made its decision and to the Parliament's credit that time has been made <place-holder colnum=\"155\"/> available to debate the report before the recess. The committee would wish to record its appreciation to the Parliament for that.</p><p>Timely is not a word that I use lightly because&#8212;to use that venerable phrase of contract law&#8212;time is of the essence in this debate. The challenges that I have described&#8212;or, as some might say, the problems that dog Scotland in global competitiveness&#8212;are with us and will aggravate and compound difficulties unless they are positively and urgently addressed. I hope that the minister recognises that the report offers a substantive and sensible framework of solution and feels impelled to encourage and promote early implementation of the framework.</p><p>The minister should feel at ease in doing so because of the committee's impressive modus operandi, which included a reliance on extensive and painstaking evidence; a variety of evidence sources; and the significant contribution of our advisers in assisting with the assessment of evidence and tempering some of the wilder flights of fancy on which the committee might have been disposed to set off. As a result, the report is an authoritative and logical series of conclusions. Although it is voluminous and broad in application, that should not be confused with generalisation and lack of specification.</p><p>John Swinney was right to say that any attempt to over-prescribe detailed solutions would create rigidity and inflexibility and place a restriction on the autonomy of legitimate local activity. Final conclusion 1 is the pivotal conclusion of the report.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is congestion within the field of local economic development in Scotland. There is confusion, overlap, duplication and active competition between the many agencies involved.\"</p><p>From that conclusion, all else flows. The Scottish Executive must not shirk its responsibility. It must take the lead to simplify the structure and eliminate duplication by penalising publicly funded bodies that do not co-operate in this process.</p><p>I mention in passing that the Scottish Executive's review of the enterprise network was somewhat premature and would have been more useful if it had followed this report rather than pre-empted it. None the less, I am sure that we all agree that the review of the enterprise network is welcome and I was pleased to hear the minister's comments.</p><p>The report expands on the obligations of the Executive in final conclusion 6, which says that the Executive should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"withdraw from operational programmes and concentrate on strategic guidance, setting targets and measurable outcomes, ensuring value for money in service provision, promoting good practice, reporting and evaluation.\"</p><p>With devolution, the role of the Executive in this <place-holder colnum=\"156\"/> area can be strategic, but it must also play the part of a watchdog that is prepared to bite. In final conclusions 9, 10 and 11, we begin to get to the meat of what should be happening at local level, at the heart of which are the local economic forums. I hope that they will be viewed by the business community as a flexible local friend.</p><p>The sting in the tail of the report comes in final conclusion 10, which says that the forums must devise a strategy that must include</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the definition of lead agencies and the unambiguous delineation of their areas of responsibility.\"</p><p>It goes on to say that the forums</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must also identify the process of eradicating duplication in the provision of services\"</p><p>and that their strategy should</p><p class=\"indent\">\"set out clearly the division of labour proposed by the forum, which should aim to ensure value for money and transparency.\"</p><p>The final sting is that the report suggests strongly that all of that should be assessed by a joint study by the Auditor General for Scotland and the Accounts Commission via Audit Scotland in 2002. The report has teeth and should not be taken lightly. For that reason, we urge the minister to consider the recommendations it makes.</p><p>The other conclusions in the report, which deal with small businesses, LECs and tourism, are positive and constructive, as are the Executive's forthcoming document on an economic framework for Scotland&#8212;I welcome the minister's comments in that regard&#8212;and proposals for lifelong learning.</p><p>I draw members' attention to the sections of the report that deal with business support services and performance management. They demonstrate that the inquiry produced startling and disturbing evidence of where we were failing to provide the counselling, mentorship and the vital support service that any new business needs. As John Swinney stated, there is profound concern about the calibre of some advisers that are provided to business.</p><p>The report identifies problems and provides solutions and is about making partnership work not for a supply-driven agenda but for a customer-driven one. That is the feature that came through time and again in the evidence that we took. If we are to deal with the problems that I have outlined, we have to consider the concerns of the business community that were clearly articulated in the business in the chamber event. There is an unhealthy cynicism among business people about the existing structures, which are felt not to work for them but to work for people with a predetermined agenda on the supply side. They are felt to be of varying levels of relevance to the business community.<place-holder colnum=\"157\"/></p><p>I suggest that there can be no other impetus or approach to providing business development services locally than what will be good for business, our communities, job creation and a wealthier and more fully employed society.</p><p>Although the report may be voluminous, and although some may think it generalised, it has a carefully crafted structure. It has drive, clarity, focus and teeth. It is the way forward for business in Scotland and I commend it to the Parliament and the minister.

It is just not here.</p><p>I want to echo the remarks that have been made in the debate that the bill as it stands is so deficient as to be meaningless. For the purposes of the Parliament, this is a bad model of legislation. Were it not for the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, the stalwart efforts of its staff and the conscientious efforts of the members, the debate would be meaningless to most people present.</p><p>It is desirable that employers, employees and trade unionists are able to understand the bill, to know its content and to make submissions on it, to make qualified, authorised and, it is to be hoped, informed comment, and to improve on and expand the debate. We have all been working in the dark.</p><p>For that reason, I hope that, in their substance, the illustrative regulations that were produced for the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and which gave us some kind of torch to look along the path, will reflect closely what the minister ends up with, as the ultimate appendage to the legislation. It is undesirable that those regulations will, effectively, be promulgated during the summer, when there will be no opportunity for scrutiny or review by the chamber or by the committee.</p><p>Having said that, on this side of the chamber there is enthusiasm for and a welcome of the proposals. They are extremely important. Going back to Marilyn Livingstone's question earlier, when she rightly inquired about Scots achieving a minimum level of literacy and numeracy, individual learning accounts have a particular relevance to the workplace and to the potential recipients of their benefits.</p><p>On clarity of operation, it is difficult to know, in the current context, whether it will exist. I hope that the minister can reassure us. In the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, we sought from Mr Pignatelli, who was there on behalf of the Scottish university for industry, some confirmation that there would not be confusion in the advisory element. As Mrs Ewing asked, who should people go to? Who should they phone? He sought to reassure the committee that he would endeavour to ensure that there was no confusion and no duplication of effort.</p><p>However, there are a number of players in the whole operation. There is the recipient, an employer, a provider, and there is, I presume, a facilitator, in the form of SUFI. It is critical, if the scheme is to have credibility, that everybody knows what their role is, that nobody is standing on toes and that the most important person, the recipient, is getting a clear steer as to the path they should follow to achieve whatever they seek <place-holder colnum=\"1178\"/> to acquire.</p><p>The scheme is good and I think it can expand. I hope the measure of its creation will be its ability to sell itself on its credibility. However, it should be monitored and its output should be measured. I hope that there are clear details from the minister on assessing how it operates once it gets under way.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the most important aspect of all: the recipients should be able to demonstrate that, by becoming recipients of ILAs, they have managed to improve themselves.

The fact that I remember that indicates that I am getting on a bit and, because I am getting on a bit, it means that I have known Glasgow for many years, socially as a student and also as someone who has been in business in this city.</p><p>I have seen changes, many of which have been enumerated in this debate: low gross domestic product; high unemployment; drugs abuse; extensive poverty; pervasive ill health; manifest social exclusion; and business deaths that exceed business start-ups. The bustle is out of the heart of the city. Anyone who has been in business in this city over the past 30 years can see that. Glasgow has the lowest economic activity rate among those of a working age of any place in Britain. Its population is falling and there are extensive tracts of derelict and vacant land.</p><p>However, there have been other changes. There has been the regeneration of the Merchant City, and Glasgow is making headway in the tourism sector&#8212;the garden festival and Glasgow's year as the city of architecture and design are testament to that. We have hotel facilities that rank with the best in the United Kingdom. With the universities of Glasgow, Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian, this city can hold up its head internationally as one of the premier providers of higher education. I declare an interest in that regard, as I sit in the court of Strathclyde University. We also have top-grade international airports in Glasgow and Glasgow Prestwick. Among the negative images are some very positive ones, many of which were created during 18 Tory years.</p><p>The most positive image&#8212;Glasgow's strongest feature&#8212;has never changed and never will. It is the beating pulse of Glaswegians, which shows itself, whether in Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Maryhill or Kelvinside, in warmth, humour and resilience. People in Kelvinside have their own way of demonstrating that, but it is still there. I want to use this opportunity to make a plea for Glasgow to the film makers, television drama writers and fiction authors. I ask them, when they create a character who is a villain, a wide boy or a chancer, to use a bit of literary imagination and give him a background other than Glasgow.</p><p>Although it is appropriate that in this place, on this day, we debate the regeneration of Glasgow, the words of the Executive's motion add up to little and the words of Ms Alexander's speech added up to even less. Braying repeatedly about small minds and small solutions was ill advised from the instigator of the repeal of section 28 and the <place-holder colnum=\"742\"/> proclaimer of what everyone regards as an indecently modest &#163;12 million to address the visible and profound difficulties confronting this city.</p><p>In the minister's speech the very factors that are impeding development, expansion and job creation in Glasgow were conspicuous by their absence. They include the road traffic tourniquet that the M8 and Kingston bridge become at morning and evening rush hour. Travelling by her ministerial car, Ms Alexander may not be familiar with that, but I faced it for years. Where is the M74 extension? Glasgow's jobs need it, the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce regards it as its No 1 priority, and the business community is screaming for it.</p><p>Where in the minister's speech were business rates mentioned? I appreciate that she glides around in her ministerial car and seldom has to hoof it like the rest of us, but has she paused to glance at the \"For sale\" and \"To let\" signs in the city? Has she observed that the growth industry is charity shops, and does she know why that is? Does she have any understanding of what removal by the Government of uniform business rate means, and does she really think that the imposition of a higher rate poundage for Scotland than for England is the way to encourage the regeneration of Glasgow and the creation of jobs?</p><p>For existing employees, are the city entry charges and workplace charges proposed by the Government not active deterrents to regeneration? Glasgow City Council leader Charles Gordon certainly thinks so. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We're setting our face against urban road tolls\",</p><p>and he is right to do that. Has the minister given any thought to the thousands of square feet of unoccupied property in the commercial heart of Glasgow? It will never again be occupied by commerce, so why does the Executive not enter into a dialogue with the council about pioneering redevelopment of that space for residential purposes? As regeneration of the Merchant City showed, there is a demand for that. Through such redevelopment, we could reduce commuter pressure on roads, start to reverse depopulation and bring much-needed resources back into the city.</p><p>The Conservative amendment indicates additional specific measures which, in our opinion, would assist in addressing the challenge of urban regeneration for Glasgow. We propose a minister for Glasgow. That is not a suggestion that we make lightly, but an attempt to ensure that there is co-ordination and focus on what must be a concerted and conjoined effort. We also propose a directly elected provost and a Glasgow parliamentary committee.<place-holder colnum=\"743\"/></p><p>This is the biggest conurbation in Scotland. Its problems are more pervasive and, I suspect, more universal than the problems anywhere else in Scotland. Our amendment seems to me to be devolution in action. The words of the song are that \"Glasgow belongs to me\". However, to make regeneration work requires joint action and not joined-up words in a motion.

Some means had to be devised to let fresh air blow through it; the bill is a start.</p><p>We support the principles behind the changes proposed by the Parliament's Local Government Committee&#8212;to which tribute has, rightly, been paid&#8212;during its consideration of the bill. In particular, the suggestions that it made concerning the creation of a standards commission, with a wide range of meaningful sanctions, represent a positive set of proposals. Those sanctions will be acceptable to the public. Also sensible is the suggestion that the bill should extend to all devolved public bodies, including local enterprise <place-holder colnum=\"95\"/> companies.</p><p>The Conservative party feels that the role of the standards commission could be achieved by streamlining existing procedures and bodies, without necessarily creating further, new bureaucracy in the form of a separate commission. That is an aspect that we shall consider carefully during stage 2.</p><p>Much of the content of the bill is good, is needed and is overdue. It is a matter of regret for the Conservative party, therefore, that we find ourselves unable to support the bill. The aspect of the bill that is unacceptable to the party is section 25, which seeks to repeal section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986 or, as it is more familiarly known, section 28.</p><p>Repealing section 28, if that is what the Executive is hellbent on doing, has no place in this legislation. It is a hastily conceived add-on, which is unconnected to the rest of the bill. If repeal of section 28 is to be pursued by the Executive, it should be the subject of separate legislative proposals and separate debate. The approach has all the hallmarks of a furtive ruse to slip something into the statute book in the hope that no one will really notice.</p><p>The proposal was, after all, neither a Labour nor a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment. It was not in the Executive's programme for government; it was not in the partnership agreement; nor was it contained in any statements by ministers on this very bill.</p><p>Opposition to the repeal of section 28 has already been debated in the chamber, at the instigation of the Conservative party. While we lost the vote to retain that section, there is no doubt that, by being the only party in the chamber to stand up for them, we won the argument decisively as far as the people of Scotland were concerned.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have been resolute in their opposition to repeal. Interestingly, during the Ayr by-election campaign, the Scottish nationalists rather wavered in their position, which had been one of unstinting support for the Executive, which proposed repeal. They decided that they ought to consider statutory guidelines. The party that remained resolute in its beliefs, the Conservative party, happened to win the Ayr by-election.</p>", "hdate": "2000-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226289", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Conservative party welcomes the bill in principle.

My understanding is that our position&#8212;as represented by Mr Monteith&#8212;has always been that we should maintain our opposition to repeal of section 28 and that we would relax our view only if we were satisfied that acceptable safeguards were being put in place. I am strongly of the view that that is the point that Mr Monteith was advancing when he debated the subject.</p><p>I return to the seemingly twofold arguments that the Executive has sought to advance in support of repeal of section 28. The reasons that the Executive proffers for repeal of the section are that repeal will stop bullying in schools and that it will facilitate discussion and education about homosexuality in our schools. I am sorry to say to the minister that in the earlier debate on the matter in the chamber, I found those reasons unconvincing and unproven&#8212;I still consider that to be the case. The Scottish Executive's anti-bullying website admits that there is no legal bar to preventing teachers from explicitly condemning homophobic bullying, or discussing pupils' concerns about sexuality&#8212;a position that my party endorses entirely.</p><p>The current Scottish Executive development department guidance to local authorities makes it <place-holder colnum=\"97\"/> clear that section 28 will not prevent the objective discussion of homosexuality in the classroom, nor will it prevent the counselling of pupils who are concerned about their sexuality. That is also a position that the Conservatives support entirely.</p><p>There is no need to repeal a legally enforceable safeguard for our children&#8212;that is at the heart of the concerns of so many people in Scotland. When repeal is mentioned in the context of sweeping away protection to replace it with something that is not enforceable, naturally parents become deeply concerned. I know that the minister does not share that view&#8212;her view is that we can trust educationists, that we can trust local authorities and that we can trust those who provide information to our schools. Many parents feel that, in the absence of some form of protection, that is not a satisfactory reassurance.</p><p>There is, therefore, no need for repeal of the section. The arguments that the Executive has advanced are, as I said, not proven. The people of Scotland do not want repeal. According to a recent ICM Research poll, 64 per cent of people do not want it, and a MORI poll in January indicated that 60 per cent of head teachers do not want it.</p>", "hdate": "2000-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226289", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Conservatives' position can be clarified amply and I am sure that Mr Monteith will take advantage of the opportunity to do that in his speech later.

In the perception of the public, this project has become a farce. Something insidious is happening: the <place-holder colnum=\"1333\"/> public is making a judgment on the Parliament itself. It affords me little comfort to repeat some of the comments that I have heard recently from members of the public: \"what a shower\", or \"they are out of control\" or \"who do they think they are?\" The public are looking at an institution that has become associated with costs and rising costs; that has a huge swathe of ministers; that has legions of advisers; that has embraced the controversy of section 28; that allows a Lord Advocate to hop off and become a judge; that seems to be obsessed with fox-hunting; and that has presided over crises in our civil and criminal courts.</p><p>It is small wonder that the public use epithets such as \"what a shower\" and \"out of control\". That is a judgment on the First Minister and the Executive. Leadership could, and should, have come from them. Although today we may take a vote on a building and where it should or should not be, at issue is something far greater. At issue is the integrity of this institution. The questions that we must all consider before we vote should be these: how do we begin to redeem ourselves in the eyes of the public, and how do we start to restore credibility and respect?</p><p>If the advice that was proffered to this chamber in June last year by Mr Gorrie and others had been heeded, we would not be in this situation today.

It is important to bear that in mind as there is a degree of cynicism among the public about how those bodies operate. That transparency is equally necessary for the effective working of the quango. I hope that the broader issue of quangos in general can be examined. Perhaps some of them can be restructured into voluntary organisations.

To minimise bureaucracy and cost, the commissioner could audit the process. However, should not appointees be appointed for an initial probationary period, whereby continuance of their appointment would rest with the individual quango chairman?

It was at that point, Presiding Officer, that the motion gave me the jitters. Desirable is not the same as affordable, hence the amendment to the motion in my name.</p><p>The rub in all this is the money. When it comes to infrastructure, there are three options.

I am not satisfied that it would be able to.</p><p>That private finance initiatives are the best and most imaginative way forward is not an opinion that is held only by me. Were that so, I doubt whether the Executive would have had anything to do with them. The Executive realised soon after coming to power that PFIs provide an efficient and manageable means of accessing capital to provide essential investment. They allow the Government to provide better public services at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The services remain publicly owned, but the use of private sector capital and skill means a better deal for the taxpayer.</p><p>Mr Ewing referred to an independent report; I will refer to another. Arthur Andersen and the London School of Economics concluded, on 10 February 2000, that the private finance initiative appears to offer excellent value for money. The study, commissioned by the Treasury's PFI task force, examined 29 projects and concluded that, compared with the public sector estimates of the cost of buying the same projects conventionally, average savings run at 17 per cent.</p><p>The current structure of our water authorities bears examination. They have difficulty accessing capital because of their structure. In my opinion, accessing external capital is vital if they are to continue with the essential infrastructure investment in which they will have to engage.</p><p>The position is made a little more complicated by the Labour-legislated Competition Act 1998, which was introduced on 1 March 2000 and will ensure that dominant forces in a monopoly have a difficult time establishing the legitimacy of continuing to operate unchallenged.

Indeed, the document shows a healthy recognition that, when we use the word \"manufacturing\", we should not think exclusively of big bits of metal and the horny hand of toil, however attractive those attributes might have been in the past. However, the honest sweat of brow remains enduringly relevant, as I shall explain.</p><p>It is refreshing to find references in the document to how factors such as research and development, design, supply, production, software, services, distribution and aftercare can combine to create the process of manufacturing. It is equally helpful to track the course of manufacturing jobs over the past 19 years and to be presented with the analysis of the steady increase in electrical and instrument engineering jobs over the past five years.</p><p>The chart in the document that illustrates a comparison between 1973 and 1998 of gross value added by the manufacturing sector is particularly illuminating. Although the chart shows where there has been sector decline, the consistent growth in other parts of the sector and the huge productivity gains in the past 20 years are both positive aspects.</p><p>However, smiling at ourselves in the mirror becomes pointless when we lag behind competitors such as France, Germany and particularly the USA in terms of productivity. Successful business, whether in the manufacturing sector or elsewhere, exists on innovation, creation, productivity and competitiveness. To nurture those criteria, the document includes an extensive list of things to do, all of which are relevant and laudable. However, the question is how many of them are happening. Will some of them ever happen, or are they just a well-intended wish list?</p><p>Since the Parliament began, the minister has given a string of announcements about initiatives, as Mr Swinney said. What has happened to them? Has anything happened because of them? Is anybody measuring output or outcomes? Has <place-holder colnum=\"539\"/> anyone set targets?</p><p>Mr Swinney appropriately referred to the Scottish university for industry. My perception is that there is slight scepticism among the business community about the relevance of the concept. I hope that that scepticism can be dispelled, but we must be much more public about the achievements and consequences of established initiatives. If such initiatives are not to be discredited and if politicians are to enjoy any respectability with business, we need to put flesh on the bones of such initiatives and we need to do so quickly. I hope that the minister can give us an early report on progress to date.</p><p>I want also to mention a particular hobby-horse&#8212;the reviews of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The minister should be under no illusion: business is looking for radical proposals and for clear links, not confusion.</p><p>We must examine the Executive's intentions for the business environment if we are to avoid the Executive's publication being discounted. Page 5 of the document says that the Executive will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"take steps to ensure that the regulatory burden is kept to a sensible minimum\".</p><p>That is great news, but what is happening?</p><p>According to the British Chambers of Commerce, since 1997, the Labour Government has implemented more than 2,600 regulations and repealed only 20. Much of Scotland's manufacturing sector is made up of small concerns employing fewer than 10 people. For such businesses, being hamstrung and strangled with red tape is a threat to survival. An inquiry by National Westminster Bank plc found that the total cost of compliance with Government red tape was 8.5 per cent of turnover for businesses with a total turnover between &#163;20,000 and &#163;50,000 and 4.1 per cent of turnover for larger businesses.</p><p>Those are alarming statistics, because they go to the heart not only of survival, but of competitiveness. My suggestion&#8212;which I make purely constructively, I hope&#8212;is to beef up IRIS. I am not exhorting the minister to go around fattening up women; I refer to the improving regulation in Scotland unit. I suggest that the unit be given a target and that the Scottish manufacturing steering group be asked to produce proposals for a reduction in red tape over the next four months. The minister should then ask IRIS to report on the proposals to see whether they can be implemented. I assure the minister that that will raise a cheer like nothing else.</p><p>Page 5 of the report also says that the Executive will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ensure the competitiveness of Scottish manufacturers is not adversely affected by decisions on the business rate\".<place-holder colnum=\"540\"/></p><p>Mr Ewing referred to that. Because Jack McConnell, the Minister for Finance, has abolished the uniform business rate, we have a built-in business rate pound discriminator between Scotland and England. That is bad news and bad public relations for the Scottish business community, which needs to attract, not deter, inward investment.</p><p>I do not expect a wand to be waved, but the minister should be aware that there is a disparity between words and what is going on&#8212;there is a shortfall. I am as anxious as anybody that this document should enjoy credibility, but it will do that only if deeds begin to match words.</p><p>Another of the Executive's declared aims is to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"build an integrated transport system, which meets Scotland's economic and social needs, but does not threaten the health of our environment\".</p><p>So far, we have no integrated transport system. According to the Minister for Transport and the Environment, we are not getting one this year, next year, sometime never. If the minister knows something that we do not, we should be put out of our suspense. We would like to know what M74 extension card is up the minister's sleeve, because unless a card is coming out of a sleeve&#8212;or a rabbit out of a hat&#8212;the commitment in the report means nothing. We have had only deterrent factors, which hit competitiveness. They include the highest fuel prices in Europe, proposals for road-user charges and taxes on workplace parking.</p><p>On page 6 of \"Created in Scotland\", which deals with</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the use of knowledge and technology\",</p><p>the Executive says that it will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"develop an e-commerce strategy for Scotland\".</p><p>That is very worthy, and it is obviously vital, but let politicians not make the mistake of thinking that e-commerce is a stand-alone electronic innovation or an end in itself.

The minister should confirm that he will enter into urgent consultation with current connection providers to address that threat.

I have a certain sympathy with his doing so, although his credentials are slightly questionable&#8212;I remain unconvinced that the SNP would be anything other than a high-taxation party in an independent Scotland. The current platform of taxation is oppressive. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Chris Humphries, said on 11 March last year that the net effect of the budget was that business would be &#163;500 million worse off in 1999, &#163;1.5 billion worse off in 2000 and &#163;1.2 billion worse off in 2001. We cannot regard those as empty statistics. Those figures have a significant impact on business. The manufacturing sector is particularly vulnerable.</p><p>The Conservative party commends the spirit of the Executive's report. Out there in our manufacturing sector, there is at every level the honest sweat of brow. Let us not turn that into a cold sweat. In \"Created in Scotland\", we have bones. I say to the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning that, unless we put flesh on those bones, I am afraid that there will be no conviction on the part of the business community that the Executive's initiative is anything more than <place-holder colnum=\"542\"/> a verbal one. Speaking for my party, I want the initiative to be anything but that. I believe that the document is good and that its spirit lies in the best traditions of trying to help industry.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13223132", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Manufacturing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "More's the pity.

The rural economy is in a state of unprecedented disintegration, we underperform in business expansion and there are huge questions about the health service.

I am sure that I am not alone in having been deeply disturbed by the nature and flavour of recent comments.</p><p>We have to be clear about what we are discussing. To me, this debate is not, and never should have been, about homophobia. It is not, and never should have been, an unseemly and at times offensive exchange of views.</p><p>For a society that aspires to reflect social inclusion, tolerance is, or should be, the foundation stone. I have no doubt that, when people are mature enough to make their own decisions on lifestyle, they must be free to make those decisions. The decisions are for them and them alone.</p><p>The issue in this debate is much simpler&#8212;the stable, reassuring and supportive environment that we want in our schools for our young people. During adolescence, young people go through arguably the most turbulent and difficult time of their life and are perhaps at their most impressionable and vulnerable. That is what any debate on section 28 ought to be about.</p><p>When the Executive first intimated that it proposed to repeal section 28&#8212;I recall that that was done not in this chamber, but at some event attended by the Minister for Communities at the University of Glasgow&#8212;the reasons advanced were that the presence of section 28 prevented or inhibited teachers from dealing with the bullying of young people who were thought to be homosexual, and it inhibited or restricted adequate discussion about homosexuality in schools.</p><p>Those arguments troubled me, because I find it unacceptable that bullying in schools should arise from any cause and that it should not be dealt with. It also troubled me that there could be any meaningful sexual education class in schools without reference to homosexuality; the discussion of such matters, as appropriate for the age and <place-holder colnum=\"937\"/> stage of development of our children, is absolutely essential.</p><p>That took me to the text of section 28. Reading that text as a lawyer rather than a politician, I found nothing in it that would prevent schools from dealing with bullying or would inhibit the discussion of homosexuality in our schools. I say that because the nub of this issue is the word \"promote\". A confusion has arisen about the meaning of teaching, as distinct from promoting.</p><p>In the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"promoting\" is defined as \"advancing\", \"preferring\" or \"encouraging\". That places a very different construction on the argument. As far as sexual education in our schools is concerned, section 28 is doing no more than preserving a balance. The reality is that, without any promotion at all, heterosexuality is the norm; and when I say the norm, I mean that it is the condition or situation in which the majority of people exist. That is a central tenet of society.</p><p>I understand that the First Minister has said that he does not wish to promote homosexuality, as has the Minister for Children and Education. If that is so, the question that I and a great many people in Scotland are asking is: why has this issue arisen?</p><p>Choice of lifestyle should not rest with schools, which are there to inform. Nothing in section 28 prohibits the imparting of such information. In my opinion, such information should also refer to the structure and value of marriage, the family and stable relationships, to use the Executive's own words in a newspaper this morning.</p><p>In considering section 28, I have been struck forcibly by two factors. Before the Minister for Communities made her announcement at the University of Glasgow last October, no one had raised the matter with me. Nobody had expressed the fears that the minister seemed to harbour or the difficulties that she seemed to have. That view is supported by Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector for schools in England and Wales, who recently said that the issue had simply not been raised with him by the teaching profession.</p><p>I presume that that is why the repeal of section 28 was not thought worth including in any party manifesto for the Scottish Parliament elections, and did not merit mention in the Executive's programme for government, the partnership agreement or any ministerial statement on the ethical standards bill. I cannot say that that silence has endured since the minister made her announcement.</p><p>I cannot believe that I am the only MSP to be overwhelmed by a mountain of mail from members of the public who are deeply alarmed at the threatened removal of what they see as a <place-holder colnum=\"938\"/> fundamental protection for young people. I cannot speak for others, but, as of this morning, of the 223 letters that I have received on the issue, 11 are for the repeal and 212 are against.</p><p>I have to ask myself how the matter has arisen at all. There was certainly no public appetite in Scotland for raising it.

Nor should the council of the isles conjure up a public perception of a peripatetic group of aquatic bureaucrats observing tokenism by circumnavigating their way round the British Isles.</p><p>The council's composition and activity are important, as is its location. We feel that a permanent chairman and the imaginative inclusion of an interparliamentary dimension would be fruitful and strengthen the structure. The prospect of locating the permanent secretariat in Glasgow is alluring and would be a fitting tribute to the traditions of St Mungo.

That is welcome and this party applauds those sentiments. He also considered that the council could be a forum for discussion where interests coincide, overlap and collide.

I have been uneasy, perhaps, about the tone of one or two parts of it. Some fundamental elements have been obscured by more personal and, at times, parochial issues.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Mr Russell lodged this motion. I entirely support the amendment. Quite simply, this issue is as simple or as complex as one chooses to make it. There are two inescapable elements: the monarchy and discrimination. I will make clear my standpoint. I am a deputy lieutenant and, as such, I both support and believe in the monarchy. I am also a member and elder of the Church of Scotland and, as such, I am wholly opposed to discrimination in any form, wherever it is found.</p><p>On the question of why this issue has arisen now, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton rightly referred to devolution putting our whole constitutional process under the microscope. I do not agree with Mary Mulligan, as I think that the royal family has become more topical in the past 10 years. The constitutional settlement for Scotland has enabled an eye to be cast over the more intricate relationships that exist between Scotland and other elements of our constitution.</p><p>It was curious that Mr McCabe just about managed to omit any reference to the monarchy in his speech. I wondered whether that reflected a 50 per cent appetite for all this. At least Mr Henry was more forthright: he dismissed the monarchy as an irrelevant institution.</p><p>On the Executive's amendment, I wonder whether the difficulties are not being slightly exaggerated. It is indeed the case that seven or eight statutes would require repeal or amendment, and that, perhaps, the Church of England would have a more significant dilemma over this matter than any other religious institution. However, it is also the case that our devolution settlement involved us in a very considerable number of statutory repeals and amendments, so I cannot believe that this constitutional challenge would be insuperable. As Lord James said, reforming the House of Lords has proved to be within the management of the Government. I do not think that, in technical constitutional terms, this would be more challenging.<place-holder colnum=\"1674\"/></p><p>It pleases me to say that I have no doubt that this Parliament has a role in this matter, and I do so genuinely. In the past six months, I have been taken by surprise by how important many significant institutions in Scotland regard this Parliament to be in relation to reserved matters. It has become clear that those institutions see this Parliament as a repository for opinion, and an increasingly influential player in that role. Therefore, I entirely support what Lord James said: it is important that this chamber sends out a message that is sensible, constructive and, above all else, contemporary with the feelings and mood of the Scottish people.</p><p>If there is one thing that we can infer from this debate, it is that we are all opposed to religious discrimination, wherever it is to be found. If we can be unanimous in that message, it will do this chamber a lot of credit and will be a good advertisement for Scotland. I am conscious that the Act of Settlement as currently framed is, at best, divisive and, at worst, profoundly offensive. That is an unacceptable anachronism.

We want to amend the motion to focus attention on specific areas that, if they are not dealt with, will not only obstruct the modernisation of the Scottish economy but set us back from where we are.</p><p>Before discussing the motion and the amendment in more detail, a quick spring clean round the Executive's cupboard marked \"Business\" would be timely, because I see in there some items that should head for the skip without delay. They include excessive rolls of red tape&#8212;as the minister knows, a favourite theme of mine. There have been 2,600 new Labour regulations since May 1997, which represents grim news for business.</p><p>Joining the red tape is the box marked \"No new roads\", to which passing reference has been made. As an item in the Executive's enterprise portfolio, \"No new roads\" has no place in a modern enterprise economy. In the current economic climate, asking local authorities to assume responsibility for matters such as the M74 extension is like asking granny to take part in the 400 m hurdles. The Scottish Executive should not hide behind the skirts of local authorities, but examine the current enterprise budget and, with the private sector, identify funds for the improvement of our roads infrastructure. That is synonymous with sound business investment, as business cannot function without an adequate roads infrastructure.</p><p>Well worth taking out of the Executive's business cupboard and dusting down are two boxes marked \"Education\" and \"Training\". It might even be worth while looking in those boxes to see what they contain. If our education system and training schemes are driven by a vacuum of provision, rather than by the demand-led needs of business and industry, we shall end up hitting a <place-holder colnum=\"711\"/> wall at the end of a cul-de-sac.</p><p>In the recent debate on the Scottish university for industry, I asked the minister what consultation had taken place with industry and how industry had responded. Answer came there none. Inquiries that I have made from business about the Scottish university for industry have not elicited a flattering response. Such initiatives, if not validated by demonstrable business demand, are at risk of damaged credibility and dismissal as tokenism, which would be unfortunate, as there is merit in the concept of a Scottish university for industry.</p><p>If, in the Labour business cupboard, there is a shelf creaking with the burden that it bears, it is the shelf marked \"Tax\". That shelf is in danger of coming away from the wall. The Conservative party is calling on the minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to lighten that burden. I do not share Mr Swinney's observations on the merits of macro-economic decisions being taken exclusively in Scotland. I am a supporter of the United Kingdom and a firm believer in the union, particularly in the advantages that it has brought to our trading position.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13214980", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the Executive's motion for two   reasons.

For the first time in a generation, we are paying more tax than Germany.</p><p>I do not list those statistics as a sterile litany of criticism of the Labour Government. I state them as evidence of the chilling reality of the situation. They are indicative of precisely the climate that business does not need. In relation to the motion, I suggest that careful note should be taken of the level of taxation.</p><p>If I find an unlikely ally in Mr Sheridan, I find an even more improbable one in Mr Livingstone, who, on 7 November, was honest enough to say</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we haven't increased the standard rate, but we have increased a lot of other taxes . . . we have done it with all these stealth taxes.

However, this debate also provides an opportunity to think positively and adventurously. I hope that our amendment reflects that.</p><p>We are considering the motion and the amendments against an alarming backdrop&#8212;given the wording of the Executive's motion, it is also a perverse backdrop. According to the Scottish new business statistics, published by Scottish Enterprise on 12 November, 5,064 businesses were started in Scotland during the second quarter of this year, which is a decline of 12.9 per cent from the second quarter of 1998. <place-holder colnum=\"713\"/></p><p>That is not the evidence that we want to have before us, but it leads to the text of our amendment, which is an attempt to broaden the debate and to make the phrase \"modernisation of the Scottish economy\" meaningful in the best sense.</p><p>The key is an expansion of the Scottish enterprise base. We lag behind the rest of the UK in terms of business start-ups. It is difficult to procure data, but I have been able to secure some information that suggests that the ratio of Scotland's business birth rate to that of the UK average improved during the five years to 1997. Although I recognise that there has been a modest reduction in the gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK in terms of business births, I have a document that says that the data</p><p class=\"indent\">\"merely underlines what was said in the Business Birth Rate Strategy when it was originally published in 1993: that closing the gap with the rest of the UK in terms of new business starts is a long-term task, requiring sustained effort by many people and organisations.\"</p><p>If asked about the most likely deterrent to the creation of a new business, any businessman will say that it is difficulty in securing finance. Scottish Enterprise says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the evidence certainly seems to suggest that problems in securing finance are seen as the biggest obstacle to start a business.\"</p><p>It also says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"making it easier for people to <i>gain access</i> to finance, helping people to understand more about how to go through the process, could have a significant impact on the number of businesses that are created.\"</p><p>Access to finance is a problem that also dogs businesses that seek to expand. We need to encourage a change in lenders' attitudes from risk aversion&#8212;to which the minister referred&#8212;to an acceptance of risk as an investment. In Scotland, the trend is to leave as much risk as possible with the borrower. That contrasts sharply with attitudes in other countries, particularly the United States of America.</p><p>It is time for the Government to engage in a dialogue with the enterprise agencies and Scotland's major lending institutions to consider ways of changing attitudes and transforming our economic culture to one in which failure is not a stigma.

I do not think that I am alone in being surprised that three hours of debating time in the chamber should be allocated to this topic. If we are as prepared as we can be to meet the challenge of the millennium bug, why are we having the debate? Would not a ministerial statement with questions afterwards have sufficed? If we are not in a state of preparedness and there are some dire and unanswered questions, we should be having an emergency debate on the state of Scotland.</p><p>In fairness to the minister, I think that the situation is not the latter, but the former. If that is the case, I allude to a matter that concerns my party and, more important, an audience outwith the Parliament. It is becoming apparent to many that the timetable of the Parliament is within the firm&#8212;and some would say dictatorial&#8212;grip of the Executive's parliamentary schedulers.

This debate has raised questions about practice. How will the concept work and, indeed, what is the concept? Mr Stephen said in his introductory remarks that it will not be a university. Perhaps we ought to stop calling it that. He also said that it would not end up being called the Scottish university for industry. We need to get the nomenclature right.</p><p>If I may say so, if I think that the minister is an honourable man, I shall call him that, and if I think that he is a prat, I shall call him that, too. Whatever we think this is going to be, we ought to understand what it is and we should define it more precisely.</p><p>I suspect that it would be more honest to describe it as the institution for Scottish lifelong learning. One of the case studies in the document opens with the question:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Why a Scottish University for Industry?\"</p><p>and answers:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If Scotland wants to remain part of a highly competitive global economy, it has to grasp fully the wide-ranging opportunities afforded by advances in technology.\"</p><p>That suggests to me that it must be driven by <place-holder colnum=\"181\"/> industry and I hope that, when he winds up, the minister will confirm what consultation has taken place with industry and how industry responded.</p><p>Mr Swinney was right to refer to concerns about duplication of advisory and educational facilities at local level. That problem is already exercising the attention of members of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.</p><p>The document has much in the way of verbiage, but it also has glaring gaps. If, as has been indicated, this institution or concept is not to be a mere telephone database, we need to know the answer to some questions. We need to know how the expensive duplication of existing education and advice sources will be avoided and we need to know how the concept will materialise in a manner that is clear and accessible to the public. Such clarity is certainly lacking.</p><p>Would not the network of local enterprise companies be a sensible co-ordinator of local provision to serve industry? What will be the quantitative measures of the performance of the institution? How will we know whether it is working? How will be know whether it is succeeding in achieving whatever its declared objectives will be? This Parliament has a specific interest in those questions and I hope that the minister will clarify the Executive's intention to make matters more transparent.</p><p>Will the institution, whatever it is to be called, be directly accountable to the Executive? For audit purposes, will it be subject to annual examination by the Audit Committee of the Parliament? If those questions cannot be answered satisfactorily, the proposal will be seen as empty Government dogma and that would be regrettable. The Conservative party would like to see the Scottish university for industry as a much-needed added-value component to industry.

All those people, who are unpaid, use their own time and, in many cases, their own resources, help others, whatever form that help may take. They are numerous and the contribution they make to Scottish society is probably impossible to quantify. Theirs is a gesture of a responsible society and good will, and it is the sort of contribution that, in a healthy society such as we want in Scotland, is fundamental. It should be encouraged and in no way impeded or obstructed.</p><p>I view with grave concern the possibility that voluntary organisations will be subjected not just to considerable costs carrying out checks but, if we can take the estimates from the scouting and guiding movements as accurate, that the costs will be of a magnitude that will have a significant effect on their ability to do their excellent work.</p><p>I urge the minister to view that cost as an insurance premium that society ought to pay for the safeguards it needs. Is it unreasonable for the Government to regard that premium as an investment? There is arguably no item of public expenditure that could be better justified or more useful than underwriting and supporting what those thousands of excellent people in Scotland seek to achieve.</p><p>I am glad that a review has been announced and I urge the minister to consider with the greatest concern and care the excellent points that have been made in this debate.</p>", "hdate": "1999-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13213011", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Organisations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Unlike Andrew Wilson, I was not in the Boys Brigade but I declare an interest, in that the guide commissioners of Scotland gave me dinner last month.

Some play was made of Mr McLeish's contribution to the debate in the House of Commons. I, too, have a slight concern. An authoritative view was expressed in the House of Lords by the English Solicitor-General on second reading of the Government of Wales Bill. Lord Falconer made a good point, saying of the concordats:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"They will not take the form of binding contracts; they will not take the form of statutory documents, but it may well be the case that they will create a legitimate expectation of consultation. For instance, if one party to a concordat suddenly ceased to consult the other in accordance with the concordat, the result might be that its decisions could be challenged by way of judicial review, so it is wrong to say that there will be no legal underpinning to these concordats.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>,<i> House of Lords</i>, 21 April 1998; Vol 588, c 1131.]</p><p>My concern is that we are straying on to a potential law-making facility and that we may be doing so through the back door. I do not think that that is healthy. If, in Scotland, a potential investor felt that his or her rights had been ignored or disregarded by the Executive, in relation to the directions within the concordats&#8212;it might be a lack of consultation or whatever&#8212;that investor might seek judicial review in the Court of Session. His case might be founded on the alleged lack of consultation or some other neglect or failure by the Executive in relation to the concordats. I am concerned that this Parliament has not had an opportunity to examine in detail the text of these documents. I do not want to labour the point; I simply make it and observe that it is one issue over which the Conservatives have concerns.</p><p>The joint ministerial committee seems to have been conceived with good intent, but I am not sure just how it will operate. According to the memorandum of understanding, the joint ministerial committee is to carry out various tasks. Its terms of reference are to consider various matters, to keep arrangements for liaison and to consider disputes. I am not quite sure about the committee's status. I am not sure whether it is consultative or executive; perhaps it is meant to be neither. The Executive has a duty to this Parliament to clarify how it regards the status and structure of that committee. It is important for us to know precisely how the committee is meant to operate.</p><p>There is a feeling&#8212;unworthy, perhaps&#8212;that the <place-holder colnum=\"1120\"/> committee's status may deliberately have been made vague. It may be a deliberate fudge to deal with Governments of different colours in different parts of the United Kingdom.

In my question, I mentioned the minister's key strategic priorities. The statement includes a worthy list of areas on which the minister proposes to spend money and many of the contributors to the debate have referred to that list. Under the heading of education, however, the list makes no acknowledgement of the teachers' plight and no recognition that we have a serious situation&#8212;an impasse&#8212;in which the teachers are being promised no comfort until the outcome of an inquiry in May 2000. If Labour, in its first year of spending, managed to cut spending on education by &#163;219 million, does not that make the &#163;80 million look paltry in terms of the educational sphere's current needs?</p><p>On justice, what about more, instead of fewer, police? What about fewer cuts to funding&#8212;or more money&#8212;for Victim Support? I asked the minister about enterprise and lifelong learning. Reference is made to increased access and doubling assistance to mature students on low incomes, but it is difficult to reconcile that with the tuition fees impasse. There is complete silence on help for enterprise.</p><p>Mr MacAskill eloquently described the shortcomings of our transport system. If ours is an unholy alliance, Mr MacAskill, I am proud to share <place-holder colnum=\"1073\"/> it with you. It is the duty of Opposition to point out such things. In Scotland, we have an overdue improvement programme for killer roads and a tired and inadequate roads infrastructure that desperately needs investment.</p><p>The statement is good on communities and no doubt encouraging for those who will benefit from that, but what cheer is there for people who have the misfortune to live in the country? What about fuel taxes, the neglect of our rural communities and the difficulties that face them?</p><p>Under the subject of rural affairs, there is no comfort for our agriculture industry. That is very pertinent to those members who today met the representatives from the pig industry; we heard an acute plea from an industry that is on the point of collapse. What succour is there for the pig industry?</p><p>I see gaping and disturbing gaps in the statement. On health, what about reducing waiting lists and waiting times? What about increasing the number of nurses? Such things matter to the people of Scotland.</p><p>There is no doubt that the minister's statement is ambitious, nor is there any doubt that it is carefully crafted. There is no doubt whatever that the money has been recycled so much that the food processor is in danger of exploding as it tries to produce yet another dish from the minister's kitchen.</p><p>At Westminster, there is a roll-forward of surpluses that are not being disbursed; that practice is spreading to this Parliament. That is not welcome news. A war chest is being built up and is becoming immoral in its immensity. At the current rate, it is costing &#163;1,500 for every taxpayer in Scotland. We are entitled to ask whether that money could be distributed in many more advantageous ways than being kept to hone the weapons of election combat.</p><p>In short, the expenditure statement might bring comfort to some people, but it will bring none at all to most.</p>", "hdate": "1999-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13212317", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Expenditure Plans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr McConnell gave a very attractive performance.

This party also welcomes the bill and the general principles that are set out in it. In terms of content, it may be riveting to the point of being dangerously exciting, but none the less it deals with some serious matters. Like Mr Wilson, we congratulate the minister, his team and others who have assisted in producing a very complex bill in a very short time.</p><p>We may express slight concern about the budget amendments. I think that it is now accepted that the budget will be set out through primary legislation. As a member of the Audit Committee, I am concerned, as is the Conservative group, that amendments should also be made through primary legislation. In his opening remarks, the minister mentioned honesty and transparency and we all applaud that. However, there is a need to ensure that that is <place-holder colnum=\"976\"/> effected in reality and that it does not become just a verbal shibboleth.</p><p>In the interest of flexibility, we accept the concept of ministerial direction on the format of accounts. However, we hope that the courtesy of allowing the Finance Committee to comment on format will be observed. That would be a proper demonstration of transparency.</p><p>My colleague, Mr Davidson, who is in his sick bed and cannot be with us today, serves on the Finance Committee and has asked me to raise one or two points on his behalf. He had a slight concern that the bill makes no mention of the role of the Finance Committee. I accept that the minister considers that that role will evolve and that he may not wish to make any prescriptive mention of it now. However, it might give some comfort to the chamber if he were to expand a little on how he sees the role of the committee unfolding, because there is no doubt that it is an important committee and one that is singularly relevant to the matters under discussion today.</p><p>I have been asked to point out&#8212;although I do not wish to be polemical&#8212;that when the bill was put out for consultation, it went into the public arena before the Finance Committee had an opportunity to view it. In the interests of a more harmonious relationship between the Executive and the committee, perhaps the minister will have regard to that sort of omission in future.</p><p>There is also a feeling that the budget bill, whenever it appears, ought to be in the province of the Finance Committee and, unless I have failed to read the bill correctly, there does not seem to be any specific provision for that. For example, does the minister intend to allow the Finance Committee to see the draft budget for some predetermination of how matters look, or is it simply to be landed straight into the parliamentary chamber?</p><p>Mr Wilson alludes to his concerns about audit functions, which I will come to in a moment. However, I have a concern&#8212;I have already placed it on record in the Audit Committee&#8212;about the position of local authorities. While I understand the constitutional precedent that allows the Accounts Commission to audit local authorities, I think that it is necessary for me to put the following comments on record in the chamber, for the public information of the electorate.</p><p>We, as a Parliament, are attempting to deal responsibly with the expenditure of very large sums of public money, as the minister said. It seems anomalous that the bill does not provide for the slice of expenditure that goes to local authorities, which currently spend approximately &#163;6.4 billion, to be examined in more detail. I accept the minister's response that the Parliament <place-holder colnum=\"977\"/> would have access to the overall figure. However, an overall figure of that magnitude in isolation is not very meaningful. There are serious concerns that&#8212;when we talk about expenditure of the size and extent currently seconded to local authorities&#8212;the creation of this Parliament affects constitutional precedent.</p><p>Finally, Mr Wilson described the Scottish Executive as a conduit&#8212;I pronounce the word slightly differently, but that is a small matter. Mr Wilson was making an articulate and skilful attempt to justify an agenda of independence. Not surprisingly, he will find little support for that from these benches.</p>", "hdate": "1999-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13212181", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse much of what Mr Wilson said.

In fairness, the first signs were encouraging. Tony Blair said:<place-holder colnum=\"823\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would say that the new and right direction for Europe is investing in people, skills and technology rather than regulation and constant burdens on employers. For the first time, this signals a different direction, saying that we want to reduce costs and reduce burdens.\"</p><p>That was said by Mr Blair in 1997.</p><p>The story since then has not been quite so encouraging. We have had a series of directives: the minimum wage, the working time directive, the works council directive, the part-time workers directive and the parental leave directive. No matter how meritorious those are regarded as being in certain quarters, and no matter what virtues they may have&#8212;and, no doubt, they do have them&#8212;it must be understood that, for manufacturing and industry, directives of that nature are not good news.</p><p>In fairness, those regulations do not stem solely from Labour's decision to sign up to the European social chapter. The British Chambers of Commerce has observed that Labour has implemented more than 2,600 of its own regulations since May 1997, and that it has repealed only 20. I am not making a cheap point. All I am observing is that, if there is to be the vibrant sector that all of us here want, certain essential criteria must be in place and must apply. I could list a catalogue of other new burdens on business that have been introduced since May 1997, with which members would be familiar.</p><p>The Centre for Policy Studies has warned that Labour's new burdens could lead to as many as 800,000 job losses UK-wide. Some may scoff at that; some may consider it excessive; some may seek to dismiss it. I think that there has to be an element of substance in it.</p><p>What does our industrial garden make of all of that? Not a particularly positive interpretation. Only in February, the chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, Brian Prime, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Small firms are now being over-regulated to such a degree that it is too costly and too risky to employ staff\".</p><p>That concerns me. It strikes at the heart of being able to sustain the sort of sector that the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning has in mind. Mr Prime's views are supported by the Confederation of British Industry, which has called for a moratorium on new business burdens, such is its concern over current policies.</p><p>In short, I think that the gardener in this area has been found wanting. I would like to see the secateurs chopping through the red tape. Every bit of red tape which unfurls from a civil servant's desk sets off on a deadly mission which will end in the extermination, to a greater or lesser extent, of jobs.</p><p>What else can cause wither and blight to our manufacturing base? Taxation, obviously. Mr <place-holder colnum=\"824\"/> Sweeney has already alluded to this. What did our horticultural supremo have to say about taxation? I quote Mr Blair again:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I vow that the promises we make on tax, we will keep. This is my covenant with the British people. Judge me on it. The buck stops with me.\"</p><p>He said that in 1996.</p><p>That does not tie in with the words of today's motion; the reality is slightly different. Only in March, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Business today is more heavily taxed, more heavily regulated than we were two years ago.\"</p>", "hdate": "1999-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13211702", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Manufacturing and Industrial Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I observe that, in the creation of the circumstances that are congenial to a vibrant manufacturing and industrial sector, certain conditions must apply.

Significant taxes have been applied; significant new taxes are threatened.

The chilling factor was that it created 31 per cent of redundancies. To me, that is a factor that cannot be disregarded.

All that we-and the Scottish nationalist party-were saying was that it is not for us, or for ministers or advisers, to become judge and jury. If we wish to test a law, we must ask a court to undertake that task. That dramatically illustrates the relevance and significance of the role of Opposition. It is not for the Opposition to go around kowtowing, apologising and promising not to be unpleasant or nasty. It is for the Opposition rightly to consider any given situation, particularly one of the gravity of the Ruddle case, and to determine whether the Executive has fully, responsibly and openly discharged every obligation upon it and explored every avenue available to it. </p><p>In that respect, there is one question to which I, personally, have not received an answer. I listened with interest to Mr Wallace's remarks. In his preliminary observations, he said that there was \"no appeal, no interim interdict\". Did Mr Wallace receive advice that, within a judicial review application, it is competent to include a conclusion for interim suspension of a sheriff's interlocutor? </p><p>We in the Conservative party have made it clear that we support in principle this welcome attempt to plug the loophole, and we certainly support the motion that it should be treated as emergency legislation.

I notice that the bill proposes the adoption of the framework of the 1984 act, which means a <place-holder colnum=\"94\"/> continuance of the application to the sheriff court. However, we ask Lord Hardie whether it is possible to consider an application to the minister. We realise that that may fall foul of the European convention on human rights, but we suggest that, given the immediacy of a grave situation such as that created by the Ruddle case, control might be more immediately achieved if there were the possibility of the procedure consisting of a straight application to the minister, with the ultimate safeguard of appeal to the court in the event of the applicant being dissatisfied. </p><p>Quite rightly, reference has been made to the bill's attempts to include personality disorder as part of the definition. That is a further issue that requires careful consideration. </p><p>It is not clear from the bill whether the burden of proof proceeds on the balance of probability or on proving a case beyond reasonable doubt. That needs to be clarified and is a fundamental issue that must be determined. </p><p>The Conservative party supports the emergency legislation.

To propose, as the Government does, motorway toll taxes, city entry charges and employee parking taxes is a curious way of promoting skills, of promoting a stable and competitive environment for enterprise and of encouraging the growth of new business. That all comes on top of the already crushing weight of tax increases that the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has imposed by way of fuel taxes. As Scottish products have to be distributed over large distances, the increases in fuel taxes and the recently announced penalties for using Scotland's roads will further threaten the health of the Scottish economy. That seems to strike at the heart of the motion. The health warning is clear: Labour taxes will seriously damage job prospects. </p><p>It is extraordinary that the minister did not allude to the Manpower Employment Services report that was published this week. Its quarterly survey of employment prospects indicated that Scotland was unlikely to prosper as much as England. It seems that business is scared by the arsenal of stealth taxes that Scottish Labour intends to unleash on the Scottish business community. That relentless pounding will presumably intensify when Labour creates the minefield of permitting local councils to reintroduce a variable business rate. I applaud Mr Hamilton's contribution but, perhaps unlike him, I know the pain of such measures because I have been in small business. I am deeply concerned about the implications of the Government's proposals for that sector. </p><p>Labour is incapable of understanding the basic law of economics that taxes destroy business and kill jobs. Whenever the electorate are told about new or increased taxes, someone, somewhere, as sure as night follows day, is losing a job as a consequence. </p><p>I have not yet mentioned the crippling cost to Scottish business that has been created by Labour's high-value pound. I submit that our business sector is much more fragile than the tone <place-holder colnum=\"837\"/> of the motion would suggest. Any further taxes would badly affect the demand for products and services and could well push business over the edge, taking jobs with it. </p><p>In its motion, the Government has the temerity to mention skills. I share Mr Swinney's concerns about the new deal. Quite simply, I do not think that it is working; it might be better classed as no deal at all. A system that fails more than 60 per cent of its participants does not seem to me to be a good model for the reintegration of people who have been without jobs. The Labour party hypocritically trumpets loudly its stolen slogan, \"Scottish solutions for Scottish problems\". Why then did it mess up a good and improving series of skills development programmes that was made in Scotland, by Scots and for Scots, by forcing on Scotland an English programme-the new deal? As we now know, Scottish skills experts urged the Labour party not to do so. </p><p>Looking at this motion, I feel that this Government is no friend of Scottish business and enterprise; it may masquerade as such, but it is posturing. Deeds mean a lot more. Judged on its legislative programme, this Government is a \"spend\" Government. It is neglecting the enterprise base-the very base on which we rely to produce the generated taxation and Exchequer funding that we need before we can consider what we can spend within that allocation. </p><p>I oppose the motion and I welcome the amendment of my colleague Mr Davidson. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13208794", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I applaud the spirit of the motion, but I have to express some cynicism about its substance.

It would be an exaggeration to say that the people of Scotland talk of little else. </p><p>Mr Mackay will probably be relieved to hear that Conservative members are broadly in agreement with what he proposed, but I have been asked to flag up one or two specific concerns relating to the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Mr Swinney has already alluded to the concerns that I hold and to which I was alerted by the Law Society of Scotland. If I speak with conviction, it is that of the zealot of poacher turned gamekeeper. From a previous existence as a solicitor dealing with investment work, I know that no body could have been more rigorous, robust or harassing than the Law Society in its regulation of solicitor members. </p><p>That brings me to the more serious point that the bill apparently does not seek amendment to the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980, which is the primary legislation governing Scottish solicitors and regulates what solicitors handling investment business must do or should not do. There is grave concern that a dangerous duplication will arise: not only an unwelcome one for solicitor members in Scotland who may find themselves subject to two lots of administrative charges-which at first estimate will be hefty-but one which could cause confusion for consumers. That is distinctly undesirable. </p><p>There is a perception-and it may be worth investigating-that the Law Society of Scotland and its member solicitors would be content to remain with the existing adequate framework. In Scotland we have the unique virtue of an independent legal system and we have in place a satisfactory framework for the regulation of solicitors who handle investment business. Allowing a duplication to arise is an unnecessary complication and an unwelcome expense. </p><p>I hope that the minister will look carefully to see whether any steps can be taken to preserve the integrity of what already exists in Scotland and is in every respect admirable, to avoid bringing in any unnecessary confusion. </p><p>I also draw the minister's attention to some of the definitions in the proposed bill, specifically to the distinction between an investment and investment business. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty that should be defined in the <place-holder colnum=\"701\"/> primary legislation; it should not be left to the statutory instrument. Due regard should be given to that important point. </p><p>I referred in my general remarks on the possible confusion to the cost of regulation. The Law Society of Scotland has ascertained from the FSA that the likely cost to Scottish solicitor practitioners will be a minimum of &#163;1,000 for authorisation. That contrasts sharply with the existing charge of &#163;135 imposed by the Law Society. I gather that the FSA has accepted that it will be neither as efficient nor as economical as the Law Society in regulating the investment business of Scottish solicitors. The minister may wish to give significant attention to that. </p><p>On a matter of corporate governance, the Hampel committee on corporate governance confirmed the recommendation of the Cadbury committee that in principle the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should, for obvious and understandable reasons, be kept separate in every public company. It is logical that that principle should be extended to comparable positions in the FSA. That is in no sense meant to denigrate or diminish the stature of Mr Howard Davies, who has a fine reputation; it is meant to point out that a distinction should be drawn between those two very separate roles. The Conservatives welcome Mr Mackay's proposal, but we hope that regard will be given to the very real concerns of the legal system of Scotland and its practitioners. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13208279", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Devolved Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a little difficult to bring any sense of passion to this debate, with topics such as the Financial Services and Markets Bill, the electronic communications bill and the limited liability partnerships bill.

Until that investigation happens, I cannot see how MSPs can responsibly mandate the expenditure of significant sums of public money when they cannot justify why their decision is the best one. </p><p>By instinct, I am a protective soul, and while I shall draw short of accepting Mr Miralles's invitation to embrace the First Minister, I feel an obligation at least to look after him. Unless the <place-holder colnum=\"535\"/> investigation of the other options is made, there is a grave risk that the new Parliament will be identified as a product of self-interested, self-indulgent and profligate MSPs, and Dewar's folly will become a reality. In all seriousness, I think that that would be fair neither to him nor to the people of Scotland. His name should be associated with a Parliament that all of us can be proud of and can defend because we made the best decision based on all the information available, rather than a poor decision based on inadequate information. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13207797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holyrood Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Gorrie's amendment suggests a sensible and practical way forward.

As Mr McLetchie has indicated, there are areas of the programme which the Conservatives are prepared <place-holder colnum=\"432\"/> to endorse and to support, but the other parts cause concern. </p><p>I agree with some of the earlier comments about the determination of priorities and the consequent gaps in the programme. The First Minister, in his preliminary remarks, said that people ask when this Parliament will make a difference. He also said, in defining the Parliament's role, that we are here to keep promises. </p><p>One of the most alarming gaps in the programme relates to drugs abuse in Scotland. I endorse what Mr Gallie and Mrs Godman have already said, and I am grateful to Mrs Godman for an accurate outline of the extent of the problem. The Deputy First Minister, Mr Wallace, has some sympathy for the problem. During the election campaign, he and I met in connection with the problem of drugs abuse in Scotland. I think that he and I would agree that the people we met-the youngsters we encountered, and the people who work with addicts and victims-were a deserving and meritorious group. </p><p>If I heard one comment recurring throughout the election campaign, it was that drugs abuse in Scotland is one of the major issues that perplexes, worries and alarms people. I am concerned that there is a silence about that in the legislative programme. Another recurring theme that I heard-as did the Deputy First Minister-was that all those who are trying to work at grass-roots level with the horrendous consequences of addiction and abuse are apprehensive about the lack of coherence, cohesion and a definitive Scottish programme to deal with the problem. During the election campaign, the Conservatives submitted that the issue was one of beckoning opportunity for this Parliament. We can look at the problem, take it on board, and spearhead a Scottish initiative through a minister or a parliamentary committee. </p><p>It is regrettable that the coalition Government has been unable to produce anything of comfort to the people of Scotland. They are desperately and acutely aware of the problem and they seek urgent reassurance. I hope that, notwithstanding the silence on drugs abuse in the legislative programme, it might be possible for the Executive to devise a means of bringing this problem to the fore, and in so doing to reassure the people of Scotland that this Parliament is concerned not about minutiae or technical detail or other aspects of bureaucratic tedium, but about the profound issues that are ravaging the communities of our country. </p><p>I am equally alarmed about the omission from the programme regarding enterprise and business. It is a matter of concern that there is no specific encouragement for the business community. Mr Dewar said that he wanted to build an enterprise <place-holder colnum=\"433\"/> economy. As Nicola Sturgeon said about education, however, words may be one thing, but what are the substantive components of policy and legislative intent that will bring bricks and mortar to that proposal? </p><p>On the transport bill, there is silence on the need to address the desperate concerns of the business community about inadequate transport links. If one speaks to business communities in all parts of Scotland, one finds concern about congestion in a road structure that is unable to cope with the needs of business and commerce and concern that the ability of those areas to attract investment-inward or otherwise-is being deeply prejudiced. </p><p>I am concerned that apparently that is not perceived by the Government as a matter of any importance. What about reassurance on business rates? What about succour for the small business community? I come from that background, and I know that running a small business is a matter of daily, indeed hourly, challenge and preoccupation. </p><p>It would be helpful if the Government could reassure the business community that the matter of business rates has not been lost sight of, and if the Government could emphasise that it recognises the importance of preserving stability of business rates. If it does not, business communities in Scotland have real cause for concern. </p><p>In relation to training, the new deal-which I think we all acknowledge was Labour's English solution to a Scottish problem-has not been a success. It can hardly be classed as a success when more than 60 per cent of those involved do not end up in full-time jobs and when the cost of success is huge for those who do. </p><p>I am concerned that that problem has not been addressed. It is known to exist; one cannot speak to the business communities or the business agencies and not hear that there is deep concern about the efficacy and the workability of the new deal. I should have thought that this was an ideal opportunity for the Parliament, within the Government's legislative programme, to look at that and to determine a better structure for people in Scotland. </p><p>I, too, welcome the attention to the technical detail of feudal reform, which most people recognise is long overdue. However, it might not be universally recognised that there is a useful aspect of feudal law: the current relationship between what is technically known as the superior and the vassal allows the superior a preservation of amenity conditions, as well as private expense and immediacy of enforcement action. I am pleased that the Government acknowledges that and is prepared to try to support and retain it. That <place-holder colnum=\"434\"/> can be contrasted sharply with the lumbering enforcement procedures under planning law, which are carried out at public expense. </p><p>I hope that the Government, in framing the bill, will not throw the baby out with the bath water, but will preserve the best, the most workable and the meritorious aspects of feudal law. </p><p>I endorse what Mr McLetchie said about the national parks bill; there is a need to see clearly what the bill is about. It is easy to wave the words \"national parks\" around and imagine that it is a panacea for all the problems that have been identified in relation to the management of land and water in, for example, the Loch Lomond and Trossachs area. </p><p>One of the burning issues at Loch Lomond is the abuse of activity on the water extent, which has been going on for many years and is of deep concern to both riparian dwellers and visitors. I hope that in the phrasing and drafting of the bill, due regard will be given to the need for proper management of activity on the water surface. </p><p>As Mr McLetchie said, the Conservatives will gladly support aspects of the Government's programme. However, there are huge gaps, which are a matter of concern, and there are other areas where the greatest sensitivity and the exercise of manifest common sense will be required. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13207537", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This legislative programme seems to be rather like the curate's egg-good in parts.

Beside him and behind him are other lambs. The difference between the Conservative party and Mr Gorrie's party, the Liberal Democrats, is that we approach each issue with Scotland's best interests in mind, instead of soldering ourselves into some wee pact for the sake of self-interest. </p><p>I am principally concerned with the part of the Scotland Act 1998 (Modifications of Schedules 4 and 5) Order 1999 that refers to Short money. I am tempted to observe that facts are chiels that winna ding. The facts are very simple and should be obvious not only to this chamber, but to the people of Scotland beyond. Short money exists to allow Opposition parties to do their job effectively. The amount that is currently available at Westminster is &#163;10,000 per member, with a vote supplement. New Labour is halving that for the purposes of the Scottish Parliament. </p><p>These are the facts. Short money is not available to Governments. The Liberal Democrats, perceived by the Scottish people first as the smiling and latterly as the gloomy Judases of Scottish politics, are part of Government; if Mr Gorrie thinks that Mr McLetchie is vituperative, he should just wait. Mr Wallace said: </p><p>\"I am delighted that Nicol Stephen and Iain Smith have joined the Government team. Along with myself and Ross Finnie, this demonstrates again that the Scottish Liberal Democrats are right at the heart of this partnership government.\" </p><p>The Liberal Democrats propose to accept this Short money. If they do, they will take sitting on the fence-admittedly their legendary pastime-to new heights. If they aspire to being in government and opposition at the same time, they will not only have perfected the art of having their cake and eating it, but will find that the fence cuts through their collective political crotch, and the Scottish people will not forget their dishonour in their dismemberment. </p><p>In my opinion, the Liberal Democrats would do well not to touch a penny of the blood money. But if the Liberal Democrats reek of obsequious ambivalence, what about the ill-disguised <place-holder colnum=\"183\"/> arrogance of Labour? It is the party that heralded the launch of this new Parliament with the creation of a bloated, padded, opulent Administration, which is costing the taxpayer more than &#163;5 million. What an advertisement for a country that is characteristically associated with prudence and thrift. </p><p>Labour has single-handedly transmogrified the Scottish lion into a tartan fat cat. As its members feed themselves at the taxpayers' expense, the Opposition parties are to be put on a starvation diet. How convenient. </p><p>That is arrogance-but it is something more sinister: the Government does not want opposition. It does not want the Scottish National party and the Conservative party here asking questions. It does not want them opposing or testing what it is doing, or examining and, where necessary, exposing. Yet this is a Government that proclaims to have set up this Parliament for democracy. It is my submission that that is not democracy. Unless the Opposition parties in this chamber are to be treated fairly and with parity, we do not have democracy; we have suppression, repression and control. That is bad for this chamber, but even worse for Scotland. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13206982", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Devolution"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If I may respond to Mr Raffan, the trouble with his being a turncoat is that it makes it difficult for us to find him convincing, because we do not know where he will turn up next.
