We are pleased to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion and the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>A number of members in the chamber were present at last week&#8217;s meeting of the cross-party group on sport, which was ably chaired by Alison Johnstone. We heard some key speakers, including the minister, talk about legacy. It was an interesting meeting for all sorts of reasons&#8212;in fact, I think that there was a record turnout&#8212;but I shall focus on my own thoughts about what was said.</p><p>No one can doubt the extent of the challenge that we face in providing a meaningful and lasting legacy. I say that because I do not think that it is terribly easy to define the term, particularly in its qualitative sense. I was struck by an article in this month&#8217;s GTC magazine written by David Grevemberg, in which the author talks about seeing it</p><p>&#8220;as defining and connecting and giving people a sense of identity. It is ... about ambition, peace, prosperity and democracy&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, it is about some important aspirations and values that are not easy to measure. As Patricia Ferguson rightly said, it must include some aspects that can be quantitatively measured&#8212;for example, the increasing number, we hope, of people who participate in sport, the reduction in obesity totals, and how much additional money is raised. Those are all important aspects, but the legacy must be much more than that, and that is the tougher call. Indeed, I am not entirely sure that it is the politician&#8217;s job to dictate what it should be, but it is our job, which we must do in line with the other stakeholders, such as sportscotland, Glasgow 2014 and local authorities, to deliver the circumstances that will help communities to develop the more qualitative aspects of that legacy across Scotland.</p><p>What do I mean by that? For one thing, it is about improving wellbeing just as much as it is about improving welfare&#8212;we had a very interesting debate in the context of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill about whether it is possible to legislate for wellbeing, given that it has no accepted meaning in law&#8212;and, at the same time, we need to allow communities a sense of purpose, so that people feel better about themselves and can develop team spirit and an understanding of the crucial role provided by volunteers.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson mentioned the Universities Scotland and Colleges Scotland initiative, the game changer awards, which, I think, are funded by the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council. The awards provide new incentives for individuals and communities&#8212;in whatever way&#8212;to provide that added value in community life and, even if they cannot be measured by a politician, an economist or perhaps even the media, those incentives are important.</p><p>A legacy is therefore not just about improving the level of physical participation, physical education in schools, additional money or the bigger sports; rather, it must go deeper than that. The Scottish Government is absolutely right to identify the economic and social aspect of that in its motion and the Labour Party has raised the health aspect in its amendment, which is absolutely right and proper.</p><p>At the cross-party meeting, lots of interesting comments were made about what must still be done to achieve the legacy that we desire. I was struck by a number of things. First, sportscotland commented on the need for a more joined-up approach across the sector. It is clear that lots of good things are happening on the ground, but the fact that there is not always a co-ordinated approach can make life pretty tough in some areas. For example, there is a history of very poor data collection about what facilities exist, who runs which sports programme, who can access them and when and, in some local authorities, an inability to provide local people with sufficient relevant information. That seems to be changing, thanks to an extensive audit that has been undertaken by Audit Scotland and sportscotland, but I was struck by the statistic provided at the meeting that although 50 per cent of senior schools have really good sports facilities, many remain underused.</p><p>Comment was made about the problem of access or, in many cases, about the high prices that are charged to allow certain groups to use the facilities. That seems to be a particular problem in some of the poorer areas, which are exactly the areas that we need to target when it comes to increasing participation. On the same basis, it has been pointed out that some of the most successful sports clubs are those that have managed to turn aspects of their sports into family affairs and, although that might need a slight refocusing of attitudes, it is clearly something that we need to think about. Invited speakers made several comments that community remains a slight gap when it comes to successful organisation and they urged politicians to consider that when deliberating on policy with local authorities.</p><p>I was also struck by a second comment on the need for a modern, coherent digital strategy when it comes to the promotion of sport. The BBC and STV came in for a bit of criticism for their coverage of sport. Mention was made of the very high dependence on football, the fact that only 5 per cent of coverage is devoted to women&#8217;s sport, their failure to recognise that young people have turned away from both these channels in favour of other online programmes and the poor coverage of so-called minority sports, despite Scotland doing very well on the international stage in some of them. The minister was at the same meeting, so she may wish to reflect on the digital strategy for the future.</p><p>A key point is about schools and I will focus on that, not just because it is the theme of the Conservative amendment, but because nothing is more important when it comes to inspiring participation in sport than what happens at school. I was sad to hear the reflections at the meeting that made it abundantly clear that there is still a long way to go in some schools to ensure that all pupils have the right opportunities. I know that we have had a lengthy debate in the past about PE in schools, the two-hour commitment, the need for fully qualified PE teachers and how to ensure that more girls are enthusiastic about sport, but the issue is much more than that. Stewart Harris summed that up when he said that developing the right ethos in sport is so very much easier if it happens in school rather than in a club, after the young person has left school. He also drew our attention to team sport.</p><p>At the weekend, there was much discussion in The Sunday Times about the Office for Standards in Education south of the border and its alleged failing to support teaching methods that foster healthy competition among young pupils. I cannot comment on Ofsted&#8217;s activities, but I know that similar criticisms have been levelled at too many schools and, in some cases, local authorities, which, for one reason or another, have chosen not to promote competitive sport. Indeed, in some cases, they have campaigned against it because it was thought to be somehow divisive.</p><p>Having spent 40 years of my life actively involved in playing sports at different levels and coaching many youngsters from a variety of backgrounds, I am appalled when anyone says that competitive sport should be banned. I cannot think of anything more contrary to the spirit of young people or real life or that does more harm to the self-discipline of young people. It will clearly do great harm to our school communities and, possibly, some of our international development squads. Competitive sport must return to all schools. It should not be compulsory, but the offer must be there for everyone and be enshrined in the legacy of the Commonwealth games.</p><p>The Conservative Party is happy to support the Government motion and the Labour amendment. I move amendment S4M-08879.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and notes the comment from sportscotland that to maximise the impact of the Games, both in 2014 and in the decades ahead, competitive sport should have an important place in all schools&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for an encouraging and comprehensive update on where we are.

She is right&#8212;and for exactly the reasons that were set out by the convener of the Public Petitions Committee in his opening remarks. As other members have said, not only are there few subjects quite as distressing as this, but few are quite so hard to tackle, given the difficulties in uncovering the true extent of the problem.</p><p>Several members quite rightly highlighted that, thanks to the researchers from the University of Bedfordshire, we know that the extent of child sexual exploitation is extremely difficult to establish. They state that the problem &#8220;is not visible&#8221; and it has as much to do with the entirely understandable reluctance of the victims to come forward as it has to do with the hidden nature of the crimes and those who perpetrate them.</p><p>We know, too, from the very high-profile cases that there have been in Rochdale and Oxford just how sensitive this subject is within the public mood. That point was extremely well put by Jamie Hepburn and John Wilson, and by Graeme Pearson, who made a very thoughtful contribution. Given his experience in the police service, he brings a greater degree of understanding to this issue than perhaps the rest of us do.</p><p>All this matters because the problem can be addressed fully only if we understand its nature, prevalence and extent. We have a definition of child sexual exploitation in Scotland, but, as Anne McTaggart rightly said, there have been issues around it. The line between such crimes and other forms of abuse can be extremely thin. In truth, there is often a cyclical relationship between the two, which can add even more complexity.</p><p>As Jayne Baxter rightly said in her contribution, the study that was conducted by CELCIS into the sexual exploitation of looked-after children provided particularly important evidence, not least because it threw up the fact that those who are in that circumstance are particularly vulnerable, because they are often in the care system for the very reason that they have been abused or exploited.</p><p>Martin Henry of Stop It Now! Scotland has warned that</p><p>&#8220;it would be dangerous to separate child sexual exploitation too much from the wider childhood sexual abuse agenda.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 11 June 2013; c 1434.]</p><p>We have to take that comment seriously, although it adds that greater degree of complexity.</p><p>Given that, it is easy to appreciate where the ministerial working group was coming from. The problem is very real, but quite often unseen; it is distinct, but closely related to other crimes. As Jackson Carlaw said in another thought-provoking speech, the problem throws up a lot of the dilemmas that we face as parliamentarians. Notwithstanding that, the steps that have been taken are very much in the right direction and the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s report is hugely helpful, as are the deliberations of many in the voluntary sector, including the ever-helpful Barnardo&#8217;s. The Scottish Government and the ministerial working group have shown a real determination to address the issue head on and improve Scotland&#8217;s national child protection guidance. We have seen in both the drugs debate and the alcohol debate that we have to be bold and, in some cases, go into areas that perhaps would not always be the choosing of parliamentarians.</p><p>I did not sit through the committee&#8217;s deliberations first hand, but for me the committee report sends out some key messages. I will deal with a few of them. First, in this age of rapid online communication, more and more youngsters&#8212;even those from secure backgrounds&#8212;are in danger of falling victim to sexual exploitation, and clearly some groups are particularly vulnerable. Gil Paterson made a good point about where the responsibility for that lies. The area needs urgent attention and I do not pretend that I have any answers, but it is coming up the political agenda.</p><p>A second point, which was raised several times in the report, is the need to identify and help victims as quickly and efficiently as possible. We have seen lots of initiatives that have made that more possible, and I take on board the point that several members made about trying to draw that together into a coherent strategy. I fully accept what the minister is saying about the fact that we do not want another war of words or another review&#8212;it has to be about action.</p><p>However, we have some good experience on which to base our future policy. In February 2013, operation dash investigated CSE in the 12 local authorities of the then Strathclyde Police area and worked closely with Barnardo&#8217;s policy areas. It was helpful to identify the four categories that help inform us about the responses. We have seen interesting responses in Derby and Keighley in the south, which have also informed policy.</p><p>I share Neil Bibby&#8217;s and David Stewart&#8217;s concerns about the Aberlour situation in Glasgow. I am certain that Aberlour is keen to work with the Scottish Government to address the situation. The opportunity to have safe places means so much to children who need help and who need a situation in which they can feel totally secure. I hope that the minister will take up Aberlour&#8217;s offer.</p><p>My colleague Jackson Carlaw set out a third important issue of training and education, and argued that we should not forget parenting. We all have a responsibility to ensure that the information on which we drive forward policy is accurate and can be used coherently.</p><p>The debate has been very interesting and helpful, and I thank the Public Petitions Committee for its work.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In her capacity as chair of the ministerial working group on child sexual exploitation, Jackie Brock of Children in Scotland described the issue as &#8220;particularly complex&#8221;.

Although the Scotland-wide teenage pregnancy rate among the under 20s has shown some kind of decline&#8212;that is welcome&#8212;among the under 16s there is still a concerning increase. It is therefore a positive step forward to see the very specific work that is being undertaken to look at how carefully directed support can be provided to the most vulnerable mothers and what interventions can take place to support our youngest families.</p><p>The teen parent project, as David Torrance set out, has shown its positive value from its pilot days in Levenmouth in 2009 right up to the launch of the much more sizeable project in Kirkcaldy in partnership with the YWCA.</p><p>I note from the updated briefing document that Fife Gingerbread provided to MSPs that somewhere in the region of 340 parents have received support through one-to-one work, with targeted work focusing on increasing access to other services as well as on developing parental skills, confidence and self-esteem. Fife Gingerbread estimates that the project has had a very positive impact on well over 300 children.</p><p>The project outcomes are to be warmly welcomed and it is good to see that as a result of the projects, 96 per cent of referrals resulted in the family accessing further support for children&#8212;as well as the focus on helping to improve levels of physical, intellectual, emotional and social development in children.</p><p>Early intervention is something that we have discussed at great length in this place&#8212;indeed, the deliberations of this morning&#8217;s Education and Culture Committee are evidence of the extensive focus on these issues&#8212;and although members might come at some of the issues from slightly different angles, there is general agreement around the chamber about just how important that focus is. That is another reason why I would like to add my congratulations to Fife Gingerbread.</p><p>Family nurses visit expectant mothers and it is obviously important that those visits are very regular. Family nurses have a great deal to contribute to not only the child&#8217;s development and care but many of the preventative measures that we expect, as well as helping with the development of parenting skills and with better diet, education and employment in later years.</p><p>That programme aims to enable young, first-time mothers to develop their confidence in all those areas, in particular with regard to the parenting angle, and again, although we have slight differences of opinion across the chamber, I think that everybody accepts that there is general cross-party agreement on the importance of that.</p><p>As regards the issue of young mothers, often children themselves, accessing services, I know that Fife Gingerbread has become rather specialist in the facility that it provides. An awful lot of the other groups around the county can not only gain the confidence to do something similar to that facility but see the real and lasting benefits that Fife Gingerbread has managed to achieve.</p><p>The minister is, I am sure, very sympathetic to this cause and I hope that in closing she will be able to outline some of the things that the Scottish Government has taken on board from the recent report and how we can push that agenda forward.</p><p>I add my very strong congratulations to the group and to David Torrance.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22825495", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Annabelle Ewing has just reminded us that it is less than a year since we celebrated the 25th anniversary of Fife Gingerbread.

Very good progress has been made in some such areas, but we need to do more to ensure that those who come from a very rural background have good access to facilities and can take part in as much sport as is possible.</p><p>I said in my response to the minister back in October that I thought that we could do more to help build bridges between the private sector and the state sector. There are some excellent initiatives in state schools and in private schools, many of which have excellent sporting facilities. It is important that we try to use those facilities as much as we possibly can, to the benefit of all children. We should consider the point that Patricia Ferguson just made about scholarships, whether in the name of Nelson Mandela or other international and sporting figures, because a person&#8217;s parents&#8217; income or where they come from should not determine whether their options for school sport are available or closed off. I welcome the suggestion that was made.</p><p>There is a need to ensure that there is a good coherent strategy between central Government and local government. This morning, the Education and Culture Committee heard loud and clear from a group of outdoor education specialists that they are concerned that there is not a coherent strategy and that there is a bit of a disconnect between central Government and local government. I noticed that that was mentioned in the strategy, but perhaps we need to think a bit more about how the Scottish Government can create a better system in that regard.</p><p>As somebody who over time has held various sports coaching qualifications, I am acutely aware of the input that is provided by volunteers. If it were not for those volunteers, far fewer children would have the benefit of sport. We have done a lot to increase the number of volunteers, but we have to be mindful of the fact that there are still concerns, particularly in some sports, that people cannot volunteer because of the bureaucracy that goes with it.

As a result of the travel situation she has had to head back to the Highlands for a constituency event rather earlier than she was anticipating, so I pass on her apologies to the Presiding Officer and to members in the chamber.</p><p>The extent of the challenge that faces the Parliament&#8212;and most especially the Education and Culture Committee&#8212;has never really been in doubt. In the past few years, during the most recent inquiry and the previous one, it has been patently clear that the Scottish care system is letting down far too many young people. In preparing the report we heard time and again from charities and third sector organisations and, most important, from young people in the care system, that most&#8212;though by no means all&#8212;of the concern centres on the decision-making process.</p><p>Before I turn to the report and to the Government&#8217;s response, I acknowledge the very real frustration, which stretches well beyond Holyrood, at the length of time that it is taking to meaningfully address the issue of looked-after children. All parties in the chamber have shared a common commitment to making the Scottish care system as effective as possible, and yet for all the goodwill and endeavour we seem to find ourselves back at first principles time and again. We have been very good at the diagnostic process, but much less good at finding a cure.</p><p>For instance, when the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration published its 2011 report there was real hope that progress would follow very soon after. However, two-and-a-half years on, we are still very much stuck with the same problems. Indeed, the minister indicated in her response to the committee&#8217;s report that the Scottish Government is aware of that situation and intends to review the care and permanence plan, with a revised strategy due early in the new year, which is good to hear. We all recognise the huge sensitivities that are involved in the issue, but we need to ensure that changes are well-balanced and properly implemented. Likewise, I think that we all feel a little guilty that the pace of reform has been too slow.</p><p>During our deliberations we have all been considering why we have made so little progress, given the extent of the good will that I mentioned. There has been considerable cross-party support, and the issue has been placed further up the political agenda, for which I give the Scottish Government credit.</p><p>Have we been missing some key points, or failing to listen to the right people? Perhaps the most uncomfortable question of all is whether we are relatively powerless when it comes to dealing with some situations. There might be a little bit of that&#8212;certainly that is what we were bluntly told by two of the witness panels&#8212;but the lack of progress is also due to the weaknesses inherent in some of the data that has been essential in uncovering the problems in the decision-making process. It has also resulted from poor transparency, although that was not intentional.</p><p>That said, there is no weakness or lack of transparency when it comes to the blunt statistics that define the problem. Some of them are truly shocking. Although 56 per cent of school leavers overall gain five or more qualifications, only 4.7 per cent of children who are looked after away from home and 0.5 per cent of children who are looked after at home can expect the same degree of attainment. That is not a small disparity but a gaping chasm that reflects very poorly on us all.</p><p>Moreover, while 87.5 per cent of school leavers are engaged in work, education or training, only half of those who are looked after at home are doing the same. We are really not doing them any justice whatsoever by not enabling them to acquire the relevant skills to participate in a modern workforce, and that has lifelong implications.</p><p>During our most recent inquiry we heard troubling evidence from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children that, in Glasgow, two thirds of children who have left care to return home end up back in the system within a year. Oscillating between pillar and post, those youngsters are at serious risk of being left behind completely.</p><p>We have been good at the diagnosis, but what is the cure? There is no doubt that much of it will have to focus on the decision-making process, because it is clear that, as many of the witnesses told us, too many barriers remain in the way of good decision making. Those barriers mean that too many children are being left in unsuitable home environments. Decision making is inconsistent and variable across the country; the system does not use resources sufficiently well; and some groups find it far too difficult to have the courage of their convictions and remove a child&#8212;I can well understand why.</p><p>In response, perhaps the key recommendation is on early permanence: the idea that, by intervening earlier, children are removed from an unstable home environment and given the foundation that they need to grow and prosper. A consensus is emerging that, together, early intervention and early permanence can deliver much better outcomes for children, families and communities. The whole package, if I can call it that, is important.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I put on record apologies from my colleague Mary Scanlon, who was due to participate in the debate.

That is a slightly different issue from funding.</p><p>We are rightly celebrating the centenary of the Medical Research Council, which has made such extraordinary provision throughout the UK, including in Scotland&#8217;s universities and teaching hospitals. Over its life, the Medical Research Council has supported no fewer than 29 Nobel prize winners and has ensured that many of our Scottish institutions have been at the cutting edge of scientific and technological developments.</p><p>The Haldane principle, which has underpinned the funding arrangements since 1918, has ensured that while remaining a publicly funded body the council can operates at arm&#8217;s length from the Government, so that scientific decisions can be made on an independent basis and according to criteria that will reap the biggest returns from medical research that is directed at improving health outcomes. That principle has formed the basis for the council&#8217;s current strategic direction, which comprises four aspects: identifying the research that delivers the best return; ensuring that more people can access the benefits of research; helping the UK to compete globally; and providing the best support to individual scientists.</p><p>What happens in medical research not only has major implications for the ability of our universities, hospitals and related centres to attract top-class students and staff. It also has direct effects on the local economy&#8212;and on the national economy&#8212;and the creation of jobs. Universities in all their guises contribute &#163;6.3&#160;billion to the economy and somewhere in the region of 142,000 jobs. A very high percentage of that relates to medicine and related sciences&#8212;probably somewhere in the region of &#163;96&#160;million.</p><p>The fact that Scotland has been able to punch so well above her weight in receiving funding from the research councils tells its own story. Over the past few years, on average Scotland has received around 13 per cent of research funding, despite the fact that it has around 8.5 per cent of the UK&#8217;s population. For medical research funding, the figure has been closer to 17 per cent. That represents a significant sum of money, but it is also a sign of the distinguished reputation that Scotland enjoys, especially for medical research.</p><p>For 100 years, Scotland has been richly rewarded for pioneering research that has been done in the name of outstanding medical scientists, including Professor Sir David Lane, and for being in the forefront of institutional developments, such as the &#163;10&#160;million new facility at Glasgow&#8217;s Southern general hospital, where we are leading the fight against diabetes, rheumatology and cardiovascular disease. That strength comes from the large and highly integrated UK research base, which has afforded sizeable economies of scale and the opportunity for collaboration across international boundaries.</p><p>Following today&#8217;s publication of the Scottish Government&#8217;s white paper, the people of Scotland will need to study the facts on both sides of the debate on a host of issues, of which university research funding is just one. Will an independent Scotland or the UK better safeguard the future of Scotland&#8217;s university research investment and provide the greatest success for bodies such as the MRC?</p><p>Last week, Professor Wolf, the director of medical research at the University of Dundee, threw doubt on an independent Scotland, but other academics say that perhaps things would be better in an independent Scotland. The public have to make a judgment on that&#8212;that is what the debate is all about. I urge the Government to think carefully about the implications for the actual source of funding. The issue is not just about collaboration and scientific investigation; it is also about funding. We have to listen carefully to what academics are saying about where the money will come from.</p><p>It is important that we celebrate 100 years of the Medical Research Council, which has done a fantastic job.

Given the better outcomes for young people that have been achieved by those service providers that have engaged in that greater collaboration and integrated approach, that is a reasoned approach for the bill, and it is an approach for which there is clear cross-party support.</p><p>Too many young people are losing out&#8212;whether they are children with foster families or kinship families, young carers, children with long-term illnesses who are unable to go to school, or children who cannot access the full entitlement for nursery provision.</p><p>On that last subject, I welcome the opening that the Minister for Children and Young People gave us to discuss the matter further. The issue about when the child&#8217;s birthday falls is different from the issue about the monetary provision. We will wish to pursue that matter at stage 2.</p><p>The Parliament knows that we have serious concerns about certain parts of the bill. In some cases, those concerns are substantive. In others, they are administrative and resourcing issues. Sometimes, it is a matter of drafting.</p><p>The legal profession rightly asks politicians to be mindful of what constitutes good law: whether proposals are clear, coherent, effective and accessible and therefore easily understood. Throughout the bill&#8217;s early progress, we have examined the proposals against those criteria and questioned whether new legislation or a change in culture and attitude is required, or perhaps a mixture of both.</p><p>For the most part, the Scottish Government has decided on a legislative route, so I will deal first with some substantive concerns in that respect. First, there has been a move to legislate with primary regard to the child&#8217;s wellbeing rather than to their welfare, which is a term that underpins most of the existing legislation. I well understand why there is a certain attraction in that, as it is generally assumed that wellbeing has a deeper and much more holistic meaning that might bring some added qualitative value. However, it has exposed the tension between the theory and the practice. Although I think we can all agree that wellbeing is a good thing, it is exceedingly difficult to define, notwithstanding the SHANARRI&#8212;safe, healthy, achieving, nurtured, active, respected, responsible and included&#8212;indicators and their subdivisions, which have been operating in some local authorities. The bill is not entirely clear about the definition of wellbeing and it is too often conflated with welfare.

They have all made the point that a universal provision for a named person clearly undermines the role of some parents, and the family and communities, and instead places professionals in the front line of responsibility for the child.</p><p>When that is taken together with the proposed extent of data sharing and the extension of powers to the children&#8217;s commissioner&#8212;and, in some cases, to Scottish Government ministers&#8212;in a way that Kenneth Norrie described as &#8220;open ended&#8221;, it makes the bill a bit too statist in its approach for our liking.

I remember, from when I was a very young child, visits to my parents by one of my mother&#8217;s best friends, who was an international opera singer. She was Dundee born and bred, and I remember the occasion on which she told my mother, with great sadness, that she would&#8212;very reluctantly&#8212;be moving away from Dundee. That was the advice that her musical colleagues had given her because, in those days, Dundee did not do culture.</p><p>How different she would find things today, in a Dundee that is vibrant with cultural development in theatre, art, dance and music, and in which there is extensive regeneration of industry and commerce. She would see the huge success stories of the universities of Dundee, Abertay and St Andrews, and the hinterland of the Tayside college sector, which have allowed the area to build such a strong international reputation and to play a leading role in the education of young people and in raising their aspirations.</p><p>It was, of course, in the 1970s&#8212;as has been mentioned&#8212;that tough times hit the city very hard, especially with the decline of the jute industry. Dundee struggled to compete with the other Scottish cities and became only too well known for its social and economic problems, rather than for anything else.</p><p>It was at that time that the RRS Discovery&#8212;which Jenny Marra mentioned&#8212;was very nearly sent to the breaker&#8217;s yard, but for the intervention of the Maritime Trust. Just like the city, the ship had enjoyed a glorious past, especially when it was the focal point for the British expeditions to Antarctica, including the first successful expedition of Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. It had been used by the Hudson Bay Company and in the 1914 to 1918 war effort, and it carried supplies to the White Russians in 1917. However, as the ship became increasingly outclassed by other merchant ships, her future&#8212;and that of the city&#8212;became very uncertain. Now, of course, there has been a complete transformation, and Discovery has won numerous awards for its museum and visitor centre, and is very much on the international map. The phrase, &#8220;One city, many discoveries&#8221; is very well chosen and will, I hope, act as a good-luck charm next week when the all-important decision is made.</p><p>What have been the reasons for Dundee&#8217;s resurgence? On top of the significant developments that took place some 30 to 40 years ago, such as the building of Ninewells hospital and the Wellgate shopping centre, and the return of the RRS Discovery, there has been the inspiration that has allowed Dundee to lead the international field in biomedical research and in the gaming industry, and in constructing the extraordinary &#163;45&#160;million V&amp;amp;A waterfront development that the cabinet secretary mentioned.</p><p>There are many who say that Dundee&#8217;s resurgence is down to the sheer resilience of its people and its ability to rise to new challenges, which make a difference. Undoubtedly, its recent economic diversity, rather than its depending on a few industries, has been a large part of Dundee&#8217;s success. If we look to cities such as Liverpool, which was the 2009 European city of culture, we see that diversity is one of the necessary ingredients for development. With that development and economic regeneration comes a new-found confidence and the inspiration for bringing about social regeneration through the celebration of our culture. We should not underestimate the effect that that can have.</p><p>The bid team has decided to combine the celebration of the river and the Dundee environment with a celebration of the rich diversity of its people, and it is focusing on how that unique combination can shed light on the pathway for future generations. I find that to be one of the most powerful aspects of the bid, and I am pleased to see that within that celebration there are commitments to young people, to raising attainment across the city, and to the people in underrepresented communities who so often lose out. As the bid team has said clearly, it is</p><p>&#8220;Your City, Your Culture, Your Year&#8221;,</p><p>whoever you may be.</p><p>Success in such competitions depends so much on good preparation, as we found out when Perth was seeking city status. I am sure that the bids from Leicester, Swansea and Hull will make for a very tough opposition, but I think that we can be confident that the Dundee bid is well prepared and makes a passionate claim for Dundee&#8217;s recognition as the 2017 UK city of culture.

On that basis, we are happy to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion.</p><p>In doing so, however, we want to dig a little deeper into the main reasons behind the publication of what is becoming a national play strategy, and the issues that arise from them. First, there is a sizeable number of people&#8212;whether they speak as individuals or as groups&#8212;who consider that the existing situation does not provide adequately for children&#8217;s needs. Secondly, there is concern that the play strategies in local councils&#8212;or in most of them, at least&#8212;are not working well enough when it comes to providing for all those children.</p><p>It is important that we consider those contexts, as well as the central mantra of the Scottish Government, which dictates that Scotland must be the best place in the world in which to grow up.</p><p>I said that I thought there were two main reasons behind the calls for change: too many individuals and groups have anxieties about existing practice; and there are concerns over the ability of councils to make effective provision. As a result, there are demands for greater statutory provision. I can understand that, but, as ever, when there are demands for greater statutory provision, there is the threat of an accompanying cost and potential bureaucracy. Perhaps even more challenging, there is a need to be crystal clear when it comes to the definitions.</p><p>I raise that point because there is an interesting and complex debate taking place just now with regard to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill on whether the all-important issue is the child&#8217;s &#8220;wellbeing&#8221; as opposed to their &#8220;welfare&#8221;. That debate has thrown up philosophical tensions between theory and practice. I think that all of us would view &#8220;wellbeing&#8221; as having a deeper and more holistic meaning, and yet its definition&#8212;most especially in law&#8212;is much less clear than the definition of &#8220;welfare&#8221; in existing legislation.</p><p>Following on from that, there is a concern that the more one tries to make statutory provision for an outcome where the meaning is open to several interpretations, the more difficult the territory becomes for those who are providing the service. In his intervention, Ken Macintosh made a very good point about the use of words and how we interpret legislation.</p><p>The minister herself said that the strategy attaches a very wide definition to the term &#8220;play&#8221;. She said that play can be</p><p>&#8220;active, passive, solitary, independent, assisted, social, exploratory, educational or just fun.&#8221;</p><p>That view is absolutely right, and I have no problem with it. However, if we are going to encounter difficulties regarding that very broad definition, we must be a little cautious about taking things a bit too far down the road of statutory requirements.</p><p>There is a balance to be sought to ensure that no-one&#8217;s rights are undermined while allowing the necessary&#8212;indeed, the traditional&#8212;notion of freedom of expression in play. The legal technicalities of the debate, which at times threaten to tax the minds of all the members of the Education and Culture Committee, are serious, and&#8212;almost ironically&#8212;they are not simple child&#8217;s play.</p><p>The issue is partly about understanding why the Scottish Government has decided to adopt a national play strategy as opposed to concentrating on encouraging better guidelines to be implemented in local authorities. I know that the minister will say that they are complementary&#8212;of course they are&#8212;but I am interested to know why the balance has to be more on the strategy side rather than on feeding the local authorities with better opportunities.</p><p>I do not think that there can be any argument at all that this comes back to the fact that too many people are uncomfortable with the status quo. I presume that that is why the Government decided on a national strategy That point has been made by the substantial number of groups that have lobbied heavily in this area and, obviously, it is important that we listen to their views.</p><p>The concerns of parents are absolutely paramount. It is hard to deny that those concerns have been growing in recent years, especially when it comes to the pressures on play areas in many local communities and the pressures on local authorities, which may not always see play as a priority when it comes to the very tough budget decisions that they have to take. A sizeable number of communities are concerned about the lack of suitable play facilities and, in some cases, the lack of facilities that are fully safe.</p><p>The Scottish Government has gone to great lengths to set out a list of the main objectives and has provided us with some guidance as to the likely timeframe for each, which is helpful. I note that &#163;90,000 has been set aside; an awful lot of working groups have been suggested, and I will watch with interest how they all come together. However, some of the work that the Scottish Government says still needs to be done is already partly established.</p><p>I provide just one example of that in relation to recommendation 7.5, which says that there should be an audit of</p><p>&#8220;current levels of community access to school grounds&#8221;</p><p>and community campuses and how well used they are. Such an audit is absolutely the right thing to do. I flag up the fact that at the meeting earlier this week of the cross-party group on sport, Patricia Horton of sportscotland gave us a pretty comprehensive presentation&#8212;a copy of which I have with me&#8212;on just how far sportscotland has got already in undertaking that audit. Sportscotland has provided very useful information about the inventory of the school estate as it is now&#8212;the inventory has been updated&#8212;and how the school estate is currently being used. The priority is to ensure that when local councils review the matter, they turn their attention to the qualitative impact of the use of those facilities. That important study is well under way, and the Government needs to pay some attention to it.</p><p>On the same theme, given that the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment is to a strategy that goes up to the age of 18, we need to be much more focused about how we can cater better for the sports and leisure interests of our older children, especially those whose school is in the older part of the school estate, where playing fields or leisure facilities may be slightly further removed and off site.</p><p>At the meeting of the cross-party group on sport, we also had an interesting presentation from the Scottish Futures Trust about better planning&#8212;the minister referred to this in her speech&#8212;for community schools, playgroups, nurseries, open spaces for young children and so on. We were provided with a very interesting set of slides on community campuses where a much more attractive environment has been laid out and which now work better. The responses from parents and from people who work on those campuses have generally been very positive.</p><p>However, in my opinion, there is a very substantial issue about the accessibility of some of the bigger sports complexes. That issue is especially pertinent when it comes to older children. It was reported to us that some facilities seek fees that are well beyond affordability for some groups, which is having a detrimental effect. I know dealing with that is not the Scottish Government&#8217;s responsibility, but we have to be mindful of the issue when it comes to planning.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I doubt that anybody will quibble with the central ethos of the play strategy that we are debating this afternoon, as it goes without saying that play is part of the general wellbeing of each child and is essential to the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of the nation at large&#8212;as it has been throughout time.

I say at the outset that the Scottish Conservatives are very conscious indeed of the likely financial and construction implications of such a project. They are significant, but so too are the substantial costs of not upgrading one of the main rail arteries in the United Kingdom, never mind in Scotland.</p><p>The direct rail route from Edinburgh to Perth via Dunfermline, Kinross and Glenfarg was closed in 1970 to make way for the M90 motorway. At the time, many saw that as a short-sighted decision because it meant that inter-city rail travellers would face journey times that were significantly longer than the road alternative, and longer than comparable inter-city routes elsewhere. Originally, most of the Edinburgh to Perth and Inverness trains were diverted via Stirling, but now most run via Ladybank. That situation has seen rail travel become increasingly uncompetitive with road, and left the rail journey from Edinburgh to Perth slower than it was 100 years ago.</p><p>The AA&#8217;s route planner estimates a car journey time of just 59 minutes, compared to a 2013 rail average of 1 hour 22 minutes. It does not compare favourably with similar routes. For example, Swansea to Cardiff by rail, which is an identical distance, takes less than one hour and a similar journey on the continent, such as that between Ghent and Brussels, takes just 30 minutes.</p><p>It has been estimated that the reinstatement of a direct link would reduce journey times from Edinburgh to Perth and onward journeys to Inverness and Aberdeen by up to 35 minutes. The re-opening of a direct line would not only allow the creation of a key hub on the inter-city network at Perth and its iconic station, it would also provide the opportunity for the creation of new stations to better serve the kingdom of Fife and Perthshire and Kinross-shire, where there is to be very considerable population growth. Indeed, it was partly for that reason that Transport Scotland in 2009 included the possible construction of a railway link between Inverkeithing and Halbeath as one of the 29 transport projects and programmes identified in its strategic transport projects review.</p><p>The history surrounding the closure of the line is well documented. However, like the recent success of re-opened lines such as the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link and the soon to be reopened Borders rail link, a direct link to Perth would provide many benefits for modern Scottish infrastructure.</p><p>Since I was elected as an MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife in 2007, the reopening of a direct line has been raised with me many times. On the back of a number of local surveys&#8212;the most recent one has attracted hundreds of supporters&#8212;I approached Transform Scotland and the Scottish Government to ask for a new feasibility study to weigh up the costs and benefits. I am conscious that I lack the technical and engineering expertise that is required to examine in detail what might be built and where, but I am extremely grateful to the Transform Scotland consultants who have advised on certain key issues. Their deliberations were based upon the very detailed discussions that they had with Transport Scotland civil servants, and the pressing need, they believe, to develop more scope and ambition within the strategic transport review.</p><p>It is not as though the Scottish Government has not considered the issue. When the Minister for Transport and Veterans was the Scottish National Party candidate in Ochil, he was a keen supporter of the reopening of Kinross station. Within the 2009 strategic transport projects review, the Scottish Government undertook to look at the possibility of building a new railway between Inverkeithing and Bridge of Earn. At the time, the Government concluded that the cost was too great, but clearly the demographic, social and economic profile of the region has continued to change, and Transform Scotland points out that the 2009 review did not properly analyse the benefits of an electrified railway, assess the merits of a new railway from Halbeath to Bridge of Earn, which would allow Dunfermline to benefit from the project, evaluate the full benefits of the park-and-ride station at Kinross, which now serves a much wider catchment, or undertake sufficient analysis of the benefits to Dundee, Aberdeen and the north-east, as well as the potential better connectivity to Inverness.</p><p>I mentioned that there has been very considerable public support for this project for a number of years, including from many businesses who are firm in their belief in the potential economic boost from improved connectivity. Perthshire Chamber of Commerce has consistently put on the record its support for the proposal, arguing that it could be one of the single biggest benefits to the local economy. The areas of Scotland that will have the fastest-growing populations over the next three decades include Perthshire, Kinross-shire and Fife. Indeed, the population in Perthshire is predicted to increase by 27 per cent over the next 20 years. Meanwhile, the commuter influence on Edinburgh continues to grow at a fast rate, especially among those who work on the western edges around the Gyle and who are very likely indeed to make maximum use of train transport.</p><p>Notwithstanding that there will be a new Forth crossing, there are already pressures on roads from increasing car and HGV traffic, and some major businesses in central Scotland have raised concerns that a relatively weak inter-city rail network hampers on-going freight journeys. That is not good and it goes against the commitment that the First Minister gave in The Herald in August 2008 when he said, rightly, that</p><p>&#8220;railways must at least compete with roads.&#8221;</p><p>He was adamant then that top-quality rail transport links were essential to a modern Scotland that will also deliver on its green credentials.</p><p>As Scotland&#8217;s newest city, Perth is very much looking to the future to secure new investment and re-establish its historic place at the centre of Scottish trading routes. I understand that the minister might, indeed, be considering the possibility of a new feasibility study to establish the true costs and benefits of a new route. I hope that such a study can be as comprehensive as possible when it comes to overall strategic transport planning and that it would specifically examine the possible effects of the electrification of a new direct line from Inverkeithing to Perth, the benefits of shorter journey times and the possible economic and social benefits to the north-east and the Highlands.</p><p>The Scottish Government has a good record of looking at new rail developments in the central belt, but I would argue strongly, particularly given the very strong public support that we have received and the technical expertise provided by Transform Scotland, that a new feasibility study is the best way forward to establish what I believe would be a very strong outcome that would prove that the benefits would considerably outweigh the costs, for not just Mid Scotland and Fife, but the rest of Scotland.</p><p>I thank members for their support in signing the motion and I thank you again, Presiding Officer, for affording me the time to address the motion.

For us, there has been a significant movement towards change, a lot of the credit for which goes to people whom the cabinet secretary has asked to produce reports, including Keir Bloomer, Graham Donaldson and David Cameron. They have been very thought provoking about the need for subtle changes in Scottish education, and I understand that COSLA is also looking to embrace some of that change. I remember distinctly SNP Councillor David Berry in East Lothian saying in 2009 that the Scottish Government ought to do &#8220;some pretty unconventional things&#8221; when it comes to changing the structure of school education. Those are ideas in which we are very interested.</p><p>The minister mentioned the interest that we can arouse among other countries. The systems that attract the Scottish Conservatives are those in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and New Zealand, not just because of the statistics but because of some of the differences that they have managed to make. In Germany, 8.1 per cent of economically active 15 to 24-year-olds are currently unemployed, which is the lowest level in the European Union; in Denmark the figure is 14 per cent; and in Switzerland it is 9.2 per cent.

I also thank Patricia Ferguson for her kind remarks about our late colleague, David McLetchie. The last time that I saw David before his death, we talked a great deal about 2014, and it was clear to me that the most important event of that year for him was the Ryder cup. I was only on the golf course once with him, and it was obvious not only that he was a very fine golfer but that he played with the same commitment, enthusiasm and good humour that he had always shown in politics. I am sure that David McLetchie would have been keen on this debate, and I know for a fact that he would have probably been there for the whole week of the Ryder cup next summer.</p><p>I am one of few members of this Parliament who live just 7 or 8 miles from the 18th hole at Gleneagles. Along with those colleagues, I have witnessed the growing excitement at the fact that Strathearn and Perthshire will be holding such a world-class golf tournament&#8212;indeed, it is one of the world&#8217;s most elite sporting events and draws attention from all around the world. It is the first time in more than 40 years that this prestigious tournament will be in Scotland. Given the intense competition that there is among many other nations to host the event, it is likely that it will be some time before it happens again in Scotland, so, for most of us, it is quite simply a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p><p>I want to touch on three aspects of our holding the Ryder cup, all of which, obviously, have particular relevance to people in Perth and Kinross. The first concerns the logistics of the event. I was one of the people who attended a local community briefing on Thursday in Auchterarder&#8212;in the same community centre that the minister was in on Tuesday. That meeting was with the Ryder cup management team, and I have to say that I was very impressed by the work that is already under way to plan for the event&#8212;safety being paramount, as the minister rightly says.</p><p>Obviously, Strathearn is used to hosting such high-profile events, whether on the grander scale, such as the G8 conference, or on the scale of the Johnnie Walker golf tournament. However, even with that experience behind it, there are significant challenges.</p><p>The forward planning has been extremely impressive, and I welcome the steps that are being taken to communicate fully with local residents about what is happening. Nevertheless, there are some tricky issues with regard to changes to things such as the local road network. In some cases, the arrangements will be different from the arrangements that were in place for previous events, and there are therefore challenges with regard to access to businesses and vital services, as well as the usual challenges around crowd control.</p><p>As the Ryder cup management team said, we should never underestimate the logistical challenges of such an event. We must be mindful of the fact that a large section of the population will not be particularly keen on having the Ryder cup. I happen to disagree with them, but there is a group in the population who do not see it as the most important thing that could happen in their area. It is, therefore, important to keep all local residents at the heart of the planning.</p><p>The second issue is the economic benefit of hosting the tournament. The primary reason for golf tourists to come here is that Scotland is the home of golf, but we should not underestimate the number who come as a result of business and related sporting interests, many of whom will go much further afield than Strathearn. There is an excellent opportunity to increase the &#163;220 million a year that comes from the sport.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism launched the first national strategy for golf tourism, &#8220;Driving Forward Together&#8221;, which aims to capitalise on the staging of the Ryder cup and the open championship to confirm Scotland as the world&#8217;s leading golf destination. That strategy, like other growth strategies, has been developed to build on the strong foundations of activity by the industry&#8217;s governing bodies and the public sector. The hope is that, as a result of the strategy&#8217;s implementation, the &#163;220 million that currently comes to the Scottish economy will rise to somewhere in the region of &#163;300 million by 2020.</p><p>Scotland is already competing well internationally according to the league tables, if I can call them that, of golf tourism hotspots for the future. There is reason to believe that the strategy can make a big difference to the tourism industry but, alongside that, concrete steps need to be taken. As we see from other Government strategies&#8212;I put no political colours on this&#8212;it is often difficult to live up to the targets that are set, particularly over a longer period of time.</p><p>We know that 2012 was a challenging year for Scotland&#8217;s tourism, and not just because of the appalling summer weather that we had. However, 2013 has produced much more optimism, which can only be good. People are in a more optimistic mood about what we can deliver, and that will be relevant when it comes to attracting a wider group of people to the Ryder cup. I was intrigued by the statistics that show that groups such as the Germans and the French are starting to return to Scotland, as those tourist groups had previously been in a bit of a decline. That is healthy news for the Ryder cup.</p><p>The opportunity to host the Ryder cup, which will be viewed by millions of people around the world, provides one of the best advertising opportunities that we could hope to have&#8212;far better than anything else&#8212;but, as the minister said, that needs to be articulated with the Commonwealth games strategy and strategies that are designed to assist business development for small and medium-sized businesses, which have had a much more difficult time of it. Some of the initiatives are first class, but we must ensure that that assistance is delivered in the longer term.</p><p>The third issue, which is important although much less well defined, is the potential sporting legacy of the Ryder cup. That is hinted at by Patricia Ferguson in the Labour amendment, which we are happy to support alongside the Government&#8217;s motion.</p><p>Two years ago, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;Encouraging the next generation of golfers is crucial. Club golf gives thousands of children in Scotland the chance to play golf, putting a club in the hands of every nine-year-old in the country and creating the possibility of golfing success at the highest levels.&#8221;</p><p>The First Minister was absolutely right about that, but let us not be in any doubt about the fact that golf is an expensive sport and is not the easiest sport to attract youngsters to play. We should take a lesson from the &#8220;Scottish Golf Strategy&#8221;, which was put together by the Scottish Golf Union and the Scottish Ladies&#8217; Golfing Association. Their analysis makes it clear that golf has suffered a lot from declining club membership. Lots of golf clubs around Scotland are not doing particularly well. When we talk about bringing youngsters into golf, we must be conscious of the fact that although they can be supported by club golf, they can face substantial fees when they go into adult golf. I entirely agree with Patricia Ferguson that this is about people not just tasting different sports, but trying to have a longer affiliation with a sport that can provide a longer-lasting benefit.</p><p>As the minister mentioned, she attended the launch of the Auchterarder primary school Ryder cup initiative earlier in the week. I entirely agree with her that the school and the children there have been absolutely superb in what they have achieved, and Perth and Kinross Council has done much to help with that.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives warmly welcomed the &#163;2 million of investment in Scotland&#8217;s junior golf programme, so it was good to see on Tuesday&#8212;and in the press since then&#8212;that children can become involved in golf in different ways beyond just playing the game. In trying to attract more youngsters to the sport and increase the percentage involved in school golf, we need to accept that not many schools actually have a golf section, so it will be up to the clubs to make this work. There is a message there about the numbers who can be involved and about the potential cost.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the minister&#8217;s remarks and her announcement.

I also think that he would have been faintly amused by some of the comments, not least by members&#8217; frank admissions&#8212;and, in some cases, boasts&#8212;about their golfing prowess.</p><p>Members were absolutely right about David&#8217;s passion for golf. He also had a passion for cricket, which members will know is the game that is my primary passion. I once took David to a cricket dinner at which the famous Gary Sobers was the main speaker. The latter&#8212;rather unbelievably, I have to say&#8212;spent at least 20 minutes describing the six balls that he hit for six runs in the same over. On that occasion, he took some questions from members of the audience, one of whom was a certain David McLetchie. I was struck then by the extraordinarily encyclopaedic knowledge that David had of sport. I thought that Tavish Scott was going to share his encyclopaedic knowledge of all the golf holes round which he followed Tom Watson in 2009.</p><p>At that dinner, David McLetchie showed a great knowledge not only of sport but of the spirit that Graeme Dey talked about in what I thought was an extremely well-prepared speech about the values that emanate from the game. I compliment him on that speech, because I think that he said something very special about the intrinsic value of the Ryder cup.</p><p>It has been an extremely wide-ranging debate, which is a good thing. By that, I mean that, as well as providing facts, it has had entertainment value. That is good, because it tells us what it is about Scotland hosting the Ryder cup that captures the imagination&#8212;although I have to say, from reading the newspapers, that the issue that is most likely to capture the public&#8217;s imagination is who is picked for the European team. Speculation is intense about who those people will be.</p><p>We have heard a lot about the potential for economic and tourism development. We all hope that the hosting of the tournament will bring about a significant increase in the number of golf tourists who visit Scotland, not just in 2014 but in the years to come. The figure of 250,000, which is the number of visitors who are expected to attend the week-long event, has caused quite a sharp intake of breath in many parts of Strathearn, Perthshire and Kinross-shire, and I know for a fact that the hotels, bed and breakfasts and holiday rentals there are already very close to capacity for that week. Some extremely imaginative projects are being discussed with the business community in and around the area, and the schools and community groups have joined in that discussion. That is all good news.</p><p>As has been mentioned, over the years many Governments have announced strategies with great expectations of increasing visitor numbers, only to be a little disappointed by the growth years later. However, I commend the Scottish Government and the minister for all the work that is being done, because this is no easy challenge. We all have a part to play in ensuring that the Ryder cup is one of the best things that Scotland has ever hosted.</p><p>Members have mentioned what a magnificent venue Gleneagles will be. It already has a first-class reputation for hosting major golfing events and many world conferences, and I am sure that the Ryder cup will be another feather in its cap as such a venue.</p><p>The Ryder cup management team says that it is taking additional steps to ensure that the transport that is laid on from the park and rides takes routes that show visitors some of the best scenery in Scotland. There could hardly be a better invitation to come to Gleneagles.</p><p>Annabelle Ewing said that the new website that Perth and Kinross Council has launched to provide in-depth information to residents, visitors and local businesses is an important part of the information process. I am glad that the council is looking to refine that website as it gets feedback from the community. The way in which the Ryder cup management team has interacted with that is a strongly optimistic point.</p><p>Such information will be crucial in the coming months because, whether we like it or not, some residents and businesses in the surrounding area will still feel a little anxious about what the Ryder cup will mean for them on a daily basis. Every effort is being made to reassure them.</p><p>The legacy that is hardest to define is the sporting legacy. I mentioned that it is difficult to ensure that that legacy stays for a longer period. We should not just bring in youngsters to experience golf for a few days; we must have something that has lasting permanence.</p><p>It might be interesting for the minister to look at initiatives that colleges, universities and private schools in Scotland have taken; they have done a lot to offer new golf scholarships in their communities. We talk about philanthropists and the private sector, and it would be nice for such scholarships to be offered to state schools, because it is inevitable that there will be far more children in state schools who would want to take advantage of them. If we thought about building golf scholarships, we might have more success in providing a legacy that lasts for years to come.</p><p>There is no getting away from the fact that it is difficult for some golf clubs just now to afford to have a high membership of young people, who are not in a position to pay high fees. It would therefore be good if we looked at other areas for the extra-curricular commitment.</p><p>Positive work is being undertaken by the Scottish Government and&#8212;I hope&#8212;by all of us through the part that we have to play. It is great for golf fans, Scotland and Perthshire that Scotland is hosting the Ryder cup and it is great for the Parliament to be part of that exciting challenge, which I hope will bring us everything that we want and which the nation deserves.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members for their kind words about our colleague David McLetchie, which he would have been touched by.

His case was perhaps one of the most brutal examples of how society can fail our most vulnerable children. Some will argue that the case was at the most extreme end of the scale, but it is by no means the only one in which our youngest and most vulnerable children have been exposed to appalling neglect. Quite properly, there should be a national debate about how to protect our most vulnerable children.</p><p>For some time, the Scottish Conservatives have thought long and hard about what our reaction should be to that challenge. More recently, we have been reflecting on those issues in the context of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>As we made clear in an earlier debate, we agree with some of the stated intentions of the bill and some of its proposals. In particular, we agree that we should do more to increase a collaborative approach towards the care of children to ensure that children&#8217;s services are delivered more effectively and with much better qualitative outcomes. We whole-heartedly agree with plans to extend childcare, making it easier for parents to get back into work and easing the financial pressures on hard-pressed families. We also whole-heartedly agree with providing greater backing for young carers and kinship carers, many of whom do tremendous work with very little support.</p><p>Very specifically, however, we have examined the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill against the criteria that define good law. Is this piece of legislation necessary, is it clear, coherent and effective, and is it accessible and therefore clearly understood? We contend that, in its current form, the bill fails on several counts. As well as that, though, the minister knows that we have fundamental concerns about the unmistakably statist philosophy that underpins the named person policy&#8212;a view that we believe is shared by some important stakeholders, including the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, which says in its latest newsletter:</p><p>&#8220;Our worry is that giving every child a named person is at best a waste of time and money and at worst could lead to unwelcome interference in family life.&#8221;</p><p>That view is shared by CARE and several key figures in the legal community. It is on that basis that we have chosen to debate the named person policy this afternoon, after which we hope that the Scottish Government will undertake an urgent review of its proposal.</p><p>I shall deal first with our substantive objections to a named person for every child aged zero to 18. The rights of children do not stand in isolation. They should be seen in the context of the rights of parents and families and the responsibilities of those families, which must articulate with the needs of all the individuals within those families.</p><p>In our view, those are basic principles; indeed they are the principles that are meant to underpin so much of the thinking that is behind policies for children and young people, and they are the principles that underpin European legislation in this sphere. In the interpretation of the bill, though, there is a danger that the balance could swing heavily behind the state rather than behind the parent.</p><p>The Faculty of Advocates says that section 19(5)</p><p>&#8220;dilutes the legal role of parents, whether or not there is any difficulty in the way that parents are fulfilling their statutory responsibilities.&#8221;</p><p>We share that concern.</p><p>Also in a legal context, Professor Norrie has made clear that the bill in its current state allows ministers to have more powers which, he says, are open-ended and, in his view, not well defined. While he acknowledged that some of those concerns might be a matter of semantics for the bill team, other aspects were not and they opened up the prospect of more state intervention. Again, that is something that the Conservative Party is not comfortable with.</p><p>For example, the bill defines a child as a young person up to the age of 18, which is not only contrary to other pieces of Scottish and United Kingdom legislation but involves complications. If young people can marry at 16 or fight for their country from 16, that surely raises questions about the appropriateness of a named person in that context. Indeed, we heard yesterday at the Education and Culture Committee from Bill Alexander of Highland Council, who, incidentally, is a strong supporter of the principle of the named person, that it is totally impractical in some of the older age groups and is not wanted.</p><p>In our view, implicit in the proposal for a named person for every child is the insistence that it is the state rather than parents and families that has the primary obligation to look after the child. That is entirely the wrong way round.

We have frequently been asked about how the named person will be chosen, and specifically whether the parents or child or both would have any input into that; what happens when relations break down between the named person and the family; what will be the relationship between the named person and a lead professional; and whether there really will be a single point of contact. There are also concerns about data sharing, particularly what is meant by the stipulation that information should be shared if it &#8220;might be relevant&#8221; to a child&#8217;s wellbeing and if it &#8220;ought to be provided&#8221;. What do those phrases mean? The law officers have made it very clear that such wording is open-ended, and it is simply not acceptable.</p><p>The Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill contains some excellent policy commitments, including those that seek to address pressing issues with regard to childcare, care leavers and kinship carers but, taken in its entirety, it is designed to take an unacceptable degree of responsibility away from many parents and families.</p><p>We fundamentally disagree with that, as, indeed, do some powerful voices to which I have referred in my opening remarks. We therefore want the Scottish Government to review its approach to the bill, specifically to ensure that the limited resources are targeted at the most vulnerable and that responsibility is placed in the right hands. In particular, we want the Scottish Government to review the policy on named persons, which is the issue that has already aroused the greatest controversy and concern. Expecting all children to have a named person in the terms stated in the bill is an assault on the responsibility of families and parents for whose children there are no real problems. It is unnecessary and an undesirable intrusion of the state and, just as important, it threatens to take away resources from the most vulnerable.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals to introduce a named person for all children and young people up to age 18; agrees with those groups that believe that, for many families, the named person would undermine the role of parents, and agrees with the many stakeholders who have expressed concerns about the extensive costs and bureaucracy of the policy and the likely implications of diverting limited resources away from the most vulnerable children.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697561", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Named Persons)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not accept that.

In particular, we agree that we should do much more to increase a collaborative approach and ensure that children&#8217;s services are delivered more effectively, with better qualitative measures. We whole-heartedly agree with the plans to extend childcare, which will make it easier for parents to get back into work and will ease the financial pressures on hard-working families. We also whole-heartedly agree with the plans to provide greater backing for young carers and kinship carers, many of whom do tremendous work, at times with very little support.</p><p>The Parliament has made clear many times, on a cross-party basis, that it recognises the focus that needs to be put on such key areas, and compelling evidence on the need for additional focus on the early years has been submitted to several committees of the Parliament.</p><p>That said, there is much in the bill about which we have fundamental concerns.

That is something with which we fundamentally disagree, as do some very powerful voices, who expressed concern during the summer recess and who have submitted responses to the committee.</p><p>We therefore want the Scottish Government to review its approach to the bill and specifically to ensure that limited resources are targeted at the most vulnerable children and that responsibility is placed in the right hands, in families and among professionals, and not in the hands of Government.</p><p>In particular, we want the Scottish Government to review its policy on named persons, which has aroused the greatest controversy and concern.

He was an all-round genius because he understood the world&#8217;s interconnections in their most complex detail. He was a true renaissance man. He might even have been the first proponent of the curriculum for excellence. Who knows?</p><p>Probably the most attractive aspect of Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s life was his ever-present quest for knowledge and for a deeper understanding of the human behaviours and emotions that go with it. Learning would never end and would constantly be enriched. Not for him was contentment with teaching according to the principles of orthodoxy; closed minds were not inquiring minds.</p><p>When the young people from Dalbeattie high school fly off to Italy in October they will face an unusual and rigorous challenge, which will test their skills to the limit. The da Vinci decathlon began in 2005 as an exciting offshoot of the successful da Vinci programme for gifted and talented students at Knox grammar school in Sydney. The challenge, which is designed to test and celebrate the higher-level academic gifts in a competitive environment, is of course run in the true spirit of the Olympic decathlon&#8212;the competition that is the ultimate test for athletes across many disciplines. It is a test of skill, resilience, mental and physical stamina and, of course, character.</p><p>The success of the da Vinci decathlon in Australia has been hugely impressive and it has clearly caught the imagination of the young people in Australia, as well as their parents and, I understand, many businesses. For them, the competition has proved to be such a success because of the rounded approach to learning that it brings to challenge young people.</p><p>As a member of the Education and Culture Committee of this Parliament, I am acutely aware of the constant refrain from employers in this country that we must do more to equip young people with the skills that cross several boundaries and disciplines, most especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, which have become known as the STEM subjects. We need many more Scottish pupils to look to future careers in engineering and the sciences. The da Vinci challenge promotes exactly the sort of subjects that we need to encourage more enthusiastically.</p><p>One of the strong characteristics of the tradition of Scottish inventors is the appreciation that to understand engineering, one needs to understand how many other subjects interconnect with it. That is something that da Vinci would have appreciated very much. Some would argue that there are very good reasons for making engineering a compulsory subject; I can see the logic in that.</p><p>In the past few years there has been a very pleasing increase in the number of schools that are making a determined effort to develop slightly different extracurricular activities. I know from my time as a teacher the benefits that such activities bring, especially if they are that little bit different and most especially if they involve a trip abroad.</p><p>The Dalbeattie high school pupils and teachers are to be very warmly congratulated on their initiative and on their fundraising efforts, which Alex Fergusson has described. They have clearly put in a power of work on that and it is a great honour for them to be not just the only Scottish school but the only one from Europe taking part.

Board membership is crucial to the good workings of our colleges, but we strongly believe that it must reflect the diversity of the college sector, bringing to it a variety of experience and skills rather than being too prescriptive.</p><p>On amendment 36, we are of the strong opinion that colleges work best when there is clear collaboration between the different institutions and when there is similar collaboration between the different institutions, the Scottish funding council and the Scottish Government. That collaboration can be effective only if there is mutual trust between the different partners&#8212;I use the word &#8220;partner&#8221; advisedly&#8212;and when the professional relationships are built on consultation. Too often in this bill, the Scottish Government has sought to impose its will on colleges in a way that undermines that mutual trust.</p><p>Amendment 36 therefore requires the Scottish ministers to consult the existing board fully, prior to making any transfer or new appointment of board members&#8212;which will obviously be part of the transitional arrangements for new boards.

The Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions, the reasons behind the bill and&#8212;more important&#8212;the evidence for why it was necessary should have been clear. Parliamentarians should have been left in no doubt at all about what the bill was designed to do, and there ought to have been a very clear signal from colleges and universities that they were receptive to the proposed changes.</p><p>There ought also to have been a very clear message that the Scottish Government, the colleges and universities and the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council were largely in agreement that the bill was capable of delivering the policies that will best deliver excellence in our institutions, maintain and increase their international reputation, and respond to the economic and social needs of local economies.</p><p>From day 1, none of that has been clear. Despite the Scottish Government&#8217;s protestations that new legislation is essential, many people in the sector did not share that view; indeed, colleges and universities struggled to see the powerful evidence that would prove that case. What was it that they were not doing properly in respect of their current structures, that could not be achieved by outcome agreements or, fundamentally, that was holding back education?</p><p>I repeat what I said at stage 1. The Scottish Conservatives had some sympathy with the principles of the bill, especially the desire to widen access, but as time passed and after lengthy and tortuous committee examinations of a large amount of evidence, we increasingly came to the view that the bill was both unnecessary and open to all kinds of unintended consequences that could be detrimental to both sectors.</p><p>Apart from the presentational problems that created the need for unnecessarily complex deliberations at stage 2, major policy issues are involved. I want to look at those issues in the context of the increasingly competitive international situation for our universities and the need for an increasingly diverse and competitive college sector that is best able to serve the needs of local economies.</p><p>The good governance that exists is not in doubt; I do not believe that it ever was. If there had been compelling evidence that there were serious examples of bad governance and that they were harming education and holding back our institutions, a case might have been made for legislation. The policy memorandum did not explain any problems, and Professor von Prondzynski was at pains to say that he thought that the existing structures were &#8220;largely excellent&#8221;. That rather begged the question why the Scottish Government was so intent on such an unnecessary overhaul.</p><p>I fully respect the views of NUS Scotland and the University and College Union, and I looked carefully at the claims that they made, many of which were in the context of social justice, but I could find little in their arguments that suggested that the operations of our colleges and universities were, in fact, damaging education.</p><p>The focus on widening access should not be in our colleges and universities, although they are important; the fundamental focus should be in our schools, because if we were doing things a little bit better in them, we would not need to have any kind of positive discrimination in favour of any groups of students.</p><p>On autonomy in the sector, we should look around the world&#8212;it does not really matter where. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank and the Shanghai university tables make it plain that success is greatest in the nations in which Governments are less rather than more involved. In Finland in 2010, the state was removed from universities because it was stifling autonomy and holding back research and development, innovation and knowledge exchange.</p><p>To sum up&#8212;I will return to this issue at the end of the debate&#8212;I cannot see compelling evidence that makes the bill necessary.

However, that legislation allowed colleges to increase their flexibility and respond better to the needs of their local area. I find it difficult to see why the cabinet secretary thinks that the 1992 legislation has been so detrimental. Indeed, it is often thrown up by many of the colleges as something that has given them extra autonomy and flexibility.</p><p>I repeat that the Scottish Conservatives are firmly in favour of widening access, but we have a grave difference of opinion with the Scottish Government about where that focus should be. We believe that the focus should be on schools. I noticed two weeks ago that Ferdinand von Prondzynski said that we should be starting in nursery schools when it comes to widening access, and I entirely agree with that. We would not be in this situation if we were able to ensure that everyone in schools had a much fairer choice in terms of success. Raising aspirations is crucial, particularly in schools in which there has not been a tradition of going to college or university, and that is where the policy focus should be.

They argued strongly that geology is a subject that brings together so many different aspects of scientific inquiry, and one which could hardly be more important when it comes to the future of earth sciences and the Scottish economy. Indeed, I felt that their case was persuasive.</p><p>Despite the fact that I am firmly wedded to the social sciences, I cannot stress enough the intrinsic educational value that the study of science brings to our students throughout our schools, colleges and universities.

However, it is also abundantly clear that we need to do much more to encourage a greater uptake of the STEM subjects&#8212;particularly by women, as members on the Labour benches have pointed out&#8212;and to ensure that there is a greater understanding of how those subjects can be applied in modern industry and commerce.</p><p>Science encapsulates what is around us as human beings as well as what is around the planet. The growing breadth of its inquiry, thanks largely to the application of increasingly sophisticated technology, is in great demand and is both exciting and creative. With greater diversity required in the energy industries, the debates about climate change, rapid changes in communications and transport and the significant challenges within the health industry, there is no end to the need for well-trained scientists and engineers.</p><p>Dr Robin Wallace, head of the institute for energy systems at the University of Edinburgh, has spoken about collaboration and about how it is so crucial. He says:</p><p>&#8220;in addition to advances made in wave and tidal energy at Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Robert Gordon Universities, researchers at the University of St Andrews have made exciting new breakthroughs in energy storage&#8221;.</p><p>He talks about the collaboration when it comes to</p><p>&#8220;developing new types of lithium batteries&#8221;,</p><p>which he is of the opinion will</p><p>&#8220;have a major impact on the future ... of scientific application.&#8221;</p><p>There is similar success at the University of Dundee. According to the latest Thomson scientific rankings, it has achieved the greatest impact in molecular biology and genetics and in biology and biochemistry of all UK universities. That is a significant achievement.</p><p>Those are just two areas that will significantly enhance Scotland&#8217;s prospects for the future and we must do everything that we can to ensure that those institutions can recruit top-quality science students and staff. Our colleges and universities, as well as our industries, play a crucial part in developing the groundbreaking ideas that are so essential to Scotland&#8217;s economic growth.</p><p>Likewise, we all know that the future success of an increasing number of companies in Scotland is underpinned by scientific knowledge and its practical application. Electronics has become a vibrant and dynamic industry, significantly contributing to meeting the changing needs of other industries such as automobiles and defence. Seventy per cent of Scotland&#8217;s exports come from the science, engineering and technology-related sectors and yet the oil and gas industries have expressed their concerns about skills shortages, and a recent OPITO survey of companies in Aberdeen identified finding talent and skills shortages as the number one challenge to their future competitiveness. That is an important warning.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s science centres and festivals play a crucial role in making science more accessible to all age groups and for that reason we are happy to support the Government&#8217;s motion. Nonetheless, we believe that we need to enhance that attraction and do more to ensure that there is a stronger and more diverse science qualifications network that will meet the academic needs of pupils and students right across Scotland. It is about not just boosting the profile of science within the curriculum but ensuring that we make it as easy as possible for students to gain qualifications and work experience in the related industries.</p><p>To return to the question of geology, it is a subject that ought to lead to a wide variety of degree options and professional training for graduates for a range of industries, many of which are critical to Scotland&#8217;s long-term plans&#8212;particularly in the fields of oil and gas, mining and renewables. Job prospects and graduate employment for those students are high, with above-average salaries, yet very disappointingly SQA is looking to discontinue the geology higher in 2015. That decision is based&#8212;probably not surprisingly&#8212;on the very low numbers of SQA candidates in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>The argument is that attention should be focused elsewhere, on the subjects where there is much greater demand. However, we should be very careful about how we make such assessments&#8212;a point that was put to us by Ruth Robinson of the University of St Andrews last Thursday. She has made plain her view that the low uptake is driven by the very low numbers of teachers supporting the subject. Remarkably, no new teachers have been trained since 1985. That statistic is deeply worrying, particularly given the growing scope for earth sciences within the curriculum for excellence and the number of pupils who would like to do the subject if only they could be given the chance.</p><p>If we dig a bit deeper, we find that 13,000 from just over 100 schools have been involved in the geobus outreach programme that is run by St Andrews university. That is much more akin to the ratios that we would expect if we look at Wales, Northern Ireland and England, or at some European countries, such as Norway.</p><p>One pupil made the interesting point that there is hardly a more interesting and exciting country for geology than Scotland, so he rightly posed the question of why our uptake is so poor. If there are latent reserves in our mineral ores, there is also latent talent in our pupils, and it would be a great pity if they could not be allowed to develop those talents just because there is insufficient support for staff who want to teach the subject. I hope that the SQA might be persuaded to review its decision.</p><p>I conclude by noting that science is hugely important to us all. It is encouraging to see a growth in the number of conferences and festivals showcasing the best in Scottish scientific achievement, but that in itself will not be enough to deliver for pupils whose futures will be in the science industries. Those pupils and their teachers need to know that the curriculum for excellence will provide opportunities that are supported in the same way as other subjects are.

Although the youth unemployment rates in Scotland and in the UK as a whole have not reached the exceptionally high levels reached in some parts of Europe, they remain too high. Notwithstanding what I think we should see as encouraging signs in the most recent statistics, the unemployment level for young people aged 16 to 25 is twice as high as that for the rest of the working population.</p><p>If we are to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s economy is stronger in the future, there is an onus on us all not only to help boost the jobs market, but to better equip our young people with the skills and training that they and their employers need. We need to ensure that those skills are more flexible, and to tackle the problem of large numbers of our young people not being in any form of employment or training because they became disengaged from education. Mr Macintosh gave us a sharp reminder of the fact that we have the highest proportion of disengaged groups of any of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries&#8212;the figure has increased significantly in the past decade.</p><p>Figures from the Scottish Government&#8217;s own youth unemployment strategy show that failing to move our young people into stable employment can cost the economy up to &#163;2 billion, so we welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to creating 25,000 apprenticeship places. We also welcome the discussions with the UK Government and the European initiative. I think that we must complement such work rather than work against it, and in that respect we need to bring together all Governments, whether in Scotland, Westminster or Brussels.</p><p>If our young people are to gain employment, they must first be employable. That still presents significant challenges, not least because the skills that the workforce of tomorrow will need are hard to predict with any certainty. We need to accept that the job market is much more fluid these days and that applicants require a host of transferable skills if they are to be wholly successful. We know that employers too often express considerable concern about the significant numbers of our school leavers and, indeed, graduates who do not possess the right skills to adapt to the workplace. Therefore, last week it was encouraging to see that problem being confronted by Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which will soon offer a work-ready qualification. Although I am sure that some will argue, with some justification, that that should not be necessary, anything that can help to place more focus on the problem is to be warmly welcomed.

We have to treat that issue very seriously.</p><p>Also raised at today&#8217;s cross-party group meeting was the issue that the onus of finding a work placement very much falls on the individual, rather than provision being made by schools, colleges and universities. Some wonderful initiatives were discussed at the cross-party group. If there are models that breed success, with youngsters not only finding a suitable placement but being able to find a regular job after it, we must consider them seriously.</p><p>Unquestionably, schools are the institutions that lay the foundations for work experience. Foremost is the need for good standards of literacy and numeracy, which are too often absent in too many youngsters. By no means does that apply to all&#8212;far from it&#8212;but, for too many, there is a problem. Scotland is not performing nearly well enough, and I make the case again that the curriculum for excellence&#8212;for which there is firm support&#8212;can only be part of the process.</p><p>We need to ensure that curriculum for excellence is complemented by greater rigour in the basic skills, particularly in primary school. Those two things do not work against each other&#8212;they are complementary. There is a strong message for us all, which has increasingly been coming through from colleges and universities: in too many cases, the basic skills are lacking, and we need to do something about that. It is incumbent on us all to ensure that we put forward positive policy suggestions as to how we make things work. The Scottish Conservatives put that point firmly on record.</p><p>Colleges and universities are playing their role, but they will be constrained if we cannot send them more articulate pupils.

The logic, therefore, is that policy must focus on the earliest years&#8212;which incidentally is a point increasingly being made in the policy calls from the college and university sectors&#8212;and that greater attention must be paid to improving outcomes at that stage.</p><p>It makes sense that one important means of doing just that is to improve the provision of pre-school care for our youngest children. I use the word &#8220;improve&#8221; advisedly, because there is an important debate to be had about the qualitative aspects of care as well as its availability. It is not good enough just to increase the numbers of children receiving that care; we must ensure that certain standards are upheld, which is why I think that there are benefits to having a childcare commission that can draw on many professionals&#8217; expertise.</p><p>There has also been consensus in the Parliament that, in recent years, parents have often struggled to get access to sufficiently flexible and affordable childcare, with Scottish families paying some of the highest costs in the country. Indeed, the price of childcare has soared by an average of &#163;600 since 2005. I think that we are all aware of significant disparities across the country, with some local authorities in Scotland charging twice as much as others for care.</p><p>It is also quite clear that many parents feel that the current system of childcare provision is too inflexible and often fails to take into consideration parents&#8217; busy work schedules. Of course, that point applies in particular to older children, but I stress that we must be very careful indeed to balance that with the child&#8217;s social and educational interests. We must ensure that an extended system is able to combine both interests without compromising either.</p><p>For example, although allowing them to take up their entitlement during times outwith those presently on offer might be convenient for working parents, it might be less beneficial to the child&#8217;s educational and social development. That is a significant problem for families throughout Scotland.</p><p>A report from Children in Scotland entitled &#8220;The Scottish Childcare Lottery&#8221; showed that a fifth of local authorities say that they do not have enough childcare available for working parents and that only one in 10 councils has enough provision for those who work outside normal hours. We need to balance that with listening to teachers&#8217; concerns about how best to plan the curriculum for the youngest children if we are truly to ensure that childcare gives the positive benefit that we know that it can bring.

Whether we look at the Leveson report or the evidence that was taken by the Education and Culture Committee in this Parliament, or listen to the Westminster and Scottish Governments or the press industry itself, it is clear that it has been hard to find a majority opinion on several of the key issues, especially those that relate to where we should go from here.</p><p>In some ways that is not surprising, since the central issue at stake is how we balance the principle of a free press&#8212;which is rightly seen as a fundamental requirement of a democratic country&#8212;with the rights of individuals and the protection of victims. That is never an easy balance, but it is exactly the challenge that we face, and we have an obligation to all interested parties to get it right.</p><p>It is helpful to start where there is some general agreement. First, the public at large want something to happen to improve the responsibility of journalists on some&#8212;but by no means all&#8212;aspects of press reporting and to increase the transparency of decision making. The public clearly feel that in some circumstances there are significant problems: that the press is not sufficiently accountable; that, when breaches of the ethics code are uncovered, the apologies are often half-hearted and not given sufficient prominence in the paper; and that it is too easy for clandestine deals to be done. Some&#8212;including Lord McCluskey himself&#8212;feel that the press even believes that it is above the law, which is not a view that others share.</p><p>Secondly, there is general agreement on the need for balance and a workable solution&#8212;as the cabinet secretary has outlined&#8212;that supports the integrity of the vast majority of journalists but punishes those who do not respect the privacy of individuals in a responsible manner or who flout the law.</p><p>There is an understanding that whatever we decide on must respect the subtle but nonetheless important distinction between a breach of law and a breach of ethics, which is a distinction that has been debated for thousands of years. A virtuous person is someone who is naturally disposed to behave in the right way, for the right reasons, and who can do that by voluntary action rather than by force. I think that we would all much prefer that, but the key question in this debate&#8212;whether the major players believe that an improved voluntary code of ethics is sufficient&#8212;remains. So far, the debate is firmly trapped between those who say yes and those who say no, but it is further complicated by the differences between two legal systems and by the mixed messages from politicians.</p><p>Finally, in setting out the main direction of the debate, the key issue of accountability arises. That is linked closely with the independence of the process, hence the desire in the press industry&#8212;and indeed in other quarters&#8212;for politicians to be removed from the process. That was a concern of the Scottish Conservatives with regard to the McCluskey report&#8217;s recommendation that the appointment of the chair of the Scottish recognition panel should be left to ministers.</p><p>Likewise, when it comes to the royal charter, we can well understand why there is concern about the lack of consultation with the Westminster and Holyrood Parliaments, which has meant that the result is too hasty and is perceived to be too close to the interests of a small band of senior politicians rather than being open to the scrutiny of the parliamentary process. The last thing that we want is a royal charter, albeit adapted for Scotland, that is seen to be based on vested interests.</p><p>Those are the key issues that the Scottish Conservatives believe must be answered, but the million dollar question, of course, is what do we do?</p><p>As everyone knows, the press is already subject to many other laws&#8212;the Contempt of Court Act 1981, the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Bribery Act 2010, and so on&#8212;and we all need to ask ourselves whether we need another law, some other form of regulation, or a beefed-up code of ethics. For example, we now know that the Surrey police knew that Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone had been hacked but they did not do the right thing. If action has to be taken, we need to be wholly sure that it will do something that is not already covered by the law. Several key witnesses who came before the Education and Culture Committee said that the existing laws had not been used effectively, and that that is part of the problem.</p><p>Obviously, that has implications for discussion of the Scottish dimension. Several witnesses pointed to the fact that many of the problems that brought about the Leveson inquiry in the first place were very much London based. That does not deal satisfactorily with the Watson case in Scotland, in which wrongs were clearly committed; Patricia Ferguson spoke very movingly about that. It is good to hear the cabinet secretary make her case that we need to recognise what happened with the Watson case in any measures that we undertake in Scotland. We can understand the difficulties when we are talking about a previous case for which evidence is incomplete but, nevertheless, something must be done.</p><p>We must be sure that we are not creating a huge and expensive bureaucratic burden. Not long ago the Education and Culture Committee heard at great length about the problems of the smaller regional press in Scotland, especially how some regional newspapers are facing huge financial constraints and, in some cases, finding it difficult to operate at all. As Patricia Ferguson said, those newspapers are an important part of journalism and local democracy and we need to ensure that we do not do anything to further jeopardise their future.</p><p>Leveson had some good things to say about the local and regional press, and for the Scottish Conservatives it is significant that the recent publication from the press speaks with one voice on behalf of the whole industry. At the weekend, I noticed that that caught the attention of John Whittingdale, who is chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and who said that the UK Government would be well advised to accept the offer of a tough new watchdog as recommended by the industry. I see today that more MPs south of the border are saying exactly the same thing.</p><p>The timescale within which the Education and Culture Committee was forced to operate was regrettable, especially when it came to a lack of evidence from the regional and local press. We suggest that that is an important omission and, when we have further discussions, it should be taken further.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689722", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Press Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not think that any of us would argue that this debate is anything other than hugely complex.

I praise the efforts of my colleague Alex Johnstone and the work that he has done in recent months to boost the cricketing links between Scotland and Japan&#8212;and in honing his skills in the Japanese language.</p><p>Next week&#8212;weather permitting, as Nigel Don says&#8212;it will be a huge honour for me to umpire one of the matches that the Japanese women will play on their Scottish tour. In my playing days, I was privileged to play in some internationals but, until now, I have never had the honour of umpiring an international fixture. I am greatly looking forward to it.</p><p>That aside, it has been even more of an honour to be part of the Scottish effort that has been supporting the Japan Cricket Association in its quest to provide lots of new equipment and wide-ranging coaching support for the hundreds of children&#8212;many of them orphans&#8212;who lost everything in the 2011 tsunami. I think that we all remember the appalling scenes and the complete and utter devastation of so many areas around Kesennuma. The buildings of 1,500 schools were either completely swept away or so seriously damaged that children lost their educational opportunities. They also lost any opportunity that they had to take part in sport or any other pastimes.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone said, that is where the combined efforts of Alex Miyaji and Shyam Bhatia came into play in providing the financial support to help to turn all that around. Cricket for Smiles is the most amazing charity and although I have not been to Japan to see it in action, I have seen the video footage and the photos of how much it has meant to so many children and the communities that are in the process of being rebuilt. That footage has inspired the girls whom I coach to become extremely enthusiastic in their fundraising efforts to try to help more children to take part, and they look forward to meeting the Japanese teams next Friday to hear more about the developments.</p><p>On St Andrew&#8217;s day past, I was privileged to be a guest at a dinner in the long room in Lord&#8217;s, at which Henry Blofeld of &#8220;Test Match Special&#8221; was the guest speaker. He had just arrived back from India that morning, following his commentaries on the England versus India test series and he told us, in his usual entertaining style, about the visits that he had made, along with Alastair Cook, the captain of England, and his team, to an Indian charity in Mumbai that was doing similar work to that of Cricket for Smiles. He spoke movingly about the effect that relatively modest sums of money could have in turning around the lives of children who have so little, and I hope that this debate will inspire others to help the cricketing charities around the world that enable others to enjoy what we do in this country.</p><p>Prior to that dinner, we were permitted a special tour of the Lord&#8217;s pavilion, its museum and library. While being shown some of the most precious memorabilia, we were also shown photographs of some of the most extraordinary places and circumstances in which cricket has been played around the world, which include the Arctic, an Everest base camp and a disused world war 2 airfield in Malta. Little did I know at the time that in that collection are the photographs of the match in 1863 that Alex Johnstone described in his opening speech. The idea of revolvers being part of the kit does much to challenge the descriptions of the 19th century pastoral village green that was so beloved of authors such as Neville Cardus, R C Robertson-Glasgow and Mary Russell Mitford. It conjures up all kinds of images of how the naval players managed to accommodate bat and weapon at the same time, and what might have happened when the naval captain roared out instructions to point.</p><p>What I am sure was true then and is certainly true now is that cricket has a role to play in bringing communities together. For those of us who are long-serving and passionate observers of the game, there is something about its spirit&#8212;as described by the late much-loved Christopher Martin-Jenkins&#8212;that inspires the very best in human nature, and that has certainly been true of the philanthropists who have chosen Japan cricket as the focus of their charities.</p><p>It is sometimes said that cricket is an elitist game that was born out of a quintessential Englishness, perfectly in tune with the sounds of leather on willow on long, hazy summer days on a village green, where the only rules were those of Corinthians and gentlemanly conduct. That may be so, in terms of the origins, but nothing could be further from the truth in the coastal areas of Kesennuma. However, when we see the smiles on the children's faces there, we can see exactly what cricket has brought to them.

It was quite right that the Scottish Government was mindful of whether government had a legislative role to play in assisting with meeting that challenge. The Scottish Government, in conjunction with colleges, universities and the Scottish funding council, needed to decide which policies would best deliver excellence in our institutions, would maintain and enhance their international reputations and would respond to the economic and social needs of local economies. I hope that that decision is based on building on the current successes of our institutions. If a legislative route was seen to be desirable, it would be clear in its intentions, practical and acceptable to the institutions involved.</p><p>It was against those criteria that the Scottish Conservatives set out to examine the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill. At the start of the process we were genuinely open-minded, largely on the basis that we had sympathy with some&#8212;albeit certainly not all&#8212;of the main policy intentions. As time has gone on, and following lengthy committee meetings examining a large amount of evidence&#8212;meetings that were ably and objectively chaired by Stewart Maxwell&#8212;we have increasingly come to the view that this is a bad bill. It is a bad bill not just because of its poor drafting; it is a bad bill because of the complete lack of clarity about the relationships between the new structures, which is particularly the case with regard to colleges. The bill has botched the balance between public accountability and autonomy, and it is a bad bill because there is so little evidence that it is needed and is able to deliver on the intentions behind it.</p><p>Alastair Sim of Universities Scotland summed it up well when he said:</p><p>&#8220;the bill has come adrift from the policy intentions.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 19 February 2013; c 1977.]</p><p>I agree. Apart from those presentational problems, which formed a substantial part of the evidence, there are, for the Scottish Conservatives, some major policy issues with the bill, and I will consider those in the context of an increasingly competitive international situation for our universities.</p><p>Good governance is not in doubt&#8212;indeed, I do not believe that it ever was. If there was compelling evidence and serious examples of bad governance harming education and holding back our institutions, there might be a case for new legislation. However, the policy memorandum did not identify any such problems, and Professor von Prondzynski was at pains to say that he thought that the existing structures were &#8220;excellent&#8221;.

Those are important questions for the chamber.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have taken the process seriously and have listened very carefully to the views of a range of stakeholders right across the college and university sectors on how they see the bill in relation to those specific objectives.

The Scottish Government has argued that the bill is necessary because of the technical and administrative underpinning that it will give to the reforms of colleges and universities.

The Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has given a ruling that seems encouraging, but there is still a small area of doubt.</p><p>Secondly, universities and colleges have raised concerns about the powers that are to be vested in the Scottish funding council to review the number of post-16 institutions and the learning and teaching that they provide.

We are all very much aware of the fact that there is no ready mix of those factors, and that success can never be prescribed merely by the actions of any Government. The family matters very much, but so, too, does the community in which that family lives and works.</p><p>Of course, Government has a role to play. I appreciate that a delicate balance must be struck between allowing parents and families to decide on their own responsibilities and providing intervention by Government. That is a very difficult issue, with which the Education and Culture Committee is grappling in its inquiry into decision making on when children should be taken into care. That is perhaps the most difficult issue that we face, as it is all about the balance between the individual and the state and whether the balance that we are working towards is correct.</p><p>I distinctly remember that, when my colleague Annabel Goldie first put the issue of a drugs strategy at the top of the political agenda, some said that it was far too complex a problem. However, what we saw was a real determination within Parliament and the wider community to tackle the main issues head on. I suggest that we need to do exactly the same for the parenting strategy. In that respect, I think that the Scottish Government has made a positive start and we support that work very much.</p><p>In particular, we want to see a political environment that encourages parental responsibility and choice but balances the rights of children with those of families. In an article in The Herald, Maggie Mellon made the important point that the children and young people bill must address that as a centre point. We should take on board that issue when we debate the bill. That is the reason for our amendment today and why we are so keen on a universal health visitor system, particularly for those aged zero to two.</p><p>We need to have a much closer look, as Barnardo&#8217;s has argued, at how we secure the most effective involvement of the voluntary sector. Given that many charities and voluntary sector bodies are firmly rooted in their local communities, about which they have expert knowledge, they are often the best placed to provide the help that struggling families need. We all know of first-class examples of such groups and charities in our constituencies, but we also know only too well that they frequently complain that they are not always part of a joined-up policy-making approach. Therefore, it is good to hear that the Scottish Government will have that joined-up approach at the centre of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In this age when a great deal of robust debate is taking place about the financing of tertiary education, we should not forget the fact that there is almost universal acceptance&#8212;not just in the UK&#8212;that the greatest focus for additional resources should be in the earliest years, just as there is universal acceptance that, if we can get policy making right for the earliest years, we...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Elizabeth", "last_name": "Smith", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80515", "house": "4", "member_id": "80515", "person_id": "14096", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, "section_id": "22686654", "hpos": "158", "gid": "2013-03-14.16.13", "epobject_id": "22686667", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-03-14.16.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14096+section%3Asp#g16.13", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80515"}, {"body": "<p>I entirely endorse that.

The debate has been all the better for that. It is an interesting topic with many different dimensions to it. I congratulate Murdo Fraser on bringing it to the chamber. It is an important debate, especially in the year of natural Scotland.</p><p>I declare an interest, in that I am a member of the John Muir Trust. As a national body, it is to be widely commended for all the work that it has been doing over many months to ensure that we are debating the facts rather than the myths.</p><p>I am often told by my climbing friends from south of the border that Scotland is the most privileged nation thanks to the extraordinary beauty of her landscapes, particularly those that are in the most remote areas of the country. Mike MacKenzie made an important point about what wildness actually means. For those people, the landscapes are a powerful magnet that attracts many people from all over the world, in all seasons, in all weathers and in all kinds of outdoor adventures. The argument for the protection of that wild land&#8212;or, at least, some of it&#8212;is compelling, just as it is in places such as Northumberland&#8217;s national park, north-east England&#8217;s heritage coast or the north Pennines. However, some caveats have to be put in place, which I will speak about in a minute.</p><p>As Tories, we are obviously not given to supporting additional legislation too easily, but we remain conscious of the tensions between the wilderness and economic development, specifically the creation of employment, which have been brought into the starkest focus by the march of wind farm development across our precious landscapes. Two summers ago, when, along with some others, Murdo Fraser and I were climbing in the Fisherfield area&#8212;accompanied by millions of midges&#8212;we had to accept that, even in one of our most treasured wilderness areas, large-scale wind farm developments could be seen on the skyline. That brought home to us just how significant that development is and why it is difficult for some people to accept it. Obviously, that is an issue that has been widely debated in many forums in this Parliament already.</p><p>Apart from the overwhelming need to protect the ever-more fragile environment, there are growing social and health reasons for taking action, as is evidenced by some of the studies from other countries that have been set out in the briefings that we have had.</p><p>On that point, I should say how important the role of groups such as the John Muir Trust has been in educating our young people about the responsibilities that they have when it comes to the protection of wild places. I remember vividly, when conducting my first school project with the John Muir Trust, the slightly indifferent reactions of pupils when they heard that we would be helping to do a major beach clear at Achmore on the south side of Loch Carron. I think that, perhaps not surprisingly, the pupils thought that they were there for a litter pick-up because their teachers fancied a bit of time off. Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth and, on that day, the John Muir Trust made a huge impact on the lives of 14 teenagers, none of whom had been in that kind of environment before and who knew nothing about the responsibilities that come with it.</p><p>In 2002, only 35 schools were involved in the John Muir Trust award. Now, 259 are involved. That means that the number of pupils who are in receipt of the award has risen tenfold in that period. The trust deserves congratulations for that. Of course, that is very much in line with the basic principles of the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>We have had a briefing from the Ramblers Association, too. It makes a good point that there has to be a much more coherent approach that includes other measures relating to the planning process and the design of the financial incentives. It is absolutely right to point out that there is a balance to be struck when it comes to the economy and the protection of wild land. I particularly note the association&#8217;s campaigning on the issue of what is happening just now in relation to the Cairngorm national park.</p><p>We must be careful to ensure that all voices are heard. My colleague Jamie McGrigor would have made that point had he not been unwell today. Protection should not be considered on a blanket basis, lest we do not pay due attention to the needs of the traditional land uses, such as farming, angling, crofting, game shooting, deer stalking and so on, all of which are hugely important.</p><p>We must hear the voices of those who speak for managed land, because they are just as important as those of us who like to enjoy the wilderness. Most land is managed, to a certain extent, but it is important that we take a structured view and try to consider all avenues because, at the end of the day, we have the most significant landscapes in the world.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685812", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Conservation (Endangered Species and Wild Land)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Murdo Fraser said in his introduction that this is a wide subject, and so it has turned out to be.

From the establishment of the Fife Federation of Gingerbread in 1987 to the Fife Gingerbread organisation today, the guiding purpose has been not just to provide information to lone parents, but to ensure that they have someone to turn to&#8212;as David Torrance described movingly in his speech when quoting a young person who had found someone to speak to who turned their life around. That is very much needed and valued.</p><p>Notwithstanding what I have just said about categories of lone parents, the circumstances can be highly challenging, reflecting many of the difficulties of modern life, which has changed so much in the past 20 years. We must accept that many people who seek the support of Gingerbread&#8217;s services are in difficult circumstances, whether through poverty or a very low income base, or because of substance abuse. We must accept that that is a very real situation, which needs to be addressed. I note from the website that there are about 10,500 lone parents in Fife alone, so there is a clear need for Gingerbread&#8217;s support.</p><p>When thinking about the debate, I was struck by a story that I was recently told in a constituency surgery about a couple who, sadly, had separated, and about the difficulties that the lone parent was having in paying the household bills, not because she was unable to do that, but because it was something that she had never had to do before. She very much appreciated the advice&#8212;albeit that it was basic advice&#8212;from somebody who had been through the same thing. The Gingerbread group has been highly successful in providing such support in Fife.</p><p>As a regional MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife and a member of the Education and Culture Committee, I have been very aware of much of the other support that has been given in linking up with other groups&#8212;including the student support worker that Fife Gingerbread can offer&#8212;that offer childcare and assisted benefits.</p><p>Fife Gingerbread is to be congratulated all round on the terrific effort that it has put in&#8212;not only in doing its own work, but in yielding that experience elsewhere.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685011", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread (Support for Lone Parents)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to David Torrance on securing this worthwhile members&#8217; business debate.

What is best for the universities is to ensure that they maintain and enhance their extraordinary standing in the world, continue to attract cutting-edge research and become fully competitive in the knowledge exchange economy. Although the debate has many diverse aspects to it, funding policy is a key component.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to set out why in autumn 2010 we made our commitment to a graduate contribution and why&#8212;two and a half years on&#8212;we remain more convinced than ever that it is the right way forward. We made that commitment after carefully analysing the facts, after examining comparative HE sectors abroad and after listening to senior figures in the HE sector and to those who, at the request of the Government, have produced significant studies in the field&#8212;people including Sir Stewart Sutherland, Professor Gavin McCrone and Sir Andrew Cubie. I notice that when Andrew Cubie produced his report jointly with the Goodison Group in Scotland three weeks ago, he talked even more forcefully about the challenges that HE in Scotland faces.</p><p>Each of those individuals set out compelling evidence that Scotland&#8217;s universities will in the future require additional sources of income if they are to maintain their competitive advantage at the same time as they improve academic standards and widen access. Scotland is spending only 1 per cent of gross domestic product on higher education, which is less than many other countries, including England, so I hope that the need for that additional income is not doubted by any of the political parties in this chamber.</p><p>As Hugh Henry rightly said, the key question is this: who pays for it? Clearly that is a matter of political choice. The Scottish Government has made its choice plain. It believes that the state should pay for tuition of students as long as they are Scotland domiciled or are non-UK EU students. It argues that on the basis that it believes that free higher education is someone&#8217;s right&#8212;I think the cabinet secretary used the phrase, &#8220;someone&#8217;s promise&#8221;&#8212;and that the taxpayer therefore has an obligation to pay for it. That is a rational argument and one that is, no doubt, very attractive in an ideal world.</p><p>However, the reality is that there is no bottomless state pot for higher education without significant costs&#8212;especially if the Scottish Government, along with the rest of us, wants to continue to increase the proportion of students going into higher education, which is in the region of 50 per cent, and to widen access for students from more disadvantaged backgrounds. For very understandable reasons, those students cost more to support at university than do other students&#8212;31 per cent more on average, according to the paper that Universities Scotland recently submitted to Holyrood&#8217;s Finance Committee.</p><p>Given what has happened to the funding of our colleges, we already know that the commitment to maintain free higher education comes at a very significant cost. Other spending gets hit or, of course, taxes could rise, although, as Hugh Henry said, we know that John Swinney has ruled that out. That is a political choice for the SNP, but it is one with which we profoundly disagree.</p><p>Why? First, the international evidence that has been provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and various international governments routinely supports the view that the only way to secure long-term sustainable funding for higher education, at a time when there is an overwhelming commitment to increase numbers and widen access, is further injection of private funds.</p><p>Secondly, there is a marginal social and marginal private benefit to university education, so it is not unreasonable to expect some sharing of that cost&#8212;even more so if it removes the current regressive situation.</p><p>Thirdly, evidence that has been produced by the Russell group of universities in its submission to the Browne review showed that the additional income brought into those universities has had significant benefits, which it highlights, such as the ability to attract and retain high-quality staff and, crucially, the ability to adapt to the changing needs of the student population. I want to dwell on that point for a moment, given that it is the ability to add more resources to HE that is important. David Willetts said that he thought that the figure would be 10 per cent additional resources by 2014-15. We know from the latest Scottish Parliament information centre briefing to the Education and Culture Committee that that has facilitated more money for bursary support.</p><p>The other point about the international evidence is that the countries that are performing best in HE are those whose Government is taking slightly less responsibility for the sector. Inevitably, that will be reflected in funding trends.</p><p>What of the SNP&#8217;s case for higher education in practice? As I said when I intervened on the cabinet secretary, Gavin McCrone, who was critical of aspects of the balance in the Westminster Government&#8217;s analysis of higher education, said that the funding situation in Scotland is a mess and is</p><p>&#8220;impossible to defend on the basis of equity&#8221;.</p><p>That, cabinet secretary, is why I have used the word &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; in my amendment. The Government position is discriminatory.</p><p>This morning we heard the University and College Union Scotland and the NUS say exactly the same thing. They said&#8212;I think the quotation is correct, although I have not checked the Official Report because I do not have it to hand&#8212;that the policy is</p><p>&#8220;more damaging than the worst excesses of the Westminster Government's policy&#8221;.</p><p>Knowing what UCU and NUS think of the Westminster Government&#8217;s policy, I say that they are pretty damning about what the Scottish Government is doing.</p><p>The great mantra of the SNP is that university entrance should be</p><p>&#8220;based on the ability to learn, and not the ability to pay.&#8221;</p><p>Try telling that to the people who have to pay.

However, looking at the parties&#8217; statements on welfare policy, we can see that there is relative agreement on the starting position. The Deputy First Minister set out some examples of that. However, that starting position is also similar because we know that the welfare bill is huge&#8212;it grew by 45 per cent between 2000 and 2010&#8212;and because we know that it is likely to grow significantly in the years ahead. We all agree that the debate about what can and, more important, what should be available as a universal benefit is only just beginning.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm set out, very fairly, how he sees the Labour Party paying to maintain universal benefits. Over time, the Labour Party must spell out, in the context of the other universal benefits, whether it would drop universality for them.

If members look back through the record, they will see that I raised that issue with concern several months ago. It would be fair to say that the Westminster Government has had the greatest amount of criticism on that point. However, because of that, the Westminster Government has moved to a situation in which some of the loss of benefits will be tapered so that there will be no immediate cut-off, as there was in the original plan.

It is a story of a cabinet secretary who is having great difficulty in keeping the focus on colleges where it should be and allaying the fears of the college and university sectors&#8212;never mind those of the public and Opposition politicians&#8212;about some key issues.</p><p>I understand very well that different colleges use different measures to assess the length of their waiting lists. That is not new. They do so not just because of the reasons that the cabinet secretary gave, which are to do with some students taking up other courses, getting a job or not getting the necessary qualifications. Those are all perfectly valid reasons, which is why we should be extremely careful about double counting. The use of different measures also reflects the flexibility of colleges and their ability to adapt courses quickly to the business and industry demands of their local communities, which is an issue that is fast taking centre stage in the current debate about college regionalisation.</p><p>As Hugh Henry rightly said, the mistake that the cabinet secretary has made, yet again, is in the attitude that he has adopted. He has dismissed the perfectly legitimate questions of Opposition members, including me, and&#8212;more importantly&#8212;of the college sector. By stating that waiting lists are a false concept, he has given a highly misleading impression of the situation. Although we could undoubtedly spend a lot of time picking through all the semantic details, the implication from, in particular, the manner in which the cabinet secretary spoke was that waiting lists do not exist, when it is quite clear that they do. We now have a new definition&#8212;the cabinet secretary calls them &#8220;so-called waiting lists&#8221;.</p><p>What is at issue, of course, is the definition, just as it was the definition that was at issue when the cabinet secretary got himself tied in knots&#8212;double knots, in fact&#8212;when he pontificated about college spending. At the time, he tried to pretend that nothing was wrong and that it was just that the Opposition parties were ganging up on him. Well, we are ganging up on him.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has made the comment:</p><p>&#8220;I know how desperate members are to weigh in on this matter because they think that, somehow, they are going to get a political advantage&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 16 January 2013; c 15509.]</p><p>That is not the case. We want to raise the issue because there is genuine concern&#8212;most importantly within the sector&#8212;that the Scottish Government finds it extremely difficult to adopt the right approach to what is clearly a complex problem.</p><p>Instead of saying that waiting lists are a false concept, would it not have been much more sensible to say, &#8220;Yes, they exist,&#8221; and to explain why there are so many complexities and what the Government is doing to address them? Exactly the same thing happened over college budgets: we heard persistent denial and a dismissive approach, which I understand became a feature of a Christmas YouTube video at Edinburgh College. That is not helpful to the promotion of a clear understanding of what the main issues are and what needs to be done to address them.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that colleges use different measures to identify waiting lists, are we really saying that it is not possible to come up with an agreed definition that tells us the aggregate total of students across Scotland who, during any one period, have made an application for a course or courses and who have the right credentials, but who cannot find a college place? I do not think that any of us knows whether that figure is 21,000 students or fewer, but I know that it is extremely unhelpful when the cabinet secretary tries to dismiss the issue as though no one else has any understanding of the true situation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would be inclined to give the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning a little more time, because the more he goes on explaining the facts in that manner, the more confused he gets.

After all, tone is as important as the context in which we are discussing many of these issues, and several members have mentioned the fact that the debate comes on top of other debates that have a coherence with it. That is important because we all have a responsibility for tackling youth unemployment. We also have a responsibility to focus on employability because, as Mary Scanlon made clear in setting out the statistical facts as proof, it is essentially the main issue in this debate.</p><p>Mary Scanlon is absolutely right to say that there are some signs of progress that it would be churlish to diminish in looking at the overall picture. However, what remains clear is the considerable gap between demand and supply in different aspects of the labour market, not just with regard to the total numbers but in the qualitative adjustments required. I was struck by comments made from all parts of the political spectrum by Chic Brodie, Liam McArthur, Ken Macintosh and Siobhan McMahon about the need to drill down into some of this. After all, we cannot simply come out with blanket statements.</p><p>Apart from the underemployment issue, which Ken Macintosh rightly raised, there are three main problems. First, there are those who are willing and able to work but who are unable to find work in an economy that is obviously demand-deficient at the moment and prone to some very serious cyclical downturns. Secondly, there are those who are willing and able to work but who cannot find a job because they do not possess the relevant skills and qualifications that would make them sufficiently attractive to employers who have jobs available. Then there are those who are able to work but who are, for one reason or another, unwilling to do so.</p><p>Each situation encompasses different problems in the labour market and, by definition, requires a different approach from Government. When we examine why just under half of 16 to 24-year-olds in Scotland are currently unemployed and why the youth unemployment rate here continues to be far too high, it is important that we look at the underlying trends and that policy focus distinguishes between different types of unemployment.</p><p>Several members said that many factors are at work, which is right. A concern that has been raised consistently, and which I think has emerged in almost every committee in the Parliament, given the consistent theme that employers take up when they make representations to parliamentarians, is the lack of employability skills among by no means all but too many of our young people. Employers say that too many school leavers have poor communication skills and a lack of understanding of the ethos that is expected and required in the workplace. Although employers acknowledge that there are outstanding programmes to address that issue, including many in the voluntary sector&#8212;we talked about the Prince&#8217;s Trust&#8212;time and again they make the point that policy is not sufficiently coherent across the country.</p><p>There is a wealth of evidence on the topic, and whether we consider the sophisticated economic analysis that the Confederation of British Industry produced or the sophisticated social analysis that Barnardo&#8217;s produced, we can see seriously worrying signs of personal barriers in the way of too many young people. Barriers can include poor literacy and numeracy skills, a lack of confidence and motivation, issues to do with housing and money management and, just as important, an inability to understand what is required in the workplace.</p><p>It is clear that an increasing number of commentators think that schools and colleges have the most significant part to play in tackling the problem. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce told the Finance Committee recently that a great deal more needs to be done to improve links between employers and schools and colleges and to address young people&#8217;s expectations. In that context, I congratulate Jayne Baxter on her thoughtful maiden speech. She made the point strongly that the transition between school life and working life is the most important one.</p><p>Members who attended the meeting of the cross-party group on colleges and universities just before Christmas, when we considered articulation, were struck by the contribution of Chantelle Robson, who is a classic example of the importance of successful articulation. The young lady is in her first job and made it clear that if she had not been lucky enough to get beneficial advice, she probably would not have succeeded. She argued strongly that careers guidance at school, particularly in secondary 3, should be much better.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Some very interesting points have been raised in this debate, which I think has struck a very interesting tone.

Bill Porterfield of Burn Stewart Distillers, who was providing a report about the ambitions that he and some other local businesses have for helping young people into successful careers, began his contribution with the following observation:</p><p>&#8220;When exam time comes, the education system tells you to put away your calculators, your mobiles and your textbooks, and try to remember everything you have learnt for the last two years for a two hour exam. Don&#8217;t copy anyone &#8230; and don&#8217;t ask anyone for help. This must be all your own work&#8221;.</p><p>What happens on day 1 in the workplace? You are handed a calculator, a mobile and a set of instructions. You are told not to rely on anything that you have learned up till now and, whatever you do, to ask for help. It is the absolute opposite of the academic experience that finished only a few weeks before.</p><p>That is a bit of satire, perhaps, but it nonetheless serves to set out the culture shock that many young people face when they enter the world of work. At stake is somebody&#8217;s future career and their ability to know what to expect, understand the appropriate ethos, take instruction and know their rights and responsibilities. In short, it is as much about having good communication skills and how the person adds value to the workplace as it is about their qualifications.</p><p>The earliest discussions in a pupil&#8217;s school life about possible career paths can have the most significant impact. They by no means determine exactly what the pupil will do post school, but they certainly sow the seeds for possible paths.</p><p>It is, therefore, vital that those initial discussions are well informed and properly followed up, rather than involving mandatory chats from a teacher to the whole class or in some cases the whole year group. In the past, and even at a few schools today, the latter approach has been all too familiar and has done little more than advise pupils which prospectuses to read or which websites to use.</p><p>If the philosophy of earliest identification is true in looking after the social and educational needs of our youngest children, it is also true for careers guidance. In my book, that means starting out with better careers guidance in the early years of secondary school, prior to subject choice for external qualifications.</p><p>I would argue strongly that effective guidance is needed on why there are different approaches to the disciplines of science, arts and social sciences. Members may be surprised to learn that although pupils often know which subjects fall into those categories, they are not always aware of how one learns in the different disciplines. Knowledge must be complemented by an early understanding of the world of work and the skills that are required in any occupation.</p><p>We should be clear about schools&#8217; obligations. First, there is&#8212;not least because of the principles that underpin the curriculum for excellence document &#8220;Building the Curriculum 4&#8221;&#8212;an obligation to ensure that the guidance that is provided at school is personal and no longer shaped by a-one-size-fits-all approach. Such an approach may be fine for the initial session, but it is certainly not appropriate as pupils begin to discuss their individual programmes.</p><p>I commend those schools throughout Scotland that take time to interview their pupils on a regular one-to-one basis and which, in the later years of school, ask pupils to select one member of the school staff to act as a personal tutor. The fact that the pupil has a choice has the huge advantage of ensuring that the system has a high chance of success and that the pupil sees that member of staff on a regular basis.</p><p>Secondly, schools have an obligation to ensure that they fully involve parents in the process, given that parents remain the biggest influence on young people&#8217;s choices in the early stages. It makes things much better if school and home are working together, and it is beneficial when local businesses or recruitment agencies can be involved too. As was said at the cross-party group, it is never too early to start work on what expectations are in the workplace and which skills are required in any professional working environment.</p><p>School are also obliged to ensure that they track pupils once they have left school so that they become much better informed about how well the careers guidance has worked and where it might be falling short. Universities and colleges are doing that exceptionally well just now, and such an approach should be done at school level.</p><p>This afternoon, the Scottish Government has set out the key elements of the strategy to modernise careers services across Scotland. That is welcome, but only as far as it goes. There is no doubt that some of the new approaches that have been highlighted will be enormously beneficial in providing youngsters with a much better awareness of what options are available. However, the strategy must be expanded considerably. I have concerns on two fronts, one of which echoes the concerns that Labour set out this afternoon.</p><p>First, what matters most is the quality of the information that is available and the ability of the youngster to understand and use information appropriately. New technology&#8212;especially new collaborative websites&#8212;can be important, but success will be determined by the qualitative judgments that the youngster makes. That requires human as well as technical input, and we should be in no doubt about the need for a fully co-ordinated approach in providing that. I whole-heartedly agree with Labour&#8217;s view that there is grave cause for concern about some of the evidence that was provided to the Education and Culture Committee, from which it was clear that by no means all the stakeholders involved agree on the best way forward.</p><p>Specifically, as Labour has said, there is concern that there is still scope for too many people to fall through the net. Labour has pointed to the registration issue, which is a serious concern. While I understand the principles of the system that the Government is trying to put into operation, I think that we must look carefully at expanding the whole process so that we not only have more youngsters involved, critically, at an earlier stage, but are satisfied that the process has the confidence of the main stakeholders.</p><p>As a politician and a former schoolteacher, I cannot overemphasise how important careers guidance is. We must get our approach to it right and we must be a bit broader in our outlook than the Scottish Government currently is.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-05109.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and recommends that the most significant progress is likely to be made if there is more personalised careers guidance available to all pupils in the early years of secondary school that is in line with the main principles of the curriculum for excellence and actively involves other partners such as local businesses, colleges and universities.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679351", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Careers Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last month, the importance of careers guidance was put into sharp focus for the cross-party group on colleges and universities.

As he said, music&#8212;in whatever capacity&#8212;should be at the heart of any curriculum, not just because of the educational and social benefits that it brings but because of its power to transform lives, which he described. We have seen that on a grand scale with El Sistema, which is thankfully to be expanded across Scotland. However, another important factor is that music provides an important self-discipline and, often, the ambition for pupils to do well in other subjects. Music is definitely not to be treated as an optional extra. As Nicola Benedetti has said, that would do untold damage to the cultural fabric of Scotland.</p><p>We know that music is, in principle, firmly embedded in curriculum for excellence, but we also know that its provision is patchy, particularly when it comes to instrumental tuition, and that that situation relates largely to costs, as both Clare Adamson and Jenny Marra said. In particular, our concerns relate to the wide variations between local authorities. Just a few months ago, the Education and Culture Committee was presented with the stark reality of the statistics. Three quarters of the 32 local authorities in Scotland are charging for instrumental music tuition, and the annual charge varies from &#163;95 to &#163;340. In many cases, the costs have continued to rise over the past two or three years, and in the past year 11 local authorities have announced increases that are well above the rate of inflation.</p><p>It is just as important to note that five councils&#8212;it was six, so it is good to hear that one has changed its mind&#8212;are still charging students for entering SQA exams. Notwithstanding the fact that we know that budgets are tight&#8212;again, the Education and Culture Committee was told about the effect of that&#8212;it is simply unacceptable that some councils see music as an easy target when it comes to budget cuts, and there is sometimes a hint that they see it as a means of generating additional income. That is a situation about which we should all feel distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>There is also variation between primary schools and secondary schools. We should accept that that needs to be dealt with quickly. If music is to be treated as an important part of curriculum for excellence&#8212;I am sure that we have a unanimous view on that&#8212;it is difficult to square that with the fact that families are having to pay high fees, and parents will rightly be confused and angry if they have to face more increases in that regard. Given that parents are already paying taxes to local authorities, they find the additional charges reprehensible.</p><p>We have been told that it might not be possible to avoid additional charges altogether. I can accept that up to a point, given the nature of some of the tuition that is required. However, if there have to be some charges, I suggest that local authorities be more imaginative about possible sources of additional income. Some of them have been interested in the concept of trusts when it comes to sport, and I wonder whether something can be done on the same basis for music. It might also be possible to involve local businesses if we have to find some additional funds.</p><p>I finish by commending Iain Gray again, because this is an important debate and he spoke with considerable passion on the subject.

How ironic it is that a debate that was supposed to be about the important issue of improving career guidance services in Scotland has turned into a debate about the career guidance for one cabinet secretary.</p><p>What happened last week was a turning point, when competence disappeared from the SNP government at its highest level. However, it is the credibility question that is most troubling and, as many people in the sector have commented, it is a wholly unwelcome diversion from many of the real issues in the college sector. The debate should be about education and jobs, and I will come on to those in a minute.</p><p>Let me be clear that our ability to scrutinise the true situation that exists for colleges and, indeed, the ability of the witnesses who attended the Education and Culture committee, has been seriously undermined by the lack of accurate data. Mike Russell&#8217;s problem is that he has lost the confidence of the sector, the public at large and politicians across the chamber. That situation is not good for Scottish education.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the academic year does not match the financial year&#8212;that is not the fault of any Government or even the cabinet secretary&#8212;new interpretations of the budget figures seem to emerge every time the Scottish Government makes an attempt to clarify them. The public sees a First Minister and an education secretary who cannot make up their minds about whether college budgets are going up or down. It is bad enough that they both misled the Parliament with dodgy figures, but they did not even seem to know what the right ones were. Mike Russell was nodding when the first Minister produced the wrong figures at First Minister&#8217;s questions; he was again seen nodding vigorously when he thought that his boss had set a wrong right in the 5 pm statement. But were those figures the whole truth?</p><p>If the First Minister is correct in amending the baseline figure to &#163;556 million for the financial year 2011-12, instead of the &#163;545 million figure quoted in the Audit Scotland report, does that not mean that the college budgets have actually suffered a cut of more than 24 per cent? Likewise, as a result of the mess created by the Scottish Government with recent figures, there is a danger of fixing too much attention on the budget year 2012-13 and losing sight of what will happen in budget year 2013-14, when it now seems likely that there will be an even greater cut than was previously stated. What does that say about the long-term planning for colleges in their courses, staff and student numbers?</p><p>How does that affect education and jobs? I repeat what I asked in last week&#8217;s colleges debate. Why, when youth unemployment is growing and we have a flagship policy that promises an education or training opportunity for all 16 to 19-year-olds, does the SNP Government still believe that it is right to cut the budgets of further education colleges, which are essential for training young people in the skills that will be needed when the Scottish economy returns to sustainable economic growth? As we have already agreed, colleges could hardly be more important in that respect, nor in reaching out to the many people for whom further education was previously too remote. Last week, all parties in the Parliament, including the Scottish Government, praised colleges for the diversity and flexibility of their work and their potential to widen access.</p><p>Worse still, as a result of the Scottish Government&#8217;s changed policy focus to provide greater student support, there is now less money available for bursaries, which, as everyone knows, are provided specifically to help students who come from poorer sections of society. When the Scottish Government talks to other parties about Conservative policies, it should be mighty careful about seeking the moral high ground. Student support is a vital element of any college budget, but so too are bursaries. The Government should remember that student support will be of little use if students cannot find places in the first instance.</p><p>The Scottish Government says that further education must change. I do not think that anyone disagrees. It is clear that it wants to move away from a system where institutions matter more than people, towards one that is built around the needs of a wide range of students and much greater flexibility. Those reforms are the basis for regionalisation. They bring enhanced educational opportunities and much greater responsiveness to local demand. That should be the driver for college reform; it should not always be about money.</p><p>I have previously complimented the Scottish Government on several of its early years policies, which can make a crucial difference at the most important stage in the educational journey. Completely the opposite is true of its policies on the tertiary education sector, where the focus is entirely wrong.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives cannot support a policy that is ripping the heart out of institutions that have done much in recent years to make further education more accessible and more flexible, and that aspire to higher standards. That is why we fully support the amendment lodged by Liam McArthur, call for a major rethink of the Scottish Government&#8217;s priorities within the education budget and demand that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning resign.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677831", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The fact that we are back in the chamber discussing the Scottish Government&#8217;s handling of its college policies says it all.

It was a remarkable speech from a remarkable woman. Asked to set out the challenges ahead and how she thought Scottish businesses and industry should respond, she said that understanding globalisation is the key and no more so than in the sphere of education. We must, she said, question what we are training our young people for and why. Her words provide a convenient backdrop to the debate on widening access to our colleges and why we, on this side of the chamber, contend that that overall ambition is being seriously compromised by the misplaced focus of Scottish Government policy.</p><p>The debate&#8212;which I hope will soon be followed by another debate about widening access to universities&#8212;will examine the crucial role that our colleges can play in a fast-changing global economy to help Scotland to stay ahead of the game in the manner suggested by Dr Albright. Notwithstanding our acceptance of the very tight financial constraints affecting many economies, we urge the Scottish Government to refocus its budget priorities and tackle head-on the criticism that has been levelled at the Government from so many sources in education, business and industry.</p><p>I take up specifically the comment from Jeremy Peat of the David Hume Institute that</p><p>&#8220;change must not be at the cost of the crucial role the colleges play in providing opportunities to many from diverse parts of society&#8221;.</p><p>In this chamber and in several portfolio and cross-party committees, we have been reminded many times by experts in the sector that further education reaches parts of the population that other educational institutions do not and that it has an increasing reputation for inspiring those groups towards more meaningful employment, including a greater interest in successful entrepreneurial activity.</p><p>The role of our colleges is clear. So, too, is the Scottish Conservatives&#8217; respect for all the staff and students who are involved. First, in educational terms, it is clear that our colleges want to move away from an outdated system in which institutions matter more than people. They want to move away from being the institutions that the public often labelled&#8212;simplistically&#8212;as being in between schools and universities. They want to ensure that their provision of education is responsive to the needs of their local economies as well as to the needs of the national economy, to which they have contributed to the tune of 1 per cent of gross domestic product over eight years. They want better articulation&#8212;a point that will be developed by my colleague Mary Scanlon&#8212;and they want to provide greater flexibility so that college education really is open to a wider cross-section of society. It is on that point that I want to dwell because, in my book, it is that greater flexibility that matters so much to the modern economy and which provides colleges with their important social function to widen access and reduce inequalities.</p><p>Colleges have come a long way in recent years in making themselves more responsive to the needs of a much more diverse working population; to the needs of mature, part-time and disabled students; to the needs of women students with families; to the needs of younger students from groups for whom, in days past, a college education would have been only a pipe dream; and to the needs of the ethnic minority groups who were, at one time, completely left behind.</p><p>We must not forget the fact that out of the 300,000 or so total learners at college, about 75,000 are full time, which clearly means that the majority are part time. Fifty-four per cent of college students are women; the comparable figure in secondary schools is 49 per cent. Only 38 per cent of college students are in the 16 to 24-year-old age group, which many people tend to think of as the traditional student age, and 25 per cent come from the more deprived communities.</p><p>John Henderson, chief executive of Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, said:</p><p>&#8220;One of the enormous strengths of our college system is its ability to cater for a diverse range of students at different times in their lives.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say that the policy should reflect that, and that the allocation of Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council money must ensure that no one group is disadvantaged when it comes to aspiring to a college education. He pointed out that per head spending in further education is traditionally lower than it is in higher education and secondary education, and that the college sector, which derives a much greater percentage of its funding from the public purse is, obviously, more susceptible to budget cuts.</p><p>As members know, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has announced that he is keen on college audits. Let me assist him with that. First&#8212;notwithstanding the fact that there are many people, including many members of the Education and Culture Committee and its recent witnesses, who have found it exceedingly difficult to pick their way through the unintelligibility of some of the data that has been presented to us as we scrutinise the current budget&#8212;is the issue of the overall college budget spend.</p><p>We acknowledge that there are cuts to the overall Scottish budget and that, by definition, the Scottish Government has to make cuts&#8212;we accept that, and we acknowledge that some of those decisions are difficult. However, let us be clear: the decisions about where priority spending should be within Scottish education are entirely a matter for the Scottish Government. The college sector, many businesses across Scotland and the Opposition parties have all combined to send a strong message to the Scottish Government that it is unacceptable that our colleges have been the target of such significant cuts. As the Labour Party amendment rightly points out, those cuts mean that college funding over the next three years is set to be reduced by a quarter&#8212;that was central to the Audit Scotland report and its concerns that such cuts present major challenges to the entire sector.</p><p>Most important, there has been a disproportionate cut to teaching budgets&#8212;the very budgets that the college sector tells us make the greatest difference to the quality of coursework that is on offer in our colleges. That means, despite a &#163;24 million transfer from the employability fund to colleges&#8212;we are waiting to hear the detail of that&#8212;there will be a 15.8 per cent cut to teaching budgets in academic year 2012-13 compared with 2010-11, which means that &#163;73 million will be lost. Since 2009-10, we know that 2,300 jobs have been lost in the sector, and that some college courses have been cut and some have disappeared altogether. We are being told by many students and staff that class sizes are likely to grow in order to cope, which is not the best advert for a sector that has worked so hard to improve standards and which is striving to become more flexible, not less. It is not surprising that the sector now has a major bone of contention with the Scottish Government because it does not believe that that is any of its fault.</p><p>Secondly, on the question of participation, we know that the number of female learners has declined by more than 26 per cent since academic year 2006-07 and, although some of that can be explained by demographic changes, that is by no means the whole story. Worse still, when we compare that with what has happened to male student numbers, we find that it is twice the rate of decline. Much of the reason for that is the fact that the Scottish Government has chosen to prioritise full-time courses for younger students because of the youth unemployment situation. Indeed, the First Minister said in the chamber last week that that was the priority because full-time places are more likely to lead to jobs. That is perhaps not the best message that the First Minister has ever sent out.</p><p>We know that women students are much more likely to want to take up evening or weekend courses, which are structured to suit the changing demands of women and their families, and which are the very kind of courses that were designed to encourage more women to take up college places so that they could enter the labour market.</p><p>At this point, I want to mention the issue of mobility. One of the huge advantages of colleges has been their local dimension and their ability to provide for those who do not have the resources to travel longer distances. That is particularly true of women who have busy lives with their families. How sad it would be if we saw a reversal of the good work in that area.</p><p>So far, the Scottish Government has not come back with many public rebuttals, except to say that it has laid on more childcare facilities. It has, but that will not be much good if the college places are not there in the first place.</p><p>What do we make of the situation for those students for whom college education was previously only a pipe dream, who clearly form a large part of the 16-to-19 initiative that the Scottish Government claims is a priority and for whom colleges such as John Wheatley College have been doing excellent work? They are the very students who need greater support, whether through one-to-one or small-group attention, or through help with their coursework, which they are often less able to do on their own.</p><p>It is my firm understanding that one of the key rationales behind regionalisation was to ensure that there was greater scope for flexibility so that diverse needs would be catered for. I have heard the cabinet secretary say several times that he wants college reform to remove what he describes as the dreadful Thatcherite structures that led to far too much autonomy and overlap of course provision. If his plans to withdraw greater autonomy mean that too many courses are shut down, it is little wonder that he is now on the receiving end of the sharpest criticism. Week by week, we are getting evidence that there are problems. At Carnegie College, for example, three courses&#8212;one of which was at higher national diploma level&#8212;have gone and, at Inverness College, there are now not enough supervisors to cope with some technical course provision, so how on earth can the Scottish Government argue that its policies are widening access? I do not understand the Government&#8217;s reason for that approach, and I suggest that the colleges&#8212;which have warned the Government time after time of the folly of its position&#8212;do not, either.</p><p>On that note, over the past 24 hours, we have seen extraordinarily heated exchanges between a college chair&#8212;who has now resigned&#8212;and the cabinet secretary. None of us in the chamber, except the cabinet secretary, is in a position to know the full facts about the management of the meeting in question and&#8212;perhaps even more important&#8212;about what communications have taken place. However, given the claims and counterclaims that now exist, which I suggest have been around for some time in the sector, about allegations of cultural bullying from the cabinet secretary, I suggest that there is now a case to answer and that the cabinet secretary should be called before the Education and Culture Committee.</p><p>I heard the committee&#8217;s convener say this morning that he does not believe that there is any need for that, but I think that there are many members who beg to differ. If I may say so, I do not consider it appropriate for the convener of any parliamentary committee&#8212;who may, after all, have to act as arbiter on such a matter&#8212;to be judge and jury at the same time. Any convener&#8217;s first responsibility is to his or her committee.

We also agree that the state has no greater responsibility than to ensure that children who for one reason or another are not born into a secure and loving family&#8212;immediate or extended&#8212;are properly looked after.</p><p>We are also clear that although hundreds of social workers across Scotland work tirelessly to do their very best for every child in difficult circumstances&#8212;as Hanzala Malik alluded to&#8212;nothing can replace the love and security of a permanent and stable family environment. The evidence is overwhelming, whatever criteria are used, so it goes without saying that that must be the overall policy objective.</p><p>Within that policy objective, we must be clear that it is the child and his or her immediate family&#8212;whatever the definition of that may be&#8212;that matters most and that policy making must reflect the very diverse range of needs. If I interpret correctly all the current briefings on the matter and the Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions in the children and young people bill, plus all the as yet incomplete conclusions that have been drawn by the Education and Culture Committee, then it is clearly important to design policies that will be in the best interests of the child and their family or carers, but that at the same time will articulate with local authority structures, with schools, with healthcare and with financial pressures. There is a temptation to devise policy the other way round, which is the last thing that we want to do. Barnardo&#8217;s makes the compelling point that that can only frustrate moves to ensure that there is a quick and right decision for the child. We note the improvements that Barnardo&#8217;s believes need to be made.</p><p>It has been very good to celebrate national adoption week and to hear the updates on adoption policy from the Scottish Government, which can help to inform members as we enter the next phase. However, there is still some other expert evidence to come. We have an obligation to listen carefully to it and to weigh up the implications before we move further on some aspects of policy. As Stewart Maxwell said, there is a need to talk to real people on the front line.</p><p>The Scottish Government has acknowledged, as has each of the Opposition parties, that more has to be done to provide workable and equitable solutions rather than just present the statistics and diagnose the problems. How often have we been told at committee that we are very good at that part, but much less good at providing meaningful action, particularly&#8212;as Malcolm Chisholm and Liam McArthur said&#8212;in the earliest stages of children&#8217;s lives?</p><p>I remember that, in their evidence to the committee, Claire Burns, the strategic policy manager for CELCIS, and the Educational Institute of Scotland said that there has been little improvement when it comes to taking the desired action, although we have been very good at diagnosing the problems. In other words, there have been lots of attempts to do things, but they have not always had the greatest impact.</p><p>What lessons need to be learned from the experts on the ground? What can we do as politicians to ensure that there are significant qualitative improvements in the life chances of adopted and looked-after children?</p><p>Some issues that relate to the decision-making process must be addressed. The convener of the Education and Culture Committee set out the challenge contained in the wealth of written and oral evidence that has been presented to us on some key themes. First, as has been reiterated by several former councillors who are now members of the Parliament, local authorities are not yet skilled enough at bringing greater coherence to decision making, particularly when it comes to involving council officers across lots of different departments. It is good to hear the Scottish Government&#8217;s intentions on that, especially in relation to dealing with some of the discrepancies.</p><p>The spirit of GIRFEC is definitely out there, but the practicalities still present problems. It has been pointed out that sometimes there is not enough of a multidisciplinary approach to training among professionals. That issue was raised by Graham Donaldson, among others, when he examined how childminders and teachers could be assisted to provide crucial educational support in the earliest years for children who are perhaps going through some difficulties.</p><p>It has also been pointed out that, in terms of decision making, it is often the financial concerns of local authorities that drive the policy, rather than some of the other factors that we should look at to achieve better qualitative outcomes. Implicit in such comments is the suggestion that we need to take more seriously the role that the voluntary sector can play in providing additional support.</p><p>It has obviously been pointed out that in some areas local communities and local voluntary sector organisations can provide some of the greatest support to potential adoptive parents and to families when there is perhaps a desire to become adoptive parents but, for one reason or another, there are problems. The views of the voluntary sector are crucial.</p><p>There is a wealth of evidence that suggests that a lack of permanence and stability in childhood can have significantly negative impacts further into people&#8217;s lives. We cannot sit back and wait and hope that things will change without a different intervention approach in the earliest years. It has been good to hear that there is a will in the Parliament to make that happen. As Nanette Milne said, we are happy to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion, and both the Labour and Liberal amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been very clear from the contributions to the debate&#8212;many of which were based on significant personal experience&#8212;that everyone agrees that there is no greater responsibility than bringing up children.

They should be immensely proud of what they have achieved, no doubt in the face of stiff competition from lots of other scout groups. While it is a great result for the six of them, I am sure that they would want to put on the record their thanks to the whole 5th Fife scout group in Kirkcaldy for helping them to achieve their national success and provide wider recognition of the merits of the scouting movement.</p><p>For exactly the reasons that Dennis Robertson spoke about, the scout movement is at the bedrock of the support for young people between the ages of 12 and 18 as they develop personally, physically and emotionally. I never fail to be impressed by the way in which the scout movement adapts to the challenges that are faced by young generations, which change over time even if there are some similarities. It is that ability to move with the times that I admire so much in the scout movement. The range of exciting opportunities that are provided to people are invaluable when it comes to later life.</p><p>As David Torrance said in his opening speech, all too often we in the Parliament are confronted with negative stories surrounding what is a tiny minority of young people in Scotland. That disproportionate attention sometimes threatens to diminish the good news, so it is always a pleasure to be able to support worthy causes such as this one, particularly as the group has successfully encouraged more youngsters to join as time has gone on. Other members have mentioned the increase in national scout membership, but I am particularly impressed by the fact that the membership in the Kirkcaldy district has increased for 10 years in a row. That is a considerable achievement given what is happening in some other areas of extra-curricular activity.</p><p>Indeed, these days, there is even more reason to encourage all youngsters to participate in scouting or similar activities, given the movement&#8217;s track record in providing its members with relevant skills, self-esteem and confidence, as well as the opportunity to make the many lasting friendships that come about as a result of the work that such groups do in their local communities.</p><p>Before the debate, I took a quick look at the Kirkcaldy district scout group&#8217;s new website and annual report. I was hugely impressed by the significant contribution that the scouts have made to their local community and the diverse range of activities that they pursue, whether that is helping in old people&#8217;s homes, doing a beach clean or whatever. I was particularly impressed by the fact that it was the first group to have a sleepover in Deep Sea World. I trust that it was not underwater, but I congratulate the scouts on that, too.</p><p>One section of the report that really stood out for me was the chairman&#8217;s comments. He wrote:</p><p>&#8220;I make no apologies for placing on written record once again my genuine and heartfelt thanks to each and every adult leader and helper who work tirelessly to provide exciting and enjoyable Scouting activities for the young people throughout the District. Without their commitment and enthusiasm the District would not be as successful as it is so to each and every one of you ... THANK YOU!!&#8221;</p><p>As parliamentarians, we also thank them. This evening&#8217;s debate is a timely opportunity to highlight the need for more adult volunteers to come forward to help with local beavers, cubs, scouts and explorer groups. I know from the conversations that I have had with scouts, cadets and girls brigade groups all over Perthshire and other areas of Mid Scotland and Fife that the level of volunteering is still a major issue, but the success of the 5th Fife scout group should be an inspiration to everyone.

We can never be too vigilant when it comes to defending the young from abuse, abandonment, exploitation, neglect, poverty and harassment. It is, therefore, apt that we should praise the NSPCC for its long and distinguished involvement in the protection of children in our society. It has made a significant impact in its 128-year history. However, as Jamie Hepburn said, that work is, sadly, becoming ever more demanding.</p><p>Today in Scotland, 90,000 children live in poverty, one in 10 has suffered parental neglect, one in 100 has suffered severe physical neglect and thousands&#8212;I think that we do not know the exact number&#8212;live in households where there is either alcohol or substance misuse, or both. For many children, the sad reality is that Scotland is not a safe and secure country in which to grow up.</p><p>I have long admired the work of the NSPCC. No one can have failed to be moved by the television campaign that brought home the harsh reality that children across the United Kingdom face. The positive work that the NSPCC undertakes makes a real difference to the lives of many children. The Renfrewshire programme that Hugh Henry highlights in his motion is clearly helping to address child neglect, but it also provides positive support to parents. As Neil Bibby said in his opening remarks, that is probably the most important focus for the programme&#8217;s work. Helping parents and future parents to understand and respect their responsibilities in the home and in wider society is crucial, and is probably the most effective preventative work that can be done. As the NSPCC website states,</p><p>&#8220;Being a parent is one of the most rewarding jobs in the world but it&#8217;s also one of the most challenging.&#8221;</p><p>In some communities in Scotland, we probably now have a third generation of parents who lack good parenting skills. There is a vicious cycle of poor parenting that, in turn, has resulted in unacceptable child neglect. Neglect can occur as far back as pregnancy if the mother abuses substances. Once a child is born, a parent or carer can neglect them by failing to provide adequate food, clothing or shelter, by failing to protect them from physical and emotional harm or danger, by failing to ensure access to medical treatment when needed, or by failing to respond to their emotional needs. I am sure that every member of the Parliament will have come across incidences of child neglect in their constituencies. We all know that such cases, by their nature, are difficult and complex and that they highlight the desperate situations in which many children find themselves.</p><p>The NSPCC programme has set itself the important goal of supporting more than 1,600 families in seven locations in the United Kingdom over two and a half years. I am sure that the Scottish Government will review the outcome of the programme to see what lessons can be learned. Along with many other members, I have been hugely impressed by the NSPCC&#8217;s online resources. I hope that the Scottish Government minister will consider how that first-class help and information can be made more readily available.</p><p>I am pleased that good progress is being made to improve child protection and the inspection regime, which is just as important, and that consideration is being given to how we can respond better to vulnerable children&#8217;s needs.</p><p>I record my congratulations to Hugh Henry on bringing the debate to Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my thanks to Hugh Henry for securing this debate and recognise his work in this important area over a number of years.

I suggest that the starting block is to ensure that we build on projects that we know have worked and for which there is therefore quantitative and qualitative evidence that progress has been made.</p><p>We all have constituency examples of such projects but, to my mind, the first issue is not just the extremely important one of expanding the numbers involved; it is much more about the quality of the experience. As other members pointed out, it is about an on-going experience on a longer-term basis.</p><p>Secondly, it is about access to professionally trained PE teachers and trainers, as well as making life very much easier for people to volunteer. I note carefully what the Scottish Sports Association said about employer-related schemes. John Park made a good remark about the apprenticeship scheme. There are obstacles in the way of people, who are more inclined to opt out of volunteering than to opt in.</p><p>It is good to hear that the Scottish Government is about to build in a new sports strategy. That is essential. It is also good that the Government is making some progress on the two hours of PE. However, I ask the minister urgently to address the problem about qualified PE teachers, of whom we have seen a decline. Margo MacDonald has made the point several times in Parliament that quality in PE teachers is essential.</p><p>The third issue is improving facilities, rather than just having more of them. Jenny Marra said that some of the tennis facilities in Dundee are simply not acceptable. No one will be attracted to play when playing fields, changing rooms and&#8212;sadly, in some cases&#8212;pavilions are run down and there are considerable restrictions on facilities.</p><p>However, it is also to do with ensuring that whatever strategy we come up with fully articulates with policies in other portfolios, whether that is in health, transport, housing or education. Those are the things that will make us succeed.</p><p>I am sure that we were all overawed by what happened in the summer in the Olympic and Paralympic games but, after listening to the athletes talk on television and reading what they have written in the newspapers, I note what comes across loud and clear is that what mattered most to them was what happened at a young age and the inspiration they had in their early years. Andy Murray talked about entering a major tournament at the age of 12&#8212;indeed, Luke Patience has mentioned getting into rowing at the age of seven&#8212;and we need to captivate, inspire and educate children at that young age and urge them to aspire to that kind of performance.</p><p>If we urge communities to build on the examples that we know have worked, we can create a much more prosperous country and make individuals, families and the communities where they work happier and healthier.

It is entirely right that the Education and Culture Committee tackles the very difficult question of whether it is right to remove children from their parents if the latter are unable to demonstrate that they can cope effectively.

That is fraught with all kinds of difficulties and we will certainly not support any extension of the nanny state to interfere in matters that are not for Government.

Although there may be many divisions between us as we respond to the current debates about what constitute appropriate definitions of family and marriage, there is no dispute at all about the need to do more to help groups that provide crucial support when families&#8212;of whatever shape or form&#8212;find themselves in difficulty. We have cross-party agreement on that but, as was the case in the drugs debate, the next stage will be the real test. Can we lift the debate, as Nanette Milne said, away from just warm words, and on to a level that involves meaningful action, however difficult and challenging that may have to be?</p><p>As with the drugs debate, we are talking about an issue that is hugely complex and pervasive, and no party can ever pretend that it has all the answers. It would be grossly naive and arrogant for anyone to assume that they had all the answers, but we can say that we must have the courage of our convictions and not just stand by and do nothing but, instead, take a lead from groups such as the Grampian Family Support Forum.</p><p>As several colleagues have said, the effects of addiction can make family life lonely and emotionally draining. The families who are affected need help; most often, they need it from within their most immediate communities. That is what makes the Grampian Family Support Forum so special. The same is true of the Fife alcohol and drug partnership and, in the case of kinship care, of family group conferencing. Such groups are crucial in opening up avenues of discussion and breaking down barriers of discrimination or ignorance among some sections of society.</p><p>As the Parliament knows, the forthcoming children&#8217;s services bill will be a major piece of legislation that will provide us all with an opportunity to do things differently and to tackle head on the complexities that we face. Members of the Education and Culture Committee have already faced some challenging questions as we have taken preliminary evidence from many experts who work on the front line of helping children and struggling families. That comes on the back of the hugely important debate about kinship care, on which, to be frank&#8212;as Neil Bibby said&#8212;none of us can take credit for progress, which has been slow. That is doubly alarming, given the promises that Parliament made on kinship care some years back. We have failed to make things much better, so it is essential that we start by understanding the exact nature of the problem, given the extent of the cross-party support and the political will to help.</p><p>In two recent Education and Culture Committee meetings, we have been challenged on the inherent problems in defining and measuring outcomes, and we have been challenged to appreciate the real barriers that prevent better progress. Perhaps most difficult of all is that we have been told that the evidence base is patchy and inconsistent. How can we deal with a problem when we cannot put our hands on all the necessary data? That question needs the most careful attention, and groups such as the Grampian Family Support Forum can be instrumental in ensuring that families&#8212;who might well be extremely reluctant to come forward in any other forum&#8212;can first be rediscovered, and secondly be helped confidentially.</p><p>We need to be clear that Parliament is setting out on a difficult and probably tortuous journey, during which it will be not just politicians who can make a difference, but the volunteers and professionals on the ground who have the first-hand experience that we have not. Debates such as this are so important because it is immensely encouraging to see that we have the necessary political will and cross-party support.

They should instead be a meaningful employment opportunity. As Iain Gray pointed out in his good speech, the definition of that is vitally important. The employment opportunity must also be fulfilling and be for the longer term, as came through strongly in the discussions at the Finance Committee meeting yesterday.</p><p>No one is pretending that the job is easy, particularly when it is set against trends in the global economy. It demands detailed scrutiny of exactly where the problem lies, and a well-evidenced analysis of where the policy and spending focus should be. Yesterday and today, my colleagues Gavin Brown and Mary Scanlon have been asking the Scottish Government some very important questions on that front. They have asked it to be clear about the exact causes of unemployment among our young people, and about the quantitative and qualitative measurements by which it intends to judge whether their policy focus is a success. That point was made very well by John Park and Liam McArthur.</p><p>The minister has rightly said that local business forums can be very helpful in the micromanagement that is required in employment policy. She was right to say that that also includes schools, colleges and universities. That will succeed only if there is a transparent approach and an accepted rationale for where spending is greater and likely to have its best effect.</p><p>My colleagues and other members are keen to tease out of the minister a little more about the criteria that she is using to award six local authorities additional resources. That comes back to Jenny Marra&#8217;s point. Nobody is disputing the reason for doing that, but they want to know the criteria by which the awards are being made possible, and how we will assess the success of the additional resources.</p><p>The point that was made by several Labour members is crucial: training programmes have to be tailored to suit the skills of young people, rather than the young people being developed to suit the training programmes. I do not accept the high percentages that are sometimes bandied about in some quarters, which say that the vast majority of our young people are unemployable.</p><p>I do accept&#8212;not least because it is the very consistent and powerful contention from virtually every part of the highly respected business community in Scotland&#8212;that far too many young people do not have the right skills and, sadly, are not sufficiently well schooled in the basics of literacy and numeracy, or sufficiently aware of the professional approach that is required in the work place. Yesterday, we saw another report on our schools which&#8212;yet again&#8212;highlighted the need for more action in that area, particularly in our deprived communities.</p><p>Once again, I stress the importance that the Scottish Conservatives attach to dealing with the issue at the youngest possible age. It is all very well for Governments to be talking about colleges and universities widening access&#8212;which is entirely right&#8212;and setting a certain number of places aside for students from disadvantaged communities, but&#8212;to be quite frank&#8212;that is not where the focus should be. That point is too late in the day for many young people, which is why we need to tackle that issue earlier, particularly in primary school.</p><p>Provided that employers buy into its philosophy and new exam structure, the curriculum for excellence should be a real opportunity to make the school experience much more meaningful to each individual, and to combine that with much greater rigour when it comes to the basic skills. That, combined with taking on board what Donaldson, Roe and Christie all said to us, should allow us to make much better progress when it comes to their developing the right skills.</p><p>It is by those means that we can hope to change attitudes to technical and vocational training, and to remove the still-persistent view that a non-university education is somehow second class. In his excellent speech in this chamber last week, Sir Tom Hunter had some extremely important things to say to us, as some members have mentioned. We need more imagination and creativity about how we can instil the entrepreneurial spirit in more of our young people. There are many other entrepreneurs who want to see the Scottish Government make much greater efforts to encourage private sector capital into the process. That needs much greater attention if there is to be a fully coherent approach in the manner that the minister has said she wants. That can only happen if we remove the barriers that prevent some employers from taking on new apprentices.</p><p>We can argue a lot about the numbers and about what constitutes an apprenticeship and what does not. I am sure that that has some importance, but so does the qualitative aspect of what we are doing and that, in turn, demands a much more robust, transparent and evidence-based policy.</p><p>I support the amendment in the name of Mary Scanlon.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The contributions to this debate, which have been fiery at times, put into sharp perspective the extent of the challenge that we all face in tackling the great scourge that is any society that is scarred by the unemployment of far too many young people.

I am delighted that Ardroy outdoor education centre has reopened and I add my congratulations to all those who fought extraordinarily hard to ensure that that was the end result, particularly as they had to fight against some very difficult financial circumstances.</p><p>John Park made clear the valuable role that Ardroy has played over a long period of time in helping young people in Fife to develop their skills, confidence and environmental awareness. He also made plain the strength of positive feeling towards the centre among many who have experienced its programmes. The fact that the centre is already fully booked until well into next year, whichever of the 17 different outdoor activities is being pursued, speaks volumes about the need for Ardroy. It would be unacceptable for so many Fife primary school children to lose the opportunity of attending this wonderful facility. I have no doubt at all, especially during the implementation of the curriculum for excellence, that the wider educational experience that such centres can bring will be an increasingly important part of any young person&#8217;s school career. John Park is absolutely right to say that it is appropriate that this debate comes just after the important debate that we had this afternoon about the skills that are required.</p><p>The benefits of outdoor education are well known. It enhances the self-esteem, the self-discipline and the confidence of the young person and it gives children the teamwork skills that are essential for the workplace and in later life. It gives them a healthier and more active outlook on life, makes them more aware of a different environment, in some cases, and it gives them&#8212;especially at the end of their primary school career&#8212;a new independence and self-reliance that helps them to mature into young adults. As David Torrance said, it can also help to lay the foundations for the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s award or the John Muir award, which is immensely valuable. However, I would argue strongly that it is the residential aspect of the experiences that can be the most powerful, especially if they can be enjoyed over a week or two weeks and in locations that are far removed from the young person&#8217;s home environment. Those are the best learning situations.</p><p>There are other lessons to be learned from the Ardroy experience&#8212;lessons that were part of an interesting discussion that took place at this week&#8217;s Education and Culture Committee when, in the presence of some expert witnesses, we debated how best to ensure that there was much better strategic planning of local government and a much better understanding of how the public, voluntary and private sectors could work more effectively together to lay on diverse qualitative educational experiences for our young people.</p><p>It is not exaggerating things too much to say that there was considerable concern among some of the witnesses that, although we have some marvellous facilities on offer in Scotland, we do not always get the strategic planning right. There are some serious issues to do with how we could try to improve that co-operation in partnership between the different sectors.</p><p>It was pointed out in a written submission to the committee from Scottish Outdoor Education Centres that unless there is a different, broader approach to those issues, the future of some outdoor education centres, including Ardroy, could be under threat. SOEC pointed out the need to involve more stakeholders in the early strategic decision making. Sometimes our approach to the need for those facilities is a bit short term, and there can be a lack of transparency about how local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors could come together.</p><p>It is excellent news that Ardroy is back in business&#8212;I am delighted that John Park has highlighted that&#8212;but there are other messages, too, and a wider perspective that we need to address.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ardroy Outdoor Education Centre"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Park on the motion.

The article went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;by the time people are out of their 40s altogether they will opt for a more sedate lifestyle more of which will be based indoors rather than outdoors&#8221;.</p><p>It also said that, once people are over 50, they become very risk averse.</p><p>I will leave members to ponder which description best fits me but, in recent months, it has been an enormous privilege for me to undertake some work with the Tayside mountain rescue team and to see at first hand the extraordinary commitment that it makes&#8212;unpaid and often in very challenging circumstances&#8212;when it provides support to members of the public who find themselves in difficulties on the hills or at sea.</p><p>Our 27 mountain rescue teams, which are assisted by three police forces and two Royal Air Force teams, are staffed by some of the finest professionals in Scotland: more than 1,000 in all. Last year, 668 persons were assisted by our teams, and a total of 24,000 hours was required in deployment, 24/7 on all 365 days.</p><p>The teams give selflessly of their time to assist others, frequently on difficult mountain terrain or in dangerous waters, in treacherous weather conditions and often at night. They do so at a time when the relatively small amount of public money that they receive is under considerable pressure, and when charitable giving is constrained by the effects of the recession. When one considers that it costs a minimum of &#163;6,000 to scramble a helicopter these days and that the annual grant to mountain rescue teams is &#163;339,000, that pressure is put into perspective.</p><p>Fundraising is not easy. The mountain rescue service would be the first to admit that it is viewed as very specialist, in the sense that it is relied on by only a very small number of people. It is not easy for it to compete for public money with organisations such as cancer charities, Barnardo&#8217;s or the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which obviously have a much wider public appeal. It is true that there are some additional funds that can be provided to assist with extra staff, additional equipment and the mountain weather forecast website&#8212;whose accuracy is usually first class&#8212;but we should be in no doubt about the pressure under which mountain rescue teams find themselves when it comes to financing their activities.</p><p>The issue also needs to be seen in the context of the fast pace of technological change. For example, the newest global positioning system and avalanche detection monitors that are now commonly used in the Alpine countries, which I had the privilege of watching in operation, are extremely hi-tech and expensive. I was told that, in some cases, costs have risen by up to 40 per cent in the past few years, so there is concern about how to balance safety needs with the finance that is available.</p><p>The teams are under pressure for a variety of other reasons. First, a growing number of people come to Scotland to enjoy our magnificent mountains and rugged scenery. Although that is extremely good news for us and is greatly to be welcomed from a tourism perspective, it brings its challenges. The number of older walkers and climbers is growing, and statistics indicate that an increasing number come from abroad and outwith Scotland, which makes it difficult to ensure that the public&#8212;in the widest sense&#8212;are fully educated about the potential dangers.</p><p>We often see tourists who are excited by the thought of scaling Ben Nevis or Cairngorm heading out with inadequate clothing and kit. It is easy to understand why if they come from countries where a reliable summer climate means that there is little danger in the hills. That is not so in Scotland, especially this year, when the extraordinary change in weather patterns that we experienced in the spring meant that we jumped from near Mediterranean temperatures to Arctic ones in the space of 48 hours, which had significant implications for climbers and the equipment that they required. Even in mid-May this year, some of our hills&#8212;even in places such as Glen Affric and Glen Cannich&#8212;were unusually thick with snow and became places for crampons and ice axes rather than the ordinary walking kit that we would normally expect to use.</p><p>Public awareness is a major concern for Scotland&#8217;s mountain rescue teams. The issue is how best to educate a largely ill-informed public and how to ensure that our schoolchildren grow up with some understanding of the responsibility that is required if they choose to venture on to the hills. On 10 December 2010, there was the high-profile case in the media of some climbers who ill-advisedly set out in Glen Doll against very strong advice from weather forecasters and the Met Office, only to cause 42 volunteers, a helicopter and a full medical team to be involved in their rescue. They appeared to have little appreciation of just what was required in bringing them back to safety.</p><p>Raising awareness costs money and requires a considerable amount of time on the part of the experts, who are already required to undertake intensive training. It is an issue that concerns them greatly, and one that requires some imaginative thinking if we are to make our hills a safer place.</p><p>There are controversial debates about how much signage can be displayed without spoiling our countryside and whether additional personal insurance should be considered. I understand from some members of the mountain rescue teams who have recently been on training exercises in Austria that we have many lessons to learn from some of the Alpine countries on better co-ordination of the emergency services. Such co-ordination saves valuable time on a call-out and can save lives.</p><p>It is on that theme that I would like to finish, given the impending public sector reform changes. New structures for police and fire services will have considerable implications for mountain rescue teams. There is already close co-operation between the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, but the officers of both are wary of some of the implications of the new structures and what they will mean for the best delivery of local services.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669175", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mountain Rescue Teams"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There was an article in the Sunday newspapers last weekend that ventured the opinion that, once people reach the age of 40, their spirit of adventure declines.

Some of that advice, which in many respects is similar to the advice that Willy Roe provided when he produced his report a year ago, has not made for comfortable reading. Too many youngsters are being castigated for a poor grasp of basic numeracy and literacy, for a lack of effective communication skills, for a failure to recognise the need for teamwork, for not having appropriate expectations in the workplace and, sadly, for not showing too much commitment. There has also been criticism when it comes to science, technology, engineering and mathematics&#8212;the STEM subjects&#8212;and foreign language skills, particularly from companies that are heavily involved in the production of major Scottish exports.</p><p>As the minister has said, the statistics for language teaching also give slight cause for concern. There has been a significant decline in the number of young people in the United Kingdom studying some of the key modern languages, and that has been accompanied in Scotland by similar declines in the numbers studying for some Scottish Qualifications Authority higher exam subjects, particularly German and French. The education and employers task force concluded that the UK has the worst language skills of the 27 European Union countries.</p><p>There has been concern in some quarters about teacher training places in foreign languages. There is obviously a very sharp concern about the decline in the number of foreign language assistants and, in particular, the number of local authorities who are now taking them on.</p><p>Although it would be easy to exaggerate the extent of the problem, far too many people&#8212;including many key employers&#8212;are speaking about it for us to ignore the need for radical improvement and for refocusing on the correct priorities.</p><p>I compliment the Scottish Government on its motion, but we must be thoroughly realistic&#8212;I am in some agreement with the Labour Party in this respect&#8212;about tackling the malaise that currently makes us bottom of the class. Apart from pursuing the laudable aims that are contained in the report, we must listen carefully to what language teachers are saying.</p><p>First, they are saying that when schools choose to start languages in primary school, it is essential that they ensure that the teachers have adequate subject knowledge and are fluent speakers themselves. Obviously, there must be a passion and enthusiasm not only for teaching the language but for its culture.</p><p>Secondly, they make the important point that there must be progression in the learning. It must not just be a varied selection of bits and pieces, or what many schools describe as taster lessons; there must be a methodical progression if we are to ensure that the subject can be properly developed in secondary school, otherwise I think that we lose some pupils and we certainly lose some teachers who might otherwise aspire to go on and develop other languages.</p><p>They also make the very strong point that we cannot expect there to be sufficient rigour in language teaching unless the pupils have a proficiency in English. Many language teachers will say that they find life increasingly difficult because too many of their pupils come to them without a good grasp of basic grammar in English and therefore, naturally, have little chance of picking up a second language, never mind a third.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In recent weeks politicians, including many in this Parliament, have been on the receiving end of some very blunt advice from employers in Scotland, much of it relating to the employability&#8212;or, sadly, otherwise&#8212;of some of our graduates and young apprentices.

It is an important issue.</p><p>As Neil Findlay pointed out, there has been a very substantial decline in the number of foreign language assistants. I do not think that we can sit back and simply accept that. I understand that there are huge financial pressures on local authorities and that it is very difficult for them to ensure that they can provide employment for those people, but let me suggest two things that we might consider doing.</p><p>First, there is a huge wealth of talent among our retired teachers of languages in schools. I do not believe that we cannot use their expertise and services by asking them to help in classrooms as assistants, especially when many of them are willing to do that. We should also at least pursue the opportunity presented by the fact that some people in business&#8212;particularly those who are key in the export industries&#8212;might be prepared to put a little money into helping to provide language assistants in our classrooms. The Government would do well to look at that.</p><p>The curriculum must have a firm and renewed focus, so that sufficient time is made available for teaching languages. We should be under no illusion about the logistics involved in that. How often have we heard teachers complain that their subject has been diluted in recent years because they have had to share a timetable space or to miss out on pupil contact time in specific year groups&#8212;for example, by providing one social science in secondary 1 and another social science in S2? As has been mentioned, we must not forget that coming into the equation is the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy on Scottish studies, for example, for which additional space must be found. There are plenty of practical things to think about. We must ensure that enough curriculum space is available and that course content has sufficient rigour.</p><p>A not unrelated issue is the role that languages can play in university entrance and ensuring that appropriate credit is given to languages in the group of qualifications with which a student seeks a place at university. Some of the decline in the number of pupils who sit SQA exams in languages began at the same time as fewer universities required pupils to have an additional language in their S4 and S5 exam diet. When we are debating the merits of a baccalaureate system, there is an opportunity to look at how that might play out in relation to university entrance.</p><p>I have no difficulty with the broad aims of the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals. Addressing the languages problem is long overdue, but the policy needs to be carefully thought through so that we do not just pay lip service to a worthy ambition. There must be consistency, a methodical and rigorous approach and the necessary practical adjustments to the timetable to make the aim happen.</p><p>I have pleasure in moving amendment S4M-03004.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, but recognises that this ambitious programme cannot be achieved without renewed focus on the training of qualified foreign language teachers and without substantially increasing the number of foreign language assistants in Scotland&#8217;s schools.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yes.

As various speakers have noted, learning a language is not only a useful discipline in itself but can open many other doors to the history, geography and literature of the country whose language is being studied. It can also help with an understanding of the true meaning of internationalism and of how we can widen our horizons in what is an increasingly global community.</p><p>That global community is changing fast, all the time. It is becoming increasingly competitive, especially with the emergence of new economic powers, and it is vital that we respond to those changes and do not automatically assume that English is the main language of international trade.</p><p>Those employers who tell us that there must be more focus on foreign language skills when it comes to marketing Scottish products also tell us that we must not underestimate in any way the powerful effect of fluency in a language, especially with regard to business lobbying, networking, getting a job&#8212;as in the case of Claudia Beamish&#8217;s daughter&#8212;and earning a higher salary. We ignore any of those observations at our peril.</p><p>Liam McArthur and Margaret McCulloch said that many economists have calculated that the problem of insufficient language skills is a barrier to trade. In fact, they have defined it as a tax that costs the Scottish economy up to as much as &#163;591 million. The evidence for that was made clear in the CBI&#8217;s April 2011 report and can be seen in the fact that, sadly, some major European companies are bypassing Scotland when it comes to major contracts.</p><p>There must be a happy blend between meeting Scotland&#8217;s needs in a global economy and learning a language because of its intrinsic value. That is perhaps the biggest challenge that we face, because there are tensions in that regard&#8212;certainly for SQA, which rightly says that its qualifications provision will depend on demand. Although there may be perfectly legitimate and scholarly reasons for learning Latin, Greek, Hebrew or any of the other languages that do not necessarily feature on the school curriculum these days, there are powerful economic reasons for learning Mandarin, Spanish or Russian&#8212;the growing languages.</p><p>Hanzala Malik and Sandra White raised extremely important issues in that regard. They highlighted concerns&#8212;in relation to the SQA and the Scottish funding council respectively&#8212;about the exact criteria that are to be used in offering the relevant qualifications; what happens when schools, colleges and universities decide which courses they will offer their students; and which examinations students may be able to take. As I pointed out at the start of the debate, decisions on those may determine how we ensure progression from learning in the early years of primary school right through to the learning that we expect students to undertake in the tertiary sector.</p><p>I stress again the importance of ensuring that the development of the 1+2 policy and the Barcelona agreement principles, which are mentioned in the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion, is underpinned by giving pupils as firm a grasp as possible of their own language in the first instance. I know that debate very well, and I have spoken to many language teachers about it. We must have a proper balance between rigour and the old-fashioned basis of ensuring that children have a grasp of grammar, which is important, and making learning much more relevant than it perhaps was during the schooldays of many members. When I discuss with modern language teachers what we need to take language teaching forward, they raise that issue almost without fail.</p><p>I will dwell for a moment on foreign language assistants, because they are worth their weight in gold, especially if they are able to work across the transition years. As several members have said, the current scarcity of foreign language assistants, particularly in the state sector, is nothing short of a disgrace and the drop is far in excess of that south of the border.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale made an important point about how we address the resource situation. I return to the argument that I made in my opening remarks, which is that rather than focusing simply on resources being provided by local authorities, which, as we all know, have great difficulties in providing such resources just now, we must be imaginative about drawing on other resources. That could involve seeking European funding or encouraging the private sector to make at least some provision to help with classroom assistants. We must address the issue.</p><p>One of the most interesting recommendations in the working group&#8217;s report highlights the need to do much more about the transition between primary and secondary school. That is very important, not just in language teaching but in other areas of education. I am interested in drilling down further in that regard, because we need some detail&#8212;particularly in the context of curriculum for excellence&#8212;on exactly what can be done in those crucial years.</p><p>Careful planning is required, and there is an issue with finding space in the curriculum&#8212;we cannot get away from that. We have heard far too often about the difficulty of allocating time for many subjects such as physical education, history and music. There has been a great deal of publicity about that in recent months and the Government must face up to the challenge of dealing with it&#8212;it is a challenge, and I do not think that any of us are in a position to solve it. There is a dilemma in the fact that the curriculum for excellence is based on much greater flexibility, and we must ensure that no Government, of whatever political colour, decides in too much detail exactly what students are learning.</p><p>I will finish by stressing two important points that Linda Fabiani and Malcolm Chisholm raised: the need for a long-term strategy to get away from the piecemeal approach that has been taken in the past, and the importance of ensuring that any policy that we develop is based firmly on evidence.</p><p>The debate has been important and enjoyable, and I am happy to support many of the themes that have been developed.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a timely debate and it has included thought-provoking and informed contributions from many members.

However, she went on to say that it was not a debate about &#8220;ministerial direction in general&#8221;.

That vagueness, combined with the very strong concerns that many stakeholders voiced about the extent of ministerial powers, became the subject of the central debate in the committee, and rightly so.</p><p>I suggest that the cabinet secretary was much more comfortable about defining the circumstances in which she or any of her successors would not interfere than she was about defining those in which ministers might interfere.

Stewart Maxwell has convened the committee with his normal sense of humour, and with good stewardship through a quiet authority, which is valued.</p><p>The Conservatives are of the opinion that the legislation needs to be modernised so that we can maintain and enhance the National Library of Scotland. The National Library is a remarkable national asset. Like others in the chamber, I pay tribute to everyone who is involved in its work, and to the large numbers of the public who are increasingly enthusiastic supporters.</p><p>I mentioned during the stage 1 debate the move away from the National Library being what some people call the library of last resort that is used only when people have searched unsuccessfully for sources elsewhere. That is no longer an applicable definition. That is good news, but the changes clearly bring different challenges and that is why the bill is necessary.</p><p>The Scottish Government has set out its proposals for change. We fully support it in its recognition that, in a fast-changing world of technology, we must put in place structures that will help to create not only more efficient administration, but a better system of access to the National Library&#8217;s archive, and better coherency and collaboration with the other national archives. It is simply not an option to allow things to remain as they are, and that was made clear to the committee throughout the process by the cabinet secretary and by the witnesses.</p><p>Throughout the committee&#8217;s evidence taking, I was continually struck by the professionalism, the dedication and the expertise of all those involved, and by the careful thought given to the future working of the institution and its role in modern Scotland. That expertise is, in many cases, unique: it brings with it degrees of specialisms that are not seen elsewhere.</p><p>It is on that point that we had some initial concerns about the original stance of the Scottish Government, and it is the reason why we believe that the size of the National Library&#8217;s board should reflect those who can represent the wider range of the specialist knowledge. I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for listening carefully to the views expressed at both stage 1 and stage 2, many of which were of genuine concern among the key stakeholders and MSPs about the minimum size of the board. The original suggestion from the Scottish Government that the concerns could be addressed by co-options to the board, when and where appropriate, did not address the more substantial concerns about the need for permanent access to a wide range of expertise.</p><p>Similarly, to argue that the Scottish Government is, in general,</p><p>&#8220;not in favour of large boards&#8221;</p><p>is not really a satisfactory way of persuading people that the appropriate size of a board is directly linked to the best advantage of the institution and the public that it serves.</p><p>A second major concern&#8212;and one that we have debated this afternoon&#8212;is the intended extent of ministerial direction. The policy memorandum lacks detail and clarity about the precise nature of the intended ministerial powers, which could conflict with other areas of the NLS&#8217;s management in which ministers have no power. Some guarantees have been given about the promotion of greater collaboration and diversity, but my Conservative colleagues and I remain unpersuaded that the provisions in the bill are not simply about increasing ministerial power for the sake of having a little more control, but at the expense of greater efficiency in the institution.</p><p>I listened carefully to what the cabinet secretary said about that. I accept her argument in relation to some technical issues, but there is an important general principle to be considered. As I mentioned earlier, the difficulty for the committee was that the Scottish Government chose to reassure us by stipulating situations in which the cabinet secretary or her successors would not interfere. This afternoon, she again defined the issue by stating what she could not or would not do. I accept that, but there is still an important point about the powers that she could have as cabinet secretary. That approach sometimes took us into the realm of the theoretical rather than the practical, which made things less clear when it came to justifying the enhancement of public benefit.</p><p>Nobody doubts that there is a sensitive balance to be struck when it comes to the legitimate concerns about how public money is spent and the professional judgment of the trustees and the professional judgment and expertise of the librarians&#8212;some of whom are in the chamber this afternoon.</p><p>This bill brings opportunities for the delivery of a better service, for wider access to the splendid archive that is the National Library of Scotland, and for the exciting developments that the cabinet secretary outlined. On that basis, the Conservatives are happy to support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my thanks to those of Neil Findlay to Stewart Maxwell and the clerks.

Although we will undoubtedly remain divided on one important element in the bill&#8212;the extent of the ministerial powers&#8212;I acknowledge the work that she put in, which involved some complex technicalities.

The whole philosophy around the curriculum for excellence is one of seeking a rich educational experience by applying the basic core material to the diverse needs of different pupils and different schools. It tries to draw back from overprescriptive learning, excessive testing and overdependence on educational theory.</p><p>That is exactly why the recent fuss over how ready schools are to undertake the new exams should never have happened. It was perfectly understandable that schools, which have different structures and different needs, would be ready at different times, so I am still at a loss to see why the cabinet secretary expected otherwise. Instead of listening to his own advice from 2006, he got himself locked into a mindset that the state knew better than schools and parents.</p><p>What the curriculum for excellence seeks to do is to swap the acceptance of mediocrity in too many schools for an aspiration for excellence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Localism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was a bit disappointed with the minister this morning when he said that he was surprised that Mr Carlaw had not talked about policy.

That is one reason why all parties, including the SNP, have signed up to the curriculum for excellence. We have had an acceptance of mediocrity and our results show it.</p><p>What is interesting in all of this is that Michael Russell is in difficulty about where we go from here. I know that he does not like being told by a Tory about successes south of the border when it comes to changing the focus of school management, so if he will not take it from David Cameron, the Prime Minister, let us hope that he will take it from David Cameron, his namesake in Scotland, whom Michael Russell charged with looking at school reform.</p><p>David Cameron looked around the world for examples of school successes&#8212;perhaps this might help Mr Hepburn&#8212;and drew on the European Commission study of 2007 that pointed to school successes in Belgium, the Netherlands and Latvia as a result of increased teacher autonomy; he highlighted the high value attached to the teaching profession in Sweden and Finland because of the extent of teacher autonomy; he produced evidence from Latin America, where no fewer than seven countries demonstrated that the greatest success was found where there was the greatest degree of school management; and he said that there were lessons to be learned from south of the border, where the greatest desire for our free schools has been in the most deprived areas. Indeed, we know that as of February this year 50 per cent of new free schools have come from the 30 per cent most deprived areas&#8212;that tells us something.</p><p>Then there are the comments from the Scottish rural schools network that persistently demonstrate how creeping centralisation is damaging education in some of Scotland&#8217;s most rural areas. Sandy Longmuir and his colleagues have made plain their grave concerns about what they say is the &#8220;mechanistic vision&#8221; of some local authorities and central Government that pays little regard to the context of local communities. The same principles were highlighted by David Berry&#8212;an SNP councillor, no less&#8212;in East Lothian when he considered the model of trust schools.</p><p>At the weekend, we learned about the restrictions on placing requests in Edinburgh&#8212;the fact that a record number of parents are being refused places for their children at their first-choice primary school.

We were told that repetition could be both a secret weapon and the cause of our downfall. It could be a secret weapon if we used it effectively in stressing the most important points in our argument, but it could be our downfall if we were merely to repeat the obvious and lose some of the essential facts. That turns out to be true also in politics this morning, notwithstanding the fact that we are all fully agreed about the importance of the topic. We had a good debate the last time that we debated the subject, although there were&#8212;as ever&#8212;political differences. If we have to repeat ourselves a little just seven days later, perhaps that will focus our minds more carefully on the key themes and the facts.</p><p>We are all agreed that early intervention is the crucial component in determining the future health, social wellbeing and educational achievement of any child. Last week, several members pointed to various aspects of the wealth of evidence that supports that view. I reread the Official Report from last week and, although I agree with some of Johann Lamont&#8217;s comments, I note that the main themes in that debate were the quantity of the hours on offer, the quality of provision within those hours, the flexibility to allow parents to take up their entitlements and, crucially, the need to ensure that childcare policies articulate with our other social and economic policies. The motion and the amendment both reflect that we probably need to take slightly different approaches to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of that care. I do not see any difficulties in that. They are not mutually exclusive, and the advice that we have been given&#8212;both by SPICe and by some of the legal team&#8212;is that they can work effectively alongside each other.</p><p>However, I hope that we can probe the SNP a little further on exactly what provisions it foresees in the children&#8217;s services bill on flexibility in how parents can take up their entitlements and on the use of qualified care staff, which obviously has implications for contracts and so on. Having that information before the division bell rings this evening would be helpful.</p><p>It is clear that extending the total number of hours matters not just because it is one way of ensuring that we provide more opportunities for our children but because it will allow us to catch up with and&#8212;should the Scottish Government succeed in keeping its manifesto commitment&#8212;overtake the progress that has been made south of the border. That is particularly important for parents to whom no partner or relative is immediately available to assist in raising their children.</p><p>The Liberals, who are absent today, were right last week to highlight the regional variations that we face in Scotland in the supply and the cost of childcare. We all agree that that is unacceptable.</p><p>The solution to the childcare issue will necessarily involve an effective combination of the educational experience that is on offer to the child and the convenience to the parent and the family. That challenge, which&#8212;let us be honest&#8212;is not easy, should focus our minds.</p><p>If there is one driving force, it is the need to ensure that the hours that are on offer are provided by qualified professionals and that, in adjusting the hours and the flexibility within them, we are mindful of the contractual arrangements for care staff and, for children from the age of three, the demands of the curriculum for excellence. Balancing the educational and practical needs is not easy. That is why we need to consider what is and is not helpful in legislative and non-legislative processes.</p><p>I think that the desire is felt across the chamber to focus on the most disadvantaged children who do not get what they are entitled to, which can put untold pressures on the budgets of the poorest families in our society. That is why it is important that we provide the extra choice dimension, which we debated at length last week, so that we can support those who stand to benefit most and who are most responsive to the changing focus of Government policy, by which I mean policy in Scotland and south of the border.</p><p>I mentioned last week that we should look at ideas from other countries and down south, where greater flexibility is available&#8212;not just in how we charge for care&#8212;to try to make the situation that little bit better.

The fact is that we are dealing with two very separate issues, the first of which is the number of hours on offer. In that respect, I think that we can all come up with slightly different answers to the question whether that requires primary legislation in all its guises.</p><p>The second issue is flexibility in the way parents who will have this entitlement use the hours. We must be very careful that we do not create a muddle here. If I read the legal team&#8217;s advice correctly, both the motion and the amendment contain factually correct points, and it will all come down to semantics and definitions about what exactly we are driving through. For that reason, I think that Claire Baker and Dennis Robertson made valid points about the basic principles underpinning what all of us on all sides of the chamber are trying to do.</p><p>These issues come down to three things. First, we are absolutely determined that the best possible childcare be on offer in all parts of Scotland and that it be provided by qualified carers and nursery teachers. That is essential and, indeed, it is what parents want. I know that many of the people who have lobbied us on the issue are concerned about that and at the back of all this lie various debates on certain contractual issues.</p><p>Secondly, as Claire Baker said, there are issues to do with the mix between the private and the public sectors. The fact that both sectors are valuable providers of care, even though they come from slightly different perspectives, adds to the choice that is available. We should not forget that that mix is essential, particularly in an age in which we want greater choice and flexibility. We need to make it possible for that mix to work as well as possible, and to ensure that private providers do not feel under pressure because of certain diktats from local authorities.</p><p>Thirdly, we should never forget that the policy is targeted at the most disadvantaged children. They, above all, are the priority, because it is they&#8212;and their parents&#8212;who need the greatest support. It was in that context that the minister referred to Bronwen Cohen&#8217;s article in The Scotsman last week, in which she threw up the challenge that we all face in striving for better articulation between care services and education. As several members have pointed out, the issue is extremely complex. Cross-party support will be required if we are to ensure that we can work through the complexities, just as we have done on other social matters that we have debated in the chamber. That is important.</p><p>Johann Lamont and Jamie Hepburn rightly flagged up the fact that part of the argument is about how well the welfare system that Westminster oversees works. As I said in last week&#8217;s debate, I am very conscious of some of the stresses and strains on that system and the arguments about whether the focus has been on the right places. I hope that the fact that some of the child benefit changes that were announced yesterday were not quite as radical as those that were originally planned is an example of that message having got home.</p><p>As Jamie Hepburn said, it is essential that we all pull together to ensure that we do what is right and proper for the educational, emotional, intellectual and social needs of our children. We look forward to hearing much more from the Scottish Government about the timing and the content of the legislative process that it intends to pursue.

Nobody in any political party in Parliament doubts how important the subject is.

It is important that we debate the matter and take it extremely seriously.</p><p>The Liberal motion rightly points to regional variations in supply and costs of childcare. We agree that that is a very difficult situation that needs to be addressed. Childcare costs in Scotland are not only among the highest in the United Kingdom, but are the most variable. The recent Daycare Trust and Children in Scotland report that has been referred to stresses how difficult that is, and that we are at the high end of cost and variability.</p><p>It is equally unacceptable that there is not so much flexibility in the system, so there is not enough choice available to parents in how they spend their entitlements. Why do I say that? If it is correct that only a fifth of local authorities have adequate facilities for parents who work full time, that is a serious hindrance. Instead of choice being about when and how to spend entitlements, it becomes about whether to work or have childcare. Naturally, that has serious consequences for some parents, especially lone parents.</p><p>It is too often the most disadvantaged children who do not get what they are entitled to. That can put untold pressures on the family budgets of the very poorest families in our society, which is why it is so important that we target early education support and care at those who stand most to benefit.</p><p>&#8220;Making Work Pay&#8212;The Childcare Trap&#8221; outlines the problems in the starkest detail. It says that 59 per cent of parents who are living in poverty said that they are no better off working and paying for childcare, compared with only 19 per cent of those with incomes over &#163;30,000; that parents in poverty almost always have to go without buying some essentials to pay for their childcare; and that a quarter of parents in poverty have had to give up work, a third have had to turn down a job and a quarter have not been able to take up education or training because of the difficulties in accessing childcare.</p><p>I do not think that anyone could argue that this is not an important time to be discussing the current childcare arrangements, particularly against the backdrop of so many other changes to social and welfare policy. The traditional structure of family life has changed beyond all recognition in recent decades, not least in respect of the fact that far fewer people are working in conventional 9-to-5 jobs. As a result, it is important to ensure that those who work unconventional hours are not disadvantaged.</p><p>I am extremely conscious of the extensive criticisms of some aspects of the Westminster Government&#8217;s welfare reform, including the child benefit part of the proposals, which I am on record as having expressed reservations about in the chamber. The concerns are sufficient for the coalition to review some of the details, but the principle of universal credit&#8212;which is to ensure that people are better off in work than they are on benefits&#8212;is the right one.

It was good to hear that the cabinet secretary will lodge an amendment at stage 2 to reflect that, because there is no doubt that the committee and the witnesses who came to it were overwhelmingly of the opinion that the smaller end of the proposed new NLS board numbers was, indeed, too small. I heard what the cabinet secretary said when she came to the committee about the possibility of co-options on to the board. It is, of course, correct to do that and that option will remain. However, I was struck by just how desirable an aim it is to have a wide range of experience on the board, so it is good that the cabinet secretary has confirmed that she is looking at that again.</p><p>I note, too, that the cabinet secretary has stated that the Scottish Government is keen on the principle that the governance of major institutions be considerably streamlined and be represented by smaller boards. Indeed, I think that the cabinet secretary said at committee that the Scottish Government is not in favour of large boards. I suggest that what is more appropriate is not so much a generalisation about the size of boards, but what works to the best advantage of the institution and the public that it serves. I fully understand that the current size of the board makes it unwieldy, but we should not go to the other extreme.</p><p>Before leaving the issue of the board, I urge the cabinet secretary to heed the advice of several stakeholders who are anxious for a smooth transition from the existing board to the new board, which will be very important if we are to carry with us the trust of all those involved.</p><p>A second major concern, which I think will continue as we debate the bill is&#8212;as the committee convener said&#8212;the intended extent of the powers of ministerial direction. There was a lack of detail and clarity in the policy memorandum about the precise nature of the intended ministerial power and about whether the power could conflict with areas of NLS management where ministers have no powers. There appear to be inconsistencies in some of the proposed changes. In fact, the chief executive was a little uncertain about how the promotion of greater collaboration and diversity would work when there seemed to be little comment in the policy memorandum about the detail of the proposed new powers.</p><p>The rest of the education, lifelong learning and culture brief shows that the Government has a record of wanting to increase ministerial power. College and university governance is just one example of that. I can understand that there are some reasons why that might lead to better governance, but I am not entirely comfortable with its being a general principle. We need a cast-iron guarantee that the moves in the bill are not simply about increasing ministerial powers but about greater efficiency for the institution.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise on behalf of my colleague Annabel Goldie, who is, sadly, not well today, and thank my colleague Alex Johnstone, who has come into the hot seat at short notice.

Much is at stake, but I hope that none of us will forget that the ultimate criteria by which we should judge this issue are what is in the best educational interests of individual pupils and how we support their teachers and parents in meeting that objective.</p><p>We must also remember that this is not a debate about the merits or otherwise of curriculum for excellence or about building consensus&#8212;I believe that we have that already. We have had those debates and time has moved on. Nor is this a debate about whether it was wise to have such a long gap between publishing many of the course development materials and setting out the details of the exams&#8212;we have had that debate as well. We are not here to make out that our classrooms are in crisis, because they are not.</p><p>However, we need to deal with the reality in those classrooms, whether it is that as exposed in the EIS survey or by the many other teachers who are in different unions or none. Curriculum for excellence is happening and we must now ensure that schools can provide as smooth a passage as possible between the new courses and the new exams in an appropriate timescale.</p><p>As I understand it, the main message from the majority of schools&#8212;and indeed parents and pupils&#8212;is that there is no fundamental objection to the main principles of curriculum for excellence or the new exams that will accompany them. Debates are quite properly going on about whether there is enough academic rigour in curriculum for excellence, whether the articulation between schools and colleges or universities is right and about the wisdom of renaming some subjects, but the basic philosophy is not in dispute.</p><p>Let us remember why we are making these changes: we are seeking to make learning more meaningful for every pupil, to instil in them an understanding of not just what they are learning but why they are learning and to develop in them skills that are cross-curricular and more relevant to the very fast-changing world in which we live.</p><p>Cut away all the unhelpful jargon and the unwelcome political correctness, and curriculum for excellence asks all schools to think more deeply about what makes a rounded, well-educated human being who is both adaptable and responsible in modern society. Crucially, it allows schools to be more flexible, and it is on that point that I believe the Scottish Government has shown its greatest weakness.</p><p>Last week, the Education and Culture Committee was emphatically told by the director of education in East Renfrewshire that its headteachers unanimously wanted to delay implementation on account of the reports that they had received that teachers&#8212;and therefore their pupils&#8212;wanted additional security. He was not trying to score points off anybody or trying to score media points. He was merely acting in the best interests of his schools. We heard from the EIS&#8212;and it produced more evidence yesterday&#8212;that it, too, believes that many schools are not ready and that it would be better in such instances to leave things for another year.</p><p>Alternatively, we heard from the SQA and Education Scotland that many schools are ready to proceed, and they told us about the dangers of any widespread delay&#8212;aspects on which I think we can all agree. I hope that we also all agree that it is right for those schools to proceed, for reasons that I note are given in the letter from the headmaster of Clifton Hall school, which the cabinet secretary quoted. It would be ridiculous to argue otherwise. However, it is also ridiculous to argue that all schools must adhere to the same timescale, especially when the cabinet secretary has told some of them that they have special circumstances.</p><p>Frankly, I do not understand why we should be surprised about the different signals that are coming out from our schools. Curriculum for excellence is a major change. Different schools and departments are starting from different points. They have different pupil numbers and they offer different subject choices across different curriculum structures. Some are ready and some are not. It is by no means the first time that that has been the case in Scottish education. We have coped before and we will cope again without doing any damage to pupils&#8217; education.</p><p>On top of that, parents and teachers are confused by the cabinet secretary&#8217;s public utterances. He offered the view that East Renfrewshire could be treated as a special case because it is not doing standard grades, but it turns out that that is not the whole picture.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662543", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Hugh Henry for bringing this timely debate to Parliament and for his suggestion that there are practical reasons for lodging the motion.

In a three-month period last year, the unemployment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds was 23.5 per cent in Scotland&#8212;which was 3.1 percentage points higher than the UK rate. The rate increased by 5.6 percentage points over the year to September to November 2011, whereas in the UK it increased by 2.2 percentage points. Over the same year, the 18 to 24 youth employment rate in Scotland decreased by 2.9 percentage points, compared with a decrease of 1.3 percentage points in the UK.</p><p>Just as concerning, however, is the wide variation in youth unemployment rates across Scotland, from just over 2 per cent in the Shetland Islands to more than 11 per cent in Clackmannanshire.</p><p>It is not difficult to see the extent of the problem, and that is why we broadly welcomed the announcement by the Scottish Government that it would be creating a new portfolio, with the minister having responsibility for youth employment.

That was all very good news, as was this afternoon&#8217;s announcement on the new social enterprise initiatives.</p><p>However, that is also why we fought so hard with the other Opposition parties to ensure that the college sector did not have to put up with the totally unacceptable original budget settlement. We are pleased that some progress has been made, but, like the convener of Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, John Spencer, we are in no doubt about the significant challenges that remain in the college sector as a result of the disproportionate cuts, the factual context of which we have set out in our amendment.

What must be done specifically by the Scottish Government, as opposed to moves that can be made by the Westminster Government and international markets to alleviate the pain of the global recession? Addressing unemployment among young people is not a matter of having a single policy&#8212;that was clearly flagged up in the Smith group report&#8212;and it is not all about economic policy. There are social issues, too. It is not long since we debated in the chamber the importance of policies in the early years strategy.</p><p>There are young people who are suffering from on-going structural changes in the economy and the resulting mismatch of skills. We should be mindful of the fact that, although the vacancy rate has shown a modest decline in the past year, nearly half of that vacancy rate reflects the fact that employers still do not believe that some of those workers have the appropriate skills. I return to a point that I think I mentioned in a previous debate about what Willy Roe said in his excellent report, which the Scottish Government has commented on.

It is not just about ensuring that young people have the right knowledge; they need to have the right attitude, the right skills and the right knowledge in that order.

We debated that this morning in the context of the findings of the McCormac and Donaldson reports, which suggest that we need to do far more to ensure that all schools&#8212;not just the majority&#8212;strive for excellence and strive to deliver the opportunities that are appropriate to the needs of our young people rather than appropriate to the needs or convenience of a political philosophy that is either too state interventionist or too beholden to extending bureaucracy.</p><p>Nothing is more important than creating jobs and ensuring that our young people have the right skills to fill them.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01978.3, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;and notes that, following the debate on the Budget (Scotland) Bill on 8 February 2012, the total financial settlement for the Scottish Funding Council further education programme is now &#163;559.7 million for 2011-12, &#163;526.4 million for 2012-13, &#163;494.7 million for 2013-14 and &#163;470.7 million for 2014-15, which is a cash-terms cut of &#163;33.3 million in the first year.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy that Mr Dibsdall&#8217;s comment is on the public record, which is what I quoted from last week.

Given that success, however, why have we each received thousands of e-mails from students, staff and trade union members expressing concerns about the future of our college sector and seen several question times in the Parliament and numerous column inches devoted to exactly the same issue?</p><p>At last Thursday&#8217;s education questions, the issue of college funding was raised in no fewer than seven out of 18 questions, but the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&#8212;with his usual modesty&#8212;did not appear to be in the least bit concerned. Indeed, he even accused the Opposition parties of not accepting the truth about spending on Scottish education, of always looking back rather than forward and of not listening to what he was saying.</p><p>I am in a relatively charitable mood this morning. The Scottish Conservatives want to debate the truth about spending on Scottish education; we are happy to look forward rather than back, and we are even happy to listen to the cabinet secretary, however painful that may be.</p><p>We have before us the Budget (Scotland) Bill and the worthy supporting document over which I am sure Mr Swinney has expended&#8212;and, I hope, is still expending&#8212;much time and energy. If the cabinet secretary would like to have a look at page 24 of the supporting document, he will see what has happened to college funding.</p><p>I know that Mr Swinney will want me to put that in the factual context, so I will do just that. He has faced some tough choices: fact. He produced an extra &#163;15 million transformation fund to help with college rationalisation and reform: fact. That &#163;15 million therefore reduces year 1 of the budget cuts from &#163;38 million to &#163;23 million: fact.</p><p>However, let us dig a little deeper and pursue some of the other facts, which I suspect the SNP does not like quite so much. The consequences of the tough United Kingdom situation have resulted in a real-terms cut of 1.3 per cent&#8212;that is the Scottish National Party&#8217;s own figure&#8212;so it would be unfair of me to stand here and argue if Mr Russell had asked Mr Swinney to make similar savings in the Scottish FE budget.</p><p>However, what no one can understand&#8212;however hard they try&#8212;is why, at a time when there are no fewer than 88,000 young people aged 18 to 24 unemployed in Scotland, and when the Scottish Government has a flagship policy to provide a training opportunity, education or work for all 16 to 19-year-olds, the college sector is being asked to cope with cuts of 8.5 per cent in teaching grants on top of all the cuts that it faced last year. The colleges are being asked to cope with a cut in funding from &#163;544 million to &#163;470 million. There will be progressive cuts of &#163;38 million in year 1&#8212;less &#163;15 million&#8212;&#163;50 million in year 2, and &#163;74 million in year 3, so that by 2015 there is an annual cut of &#163;74 million. They wonder what on earth they have done wrong.</p><p>At last week&#8217;s education questions, Mr Russell said that he would prefer politicians to listen to the experts in the college sector rather than deal in their own spin, so let us do that. John Spencer, convener of Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, has said twice that it is inconceivable that colleges will be able to absorb more cuts without harm being done to student places, staffing or the quality of courses. We now know that those cuts could amount to over 20 per cent in real terms, assuming that student support is maintained at a flat cash level. That view is echoed by Miles Dibsdall, principal of Edinburgh&#8217;s Telford College, who has said:</p><p>&#8220;To think that the sector could operate or indeed maintain provision after having our budget slashed by 10 per cent last year was challenging, but to have them reduced again over the next three years is just baffling. This is an incredibly difficult feat and I dread to think of what the sector will look like in a few years&#8217; time when these new cuts are felt.&#8221;</p><p>Robin Parker of the National Union of Students has said that the SNP was absolutely right in May to promise to protect college budgets but &#8220;absolutely wrong&#8221; to be proposing such extensive cuts at a time of such large-scale youth unemployment&#8212;a view shared by Andy Willox of the Federation of Small Businesses.</p><p>Why has the Scottish Government chosen to punish the colleges so hard, particularly in the current economic circumstances?</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660274", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Colleges (Funding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The sector in Scottish education that has made the most substantial progress in recent years is further education.

They are telling him very bluntly that many of the savings and efficiencies have already been made and that there is less and less scope for cuts without paring down some of the most essential parts of the sector. Colleges are looking at their budgets for 2012-13 and having to focus on the more expensive end of the scale, which is the 16 to 19 age group, since the higher costs of student support are to be found in that age group. That is on top of the real-terms cut of &#163;11 million in student support. Many of those students are on national certificate courses at the start of the learning process and need more support, so there is surely a potential impact on some of our more vulnerable students.</p><p>What will happen to provision for part-time students, mature students and students with disabilities, who could, according to the Scottish Consortium on Learning Disabilities, lose up to 34 per cent of part-time places? Those groups are all essential to ensuring that we have a more mobile and flexible workforce across the economy.</p><p>The Scottish Government cannot claim any longer that there cannot be greater flexibility in its budget decisions about higher education and FE. It is nonsense to say that the college cuts are all the fault of the Westminster Government. The Scottish Government had a choice to make and got it wrong&#8212;and I think that it knows it has got it wrong. It was a political choice, and the responsibility for it must lie firmly with the cabinet secretary.</p><p>I return to where I began by praising the outstanding work that has been done by those in the college sector over recent years. They have coped admirably with the challenges placed on them, and they are undoubtedly a hugely important part of the post-16 reforms in building a more flexible and stronger economy. They should be congratulated rather than punished by a Government that has muddled its priorities and ended up with a total lack of coherence in FE and HE policy. They are fearful of further cuts and fearful of cutbacks in student places&#8212;or, if the places can be maintained, cutbacks in teaching time. They are fearful about whether exciting new projects will ever see the light of day, and they wonder just what mergers will mean to them. In short, there is considerable doubt that the college sector, which has made such outstanding progress, will emerge anything other than weaker at the end of the day.</p><p>Mr Russell told us last week that his Government is second to none when it comes to supporting student finances&#8212;far better than any previous Government north or south of the border and probably better than any arc of prosperity in the world, if Mr Russell had his way. He said that his budget figures are &#8220;impeccable&#8221; and that the budget settlement is &#8220;fair, full and final&#8221;. Well, I invite him to accept the seriousness of the situation that he has created, to swallow his pride and to cut through all the shameful bombast of the past few months. Colleges deserve our support, and I suspect that the vast majority of members in the chamber&#8212;even within the ranks of the SNP&#8212;believe that it is time for Mr Russell to ask Mr Swinney to reconsider his budget proposals.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament warmly congratulates Scotland&#8217;s colleges in terms of the outstanding contribution that they have made to improving educational opportunities for a wide range of learners, improving the alignment between available skills and local employment opportunities and in embracing the need for structural reform; condemns the Scottish Government for forcing on the sector deeply damaging financial cuts for the period 2012-15, which are disproportionately greater in 2012-13, and which will inevitably have a detrimental impact on staffing, student places and support for students from more disadvantaged backgrounds; fails to understand how these financial cuts can be reconciled with the Scottish Government&#8217;s flagship 16 to 19 policy and the need to address the very worrying youth unemployment statistics that have revealed that 88,000 young people aged 18 to 24 are now out of work, and calls on the Scottish Government to urgently reconsider the proposed budget settlement for the further education sector.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660274", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Colleges (Funding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is perfectly true that there are cuts south of the border, but the Scottish Government is responsible for the cuts north of the border, and that is what we are debating.

We wonder and wait with interest to see whether their appointment will change the dynamics between the Scottish National Party and Labour in education debates.</p><p>We last debated raising attainment on 27 October. I am happy to do so again, because we should never relax our efforts to do everything possible to secure better attainment levels for all our pupils. However, if we are to debate the topic regularly, and particularly if we are to debate it twice in such a short timescale, it is important that we take stock of the progress that has been made on Government commitments. I will therefore consider the commitments that the Scottish Government made just three months ago and where we are with them.</p><p>On the early years, progress has generally been pretty good, notwithstanding the concerns that Hugh Henry rightly raised. There is determination in all parties in the Parliament to ensure that we make the greatest impact in that area of policy making, such is the crucial influence of early years development on a person&#8217;s life chances. On that point, we welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to be more focused with public spending when it comes to care for disadvantaged children.</p><p>In the October debate, the Scottish Government made much of the need for a much more effective parenting strategy. The issue was referred to over and over again in yesterday&#8217;s excellent debate on looked-after children. There can be no differences across the political spectrum on the essential need for an effective strategy, but can the Scottish Government update the Parliament on what it has done in the intervening three months to set out the key principles of the strategy? How will discussions with relevant stakeholders and the cross-party discussions that were promised take place? Can the Government give us some idea of the timescale? In yesterday&#8217;s debate, concern was expressed that despite consensus and good will in so many quarters we must admit to a corporate failure to improve attainment levels for looked-after children. We need to ensure that the same malaise does not affect the parenting strategy.</p><p>On preventative spend, the need to ensure the principles of the getting it right for every child agenda and the need for much more effective organisation of local authority departments, we cannot be too critical of Scottish Government policy.</p><p>I turn to aspects of the Scottish Government&#8217;s contribution to the October debate that caused concern and, in some cases, were rather worrying. Labour is right to express concern about the curriculum for excellence, but we should be specific in our critical analysis of the situation and we should not suggest that there is widespread difficulty in every area, which is not particularly accurate.</p><p>Crucial to the success of curriculum for excellence is improving literacy, which deserves just as much attention as the early years and parenting strategies deserve. I was rather taken aback in October when the Scottish Government omitted to say much about literacy, given that it had set so much store by the issue at an earlier stage. The cabinet secretary has given a little more insight into the matter today, but it would be helpful if he told us more about the focus of the group of successful head teachers, which I presume is considering approaches to literacy that have had an impact. We can also learn from some local authorities, which have had better results than others have had.</p><p>As I said at the time, I was astonished that in October&#8217;s debate the Scottish Government managed just one sentence on the Donaldson, McCormac and Cameron reviews, which the Scottish Government itself set up and which all had as their underlying principles improving schools and raising attainment. We heard a little more this afternoon, but we have not heard enough.</p><p>What has been the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to Graham Donaldson&#8217;s finding that too many teachers are uncomfortable about teaching basic literacy and numeracy and indeed that many teachers might have problems in that respect themselves? What has been the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to concerns that academic rigour is being lost in some secondary school subjects and indeed that subjects are being lost, as Hugh Henry said, because teachers do not have enough time to read up on subject areas, given all the burdensome paperwork that they encounter? What has been the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the recommendation in all three reports that we need much greater flexibility in our schools and greater devolution of power to schools and away from local authorities?</p><p>Curriculum for excellence might be the greatest change to our schools in a generation, but those reports recommend fundamental changes to our school system, and it seems more than likely that the commission on school reform will say exactly the same thing. The review panels include highly respected professional men and women from different backgrounds, and from different political parties and none, and they all urge the Scottish Parliament to make radical changes to our education system so that it becomes much more responsive to the individual needs of pupils, teachers and parents. One of the most important messages, that of increasing the flexibility of staffing, is exactly the one that the Scottish Government needs to take on board.</p><p>Finally, I turn to the crucial issue of colleges and what I see as the most blatant contradiction in any area of the Scottish Government&#8217;s education policy. How is it logical to trumpet a flagship policy on 16 to 19-year-olds while making swingeing cuts to college budgets and asking colleges to dig deep into their reserves to make the changes&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658693", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People (Improving Learning Outcomes)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome Hugh Henry and his new team.

The member has made a very good point.</p><p>The committee is conscious that there is sometimes confusion and a bit of inefficiency in the care of individual children. We should be clear that that is by no means anyone&#8217;s intention, but there is sometimes a problem with the system. There is a message for all of us from witnesses: some of the legislation may be seen to be a little contradictory and things work against one another. We are a little uncertain about how much evidence on that exists, so we need&#8212;I think that the convener of the committee would agree and I know that my colleagues on the committee would agree&#8212;to investigate the matter to assess how much of a problem it is.</p><p>The paramount issue of trust among looked-after children has come through in the debate. Children fare better when they trust the individuals with whom they deal, and they will trust them if they feel that their circumstances are secure and that they will get help in any circumstance in which they need it. That is why permanence is important and why the earliest opportunities need to be addressed. I have mentioned in Parliament several times that the early years strategy is working extremely well, although there is still work to be done. Adam Ingram&#8217;s comments and work in the area have been significant. We cannot get away from the fact that the early years agenda is vital in addressing issues of attainment not just for looked-after children, but across the board. We need to ensure that that comes through in all our institutions and local authorities.</p><p>The committee was struck by comments that the central focus must be on outcomes, rather than on how we diagnose problems in the first instance; it has come through in some members&#8217; speeches that we must think more about outcomes than about diagnostic techniques. We are good at telling ourselves what is wrong, but we are perhaps a little less good at putting it right.</p><p>Throughout my time in Parliament, I have been struck by the compelling evidence that makes it clear to us all how important the early stages of development can be not just in school, but at home. We must understand that, when we talk about the early years, we are talking not only about the early stages of a child&#8217;s life after birth, but about pre-birth situations. Members have talked about a parenting strategy and the circumstances in homes that we must address in order to help adults or young carers who are trying to assist looked-after children. We must help those people to address the difficulties and challenges that they face.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I point out that we are conscious that we have tried something different in our approach. As yet, we have not produced a report or anything other than a mass of material.

Charitable giving in Britain, including by our young people, remains at a particularly high level and among the best in the world. Nor should we forget about the huge efforts of a growing number of young carers who give so much of their time to looking after family members, often in very difficult circumstances.</p><p>That said, the 2009 social attitudes survey reveals some uncomfortable facts that we ignore at our peril, particularly the fact that misplaced perceptions rather than factual evidence can often be the determining factor in the public opinion of young people&#8212;I refer to the young man to whom Sandra White referred&#8212;and the national media can too often play a role in perpetuating that. The good-news stories seldom make the headlines, whereas the bad-news stories often do. It is disturbing that half of those who were surveyed thought that the media were particularly negative towards young people, but two thirds of those who were surveyed thought that many young people in their own communities were extremely positive. Those sums do not add up, and that is a matter of concern to us all.</p><p>It is clear that there are cases in which there is a higher incidence of negative behaviour among young people and in which it would be completely wrong to ignore what is often a vicious circle of antisocial problems that have a corrosive effect on the fabric of communities. However, instilling confidence and self-esteem in our young people is crucial. Young people who are experiencing significant problems at home or in their personal life often feel that they have no one to talk to about those problems. The project that Sandra White has described is excellent in that regard. It gives young people a place that they can go to to talk about their problems and get specialist help. That is sometimes important from a role model aspect. Sometimes, those people have had very little, and they have been too frightened or embarrassed to talk about the problems that they have faced. One of the most challenging issues for a young person is finding somebody who cares about them and understands their problems.</p><p>I did not appreciate how much work some of the truth about youth groups have done, particularly in setting up a new website, which I have looked at. I was very impressed by that website, as it is exactly the kind of support that is required.</p><p>I warmly commend the work of the truth about youth project, but we must not forget about the important role that parents and schools can have in tackling some of the issues. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to try to take that forward. I will not hear what the minister says, but I am sure that he is aware of those difficulties.</p><p>I firmly compliment the project and Sandra White, and again apologise for having to leave the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656792", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Truth About Youth Project"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise that I have to leave the chamber immediately after speaking.

As Iain Gray rightly said, it could hardly be more important, and he eloquently outlined the reasons why. There can be no doubt whatever that rising unemployment is a serious issue, particularly when we hear that no fewer than 100,000 young people are unemployed in Scotland. The stakes are high but, although the Conservatives can well understand why Labour seeks what the motion describes as an &#8220;emergency response&#8221;, we argue that there is an even stronger case for a swift but nonetheless carefully considered and coherent strategy that goes across all the portfolios in the Parliament, for exactly the reasons that the First Minister set out. If there is a lesson from history, it is that short-term responses usually have only limited impact.</p><p>The First Minister is again right&#8212;that is twice this morning&#8212;to recognise that there are various types of unemployment and therefore various causes. Clearly, many young people are suffering from the effects of the cyclical downturn and the depressed state of demand in the Scottish economy and demand for exports from Scottish companies. However, other young people are suffering from an on-going structural change in the economy and the resulting mismatch of skills. We should be mindful that, although the vacancy rate has shown a modest decline in the past year, nearly half of that vacancy rate reflects the fact that employers in this country do not believe that those workers have the appropriate skills. Willy Roe made that point in his excellent report that was published last year, and it is made consistently by the Confederation of British Industry and many chambers of commerce. That issue means not only that we are experiencing problems with our education and training programmes, but that a large number of businesses in Scotland have to spend too much money working on upskilling that population rather than on job creation.</p><p>It follows that addressing unemployment issues among young people is not a matter of a single policy. Of crucial importance are policies that promote sustained economic growth, specifically via investment in longer-term capital projects, which boost the level of consumer demand and have a multiplier effect across the whole economy. We need to spend within our means, rather than allow debt and borrowing to spiral out of control. Another aspect is the requirement to provide young people with the right skills and, perhaps more important, the flexibility of skills that allows them to adapt to the demands of the modern economy.</p><p>On that point, Willy Roe makes an interesting remark. He says that three things are essential for a modern, progressive workforce: the right attitude, the right skills and the right knowledge&#8212;in that order. He goes on to say that our schools, colleges and universities have too often dealt with them in the reverse order. That is an important point that should give us pause for thought. If there is a strong message emanating from Scottish businesses, it is that too few of our young people understand what constitutes a professional attitude. It is sad to hear those in restaurants, hotels and rural businesses saying that they would prefer to take on young foreign workers rather than young Scots. I do not believe for a minute that the potential is not there; of course it is, but there needs to be much more focus on it from an early age.</p><p>I warmly commend the Government&#8217;s early years strategy, and the work being done by the other parties to ensure that we get the strategy right, but I also commend several aspects of the work of the highly respected Smith group, which makes clear the need to ensure a focus not only on the early years but on the transition period between primary 7 and secondary 1 and 2. I also commend some aspects of the youth contract that has been introduced by the Westminster Government. As well as helping employers to cover their share of national insurance costs, wage incentives and new Jobcentre Plus schemes, the contract is designed to provide better quality work experience and more focused careers services. I base my opinion on the feedback that I receive from a variety of employers, and I have no doubt at all that the way we can help our young people to get on to the employment ladder and, just as important, to stay on it, is to ensure that they are better prepared for the environment that will confront them in the workplace.</p><p>Let me turn to what I, and many other people, see as a major inconsistency in the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy priorities. It has stated, not unreasonably, that policies to improve the opportunities for 16 to 19-year-olds should be an essential commitment in this parliamentary session. At the same time, however, it has placed on our colleges the unacceptable burden of disproportionate spending cuts. Those cuts will impact particularly badly in the first year of the 2012 to 2015 spending review and will, extraordinarily, come at a time when the Scottish Government claims that it is doing everything possible to promote and enhance the opportunities of all our young people. How can it be right that such extensive funding has been withdrawn from the college sector when colleges are a crucial part of the economy when it comes to helping our young people?</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Unemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to the Labour Party for bringing this debate to the Parliament.

It was a perfectly logical concern but, although I do not doubt that changes will probably occur decades on, I am absolutely certain that future generations can be relied on whole-heartedly never to forget the sacrifice of their forebears, especially if our young people are anything to go by. Indeed, based on the past few years, I would say that there is a heightened rather than a diminished awareness among young people of what remembrance means.</p><p>Just last week, I witnessed two groundbreaking school projects in action, both of which asked young people to become much more actively involved in supporting remembrance activities in their local communities, and not just during the month of November, but permanently. At one school, pupils were actively engaged in finding out more about the names on a local war memorial and were contacting their local council and the Royal British Legion to find out how they could participate in the on-going care of the monument and its surrounding gardens. They had been inspired by the UK Government initiative in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of the start of the first world war in 2014, which will provide opportunities for young people to adopt a war memorial. At another school, research was under way to identify just how many veterans and their families are in the local community and what support could be given to them through the community service part of the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s award scheme.</p><p>Although schools have always played an important role in the historical understanding of war&#8212;ancient or recent&#8212;awareness is growing of the need to involve schools more permanently in their local communities to support all those who have been affected by the experience of war, which is something that has poignancy all year round, not just at this time of year.</p><p>As other members have already said, this year marks the 90th anniversary of the poppy appeal and that, too, has seen an increase in local schools&#8217; interest in visiting the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, which gives pupils an insight into the issues that confront veterans and their families and the many people whose job it is to look after them and help them to readjust to civilian life. The technology of war might have changed beyond all recognition in that 90-year period, but the issues that face our armed services as they return from battle are, in some cases, remarkably similar to what they would have been 90 years ago. Our young people, in the main, have a very mature grasp of that fact.</p><p>I take the opportunity to put on record our thanks to Poppyscotland for its outstanding work.

If they do not meet those soldiers personally, through the many school links and programmes, various social media bring them closer to those soldiers&#8217; experiences and provide them with much more up-to-date feedback on what the war meant for them and their families.

Although we must acknowledge that hundreds of council workers across Scotland work tirelessly to do their very best for children in such circumstances, nothing can replace the love and security of a permanent and stable family environment, and it goes without saying that that must be the overall policy objective.</p><p>The Scottish Government and the Opposition parties have acknowledged that, notwithstanding the numerous and genuine efforts that have been made to address the problem, more has to be done. We cannot get away from statistics that show that since 2001 the number of looked-after children in Scotland has risen by 69 per cent and increasing evidence that, in some parts of this country, the problem is reaching crisis point. For example, between 2005 and 2008, the number of looked-after children in one council increased by 85 per cent. Moreover, just last week, there were worrying reports that children&#8217;s services in Dundee had reached &#8220;saturation point&#8221;, largely as the result of certain very difficult social problems in the city. As a result, the city has been overspending on its children&#8217;s services by &#163;1.6 million annually.</p><p>Although it is important to stress that such worrying situations are not the norm across Scotland, it is nevertheless evident that the country&#8217;s councils have had varying degrees of success in addressing the situation. Indeed, as the Education and Culture Committee heard only yesterday, quite a bit of progress has been made. The standard of reporting is better; better systems are in place for ensuring that there are coherent plans to look after the best interests of each child; school attendance has improved in some areas; and there are some signs that educational attainment levels are increasing. We should be encouraged by all that. However, it is only a small start when it comes to dealing with the stark reality.</p><p>Last year, 56 per cent of school leavers gained five or more qualifications at Scottish credit and qualifications framework level 5 or better. The figure for looked-after children was only 0.5 per cent, and only 2.5 per cent of the 15,000 or 16,000 looked-after children in Scotland go on to further or higher education. We also know that, as with exclusion and attendance rates at school, drop-out rates can be high. Furthermore, evidence shows that around half of the looked-after children in Scotland encounter mental health problems and, even worse, problems in accessing the relevant mental health services. Indeed, my colleague Mary Scanlon exposed that very issue just last week.</p><p>In the whole debate about looked-after children, I have been struck by two comments. First, at yesterday&#8217;s Education and Culture Committee meeting, Claire Burns, the strategic policy manager for CELCIS, the centre of excellence for looked-after children in Scotland, said that she thought that we were very good identifying the problems but much less good at measuring outcomes and providing solutions. Secondly, the Educational Institute of Scotland has stated that there has been little improvement in attainment for looked-after children</p><p>&#8220;despite the considerable volume of policy, guidance and legislation in this area&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, there have been lots of attempts to do things, but not enough of them are having much impact. What lessons do we need to learn from the experts on the ground? What can we as politicians do to ensure that significant qualitative improvements are made in the life chances of our looked-after children?</p><p>First, there are some issues with the decision-making process. From the wealth of written and oral evidence that was presented to the committee, some key themes emerged. Local authorities are not yet skilled enough at bringing greater coherency to decision making, particularly when it might involve council officers across several departments. The spirit of getting it right for every child is definitely there, but the practicalities still present too many problems. It has been pointed out that there is not enough of a multidisciplinary approach to training among professionals. That issue was also raised by Graham Donaldson when he examined how teachers could best be assisted to provide crucial educational support for looked-after children. In addition, there appears to be widespread concern that the range of professionals who are involved in looking after any one child are not always best informed about the care plan, and we need to take that very seriously indeed.</p><p>It was also pointed out that there can be issues with decision making that relate to procurement, and that too much time can be spent on tendering and contractual processes, which are often expensive, without due regard being paid to the qualitative outcomes. We were told that the procurement process can often get bogged down in ideological prejudices to do with whether preference should be given to public contracts or to private contracts when, in fact, a combination of both should often be used, and when much more recognition should be given to the role that the voluntary sector can play.</p><p>The single most damaging barrier to helping our vulnerable children is bureaucracy and red tape getting in the way of finding them permanent and stable homes within an appropriate period of time. The Westminster Government is determined to tackle frustration with that, as the Prime Minister made clear in his announcement earlier this week. We should not tolerate any situation in local authorities in which there are fundamental weaknesses in the decision-making process.</p><p>Secondly, it has been pointed out that local communities and local voluntary sector organisations can often provide some of the greatest support, particularly when it comes to assisting parents, providing financial and educational advice, and helping families to address issues of addiction and dysfunctional home life.</p><p>We should not ignore the views of the Aberlour Child Care Trust&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s largest children&#8217;s charity&#8212;whose research shows that many care homes that are run by the voluntary sector deliver not only a better standard of care but better educational attainment than some of their local authority counterparts.</p><p>Thirdly&#8212;and lastly&#8212;there is obviously the issue of educational attainment itself and the need to do far more in our schools and colleges in particular to be better prepared to identify and support the best interests of looked-after children. The curriculum for excellence will go some way towards doing that, but we still need to do more to adopt a multidisciplinary approach.</p><p>There is a wealth of evidence that suggests that a lack of permanence and stability in childhood can have a significant impact on young people that can last long into their later years. Everyone knows that we cannot sit back and wait and hope that things will change without a different approach being taken to early intervention.</p><p>We are happy to support the Scottish Government&#8217;s motion and the Labour amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is no greater responsibility than bringing up children&#8212;and no greater responsibility for the state than ensuring that children who, for one reason or another, have been taken into care are properly looked after.

I do not think that there is a more important subject for debate than how we should raise attainment for pupils in Scotland.</p><p>I do not doubt that good things are happening, as the minister said. Scotland is a leading light when it comes to teacher training, we are leading the way when it comes to the process of pupil self-evaluation and there are imaginative developments in the early years, as well as signs of some improvements in attainment levels, so I am not prepared to share the view of some who write on educational matters that our schools are always seen to be struggling; neither am I prepared to accept, however, some of the Government&#8217;s extraordinary rhetoric when it comes to the reality of certain trends in Scottish education.</p><p>How extraordinary it is that, on a subject as important as attainment, we have such a benign Government motion that does not flag up the key policy directions. A wealth of excellent work has been done in the recent Donaldson, McCormac and Cameron reviews that has been given only passing mention this morning. We should be focusing all our attention on two important recommendations from those reports. First, we must ensure that we have the best teachers and headteachers in all our schools. Secondly, we must ensure that we can raise the motivation and aspiration of all our pupils from the youngest age.</p><p>As McCormac said in his report, we need to do far more to tackle some of the disturbing evidence from Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education and from other countries, which makes for such sober reading. The fact that just over half of Scottish school leavers finish school without receiving a higher is nothing to be proud of, nor are the statistics on the extent of the attainment gaps that exist between geographical areas and socioeconomic groups, which were so brutally exposed in the Sunday Herald at the weekend.</p><p>I am very clear indeed that the evidence before us from those reports suggests that raising attainment is not all about money. If that were the case, we would be well ahead, because since 1999 we have doubled the amount of spending on schools, yet we have not seen comparable changes in attainment and, sadly, there has been little improvement in our performance according to international measurements. Although I believe that comparisons with other countries can be useful&#8212;and, in some cases, extremely useful&#8212;the most important measurement is often how much better we are doing against ourselves, and that is why we must be prepared to look at much more than just the efficiency of public spending on our schools.</p><p>I suggest that a combination of five things, if delivered together, will raise attainment levels among pupils&#8212;especially those in our most deprived communities who, for me, must be our priority. It is simply not acceptable to say that weaker local economies, or more disadvantaged communities, are necessarily an excuse for poor performance. Of course the challenge is greater&#8212;no one would deny that&#8212;but so, too, is the prize of being able to deliver better educational outcomes for those pupils.</p><p>Let us not be shy about telling the truth and being up front about what needs to be done. First, let us consider carefully not only the broad principles of the combined reports of Donaldson, Cameron and McCormac, but some of the small print too&#8212;because that is where some of the most important comments lie. They make it clear that, as well as increasing professional support for teachers, leadership in schools is crucial. I am talking not simply about the usual traditional concept of leadership, which most people think lies with the headteacher, but about leadership in our classrooms and among our pupils. The issue is competence&#8212;and confidence in that competence.</p><p>Let us not dismiss the concerns raised by Graham Donaldson when he said that too many young teachers have issues with literacy and numeracy, which has a major impact on their teaching abilities&#8212;even if many of them have many of the other talents that can help to make them outstanding teachers. The problem cannot be ignored, nor can the issue of literacy and numeracy at large, because it is nothing short of a disgrace that one in six pupils leaves school without being functionally literate. Although I think that there is genuine intent to tackle the problem, I still do not believe that we are doing enough to ensure that the best practice of teaching traditional methods, and testing accordingly, is more widespread&#8212;methods that in local authorities such as West Dunbartonshire and Clackmannanshire have produced better results, for weaker pupils just as much as for more able pupils.</p><p>Secondly, it is becoming patently clear that comprehensive education beyond S2 has failed. The one-size-fits-all approach is not working. It does not provide the flexibility and diversity that we need. Our system is too centralised and too overregulated. We need greater flexibility so that we can do much more to expand the vocational and technical training that this country so desperately needs.</p><p>There are more lessons to be learned from David Cameron&#8217;s review of devolved school management, particularly as he binds together the underlying philosophy of curriculum for excellence with the need to allow heads to have greater control over the provision that they make for their pupils. He points out that the curriculum for excellence is not compatible with the existing structure of school management.

I listened carefully to what the minister said at the start of the debate, and picked out from her speech seven key points about what is important. I do not think that any member has any problem with the importance of the early years, preventative spend, the health policy link, children&#8217;s services, including expanding the GIRFEC agenda, working with parents, the curriculum for excellence, and 16 to 19-year-olds, but the motion is benign in that it does not get down to the root-and-branch changes that have been recommended in some of the most recent reports that have been commissioned by the Government through painstaking efforts. Foresight has gone into those recommendations, which are on the Government&#8217;s table right now. We must take on board a lot of what is said in those reports, as they are manifestly about raising attainment, ensuring that we have good-quality teachers and headteachers in all our schools, and raising the aspirations of every single child in this country.</p><p>I do not agree with everything that Ken Macintosh said, but I agree that funding is not the main issue. It is about building on the first-class work of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, raising the professionalism of teachers across the board, and speaking about the uncomfortable truth that a very small minority of teachers should not be in our classrooms. It is about dealing with literacy and numeracy, moving on to a post-McCrone settlement that will find support among our teachers, and ensuring that the school system is much more responsive to the needs of pupils, parents and teachers rather than to the Government and quangos. It is about building greater flexibility into the system and being prepared to admit that the comprehensive structure has failed too many of our pupils when it comes to mastering the basic skills. Those are all serious issues that have been taken up by Graham Donaldson, Professor McCormac and David Cameron, and they demand serious answers.</p><p>Several members have rightly mentioned the importance of the early years. It is true that the early years are important, and it is right that the Scottish Government has acknowledged their importance and that that acknowledgement must be complemented by a range of policies to do with health visitors, nursery and child care, and disability care&#8212;Joan McAlpine mentioned that&#8212;and policies that will help to promote better parenting. Sandra White focused on that. As we know, there is a much stronger correlation between better attainment and children who grew up in a loving, caring and healthy environment.</p><p>I want to pick out Derek Mackay&#8217;s contribution, as he focused on policies that work. It is a lesson for all members that, whichever party we belong to, we should take up policies that work and that can demonstrate that they improve attainment. Derek Mackay referred to things that are happening in his part of the world in Renfrewshire and Glasgow. Those things have worked. The nurture groups have basically worked, and many of the schemes that have encouraged greater parenting involvement have worked. My colleague Jamie McGrigor referred to many initiatives in rural schools, where the use of the campus by the community and the increased involvement of parents in the school have worked. That is extremely important.</p><p>No member will be surprised to hear me come back to a policy of giving greater responsibility to headteachers and teachers in the classroom, which has been a substantial feature of the evidence that has been presented to the Government recently. We should consider the results of schools that have first-class headteachers and schools that were failing but have been turned around by their headteachers. As Marco Biagi said, the headteachers of those schools have thrown off the mantle of Government objectives and have done things for themselves. They have got results, and good for them.</p><p>I know that I will be criticised for ensuring that free schools are part of our policy, but I say to members who criticise the Conservative policy and argue that free schools are the privilege of the middle classes that that is not the case. In a third of cases in which the offer of free-school status has been taken up in England, the applications came from disadvantaged communities. The advantage of the pupil premium, which Liam McArthur mentioned, is that it provides an incentive. Free schools in England are working and parents are being attracted into the system.</p><p>The Teach First programme brings some of the finest graduates into schools to help some of the most disadvantaged pupils. I have looked at the programme in Germany, England, America and Australia, where it has turned around the results of many poorly-performing schools and given ambition and aspiration to children who perhaps previously had little of either. Surely that is what it is all about. I ask the Government to consider the programme carefully. Teach First is an important project and Scotland would be well advised to consider it. I accept that there must be guarantees that the GTC would have some oversight of registration.</p><p>Education policy in this country should be driven by what works, not by political ideology.

Its institutions have delivered excellence in many aspects, have transformed the quality of college courses and have widened access to many students, of all ages, who in previous times would not have been able to take advantage of further education.</p><p>Since colleges were granted their independence by the Conservative Government in 1992, they have enjoyed much greater autonomy and much greater flexibility, which has allowed them to adapt to the demands of their local regions, to build much better links with other educational institutions and to develop courses around the different needs of individual students. The Parliament pays tribute to that work and to the enthusiastic manner in which colleges have set about dealing with the current challenges that face them. In the vast majority of cases, they have an outstanding record. That is why they are, quite rightly, puzzled and upset that, despite those achievements, they are being asked to accept the brunt of the education spending cuts in this year's spending review&#8212;cuts that come hard and fast on the back of an average 10 per cent reduction in budgets last year.</p><p>Last week, John Spencer, the convener of Scotland&#8217;s Colleges, said that it was inconceivable that colleges would be able to absorb more cuts without harm being done to student places, to staffing or to the quality of courses. Over the period 2011 to 2015, those cuts could amount to more than 20 per cent in real terms, assuming that student support is maintained at a flat cash level. That view is echoed by Mike Dibsall, the principal of Telford College, who has said:</p><p>&#8220;To think that the sector could operate or indeed maintain provision after having our budgets slashed by 10 per cent last year was challenging, but to have them reduced again by 14.3 per cent spread over the next three years is just baffling. This is an incredibly difficult feat and I dread to think of what the sector will look like in a few years time when these new cuts are felt.&#8221;</p><p>He is referring to the fact that the further education sector is likely to be asked to cope with having its funding cut in real terms from &#163;544 million to &#163;435 million in 2011-15 while it watches the higher education sector get an increase from &#163;926 million to &#163;982 million.</p><p>Why has the Scottish Government chosen to punish the colleges so hard, particularly when they will be integral to the new Scottish Government flagship policy of offering opportunities to all 16 to 19-year-olds, when unemployment among young people is high and when businesses across Scotland have heaped praise on the college sector for its ability to train more students and apprentices in the new skills required for today's fast-changing world? Surely, there is not much logic to the Government&#8217;s position.</p><p>I can suggest one reason why the Scottish Government has taken this action.

We maintain that position, notwithstanding the claims from the Scottish Government that it will plug the funding gap for the next three years. At what price to our colleges? The Scottish Government cannot get away from the fact that 1,000 staff have been shed in the FE sector so far this year, the school college partnership work has been significantly reduced and, despite claims to the contrary, the number of learners has decreased.</p><p>The Scottish Government can no longer claim that there cannot be greater flexibility in its budget decisions about HE and FE. Until budget year 2010-11, the Scottish Government had separate budget lines for capital expenditure for the two sectors but for budget years beyond that the Scottish funding council has one pot for both sectors, so the Scottish Government can no longer claim that its hands are so tied. There is new scope for flexibility and therefore there should be much greater scope for a more equitable share between the two sectors.</p><p>I do not for a minute take issue with the desire of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to examine whether HE and FE are delivering best value for money. I do not doubt for a minute that some rationalisation is necessary&#8212;even some mergers in the future&#8212;but let us hope that the handling of that is not condensed into a six-week period like it was in the disgraceful situation at Abertay and Dundee, tellingly described by Lord Sutherland at the Education and Culture Committee on Tuesday as a &#8220;merger by fax&#8221;. Reform is essential, but so is the continuing autonomy of the sector and so is colleges&#8217; desire to play an equal part in any tripartite discussions that must take place between the Scottish Government, the Scottish funding council and the colleges themselves. Discussions about the future structure of our colleges and universities will be extremely important and they must include the fullest possible consultation with all parties.</p><p>I will now concentrate on the priorities of the Scottish Government. It has made it very plain that there is to be a much greater focus on the provision of opportunities for 16 to 24-year-olds and especially those in the 16 to 19 age group. It is a laudable ambition; but why then cut colleges&#8217; resources? By definition, they will be expected to play a key role in this initiative, which will make additional demands on the college sector. As I understand the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals, regionalisation is at the heart of the post-16 programme and it is predicted that there will be some savings as a result. However, I cannot see how any of those savings can possibly occur in a sufficiently short timescale to avoid serious pressures on colleges as they try to develop post-16 arrangements. Indeed, if possible mergers were to be part of restructuring, it is possible that costs could increase rather than decrease in the short term. The Scottish Government should be aware that there is a lack of evidence to suggest that significant savings can be made in the short term.</p><p>Let us not forget that there are many other student groups at college: part-time students, mature students and a minority of apprentices, who are all an essential part of the work of colleges and essential to ensuring that we have a mobile and flexible workforce across the economy. How will they fare if more demands to help with prioritising the 16 to 19 reform are laid on colleges at the same time as crippling budget cuts? What will happen to the provision of HE places&#8212;28 per cent of the total HE provision&#8212;especially for students from disadvantaged areas? Does that really sit well with the principles that underpin this Government&#8217;s priorities? I do not think so.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s economic strategy commits to maintaining bursary support to help young people to remain engaged in college and training. It is right to ask the Government whether it can confirm that student support in colleges will be maintained in real terms over the course of the spending review period. Bursary support is crucial to many students who would not otherwise be able to access further or higher education and it is also crucial to maintain a diverse student intake. We need a cast-iron assurance that bursary support will be maintained and that there will be no prospect of increasing inequality between the level of support for FE and for HE students.</p><p>I return to where I began by praising the outstanding work that has been undertaken by the college sector over recent years. Colleges have coped admirably with the challenges put upon them and they are undoubtedly a hugely important part of the improvements in post-school education. They should be congratulated rather than punished by the Government, which has muddled its priorities and ended up with a total lack of coherence in FE and HE policy.</p><p>It is incumbent on us all to heed the warnings in formal communications from Scotland&#8217;s Colleges about what could happen as a result of the spending review. The organisation fears further cuts. In the worst case that some predict, which is a cut by a fifth in the total for colleges, colleges fear cuts in student places or&#8212;if places can be maintained&#8212;cuts in teaching time. The colleges are also fearful about whether they will be able to maintain the college estate.</p><p>As I said, the college sector has made outstanding progress in recent years, but there is considerable doubt about whether it will emerge as anything other than weaker. That would be hugely detrimental to Scotland and to our economic potential.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the profound concern expressed by Scotland&#8217;s Colleges that last week&#8217;s Spending Review has severely damaged the ability of colleges to maintain student places and staffing levels, and their ability to deliver quality education across all areas of the further education sector; notes that the core funding cuts to colleges of 13.5% could result in a real-terms cut of over 20% if student support is maintained at a flat-cash level; believes that this is a direct consequence of the Scottish Government&#8217;s refusal to allow additional private sources of finance in the higher education sector thereby putting additional financial strain on every other area of education spending, and calls on the Scottish Government to explain why, in light of the findings of the post-16 review, it has severely cut back on the highly successful school/college partnerships that provide enhanced vocational opportunities for young people.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652016", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Colleges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Along with many in the university sector and many public figures such as Lord Sutherland and Sir Andrew Cubie, the Scottish Conservatives have persistently argued that free higher education is unsustainable.

I said that I had to confess that I was a little confused about what the proposal was.

First, I thought that it was plain to most observers that Scottish studies, in their widest sense, were already embedded in the Scottish curriculum and that they will be enhanced in all schools by the curriculum for excellence. I thought that maybe I had got this wrong, so I went off and did quite a lot of research to check whether I had made a mistake.</p><p>I found a Times Educational Supplement Scotland article from 2008 about developments for the curriculum for excellence, in which there was a very full run down from teachers in schools all across Scotland&#8212;in English, mathematics, home economics, history, biology, physics, chemistry and French&#8212;who had all explained, in considerable detail, exactly how Scottish themes were present in their subjects. I also found a sizeable Learning and Teaching Scotland document&#8212;all 317 pages of it&#8212;in which there is a very precise and detailed description of exactly how Scottish studies are embedded in the curriculum. It lists at length how Scottish themes are a core part of pupils&#8217; learning. I will quote some of them.</p><p>On classical languages, the document states:</p><p>&#8220;By studying a classical language, young people will become ever more aware of how vital parts of Scotland&#8217;s culture, the arts, law, political systems and social values are both directly and indirectly linked with the classical world.&#8221;</p><p>On religious education, it states:</p><p>&#8220;The experiences and outcomes draw on the rich and diverse context of Scotland&#8217;s cultural heritage through the use of Scottish stories, images, music and poems.&#8221;</p><p>On modern languages, it states:</p><p>&#8220;children and young people can gain access to the literary heritage of humanity and develop their appreciation of the richness and breadth of Scotland&#8217;s literary heritage.&#8221;</p><p>That left me with an important question: what else does the SNP think it is necessary to teach children about Scotland? Why has what started out as a concept been transmuted into a strand and then into a subject?

What I am asking is: why is it that the proposed Scottish studies course gives something extra that is not already in the curriculum? We have hordes of bits of paper that tell us that Scottish studies are already a fundamental part of the Scottish curriculum.</p><p>My second reason for being a little confused is related to other curriculum developments. The SNP, of all parties, should know the criticisms that it faces about trying to fit everything else into a crowded curriculum. Who was it that said that they would deliver two hours of quality physical education per week to every pupil? Who persuades us, or at least tries to persuade us, that they are making good progress in this area? Who is it that has received submissions from concerned history teachers about losing discrete time in the social sciences and from language teachers who are concerned that we are not devoting enough time to German, French or Spanish? It is bad enough trying to explain to those teachers why they are being squeezed in the curriculum without a new subject appearing, to add further tensions.</p><p>I appreciate that the SNP has decided not to make the subject compulsory&#8212;thank goodness for that&#8212;but even by being an optional subject, it will have significant implications for the timetable in schools, so the SNP needs to come clean and explain which subjects will be squeezed as a result.</p><p>Let us be charitable. If I thought that important aspects of Scottish studies that are essential components of a better education for our pupils were not currently being taught, I might have a little more sympathy with the SNP. However, all the research that I can find seems to offer a wealth of evidence that there is already very considerable and good-quality coverage of Scottish literature, language, politics, culture and history. Indeed, coverage has increased recently, as a result of changes to Scottish Qualifications Authority highers and the introduction of curriculum for excellence.</p><p>Therefore, from a logical and an educational perspective, I am struggling to see why the proposed addition to the timetable is necessary and why it will not overlap with existing courses. Is not the proposal also a bit of a kick in the teeth to the people who spent hours devising all the curriculum for excellence materials, only to learn that some of their work might have to be changed?</p><p>Perhaps it is not surprising that some people think that there is something a little bit political in the proposal. It is hard not to be cynical, but I will try. I hope that the SNP will be able not only to answer the two questions that I raised, but to dispel any hint that its proposal is more to do with the SNP&#8217;s pet themes than with anything else.</p><p>Before anyone in the SNP tries their usual tack and says that the Scottish Tories are anti-Scottish, I remind the Parliament and the cabinet secretary that it was the Tories, under Scottish secretaries Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Forsyth, who provided far more money for Gaelic, the &#163;8&#160;million Gaelic television fund and the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985, which financed many projects on Gaelic and Scots. I also remind members that the Tories supported the introduction of a discrete Scottish history paper in higher history. I will take no lessons from&#8212;or be indoctrinated by&#8212;anyone about the Tories being anti-Scottish.</p><p>Of course we support arguments in education that are aimed at ensuring that all pupils understand and appreciate the extraordinary richness of Scotland and its historical, social, cultural and political identity, but I am not persuaded of a need for a new Scottish studies programme. I will not be surprised if that goes for many teachers, too.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-00959.1, to leave out from &#8220;welcomes&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;agrees that it is essential that all young people should have the opportunity to learn and be better informed about their country and its place in the world, including its historical, literary, linguistic and cultural inheritance as well as its landscape and natural heritage, and that such learning provides a more relevant and connected learning experience that raises ambition and attainment for all, but believes that these educational opportunities are already extensively and successfully embedded in the curriculum without the need for the addition of discrete Scottish Studies.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Studies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Of course I welcome any measures that give teachers more confidence.

Hugh Henry was right when he said that we have much that we can be proud of.</p><p>There is no doubt that early childhood development through good-quality care or educational opportunities is crucial to determining the future health and wellbeing of children. The statistical evidence for that is non-contestable. The possible attainment gaps are well established; they can open up at as early as 22 months and, if we do not do something radical about that, it is difficult to close them later in life.</p><p>I therefore welcome the debate very much, but I suggest that the discussion is not just about childcare but about an opportunity that goes well beyond providing invaluable support to parents: the provision of early years education to enhance and promote children&#8217;s wellbeing and development. Indeed, not getting that right can have profound and potentially expensive ramifications later in a child&#8217;s life. I believe that all parties in the chamber have done a lot to move that debate on, which is good news.</p><p>I hear the criticisms of the UK Government in relation to the tax and benefits issues, but I do not entirely agree with what Malcolm Chisholm and Hugh Henry said in that regard. I believe that the Westminster Government has taken to heart the importance of early education. One of the first policies that it implemented was the entitlement to 15 hours a week of free early education. That is an important provision that we can build on in Scotland. The message from parents that they want greater flexibility and the free entitlement, particularly for those in disadvantaged communities, can take us a long way down that road.</p><p>An important point, which I think Bob Doris raised, is partnership issues for both nursery and childcare provision. We face far too many rigidities in Scotland in that regard, because, through local authorities, the state can dictate a bit too much at times just what placings are available. That is unfortunate, because parents want much greater flexibility and choice. However, it should not be just about convenience for parents, as the social and educational interests of the child must always be at the heart of provision.</p><p>The Save the Children report provides compelling evidence of the difficulties facing many families because of what it describes as the childcare trap and it sends out a strong message to employers&#8212;the point made about colleges in this regard is important, too&#8212;that they have a vital role in supporting families and our young children.

In reality, the concordat has proved to be much more of a straitjacket: it has forced local authorities to accept rigid targets set by central Government. Not only have those targets proved to be undeliverable, they have proved to be different from the priorities within local government. There are plenty of examples of that&#8212;I will not go through them all&#8212;but the policy on class sizes may be the one that has been most affected. The cabinet secretary is now admitting that the policy will take much longer to achieve than expected. Without class size targets, councils would have been better able to choose their own priorities&#8212;and perhaps would have put more money into teaching jobs. We will need to consider such issues carefully, because the teaching market needs to be more flexible. I think that the cabinet secretary is probably moving a little in that direction.</p><p>It also looks as if the Scottish Government will adopt more of a statist approach with colleges and universities&#8212;we need only ask people in the colleges about the comments on collective bargaining that have been made or ask people in the universities who fear an attack on the autonomy of the university structure. Of course we want accountability, but we certainly do not want to remove autonomy, which is one of the inherent principles of our university system.</p><p>I strongly support the Donaldson review, and I hope that I will support the coming report of the McCormac review. Jointly, those reviews offer the best way forward for providing greater flexibility and for enhancing the professionalism of Scotland&#8217;s teachers. Both reviews were tasked with making important and challenging changes&#8212;to raise attainment levels and to motivate teachers, give them the resources that they require and assure them that they are a highly valued part of Scottish society. The teaching unions are keen to stress that our teachers, by and large, are first class. Parliament, too, must send that message about all the things that teachers do.</p><p>We must maintain the strong academic tradition of both higher and further education. The debate over finances has been well rehearsed, and Parliament is well versed in the views of the Conservatives. However, I ask the cabinet secretary not to use the excuse of the funding issue to attack the autonomy of the colleges and universities, or to attack the way in which they choose to organise themselves. That would be very dangerous, and such an approach could make it difficult for people in both sectors to realise their international ambitions. We need to be very careful about that.</p><p>The funding crisis must be resolved&#8212;no two ways about it. The cabinet secretary has put his eggs in one basket, saying that the state will provide. However, he must give the Parliament confidence that, if the state is to pick up the tab, there will be no cuts in student numbers, in courses or in any aspect of our university system, and that he will not become overreliant on the fees of people who come in from outside Scotland. The cabinet secretary stresses the ability to learn, not the ability to pay. He must keep that firmly in mind.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648601", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Education and Lifelong Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mike Russell and his team on their re-election, and Mr Macintosh and Mr McArthur on their new posts.

Some people would say that too many of our sports stars in the past had to go elsewhere to complete their training but, as the minister said, a wonderful opportunity is presented to us by the forthcoming Commonwealth games, the Ryder cup, the open championship and, of course, the Olympic games in London with all the capital developments and the economic and social spin-offs that will come from those events.</p><p>It is good to hear that the planning for those events appears to be within budget and on time. We must continue to monitor that carefully as time goes on because other countries know to their cost what happens if contracts are not properly scrutinised and if there is mismanagement in the strategic planning of such events. If ensuring that the events go to plan is a difficult exercise, so too is the effort that is required to build a lasting legacy. That legacy will require a change in attitude and culture if it is to transform more than just a few sections of society.</p><p>That is why the Scottish Conservatives have worked intensively with Gavin Hastings to establish a grass-roots sports trust&#8212;an independent charitable trust run on the basis of supporting communities by making available more opportunities for youngsters in areas where there has been too little activity. I hear what the Government says and I applaud it for some new initiatives, but we must do much more&#8212;particularly in an age when, as Dr Simpson said, councils are struggling with their finances&#8212;to ensure that we truly value PE staff, outdoor education specialists, swimming pool attendants and any other support staff as people who can set youngsters on the first road. Another important aspect of our trust fund idea is the facility for businesses, philanthropists and other groups to have the opportunity to put something back into their communities and to do what they can to inspire greater physical activity among all people in that community.</p><p>Be in no doubt about the effort that is required to engage more fully with these youngsters. The SNP has made some progress on the target of two hours of quality PE, but progress is still fairly short of the target set out in 2007, which is demonstrated by the shifting of the target to 2014. That shows the extent of what we have to do. It remains the case that many schools hide behind excuses for why they are unable to deliver better opportunities. Perhaps there will be improvements as a result of HMIE inspections, the curriculum for excellence and some of the initiatives that the minister has set out.

I pay tribute to the work of Adam Ingram in that policy area.

Quite apart from the SNP&#8217;s fallacious argument that higher education should be free, there is the extraordinary continuing belief in SNP ranks that the funding gap that Scottish universities face is only &#163;155 million. That sum was based on the assumption that the average fee in England would be &#163;7,500 and that, crucially, fees would not be linked to inflation, yet we now know that 100 English universities&#8212;75 per cent of all higher education institutions in England&#8212;have declared that the level at which they will set their fees will equate to an average of &#163;8,766. In addition, we know that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Office for Fair Access have said that the English universities will be able to raise their fees in line with inflation, so what credibility does the SNP have when it says that the funding gap is only &#163;155 million?</p><p>I issue another stark warning to the cabinet secretary: he should not use his failure to address the funding issue to criticise what he says is a lack of accountability in the further and higher education institutions, for if one thing is clear it is that there is a fear in the sector that the Scottish Government wants to centralise control and to compromise their autonomy. For them, sustainable funding and preserving their autonomy are non-negotiable.

There is a wealth of information in which each group sets out its own manifesto. Reading through those that relate to education, including&#8212;interestingly&#8212;those that relate to the tertiary sector from where there is perhaps the greatest demand at the moment for additional resources, there is universal acceptance that the early years are paramount, not just because of the health and social aspects that were described by Murdo Fraser in his introduction, but because it is a delicate task to get the balance right between those factors and the child&#8217;s education.</p><p>It is a given that children invariably fare better when they grow up in a loving, caring and well-balanced environment in which family life is the centrepiece and in which they can flourish, both socially and academically, in the company of their teachers and school friends. It is important to recognise that there is no ready mix of those factors and that success can never be prescribed merely by the actions of Government. That point has been made in each of the thoughtful preceding speeches.</p><p>Of course, what Government can do is put in place a raft of policies that help to create a more conducive environment in which parents and their children can thrive and where the education experience, from its earliest stages, is of the highest quality. Apart from ensuring that there is greater support for parents to recognise and adopt their full responsibilities in fulfilling their challenging role in society, we need to find ways of providing a structure of education that can combine excellence with flexibility, greater parental choice and greater diversity, so that the child&#8217;s needs and the expectations of the parents drive the system, rather than its being driven by any doctrinaire vision that believes that the state knows better than anyone else.</p><p>So, what needs to be done on the education front to complement the health policies that were outlined by Murdo Fraser? First, we need to ensure that we do much better in providing parents with greater choice and flexibility in nursery school placing. I suggest that there is a consensus among all the parties that nursery support is invaluable, not only to the wellbeing and development of the 107,000 children in Scotland who attended pre-school education in 2010 but in providing support to parents who live away from their own parents or relatives or who are raising a child on their own and cannot rely on their partner for support.</p><p>That is why we think that there is room for improvement in the current system. Many parents want greater flexibility when it comes to using their entitlements. As a result, some&#8212;not all&#8212;parents want a wider range of providers. A Daycare Trust report that came out yesterday, shows that the average annual cost of 25 hours of nursery care a week for a child under two is highest in Scotland, at &#163;5,220, compared with just more than &#163;5,000 in England and a little more than &#163;4,700 in Wales. Conservatives argue not only that if there is more choice, parents will have more options in choosing which provision best suits them and their child, but that more robust competition between providers will inevitably lead to an overall reduction in costs, in some cases.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Intervention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In this hectic season of budgets, election preparation and the endless requests to attend hustings and briefing meetings, there is also the very important business for parliamentarians in interpreting the key messages that come from the main groups that are interested in our respective portfolios.

There is work to be done in that regard and it is important that child care be included in the package. That is something that we definitely need to think about.</p><p>Secondly, when it comes to providing greater choice, partnerships need to work properly. Partnership nurseries that involve local authorities and private providers should be true partnerships. Currently, some local authorities are dictating the allocation of places and ignoring official guidelines. Indeed, partnership status has been withdrawn from some private nurseries in Scotland, which means that parents have had to find another partner nursery or risk losing a part-time funded place. In some cases, that is worth up to &#163;1,550 per year for each child. That is a wholly unsatisfactory situation.</p><p>Thirdly, we want to work with teachers, support staff and teacher training colleges to ensure that there is greater emphasis on effective training for all teachers and support staff in recognising special needs at the earliest stage. As Mary Scanlon has said, detection is vital. The Scottish Government has done pioneering work in that respect and we give Adam Ingram and his colleagues credit for the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, but we need to do more to help teachers and parents to identify problems at the earliest stage, so that there is proper co-ordination of the individual programmes that can help children who have special needs. We need to be aware of the demands from teachers about the important need to address the issue.</p><p>Fourthly, we need to address literacy and numeracy at the earliest age. There are many international studies on the theme, the vast majority of which show that an early grasp of literacy and numeracy can heighten a child&#8217;s confidence and success, and that children are more likely to flourish when teaching methods are consistent. We look forward to further developments in the area.</p><p>Children need and want stability. Without doubt, what happens in a child&#8217;s earliest years has the biggest influence on their future. There is a very fine balancing act for Government to achieve, between standing aside to allow society to place its full trust and faith in parents and the family and legislating, where it must, to provide better welfare. Like many other social debates of the modern era, the debate is highly emotive and complex, but it is one from which we must not shy away.

During that debate, there was considerable discussion on the need to ensure that we preserve all that is best for future generations; so too is that the central principle behind the bill that we debate this afternoon.</p><p>Good-quality and accessible public records and archives are an essential part of improving the welfare of society in general, if not also the democracy about which Sandra White spoke in her reference to common good funds. If I may be allowed to say so, she made a very good point in that regard. It is fair to say that records can make a life-changing difference to individuals and families; that point was made forcibly to the committee on several occasions.</p><p>While the main driving force for the bill was the very unsatisfactory circumstances that affected many of our most vulnerable people, particularly those whose cases were flagged up by the historic abuse systemic review, there are other important reasons why we must do something to improve things. I refer in particular to the need to create greater efficiency, spread good practice and keep costs to a minimum. No one doubts the need to do that if we are to ensure more of a level playing field across the country and if we are to avoid the gaps in our knowledge that poor record keeping&#8212;or, indeed, in some cases, no record keeping&#8212;can bring about. I think that we all accept that organisations that receive public money have an obligation to ensure that records are kept properly and that they are accessible and transparent.</p><p>That said, there is still a debate to be had on striking the right balance between ensuring greater efficiency and not imposing too much of a regulatory burden on bodies and including more of them under the wider net of officialdom. As the minister rightly said, we need to keep the debate in perspective. We need to remember that the debate is on how to improve the management of records, not on what records are, or are not, included under the remit of public bodies. The latter debate might, understandably, arouse even more controversy.</p><p>I heard the exchanges about the voluntary sector, in particular the exchange between the minister and Claire Baker. I, too, have concerns about the voluntary sector. These are organisations without which Scotland would be a much poorer place, particularly when it comes to looking after our most vulnerable people. I fully understand what the minister said on the subject, and I am grateful to her for her reassurances, but we must take on board the fact that the voluntary sector does so much for Scotland; it serves the country very well. At the moment, the voluntary sector is under not only huge financial pressure, but legislative pressure. We must take cognisance of the pressures that the sector is under. It would be a great pity if some people felt obliged to move away from the voluntary sector because of those burdens.</p><p>My biggest concern was about the evidence from some voluntary sector groups that they could find no compelling evidence of a major issue with their existing processes and that the new legislative framework could be not only unnecessary but burdensome and time consuming for staff who have many other tasks to do, particularly when budgets are tight, which applies not just in a recession. Those concerns raised serious issues for me, which the minister has given an assurance will be addressed at stage 2.</p><p>Linked to that is the genuine concern, which some members have mentioned, about a tendency to overimplement the bill, because of the mindset these days that we must do that. I would be concerned if workloads increased as a result, so it was good to hear the minister&#8217;s reassurance on that.</p><p>Everyone is sympathetic to the former residents of children&#8217;s homes and special schools and to their families, who have had immense difficulty in accessing the records that they require. We appreciate the emotional issues that have resulted from sometimes harrowing experiences. It is clear that those difficulties present a strong case for change and for addressing many of the inconsistencies in records management across Scotland, but it is vital that we as parliamentarians scrutinise properly all the effects of making the process legislative rather than voluntary.

That has been a pertinent issue this week, given some reports from the business community.</p><p>Colleges in Scotland have proven themselves to be outstanding, and are an important part of the Scottish education landscape. They are also fundamental to our economic success as a nation. They offer a huge range of qualifications, from access courses at Scottish credit and qualifications framework level 3 right up to PhDs at level 12. Their recent strength has lain in their adaptability to national and economic circumstances and in their flexibility in responding to different regional demands. That is a factor that is aided in no small part by the enhanced autonomy that they have enjoyed since a Conservative Government passed the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992. Like universities, Scotland&#8217;s colleges are rightly protective of their autonomy. The enhancement of that autonomy will ensure the continued success of the sector.</p><p>In its most recent briefing, Scotland&#8217;s Colleges stated:</p><p>&#8220;The success of the college sector is fundamentally dependent on local autonomy and the flexibility and responsiveness that this creates.&#8221;</p><p>Andrew Welsh gave us clear evidence of that in his speech.</p><p>I am sure that it will come as no surprise to members that the Conservatives want to encourage greater scope for colleges to work with local schools, universities and businesses to enhance their economic and social contribution and to open up new opportunities to students through better integrated learner pathways. On working with schools, it would be helpful to have a more clearly defined two-route system from 14 years onwards, and to put much more emphasis on the skills that are required in the world of work, whether that is on awareness of the crucial need to turn up for work on time, to be appropriately dressed in a professional environment, or to know how to make calls and write letters to clients or customers. Senior businesses raised that important point just this week.</p><p>If we are serious about opening up new academic and vocational routes to pupils, it is important and logical that colleges, as the largest providers of skills for new entrants and existing employees in the Scottish workforce, play a foremost role. From an academic perspective, I agree entirely with the suggestion from Scotland&#8217;s Colleges that there could be simplification of some academic qualifications, but nonetheless greater rigour in some ways for members of the student population in Scotland&#8217;s colleges who are undertaking considerable higher education courses.</p><p>On collaboration with universities, there is a lot of good will from both the college sector and the universities and there is a lot of scope to build upon the excellent collaborative work that has taken place. Andrew Welsh referred to that and gave examples, and I know that my colleague Alex Johnstone will expand on the matter.</p><p>I have put it on public record many times that there is great scope in Scotland to adopt the principle of greater flexibility in the exam system. That can help to facilitate benefits for the education of more of our young people and allow us greater flexibility in how we fund it. It is clear that that will be important.</p><p>Our time is short.

It is also over a quarter of a century since I was a young student teacher at Boroughmuir high school, where Robin Harper was a teacher of modern studies. The pupils said that they liked Robin Harper very much and that he was a terrific teacher, and that they liked best his colourful ties. Some things do not change. Likewise, some things do not change in economics. Certain principles stay very much the same: first, unemployment is bad; secondly, productivity is good; and, thirdly, individuals have the potential to be the greatest asset of any country.</p><p>Our hearts sink when we hear that the Scottish unemployment rate is rising three times faster than that in England, that the percentage of unemployed school leavers has risen by more than a percentage point in the last five years, that Scotland&#8217;s productivity rate is almost 5 per cent lower than the UK average, and that we have an education system that still, despite all its assets, fails properly to equip too many of our school leavers with the skills and knowledge that employers demand, and which pressures too many young people to go to university because there are not sufficient opportunities available for a non-university-based education. Indeed, that last point has become my party&#8217;s clarion call because it has identified the issue as being a fundamental problem that must be addressed if we are to claim that we are genuinely concerned about the economic and social advancement of Scotland. That is why I welcome the opportunity to debate Robin Harper&#8217;s motion, which has rightly identified the growing problem of unemployment among 16 to 19-year-olds.</p><p>Although I can agree with the general tone of the motion, it is our view that if we want to deliver the best possible opportunities for young people, there needs to be a more diverse range of opportunities even before they reach the age of 16. As far as we are concerned, there should be a clearly defined two-route system from 14 onwards, in which young people are able to choose the form and type of education that they would like to continue, be it largely skills based or more weighted in favour of academic pursuits. That demands that young people receive improved and much more varied advice in careers departments.</p><p>That system has been proved to be incredibly successful in countries such as Denmark and Germany. Those are countries where youth unemployment is lower than it is in Scotland, predominantly because their young people have become much better at defining their career paths and are better equipped with business skills. Nora Senior, who is vice-chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said recently at a conference that</p><p>&#8220;there needs to be a whole-scale change to the way we talk about vocational and academic qualifications&#8221;.</p><p>I acknowledge the Scottish Government&#8217;s attempt to take that further. It is a view that has also been endorsed by Angela Knight, who is chief executive of the British Bankers Association. She rightly suggests that we will go much further if we improve the quality of the careers advice that we give to young people as early as secondary 1 and S2, so that they are given sufficient access to all the information that they need to make an informed choice.</p><p>Quite simply, if we as parliamentarians and Scots want to maximise the opportunities of our young people, it is not good enough to continue with the mediocre status quo of channelling all our children through a one-size-fits-all school system; an education, I suggest, for which they may in some cases have neither the inclination nor the aptitude to take best advantage. They have, however, other aptitudes, which would be much better utilised if they were given a different focus. The myth remains&#8212;it is a myth&#8212;that university is always a better place to be for fulfilling career aspirations.</p><p>If we want change, we must ensure that we are offering our school pupils a wider range of options at an earlier age&#8212;options that are flexible and which are backed up with the requisite support.</p><p>My colleague Gavin Brown will make comments about a Scottish youth microcredit scheme and how to engender a more entrepreneurial spirit. Any system that aspires to make entrepreneurs and wealth creators out of our young people is always worth a second look and, as Robin Harper rightly said, it is very much part of Scotland&#8217;s distinguished tradition. However, entrepreneurs need vision, they need direction and&#8212;crucially, I suggest&#8212;they need to posses the requisite skills and acumen to make the most of business.</p><p>I was interested this week to hear the Law Society of Scotland make strong recommendations that classes on legal issues, rights and responsibilities should be on offer in Scottish schools. That is a similar theme to the one that has been pursued in petition PE1354, which has been brought to the Scottish Parliament by the campaigner Stewart MacKenzie. The same can be said for classes on financial management and entrepreneurship.</p><p>That is why it is imperative that we make the changes that we have suggested in the debate. It is not enough, as the comparative evidence on microfinance suggests, to provide handouts while hoping that miracles will occur.

The fact that there have been so few amendments is becoming a major debating point, but it does not suggest that parliamentary scrutiny has been any less rigorous. It has been more rigorous, and we should bear that in mind.</p><p>The bill was set out as a technical amending bill rather than one of substantial import and substance, but it has encompassed some extremely important points of detail and it has raised important issues about legal interpretation. I will come back to that later.</p><p>As many members have said this afternoon, Scotland&#8217;s historic environment is the very precious fabric of this country. It is one of the most defining aspects of Scotland and it can bring enormous social and economic benefit, most especially in the form of visitor income. The bill matters even if it will not necessarily hit the headlines in the same way as many other items of parliamentary legislation would.</p><p>Of course, the minimal cost involved was also in the bill&#8217;s favour. That was a pleasant change as far as the Government was concerned. Perhaps that is one reason why the bill has progressed a little more smoothly than most.</p><p>When it comes to the front line in the protection of our historic environment, there are many legal issues. At stage 1, many people made a powerful case for the general principles of the bill and its prime objective, which is to preserve and enhance Scotland's historic environment for future generations. They made some points of legal detail. The comments were informed, and I pay tribute to the many people who gave us evidence and played a supporting role. Their deliberations were balanced and informative, and the briefings that we have received since have also been helpful.</p><p>I note the comments, made by various members, about there being a need for clarification in several areas and perhaps a little need for the streamlining of the administration of our historical environment. That point was picked up by several speakers during today&#8217;s debate and by several key stakeholders throughout the earlier stages. There can be no objection about the need for greater clarity, especially when it comes to the interpretation of existing legislation, notwithstanding the current need to make the legislation compatible with the Valletta convention.</p><p>For example, at stage 2 there was an interesting debate surrounding amendment 14&#8212;the doocot amendment&#8212;and what circumstances have to pertain before a local council can or, perhaps more important, should use its powers of intervention. The committee convener raised the issue following a constituency issue that had questioned what constituted a state of danger. The minister was very clear in her evidence on 15 December 2010 that powers exist to do something about that, but committee members needed to make up their minds about whether they were being used appropriately. That is quite an important issue as we bring the bill to its conclusion. There seemed to be some doubt in the minds of various councils, so there was ambiguity on that point. We should bear that in mind for the future.</p><p>Secondly, there was much debate about the defence of ignorance in section 3, particularly the possibility of all but removing the defence. There are genuine situations in which human error can occur. We had to be conscious that the problem could be compounded if a lack of clarity about what constitutes an historic monument continues.</p><p>Thirdly, there was the issue of the production of certain inventories. Like any taxonomy, they are open to interpretation&#8212;a point made by others in their stage 1 contributions. Although I would argue that difficulty should never be a reason for not doing something that is worth while, we urged caution when it came to section 11, where the bill attempts to deal with responsibilities.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank made the point that the jury is still out, not least because of some of the divisions of opinion that exist between the committee and stakeholder groups.

No one pretends that dualling the A9 will end all accidents, but it is clear that such a move will greatly reduce the number of accidents and save lives. We all know that the major problems with the A9 between Perth and Inverness are the long and dangerous stretches of single carriageway across which it can be very difficult to turn and, as we have all seen for ourselves, that many of the worst accidents occur on stretches where the road continually switches between single and dual carriageway.</p><p>The A9 is, by definition, one of Scotland&#8217;s most important transport links, particularly north of Perth, where it is very difficult to take alternative routes. It must therefore be a priority.</p><p>As Charlie Gordon said, it is important to maintain a particular tone in this debate. In that spirit, I suggest to the Scottish National Party that it consider what it said in 2007 about the trams project. At First Minister&#8217;s question time, there was a debate about the importance of semantics; semantics are certainly important here, because I think that the SNP perhaps gave the wrong impression in 2007 about what trams project money could or could not be used for. That is a matter of public record. The SNP should reflect on that, because I do not think that the transport issues in these two areas can be played off against each other. They are quite separate projects with very different aims and, if we are to believe what the SNP said in 2007, money for them was to come from different funding streams.</p><p>As we know, far too many lives have been lost, there have been too many serious injuries and too many families have been affected because of the lack of dualling on the A9. None of us, whether in the Opposition or in the Government, can afford to ignore the statistics and the despair of the affected families. Having the title of Scotland&#8217;s most dangerous road is frightening and causes communities across Perthshire and the Highland region considerable concern.

Just what, they will rightfully ask, is the main subject to be discussed in this, the first education debate of our election year? I, too, was a bit puzzled, especially when I saw the motion and the other amendments. I sought guidance from the chamber desk on what would or would not be declared competent business this morning. \"Education\" was the theme, I was told, so let me use the debate to set out why I believe we are right to be critical of the SNP's record in education, but also to set that against some tasters from the Tory education stall for the elections in May. That is what the voters deserve and what they will be expecting us to do.</p><p>Education was something for which Scotland was once renowned, across the world. Scotland was the home of the third-oldest university in the English-speaking world, the home of the European enlightenment and the home of intellectual giants such as Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson and William Robertson; we even boasted of having three universities in the top 100 in the world in 2009. I want educational excellence to be a thing of the <place-holder colnum=\"32130\"/> future as well as of the past, and I am sure that that is the aspiration of every member, never mind every party, in the Parliament. However, that will not be the case unless we confront the facts&#8212;all the facts, not just the ones that the cabinet secretary has read out this morning. That is not to deny or to diminish some of the excellent features of what is happening in our Scottish schools on a daily basis.</p><p>Some of the unacceptable facts are as follows. Since 1999, successive Scottish Administrations have doubled input spending on our schools, yet the overall standards of the outputs have not been so good. That important fact has been central to the considerations in the Donaldson report, which will be published today. Two thirds of S2 pupils are struggling with literacy, and 13,000 pupils still leave school each year unable to read or write properly. Only 30 per cent of pupils in S2 are reaching the required standard in maths, despite the figure being 85 per cent in P3. Scottish pupils are now ranked below the global average in maths and science.</p><p>Aside from the basic attainment issues there are concerns, as some Labour members have mentioned, about poor discipline in some schools, about a lack of PE and extra-curricular activities, about the availability of some higher and advanced higher courses and about whether headteachers have too little power when it comes to running their own schools. More recently, our world-class universities tell us that the Scottish Government has presented them with a financial situation that is unsustainable beyond the next academic year.</p><p>Some people will argue that that is to do with the proficiency of two SNP education secretaries. Just as important have been the unrealistic and uncosted election pledges that they made in 2007, which raised expectations well beyond the ability to deliver them. Those pledges were specific in terms of numbers: 18 or fewer pupils in all primaries 1 to 3, a guarantee of maintaining 53,000 teachers, two hours per week of quality PE, and so on. Those are very rigid national targets, which, notwithstanding the concordat, have provided huge headaches for local authorities&#8212;and they were encouraged by the SNP Government to be much more flexible in setting their priorities. That is a real tension within the system, which, I suspect, is behind much of the recent fiasco in Argyll and Bute.</p><p>This year, 2011, is an election year, and it is incumbent upon all of us not to dwell on other parties' failings but to say what we, as Opposition parties, would do. Scottish Conservatives firmly believe that Scottish education can be excellent once more, but not if there is the pretence that all is well in the current system and if there is an in-<place-holder colnum=\"32131\"/> built resistance to change. That attitude is increasingly being encountered in the educational world&#8212;by Graham Donaldson, Keir Bloomer, Lindsay Paterson, the EIS and Universities Scotland to name just a few.</p><p>That change must embrace the true spirit of devolution, so that decisions are taken, as far as possible, by the people who are most skilled to make them: by teachers and headteachers, who know far better than local authorities what is best for the needs of individual pupils in their schools; and by parents, who want the assurance that every local area will have a good taxpayer-funded school on their doorstep and that they will have more freedom to choose which school best suits their child and more flexibility when it comes to spending nursery care entitlements. There must be the opportunity for groups other than local authorities to set up new schools, more autonomy for our colleges and universities and more assistance, whether through pupil premiums or increased college and university bursaries, for pupils who might not otherwise have access to the best possible education.</p><p>Nothing will change if the Government in Scotland continues to be obsessed with a one-size-fits-all policy for local authorities, which stifles parental choice, perpetuates the monopoly of state provision of schools and all too often leads to contentment with academic mediocrity rather than excellence. I look forward to lunch time, when we will be able to see the full detail of Graham Donaldson's recommendations, particularly on how teacher training can play its role in raising standards, especially in relation to literacy and numeracy.</p><p>The Parliament's Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee will shortly review the process of school management, just as the cabinet secretary wanted to do when he wrote his seminal book, \"Grasping the Thistle\", when he hoped that SNP back benchers would move away from the outdated view that SNP councillors know better than headteachers&#8212;maybe he meant cabinet secretaries.</p><p>Education, whether in the earliest years or at post-graduate level, is at a watershed in Scotland. There is great need for change, and voters realise that. Let us give them a robust debate, which is worthy of the political process.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7692.1, to leave out from \"condemns\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the SNP government's failure to deliver on its education pledges; further notes that many of them were unrealistic, uncosted and the wrong priorities for pupils and parents; regrets that the Scottish Government has failed to bring forward any substantive reforms to school management, but recognises the educational benefits of 'free schools' and of giving more decision-making powers <place-holder colnum=\"32132\"/> and greater financial control to head teachers of all other publicly funded schools.\"</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21177845", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I remind the cabinet secretary that most members in the chamber can read.

Secondly, the strong point was made that, unless a strategy is backed by legislation, it will not be implemented, because there is no compulsion on local authorities to do so. In other words, a postcode lottery could remain in how well local authorities make provision. Thirdly, there was the overriding concern that many adults with autism suffer undetected and in social and economic isolation.</p><p>None of the concerns is inconsiderable but, at the end of the day, we needed to question whether the existing legislation is satisfactory in addressing the concerns of people with autism and, if the answer was no, what examples could be found to show how new legislation could improve the outcomes.</p><p>In each case, I, like my committee colleagues, was persuaded by much of the evidence. I was not, however, persuaded about the need for legislation. Let me explain why. First, it could easily be argued&#8212;indeed, it has been argued&#8212;by other groups that autism is not alone in requiring better support. Exactly the same demands about a strategy could be made for sufferers of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, motor neurone disease and many other conditions. They, too, have a good cause and, from both a practical as well as legal position&#8212;not to mention the cost factor&#8212;it would prove exceedingly difficult to avoid a discriminatory situation that would set a precedent for extensive and costly legislation across the board.</p><p>Secondly, the committee found it difficult to find specific examples of legislative changes that would bring additional benefits that would not already be available if the existing legislation were working properly. I suggest that perhaps one difficulty in measuring all of this is the relatively embryonic stages of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, which has not yet had sufficient time to bear fruit, <place-holder colnum=\"32022\"/> including in the ability to provide the extra support that can be given to all people with additional support needs, especially in the practice of earlier detection, which the Conservatives successfully fought to include in the act.</p><p>I know only too well that Hugh O'Donnell and many people who provided evidence are likely to feel bitterly disappointed and perhaps badly let down by the committee. I understand that, but I want them to know that we have gone through the proposal with a fine-tooth comb and I think that we have made the right judgment.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175903", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been very important to have the debate, and I pay tribute to the professional manner in which Hugh O'Donnell has set about representing the best interests of the autistic population and to the assistance that he provided to the committee in flagging up what he saw as the deficiencies with the status quo.

As Sandra White and Paul Martin have said, a loving family will always be better placed to provide social, economic, emotional, educational and moral support than will be any other institution, which&#8212;through no one's fault&#8212;cannot be expected to provide the same level of individual care. That fact is widely accepted by all parties in the Parliament. The speeches that have preceded mine prove the point: kinship care is the best option when children cannot live with their parents. It provides the child with the best chance of overcoming the often disruptive and stressful circumstances that they face.</p><p>Scotland has no shortage of kinship care and it has outstanding examples of it. More than 13,000 children are cared for by grandparents, uncles, aunts or other relatives&#8212;that is one in 70 children in some form of kinship care arrangement. We should recognise that such arrangements are saving the taxpayer vast sums of money every year, and that feat is even more remarkable when we consider the age group of many of the people who are doing the caring. About three quarters of kinship carers are the grandparents of the child, and more than a quarter of the children are cared for by a relative who is at least 50 years older than them. That presents a considerable challenge. Figures such as those put the sacrifice and generosity of carers into sharp focus. We cannot thank them enough.</p><p>Sacrifice and generosity have already been mentioned in relation to the Scottish Government's commitment to try to achieve by 2011 parity between payments to kinship carers and those to foster carers. My views on the issue are already on record; so, too, are my concerns about having in place a concordat that sets even more of a challenge because while it contains specific national Government targets it also allows councils to set their own priorities. We need to address that issue more fully.</p><p>I wish to focus on the sometimes forgotten point about kinship care. It is a dilemma that faces us all in the chamber as we acknowledge that there will be many different reasons for kinship care. We know that the majority of children who fall into that situation are there because of a breakdown in relationships with their parents, which is often fuelled by a number of social ills, including substance abuse, criminality, child neglect or abuse. It is only in a small number of cases that children end up in kinship care because of a family bereavement or very difficult circumstances arising from illness.</p><p>While we salute the relatives who take over the caring responsibilities for the children, we also <place-holder colnum=\"31810\"/> need to recognise that the other half of the story is often one of family breakdown and of parents proving themselves to be unreliable and irresponsible in some way&#8212;a trend that, I would argue, is becoming more common rather than less common. In other words, kinship care is a double-edged sword of family beneficence on one hand and of family breakdown on the other.</p><p>About 137,000 children have no parent in work; 200,000 children are living in poverty; 60,000 children are affected by the drug problem of one or both parents; 100,000 children live with parents who are addicted to alcohol. It might be an inconvenient truth for us, but the Joseph Rowntree Foundation tells us that the gap between rich and poor has widened over the past 10 years, and there is more evidence of the social and financial pressures that are contributing to the rise in the breakdown of Scottish families. Until we get to grips with that as a united Parliament, as has been said such statistics will continue to highlight a very frightening circumstance.</p><p>I finish on the need to make a full commitment on this issue, and I again congratulate Johann Lamont on all the work that she does.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Children (Kinship Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Johann Lamont for initiating the debate.

It is absolutely beyond question that the children's hearings system is an immensely important part of the way in which we protect and care for our most vulnerable children. It is also beyond question that the central principles of the bill are those that were first set out by Kilbrandon in 1964&#8212;principles that are just as relevant today as they were then. However, it is clear that several aspects of the current children's hearings system needed to be addressed, although I was sceptical at the start of the process about whether we really needed a legislative process to make the necessary changes. As I said earlier this afternoon, we should note the extent of the differing opinions, even at the later stages in our deliberations, and not just between stakeholder groups but within them. That situation has made our job as parliamentarians even more complex.</p><p>A wide range of issues have been raised, including how to improve training and national standards; the right of the child to confidentiality; ECHR compatibility; improving the feedback to panel members; the definition of the term \"relevant persons\"; and many more. However, for me, the most essential challenge throughout the passage of the bill has been to ensure that the best part of the existing system&#8212;the effective delivery of assistance for each child at local level&#8212;is retained while we modernise the structure, improve accountability and deliver better outcomes for our young people.</p><p>At several points in the process, I worried about whether we were about to construct a legislative sledgehammer to crack a relatively small <place-holder colnum=\"30961\"/> administrative nut&#8212;I had to put that in for the minister&#8212;and whether the Scottish Government was at times becoming a little too anxious about issues to do with the ECHR. It was much more important to me that we found a clear, manageable, fair and acceptable situation for all the parties that built on the best practice to be found in the local environment and with which children and panel members are most familiar.</p><p>I have been adamant all along that that should be the defining feature of the system and that any process of reform should not impair or remove those principles. I am immensely grateful to the other parties for their support and to the minister and his team for being prepared to negotiate on that front. I am also grateful to several panel members, local authority representatives and legal advisers for their assistance on the issue. Any legislation that lost the connection between the children's hearings system and local communities would have been a serious mistake.</p><p>I am mindful of the views of several stakeholders who felt, quite rightly, that we were in danger of debating too much about the procedures rather than about how to improve the outcomes for our children.</p><p>As we pass this bill this evening and as the convener said, we must be mindful of the need to keep a watching brief on how well we can balance the leadership role of the national convener while strengthening the local connection and delivery of a first-class service in local areas. There remains a lack of clarity about the operation of area support teams, particularly in light of recent economic troubles, which are forcing councils to review their best practice. Linked to that is accountability, whether related to how local authorities deliver their services or how they will interact with area support teams and, of course, the accountability to the Scottish Parliament of the national convener.</p><p>The bill has had a tortuous passage at several points. All along, it has been important to remember that the whole system is entirely dependent on the commitment of volunteer panel members whose skills and expertise are often of the highest standard. It has been exceptionally important to ensure that the changes that we are about to make have commanded as much support as possible from those who carry out the main duties on the front line. That has not been easy, given the requests to keep the structure as simple and non-adversarial as possible, as firmly rooted in the local community and as caring as possible for the children that we serve and to deliver more consistency across Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives give our firm commitment to the bill in the belief that we have now made that balance more possible and that <place-holder colnum=\"30962\"/> there will be increased scrutiny of how well we achieve improved outcomes for our children and how well we provide panels with informed feedback about how successful their decision making has been.

Were we in danger of compromising some of the best practice in the existing system at the expense of setting up a large and overcentralised bureaucracy, which would find it difficult to represent the needs of children who come from diverse parts of Scotland and whose circumstances may vary considerably? I note with interest that some of those concerns remain, especially among the panel chairs.</p><p>It has been our duty as parliamentarians to take those concerns seriously. The will of the committee at stage 2, however, was that legislation was needed, particularly when it came to improving consistency throughout Scotland. Therefore, it was incumbent on us all to try to create an effective balance between retaining the best parts of the existing system and adopting new practices that would not get in the way of that effective local delivery. It was, in simple terms, a debate about how to avoid localism being compromised at the expense of increasing centralisation; how to avoid the powers of the new national convener being excessive; how to define more carefully the links between area support teams, local authorities and panels themselves; and how to improve accountability, all the while remembering that what was central to the debate was the best interests of our children rather than complex systems and unnecessary legal wrangles.</p><p>At stage 2, concerns were raised by the Scottish Government about whether my attempts to preserve local autonomy at the same time as recognising the need for a national convener would encounter incompatibilities with the ECHR. Clearly, those concerns were extremely important, provided that they could be proven to be genuine rather than based upon a perceived fear that there would be a problem, when in fact none existed.<place-holder colnum=\"30949\"/></p><p>As ever, there was complex legal advice to be considered and some paring down of what was and was not a relevant consideration.

Nonetheless, I put it on the record that I am grateful to the minister and his team for allowing David McLetchie and me to discuss those legal concerns with them on several occasions, and for the Scottish Government's willingness to move to accommodate our concerns about how to preserve localism in the bill.

I do so with enthusiasm. Change is never easy, especially in the teaching profession. Given that that change, which involves adopting an entirely new methodology, has been extensive, people have done well.</p><p>I hope that I will continue to make a positive contribution on the theme as we progress through the debate. However, I am sure I am not alone in expressing just a little surprise and, perhaps, frustration that, after just three months of the implementation of the curriculum for excellence, so much of our precious parliamentary time has been taken up by a further debate on the subject, rather than on more pressing issues such as higher education, improving literacy, teacher unemployment and delivering better-quality physical education&#8212;I could go on.</p><p>I could be cynical and suggest that the motion is less about congratulating those on the front line and more about giving the cabinet secretary a \"mission accomplished\" moment, but I will remain my normal, charitable self and try to link together some of the debates by concentrating on two key principles of the curriculum for excellence: greater autonomy and flexibility in schools. Both principles are designed to provide an educational experience that is more carefully tailored to the individual needs of pupils and to raise standards of attainment.</p><p>Although there is a strong temptation for me to enter into the realms of the school management debate, I will refrain from doing so&#8212;not least because I am sure that I would upset the Presiding Officer&#8212;except to respond to an important comment by Keir Bloomer, one of the architects of the curriculum for excellence. Earlier this week, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"progress is made in the modern world by releasing the creative energies of people, in this case the teacher\".</p><p>I agree entirely and applaud the efforts of the architects of the curriculum for excellence to do <place-holder colnum=\"30310\"/> that and, by definition, to release the creative energies of our pupils. I was interested in the second part of his comment, in which he said that the current school management system constrains teachers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"far too much by direction from the top.\"</p><p>That continues to give me and, I hope, my colleagues food for thought.</p><p>When I read the initial documentation for the curriculum for excellence, I was struck by the starting point, which was to ask what education is for&#8212;a question of which we too often lose sight, but one that I genuinely believe was behind the philosophy of the curriculum for excellence. What a pity it would be if the potential of the curriculum for excellence were to be constrained by the current system of school management, which too often moves in the opposite direction from the pursuit of greater autonomy and flexibility.</p><p>I note the comments of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which, rightly, is seeking assurances that built into the system will be an effective means of evaluating just how successful the curriculum for excellence has been, both in raising attainment levels&#8212;more critical now than ever, if we are to heed yesterday's warnings from Scottish Qualifications Authority chiefs about where pupils in Scotland are falling short on basic skills&#8212;and in producing well-rounded young people. The society makes an important point about the evaluation process; the cabinet secretary may want to tell us a little more about his plans to address it.</p><p>There is another important debate around applying the three-to-18 ethos of the curriculum for excellence&#8212;which will, I hope, establish better links between each stage of a child's education&#8212;to the wider developments that are required in further and higher education. Those developments are quite separate from the debate about the current funding crisis. I suggest that it is inevitable that we will see major changes in the structure of FE and HE&#8212;changes that will affect the content and length of degree courses, increase the flexibility of movement between courses and institutions, and challenge the status quo of how HE and FE institutions operate.</p><p>If the curriculum for excellence does its job properly, it will make our young people more flexible and give many of them greater purpose in their academic careers. The Scottish Conservatives have long argued that the curriculum for excellence should provide more opportunities for pupils to leave school at an earlier stage to take up places in formal vocational training or apprenticeships and should reduce the pressure on too many of our youngsters to feel an obligation to seek university places when that may not be in their or the country's best interests.<place-holder colnum=\"30311\"/></p><p>The curriculum for excellence provides good scope for a radical remodelling of Scottish education at all levels, but one thing must underpin all its teaching&#8212;improvement in basic literacy and numeracy. I am well aware of the fact that the cabinet secretary and my colleagues in other parties intend to ensure that literacy and numeracy underpin the whole system, but I return to the comments of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the issue of how we can build in effective evaluation of the process.</p><p>We are all aware of the problems that we face. Although it is unhelpful to scaremonger, it is essential that we understand just how much we have to do to drive up standards in the area. We should be concerned about the fact that many teachers do not feel comfortable with teaching the basic skills, because they recognise that they may be part of the problem. I repeat my plea for the curriculum for excellence: it will succeed only when it is the agent that complements a good-quality grasp of the basics and of important subject knowledge.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21069683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of the Scottish Conservatives, I am happy to congratulate all the headteachers, teachers, support staff&#8212;who are often forgotten in this process&#8212;parents, pupils and students who have been involved in the initial stages of the implementation of the curriculum for excellence.

I hurried in to work only to find that the Browne to whom he had been referring was the one from Madingley with the additional letter, or indeed letters, after his name. Instead, I would have to content myself with \"Skills for Scotland: Accelerating the Recovery and Increasing Sustainable Economic Growth\". Compared with the 2007 document, that document has lost its gloss, but it is obviously destined for a much wider readership, as we are told that it is now available in eight languages. I will not presume to tell members which language it is best in. Was that document to be the most radical blueprint for a generation? Be ready to stand by for empowerment, support, simplification and strength.</p><p>To be fair, the Scottish Government is right when it says that levels of employment and productivity are clearly the benchmarks by which we can most easily measure the success and growth of an economy. We must all recognise the estimate of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, which says that a 1 per cent increase in <place-holder colnum=\"29480\"/> productivity equates to a growth in the economy of almost &#163;1 billion. Facts like those should be keeping the minister and his colleagues awake at night. We should consider that Scotland's productivity rate is almost 5 per cent lower than the UK average. That, combined with the fact that the Scottish unemployment rate is rising three times faster than the rate in England, demonstrates how vital it is to have a skills agenda. That is why the Scottish Conservatives believe, as our amendment states, that a great deal more has to be done to ensure that the supply of skills matches what employers demand.</p><p>That task is not easy. Given the pace of technological development, we have little idea of what jobs will be available 15 or 20 years down the line. However, the task is not helped if we cannot embrace a more imaginative approach. Nora Senior, vice chair of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said recently:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There needs to be a whole-scale change to the way we talk about vocational and academic qualifications\"</p><p>and&#8212;as Mr Whitton has just indicated&#8212;to how we prepare our young people for the world of work. That view chimes with many other people in business and academia, and with what the Scottish Conservatives have been saying for some time.</p><p>On pages 15 to 20 of the skills strategy, the Scottish Government says what it has achieved since 2007. Yes, there has been a little progress, but I see little sign so far of a fundamental change in our thinking. It is not enough to have initiatives here and there and to tinker around the edges. There has to be a radical overhaul of skills development, just as we are planning a radical overhaul of higher education.</p><p>Let me set out what needs to be done and let me again tackle the elephant in the room, which is the question whether too many young people feel pressured to go to university because there are insufficient opportunities for a non-university based education. I appreciate that the skills strategy outlines 15,000 modern apprenticeship starts&#8212;that is good, but there is a strong case to be made that many of those opportunities are coming too late in life.</p><p>On this side of the chamber, we are firmly of the view that there needs to be more diversity of opportunity from the age of 14 onwards and that, in terms of the curriculum, comprehensive education is not appropriate beyond secondary 2. In other words, there should be a clearly defined two-route system from age 14 onwards, in which young people are able to choose the form and type of education that they would like to continue with, be it largely skills focused or more weighted in favour of academic pursuits. That is a system <place-holder colnum=\"29481\"/> that has proven to be incredibly successful in countries such as Denmark, Germany and Finland.

It is because of those principles that we have ruled out up-front tuition fees and a pure graduate tax and instead declared ourselves in favour of a deferred fees system that is facilitated through income-contingent loans. Let me articulate those four principles. The first principle is that any funding mechanism must be needs blind so that academic merit, not wealth or privilege, is the driver for a university place. We believe that that ethos has always been central to what is best in Scottish education. The second principle is that we must do everything possible to enhance the very important autonomy of our university system, something that Sir Andrew Cubie has always rightly argued must never be undermined by Government or commercial enterprise.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21014823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Higher Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps not today.

Sir Andrew Cubie's point is that we must ensure that universities have autonomy in their decision-making processes on how to deliver the best form of education. That is what I want to preserve.</p><p>The third principle that has driven our thinking is that of income contingency, which is fundamental in ensuring that, far from being dissuaded from applying to university, less affluent students are encouraged to do so. At the heart of an income contingent scheme is the loan that is repaid by the student once a given threshold of earnings is reached at a repayment rate that is affordable to the student. In short, income contingency is a form of insurance that means that individuals repay their fees only when they can afford to. The fourth principle is variability in the fees that are charged&#8212;a variability that reflects the cost of the <place-holder colnum=\"29089\"/> individual course and the ability of the university to set the fee.</p><p>I will lay out some more home truths on those points. First, the status quo in Scotland is highly regressive.

Indeed, both the Russell Group of universities and Universities UK argue that being able to charge fees has provided them with more revenue to widen access to those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Just last week, we heard more evidence that suggests that a higher proportion of those from deprived backgrounds are making it to university in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where fees are levied, than is the case in Scotland, where there are no such fees.</p><p>Any policy recommendations that we make on higher education must work in tandem with a more flexible and efficient structure for the sector. Without addressing some of those institutional and organisational issues, we will not fully stem the tide of the financial pressures that Scottish universities face. For instance, there are 14 higher education institutions in Scotland with university status that thus far have probably not done enough to co-operate in terms of research funding and administration. Too many universities are trying to do too much in-house. Scotland, perhaps even more so than England, has a distinct advantage: the unique geographical locations of our universities, old and new. That gives us greater scope for the economies of scale and resource sharing that are a key part of my colleague David Willetts's plans in England. Also on efficiency, we agree with those in the sector who say that there is a debate to be had on the <place-holder colnum=\"29090\"/> future of the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council.</p><p>Co-operation should not be confined to the university sector alone. Just as in the independent budget review report, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and some of our university principals have stated the need for encouraging greater private sector investment in Scottish higher education. If we can succeed in achieving greater rationalisation and specialisation within our university sector while making degree qualifications more flexible&#8212;and perhaps a little shorter in some cases&#8212;we will have a better chance of attracting much-needed private sector investment. As some of my colleagues will say later in the debate, there is much scope for introducing flexibility into the degree system&#8212;a flexibility that can deliver better educational prospects and the potential for reduction in costs.</p><p>Of course, the elephant in the room is whether far too many young people feel pressurised to go to university because sufficient opportunities for non-university-based education are not available to them. Scottish Conservatives believe that that is wrong, which is why we have policies to accelerate the pace of developing top-quality, formal vocational training and apprenticeships at an earlier age and why we have been advocating more flexibility within the Scottish Qualifications Authority examination system.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21014823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Higher Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We will come to why we reject a graduate tax, which I think is what the member is suggesting.

It has dominated our debates and our discussions with parents and teachers not only because it represents a major change in our approach to education in our schools but because of the extent of the difficulties that we are encountering in the lengthy and sometimes tortuous planning process. I accept that some of those difficulties are understandable and necessary, but others are entirely avoidable.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have been supportive of the main principles of the curriculum for excellence since the start, specifically the need to enhance education in its widest sense so that the educational experience better reflects the needs of individual schools and individual pupils and because of the opportunity that it should afford to simplify and strengthen the rigour of our examination system. With hindsight, I suspect that it was never totally clear that this radical change was one of teaching methodology rather than a change to the finer detail of the curriculum. If the change was designed to help teachers to think more about the way in which they teach, how they can inspire an increasingly wide diversity of pupils in their classrooms and about how schools&#8212;primary and secondary&#8212;can be better linked into, and more responsive to, the needs of the world of work, culture and outdoor learning, then it has to be a good thing.</p><p>However, the real challenge has been to ensure that much of that skills-based philosophy can be achieved without any threat to discrete subject teaching, the basic skills of literacy and numeracy and the essential knowledge that equips for life after school. The cabinet secretary knows my concerns about what I see as the threat to academic rigour in some of that process&#8212;concerns that I share with people such as Professor Lindsay Paterson and Professor John McLaren&#8212;and I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for discussing those concerns further <place-holder colnum=\"27396\"/> with me recently. I suggest that that issue is very much at the root of teachers' concerns, especially in secondary schools. The expectation among the public and parents, and maybe even some teachers, was that there would be a new curriculum, but in fact that was never the intention. The undoubted need to address issues in teaching methodology was quite properly accompanied by questions about what exactly had to be taught and, for secondary 4 to 6, what had to be examined.</p><p>I am the last person in the chamber to argue that education is all about exams, but the reality is that they are vital in anyone's school career and for subsequent job prospects, and to a large extent they represent the endgame for our senior pupils. I am conscious of the hard work that is going on within the Scottish Qualifications Authority to provide the details of the new exam structure, but I suggest to members that that work has been made much more difficult because of the Scottish Government's own confusion about what it has been trying to achieve.</p><p>We were told that there were to be stand-alone literacy and numeracy tests, then we were told that there were not. We were told that there was to be a simplification of the exam structure to reduce the burden of assessment, yet we heard about new exams that were to be introduced, accompanied by complaints from School Leaders Scotland that the assessment burden would actually increase. We saw confusion, much of which alarmed our employers and higher education institutions, about what was to be internally and externally assessed. We were promised more formal vocational courses for schools, but we have yet to hear how that will be delivered.</p><p>On top of that, we had the extraordinary sight of the cabinet secretary having to tell the civil servants six weeks ago that much of the documentation that accompanied the guidance notes for the curriculum for excellence was woolly and vague and should be rewritten in plain English. That occurred no fewer than seven years down the road of development work that was designed to improve the literacy skills of the pupils but was largely unintelligible in its own composition. It is little wonder that teachers and parents remain so confused about what is going on.</p><p>The Labour motion mentions some of those concerns, but it quite rightly also highlights concerns about teacher numbers and the resulting fears about whether sufficient resources have been made available to support the development work for the curriculum for excellence. I would add to that the specific issue of the undue pressure that has been placed on our local authorities, not <place-holder colnum=\"27397\"/> just as a result of the financial pressures of the economic downturn, but as a direct result of the overtly ambitious Scottish Government manifesto commitments: 18 or fewer pupils in primaries 1 to 3; universal free school meals for primaries 1 to 3; maintaining teacher numbers; two hours of PE per week; and five days of outdoor education, to name just some. Not only were those not deliverable, given the resources available, but in many cases they were not the priorities of local government&#8212;class sizes and free school meals being clear examples of that. The combination of huge financial pressures and the headaches of trying to deliver the Scottish Government's very rigid national targets were too much for most authorities and were a major reason why some of the focus was removed from the curriculum for excellence development work, which has been the main concern for teachers and parents.</p><p>I do not believe that it is in anyone's interest to scaremonger on this issue. That is why we deplore any moves to engage in industrial action, which would serve only to harm the best interests of those we are trying to help, namely the pupils. I began my own teaching career in the 1980s and well remember the difficult environment that was created by industrial action, which took away some of the activities&#8212;many of them outside the classroom&#8212;that sought to involve children in the wider educational experience that we have all agreed is so central to the curriculum for excellence.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20852860", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am tempted to say that headmasters who shout are usually under considerable pressure.

It is beyond question that the children's hearings <place-holder colnum=\"27325\"/> system is an immensely important part of the way that we protect and care for our most vulnerable children. It is also beyond question that the central principles of the bill should be those that were first set out by Kilbrandon in 1964. Those principles are as relevant today as they were then.</p><p>It is absolutely right that we continue to pursue those principles, whose founding ethos is the best interests of the child and the recognition that children and young people who offend and those who require care and protection are usually, but by no means always, equally deserving of being considered as children in need. However, neither do I have any doubt that the current structure needs to be modernised and made more efficient. There are clearly serious issues to do with the current children's hearings system, which need to be addressed. I have been struck by the extent of the different opinions between the different stakeholder groups and, perhaps more strikingly, within the stakeholder groups on exactly what the changes should be, which I believe has made our task as parliamentarians even more complex.</p><p>What are the main concerns? A frequent message is that many children and young people do not feel able fully to express their views, nor do they always feel that their views are valued. There are concerns about unclear lines of accountability. Reporters and panel members often say that they need further support. There is wide variation in the volume and quality of in-service training for panel members. Perhaps most worryingly, there is an absence of a level playing field when it comes to the support that is provided across the 32 local authorities.</p><p>That said, I openly admit that, at the beginning of the process, and in the aftermath of the Scottish Government's botched attempt at the first draft of the bill, I questioned whether we actually required a legislative process to address the problems that I have just mentioned. I wondered whether we were about to construct a legislative sledgehammer to crack a relatively small administrative nut, thereby threatening some of the best practice in the current system. I have given that a great deal of thought, and I have come to accept that some new legislation is required to ensure that there is better legal representation of children, which, in turn, will ensure greater compatibility with the ECHR and with the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I am not yet persuaded, however, that the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill as it stands is the best possible legislation and will deliver the best possible outcomes for children. Although I share some concerns with the members who have already spoken and with other members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture <place-holder colnum=\"27326\"/> Committee, let me now outline the Scottish Conservative party's approach to the bill. We fundamentally accept the need for reform. Above all else, we want to deliver the best possible outcomes for the children involved, for their parents and carers, for society in general and for those whose hard work ensures the children's safekeeping. We want a structure that is clear, manageable, fair and acceptable to all parties involved, and that is built on the best practice that is to be found in the local environment with which the child and panel members are most familiar.</p><p>In that context, I will cover three important areas of concern and how we propose to address them. First, if there is one aspect of the children's hearings system about which there is relative agreement, it is the success of local delivery. Whatever we do, we must not impair that success and undermine the principle of local accountability. The challenge is how to ensure that that is the case at the same time as providing a national framework of standards that can be applied across all 32 local authorities. We need an appropriate balance, so we worry a little bit about the moves in the bill to reduce some local involvement.</p><p>I have no problem with the concept of a national body that can oversee national training and national support, but I do have a problem with legislative changes that might diminish the ability of local authorities or support groups to make decisions that are firmly based on the distinct needs of the child whose immediate environment is their home or residence within that local community. I do not believe that the Scottish Government wants to diminish that ability either, but there is an important matter to be resolved regarding the role of the national convener as it is currently set out in the bill.</p><p>The role of the new national convener is unclear. For example, and as the committee convener has already said, I am not convinced that the figurehead role that is envisaged by the Scottish Government is completely compatible with the role of providing direction and leadership in recruitment, selection and so on. The national convener will also have responsibility for delegating functions to area support teams, but there is confusion about how that will impact on the role of local authorities in the children's hearings system.</p><p>I flag up those concerns as I firmly believe that much of the rest of the bill is driven by what is expected of the national convener. Our party would like much greater assurance that the post of national convener is a prerequisite for a more efficient children's hearings system&#8212;something for which I do not yet believe the Scottish Government has made an entirely convincing case.<place-holder colnum=\"27327\"/></p><p>Secondly, there is concern that there is a lack of clarity about some key principles. For example, there is a danger that the phrase \"legal advice\", which is used extensively in the bill, at times means legal clarification&#8212;a subtle difference, I suggest. Notwithstanding my reputation in the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee with regard to semantic detail, I believe that that is a very important point. There is a difference between what someone can do and what someone ought to do, and we must be careful to ensure that the language in the bill is wholly accurate. If improving the legal representation of children is one of the main arguments for legislation, the legislation must accurately describe the intention.</p><p>Likewise, there is an issue about the proposed change to the definition of \"relevant person\" to be someone who has \"significant involvement\" with the child, rather than someone who ordinarily has care and control of the child, as is defined in the 1995 act. The Scottish Government's reason for making the change is to try to remove some of the grey areas in relation to responsibility for the child. However, I wonder whether the change will create too many procedural complexities, just as I wonder whether the proposed changes to grounds for referral will make the system more complex than ever.</p><p>Thirdly, aspects of the bill will have unintended consequences unless we are very careful. I mentioned our concerns about the role of the national convener and about whether, in the drive for national standards of care, we are in danger of creating a bigger bureaucracy and confusion about how national standards can be delivered locally. I also talked about legal complexities that might arise as a result of a change in the definition of \"relevant person\".</p><p>The extension of the child's right to confidentiality is regarded as essential if our approach is to be fully compatible with the ECHR. Under the current system, confidentiality cannot be offered unless the parents consent, but the bill will change the situation to one in which parents can be denied information about their child and about the reasons for decisions that were taken on the child's behalf. I have no doubt that good intentions are behind the proposal, but the change might lead to breaches of parents' rights under the ECHR. If parents are to continue to have a right of appeal, they must have a right to know the basis of decisions. We must carefully look again at section 171(2)(b)(ii).</p><p>I have no doubt that the debate on the bill is extremely important and that the future of many young people will depend on what we decide. The Scottish Conservatives will be constructive in the debate. We support the principles of the bill and <place-holder colnum=\"27328\"/> we will always be mindful that the best interests of the child are what matters most. To that end, some of the proposals make sense. However, a substantial number of sections need to be amended, and we will use stage 2 to bring forward proposals on how that should be done.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have absolutely no doubt about the responsibility that we face as parliamentarians as we debate whether to proceed with the bill.

Just how can we maintain and increase levels of academic excellence and the quality of our research base as well as widen access to higher education institutions while keeping higher education affordable and competitive? From that perspective, I am sure that many members have sympathy for students' concerns, as expressed in their petition on the issue. They are right to flag up the possibility of worsening financial discrepancies between England and Scotland and they are right to be concerned about the implications for higher education in Scotland.</p><p>The issue runs much deeper than that. I agree with the cabinet secretary and the Liberals that it would be unwise to make too many pronouncements on those issues of concern until the Browne review reports later this year. However, I do not accept that waiting for the Browne report should preclude the Parliament from pursuing urgent action on other matters. It is in that respect that I want to repeat our call, first made by my colleague Murdo Fraser in 2007, for a <place-holder colnum=\"26987\"/> full and independent inquiry into the future funding of higher education, and that is why we will support the Labour amendment this afternoon.</p><p>I know from the cabinet secretary's previous utterances, and from his speech today, that he will reject that call outright, so let me explain why he is wrong to do so and wrong to insist that any review of higher education can be carried out from within the sector.</p><p>First, we need to have the courage to address some of the most difficult and perhaps controversial questions that face the sector at large. That includes the question whether far too many people are at university. Far too many people are frightened to ask that question.</p><p>Before I am attacked for heresy, let me be clear about why the question must be asked. If we are to continue to deliver the highest quality of education possible, we must make that education available to all students who are genuinely academically able and well motivated, irrespective of their background or income levels. We should never allow ourselves to be dictated to by a percentage target, such as the 50 per cent target that was a mantra of the Blair era, as such targets put additional pressure on our young people and on schools to push them towards courses for which many are unsuited. I flag up the high first-year drop-out rates in some of our universities, which are higher than those in other parts of the UK and abroad. That suggests that some of those students should not be at university in the first place. Why does that happen? It is partly because of the culture of insisting that higher education is always a more socially acceptable option than vocational professions and trades are. That myth&#8212;and it is a myth&#8212;has done a great disservice to education in this country. It is high time that we did something about it. To do so, we need to take on board the opinions of many more stakeholders than just those in the sector.</p><p>Secondly, there is a need to take a much more holistic approach to education. I have heard the cabinet secretary say that several times, and I agree. We need far better articulation of higher education with schools and colleges, and with business and industry. That is another reason why we should be keen to listen to other perspectives within an independent inquiry. How ironic it would be, at a time when other stakeholders in Scotland are being fully consulted about the curriculum reforms that may underpin the new Scottish Qualifications Authority exams, and when the Browne review board in England has included representatives from all walks of life, for us to allow only the higher education sector to have an input into higher education reform. In my view, that would be extremely short-sighted. It is just another reason why the cabinet secretary is wrong.<place-holder colnum=\"26988\"/></p><p>The cabinet secretary is wrong for a third reason&#8212;because of the nature of the question that must be asked about future financing. I have heard the SNP rant on about saying no to top-up fees and that we must do nothing to lose the right to free education in this country. I am happy to say, just as my colleague Murdo Fraser has said in the past, that we do not believe that students should pay up-front fees for their education. However, I will not rule out students making a contribution to their education in some way once they have graduated, and I strongly believe that Scotland cannot afford to rule that out. Conservative members have been consistent in that view for some time.</p><p>We agree whole-heartedly with key figures such as Sir Andrew Cubie and Dr Brian Lang and with those student and lecturer representatives, including the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland and the University and College Union, who argue vociferously that we need a full and comprehensive debate about the financial perspective. We are no longer in a world in which we can continue to encourage more and more people to go into higher education, at the same time as maintaining and enhancing academic excellence, without addressing the funding issue, especially the growing gap between north and south of the border.</p><p>Like the cabinet secretary, I began my speech with a statement of fact: that Scotland has been a proud standard bearer of excellence in university education. As a politician, I am not prepared to accept anything less, and neither should any other politician in the chamber. We need a full and independent inquiry, and we need it now.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20818547", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Student Fees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The cabinet secretary began his speech by expressing how strong the tradition is in our university system, and he was right to do that.

One wise colleague suggested that a Liberal Democrat lunchtime debate bearing the name \"bluelight\" might be misinterpreted in the spirit of the new Conservative-Liberal consensus, but that is not the case as far as I am concerned, and I want to put firmly on the record the worth of the bluelight initiative. There can be no better example of good quality communication at community level than that which exists between the partners who are involved in the delivery of bluelight in Fife, including Fife Constabulary, Fife Council, NHS Fife, community volunteers, Fife Fire and Rescue Service, Carnegie College and many members from voluntary sector agencies.</p><p>As all parties have asserted many times in this chamber, volunteers and voluntary organisations play a vital role in ensuring that we all live in a stronger and more cohesive society. They do an outstanding job. However, to enhance that support, we believe that more can be done to promote the interaction between public and social services and the voluntary sector, with each taking advantage of each other's strengths.<place-holder colnum=\"26204\"/></p><p>The bluelight initiative has already established itself as a well-regarded youth engagement initiative in Fife and across other Scottish police force areas, working to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour through a range of alcohol and drug-free youth events and programmes, as Jim Tolson said.</p><p>Drug abuse threatens the very fabric of our society. It destroys lives, tears families apart, leads to widespread and recurring crime and to the disintegration of entire communities. It is therefore essential that we must harness not only all the resources of the state but the goodwill and determination of communities to not only discourage drug abuse but to do everything possible to eliminate it. Financial resources can do only so much. What we really need is a change of attitudes, and positive youth and community partnerships like bluelight can only help to achieve this aim.</p><p>The Parliament firmly believes that we can often learn from best practice in other countries; the bluelight initiative is an example of such an approach, having been modelled on successful youth programmes in Australia, New Zealand and the south Pacific. I hope such positive approaches can be developed in other policy areas too.</p><p>I have long advocated the need to engage more with our young people and to develop positive youth engagement initiatives throughout Scotland in order to address what is often seen as the problem of our disengaged youth. It is easy for politicians to stand here and in other places and talk, but it is the hard work of the many thousands of youth workers and volunteers that day in and day out provides positive support for young people throughout Scotland, often in difficult circumstances. I welcome the steering group that has been set up by the Scottish Government to provide strategic direction and to ensure collaboration between the many partners that are needed to make leadership activity effective. The voluntary sector will be free to come up with innovative solutions to the social problems that face our society only if it is truly independent and autonomous of Government, albeit with crucial Government support.</p><p>In my area, many smaller groups already provide additional youth and community opportunities. The youth group @spire has proved to be hugely successful and gives young people in the communities in places such as Milnathort, Kinnesswood and Scotlandwell something to do every Tuesday, in the Milnathort church hall. Youth worker Hannah Pickles provides a youth drop-in service to give support and advice for young people, especially from the rural community.<place-holder colnum=\"26205\"/></p><p>The bluelight initiative has established itself as a fine example of partnership working in the voluntary sector. I hope that we will be able to go further in the future and develop strong partnerships. The Scottish Conservatives have repeatedly called for a longer-term strategic review of social work services and how those services can utilise the expertise of the voluntary sector in dealing with some of the most profound issues in our communities. I firmly agree with Jim Tolson that bluelight is a valuable and effective initiative that should be developed further in communities throughout Scotland. Nationally, there is variability in funding for such youth services, and there is a real need to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

I say at the outset that we will support the Scottish Government's motion and Labour's amendment. I am aware that I have some work to do to persuade members that it is worth while for them to support our amendment, too.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with what the minister and Karen Whitefield said about social care workers. We, too, commend the outstanding work of the thousands of social care workers throughout the country who do a first-class job day in, day out, often in extremely difficult circumstances that demand a huge variety of skills. I hope that we can all agree that the overwhelming need is to provide them with support rather than blame them personally for any of the shortcomings that have been identified in various reports. We need to recognise that four out of five people who access social care are extremely happy with the service that they receive and with the idea that social care workers are often best placed to help them to lead a more independent life.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, many of the statistics on the number of those who require support are deeply worrying. The statistics for children are particularly stark. Some 137,000 children have no parent in work, 200,000 children are living in poverty, 60,000 children are affected by the drug problem of one or more than one parent and 100,000 live with parents who are addicted to alcohol, therefore it is not surprising that the number of children who are looked after by local authorities has increased every year since 2001. Over the past 11 years, within that overall rise, there have been steep increases in the numbers of pre-school and primary school-age children&#8212;32 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. That is one of the most worrying features&#8212;perhaps it is the most worrying feature&#8212;that we must address. It is incumbent on all of us to take on board the serious warnings that the Social Work Inspection Agency <place-holder colnum=\"25911\"/> has issued about the implications of those increases for the future, specifically the expected growth in the number of teenage children who will require to be looked after away from home.</p><p>Similarly, we cannot ignore the Social Work Inspection Agency's conclusions, which make it clear that there is all too often a postcode lottery when it comes to the quality of care. The agency found that not enough local authorities</p><p class=\"indent\">\"had consistent and coherent approaches to achieve long term security for children\".</p><p>It found that, too often, the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"quality of risk assessments was inconsistent\"</p><p>and that there was frequently wide variability in local authorities' funding. Those differences are simply not acceptable. I do not for a moment doubt the minister's good intentions, but we must do more to address the fundamental failings in the system, many of which relate to the unlevel playing field that exists across the country. Findings too often reveal that vulnerable children and families are not receiving the care and support that they need, and that vulnerable children and families have been left to take on an enormous burden of responsibility without adequate back-up.</p><p>I turn to why I am calling for an independent inquiry. I am not doing so because any of the work that has been done previously has been harmful in any way; in many cases, that work has been exceptionally good. I am well aware of all the work that was done under the previous Executive and that has been done recently in the Parliament, and I pay tribute to those who are engaged in that work. However, as is the case with many other aspects of public services in this country, the challenges that we face from the demographics involved, which are highlighted in Labour's amendment, are significant and immense. I am talking about the number of elderly people who are expected to live much longer in the years ahead and the number of children who are expected to go through the system.</p><p>On the changing culture of social work care and how local authorities operate, I am very much a supporter of the principle of getting it right for every child, which is outstanding and has in itself brought about a different culture&#8212;we look at the services in a much more integrated and holistic way. However, I am asking for an independent inquiry because I do not think that we can address all the needs of social services with the existing resources. The culture of how we approach matters has changed much recently, and it will continue to change. It is a bit like the higher education question. We cannot expect demand to continue to increase, given the level of resources that we will have. Labour and the minister have <place-holder colnum=\"25912\"/> highlighted the fact that resources will be very tight for some time to come.</p><p>We must also accept that more than half of those who are in touch with social work services are not in employment, education or training; indeed, we must be clear that that figure is approaching 100 per cent in some council areas. That is why it is vital that our most vulnerable children can access proper educational support and have more input to their futures beyond school as a matter of course rather than as a matter of chance, depending on the local services in their particular area. I appreciate that all parties have worked immensely hard to improve the process, and I am sure that we will hear from the minister about that in the near future, but we need to do more to harness the support that is required right across the system.</p><p>We must also engage in a much more structured conversation with the excellent voluntary sector groups that do so much to try to improve the lives of vulnerable families. The whole philosophy of GIRFEC, and its related principle of ensuring that there is a more holistic approach to care, is absolutely right, but it is also challenging and has implications for our care services.</p><p>All public services, and especially social services, can benefit so much from good-quality partnerships with the voluntary sector. Volunteers and voluntary organisations play a vital role in ensuring that we all live in a strong and cohesive society. They do an excellent job and we believe that there should be much more joined-up working between social services and the voluntary sector so that they can take advantage of each other's strengths.</p><p>I finish by stressing the need for commitment in United Kingdom policies to make Britain a more family-friendly nation. On this side of the chamber, we believe firmly that there is a need to support families in the tax and benefits system, to extend flexible working and to improve the structure of parental leave when families are most in need of help. We must not underestimate the enormous role that is played by kinship carers and foster parents, which was flagged up prominently in the reports. Their input is crucial, and we must be conscious of the support that they need when fulfilling a role that would otherwise be fulfilled by social services staff. The Scottish Government has worked hard in that respect, but there is still more to be done, just as there is more to be done with drugs and alcohol policies. There is much to be gained from cross-party support as we go forward.</p><p>I am only too conscious of the challenges that lie ahead and of the urgent need to support our most vulnerable families and all those who care for them. Some of the challenges are enormous, <place-holder colnum=\"25913\"/> which is why I repeat my party's call for an independent review of all social work services.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-6223.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"also notes that the Social Work Inspection Agency concluded that there were wide variations in the level of social care service provided by local authorities throughout Scotland and therefore calls for an independent review of social work services to identify the local authorities that need more help, and, furthermore, calls for the Scottish Government to facilitate greater use of the expertise of the voluntary sector and for greater focus from the Scottish Government on tackling the misuse of drugs and alcohol, which the Social Work Inspection Agency has identified as leading to an increase in the number of children needing to be looked after.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Services Workforce"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I warmly welcome this afternoon's debate.

I warmly welcome the representatives of the Combined Cadet Force in the gallery and thank the cadets who turned up this morning to meet MSPs. In particular, I congratulate the cadets from Loretto school whose CCF celebrates its centenary this year.</p><p>The Army Cadet Force is one of the United Kingdom's oldest, largest and most successful youth organisations, and Scotland has played a unique role in its history. Kirkcaldy&#8212;for which I have special affection, as the birthplace of my father&#8212;was home to the first detachment in Scotland. From that early foundation, the cadet movement has gone from strength to strength, and is now able to boast more than 47,000 cadets, who are part of the 1,700 local detachments throughout the UK.</p><p>As all members who will participate in the debate are well aware, those detachments help young people between the ages of 12 and 18 to develop personally and physically by providing them with a wide range of challenging and exciting opportunities and activities, and training them in the skills that they need for later life. The Combined Cadet Force is renowned for its ability to instil a sense of discipline, leadership and community spirit in our young people. That can only be a good thing, particularly when it can help to turn around the lives of some of our more troubled young people as well as inspire thousands more to achieve their ambitions, including, in many cases, to join the forces. <place-holder colnum=\"24929\"/></p><p>Perhaps one of the greatest assets of the cadet movement is its ability to provide a positive framework for young people of all ages and backgrounds so that it provides them with confidence and self-esteem, strong social bonds and lasting friendships.</p><p>Many recent debates in the Parliament have made us focus on the need to improve young people's skills. Colleges, universities and employers often tell us that we need to do much more in that respect. That is precisely why we should celebrate the success of the cadets and all those who work for them. Whether they learn map and compass skills for the Duke of Edinburgh award, perform in a military band or help with voluntary work in the community, the skills that they learn are hugely important, and they can use them for the rest of their lives. It is a testament to the cadet force's success that it has become one of the largest music educators of young people in Scotland. Some 800 young people in the cadet force are taught piping and drumming each year; one in every 14 cadets learns to play the pipes or drums.</p><p>We should recognise the significant contribution that the cadet force makes in our communities. Community projects enrich local knowledge, encourage good citizenship and provide support for many community events and groups. It is encouraging to see the work that is being done in schools, where the emphasis is on citizen service for all 16-year-olds, which gives young people opportunities to play a leading role in their communities.</p><p>In what will inevitably be a difficult financial period in the coming years, it is vital that we do not lose such opportunities. Jim Hume lodged a motion last week in which he rightly asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament notes with concern the plans to close the Combined Cadet Force ... at Knox Academy in Haddington, the only CCF remaining in a state secondary school in Scotland\".</p><p>I hope that all stakeholders, including East Lothian Council and the Ministry of Defence, will enter into constructive discussions to ensure that that cadet force remains at the school.</p><p>The cadet force's greatest strength is its many volunteers and instructors, who provide experience and specialist skills to develop cadets' talents. Without the support of such people, which is given selflessly and with unrelenting enthusiasm, we would have great difficulty in supporting our young people. That is why it is a matter of considerable concern that the current economic climate is forcing the United Kingdom Government to make savings of &#163;4 million in the Army Cadet Force training budget, which will inevitably have a detrimental effect on the staffing of cadet courses. There are encouraging signs <place-holder colnum=\"24930\"/> among all parties in the Parliament that we acknowledge the need to do more to encourage and support volunteers throughout Scotland, but we need to turn our words into action.</p><p>A 150th anniversary is an important milestone in any organisation's history. In the case of the Army Cadet Force, it brings a timely reminder of the strength of our young people when they are motivated to succeed. I hope that the many events throughout the UK, including the aptly named cadetfest in Glasgow in April, the cadet forces piping event in Inverness in the first week of April and the parade at Buckingham palace on 6 July, as well as the hugely important parade at Edinburgh castle on 12 June, will be widely supported by all members and will provide a showcase for the cadet movement in every part of the UK.</p><p>I wish all cadets a successful year of celebrations to mark their 150th anniversary. I wish them well in the future. I hope that we can do our bit to ensure that during the next 150 years the Army Cadet Force will be as successful as it has been in the past.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20720641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Armed Forces Cadet Movement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have secured this debate to mark the 150th anniversary of the Army Cadet Force.

Since 1999, successive Scottish Governments have doubled spending on our schools, yet overall standards of attainment have been flatlining and, sadly, actually declining in some cases. Each year, 13,000 pupils leave school unable to read or write properly. Only 30 per cent of pupils in secondary 2 reach the required standard in mathematics, despite the figure being 85 per cent in primary 3. Scottish pupils are now ranked below the global average in mathematics and science and, only two weeks ago, the Scottish Government's latest statistics revealed that two thirds of S2 pupils struggle with literacy. That situation is just not acceptable. It is not acceptable to parents, pupils and teachers, all of whom know that we should be doing very much better, or to the Scottish Conservative party, which is why we believe that it is time for radical change.</p><p>I put on record the fact that many communities throughout Scotland are fortunate to have an excellent state school on their doorstep, but far too many are not. In too many areas, particularly in some of our most disadvantaged communities, schools underperform because the present system provides them with too little incentive to improve. However hard our teachers work, their efforts are often compromised by a system that is unresponsive to the needs of individual schools and pupils. That seems particularly ironic at a time when the principles and modern methodology of the curriculum for excellence are driving at greater diversity in the curriculum and, I hope, more fulfilling options for more pupils in Scottish Qualifications Authority examinations.<place-holder colnum=\"24450\"/></p><p>All communities in Scotland should have access to a good state school. Social and economic background should be no barrier, and nor should an arbitrary catchment area or parental income levels. However, nothing will change if there continues to be an obsession with a one-size-fits-all policy for our local authorities and the long-standing&#8212;and, I must say, socialist&#8212;love affair with comprehensive education. That approach persistently confuses the principle of equality of opportunity with that of uniformity and has created false tensions between the pursuit of social justice and the pursuit of excellence. As a result, politicians have become the controlling factor in our schools, when it should be headteachers and parents.</p><p>Earlier this week, we set out why we believe that the evidence clearly shows that too many school children in Scotland do not get the education that they deserve. We also set out our plans to raise standards, which fall under three headings: breaking up the current monopoly that the state has over the provision of education; giving teachers and headteachers more control; and giving parents more choice over which type of school they want to deliver their child's education. In short, we argue that we need to take power away from the politicians and start trusting the professionals on the front line.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20683045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Management)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Education in Scotland was once rightly renowned for its outstanding quality.

In 1991, Professor Howie said that there was a great need to diversify in comprehensive education, certainly beyond S4. We are attracted to that model.</p><p>We are talking about the provision of new free schools that can compete with existing local authority schools. Those schools would remain state funded and would not be allowed to charge fees or become selective. Most important, they would remain subject to the same rigorous inspection processes of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education and the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care that exist at present for all schools. The schools could be run by educational charities, not-for-profit trusts or other philanthropic bodies.</p><p>There would be scope for local authorities to transfer a school, or perhaps a cluster of schools, to an educational trust. Interestingly, that is along the lines of a suggestion by a Scottish National Party councillor in East Lothian Council, who has said that the principle behind the proposal is the need to drive up standards, as well as the need to help local authorities make the best possible use of scarce resources at a time when local authority finance is stretched. Although we do not yet know the full details of Councillor Berry's proposal, we applaud that innovative thinking, unlike the Labour Party, which seems to have dismissed it out of hand.</p><p>Recently, there has been an increase in the number of parents who want to exercise their legal right to choose their child's school. There has been a spectacular failure to deliver the Scottish Government's class size policy in its original format of 18 or fewer pupils in primaries 1 to 3, precisely because of the obsession with a one-size-fits-all agenda. Now, whether it is a face-saving mission or what the cabinet secretary described at yesterday's Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee as a \"helpful\" measure, we have a more relaxed target of 20 per cent of pupils being in such classes. However, concerns are still being expressed about councils' ability to deliver the policy, precisely because it does not suit diverse needs in various parts of Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"24452\"/></p><p>I have no problem with smaller class sizes, but I have a problem with an overbureaucratic model that has not only created much heartache in our councils, but caused a growing number of parents to feel the need to go to court to exercise fully their right to choose different types of school. They should not be put in that situation. Some people tell me that state schools throughout Scotland already have different characteristics&#8212;I agree, and they always have done. However, where is the logic in preventing parents from taking advantage of that diversity? If more parents want the right to choose from different types of school, they should have it, and they should be able to take their child out of a poorly performing school and transfer him or her to another school where standards are better. No longer should they be dictated to by a one-size-fits-all arbitrary postcode that is unreflective of real demand.</p><p>Before Christmas, I wrote to the convener of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee to suggest that the committee's 2010 work programme should include an examination of the school structure in Scotland and how we can address the current failings. I am grateful to Karen Whitefield for pursuing that request and to my colleagues on the committee who, on 3 February, agreed unanimously that we should examine the issue in detail.</p><p>I hear on the grapevine that it is proving difficult to get a ticket for a flight to Sweden this weekend. I have discovered that not only are the cabinet secretary and some of his officials winging their way across to Scandinavia, but so too are Tavish Scott and some of his officials, such is the sudden desire of senior political figures to see for themselves what the Tories have known for many months, and even for many years. David McLetchie, well ahead of his time as usual, made exactly the same visit back in 2005 and, last September, we invited one of the most respected Swedish experts on education, Thomas Idergard, to Edinburgh. So I must ask Labour Party members, if even the yellow bus is making its way out to the airport, will they jump on it, too, or will they just stay at home and miss the bus?</p><p>I am genuinely pleased that the cabinet secretary has agreed to debate the issue and I look forward to his response and to seeing whether he really is out to grasp the thistle, which involves asking whether Alex Salmond and his fellow Scottish Cabinet colleagues will break their deafening silence, stand up and be counted.</p><p>The Scottish Tories are determined to take a lead in the debate, even if that means upsetting some apple-carts that are dragged along by conventional thinking. The polls in Scotland show consistently that the public feel that there has been a failure to deliver better quality in public <place-holder colnum=\"24453\"/> services and that the Scottish Government needs to respond more effectively to the diverse needs of different groups of people. Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Alberta in Canada have got that right, which is why we believe that lessons can be learned from countries in which parents have the freedom to choose between different providers in the state sector instead of being told what they must do. In those countries, the aim is to provide a good education for everyone and not just some, and to raise attainment levels&#8212;to drive up standards instead of being content with the lowest common denominator.</p><p>I know that some siren voices say that our proposal is all wrong. Yesterday, we were accused of having rationing as our main aim, which was rather an extreme view. I fully acknowledge that it took eight years to convince a once-sceptical public in Sweden that the new freedoms in the state sector would work, but they did. Now, almost no one, including those who are on the left of the political spectrum&#8212;they are socialists, Mr Macintosh&#8212;wants to return to the old system, such is the conviction that the new system is much better at raising overall standards.</p><p>That is true not only of the new schools but of the existing state schools in Sweden. Many teachers there liked the new system because it gave them much more flexibility and scope to concentrate on raising standards in the classroom rather than filling in far too much unnecessary paperwork. Incidentally, that is the same flexibility as we seek in the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>I will dwell on that point a little longer. If the curriculum for excellence has a central message, it is about catering for the individual pupil's needs. That principle is supported throughout the Parliament. In turn, that should mean that we are serious about opening new avenues for pupils who neither wish nor are able to pursue a purely academic curriculum. We should develop formal vocational courses for middle-year secondary pupils and ensure that they have every opportunity to learn an apprentice trade, just as in several other European countries. If that means that specialist schools come into being, just as in Denmark and the Netherlands, so be it.</p><p>Following the introduction of new providers in Sweden, 10 per cent of pupils attend free schools&#8212;the figure is nearly 20 per cent in the upper secondary. As for the merit value of schools there, five years after the introduction of free schools, the average attainment level was 206 points, and 226 points in free schools. However, just as important is the fact that standards rose not just in free schools but in existing schools. I stress firmly that the average of 206 points was an increase on the figure before 1991, when free schools were introduced. The Swedish National <place-holder colnum=\"24454\"/> Agency for Education highlighted that, reporting that standards improved across the board because existing schools needed to compete with the new free schools if they were not to lose pupils.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives believe that that model can work well in Scotland because it strikes the right balance between supporting the many good schools throughout Scotland where parents are very satisfied with the education that their children receive and improving schools that consistently underperform and with which parents are dissatisfied.</p><p>How much more evidence is required and how many more children need to be let down before the SNP, Labour and the Liberals realise that Scottish education needs to be brought up to date so that we can keep pace with other developed countries? Doing nothing is not an option. The evidence that radical change is required is compelling, as is the demand from parents and teachers that we need to deliver higher standards across the board. We must ensure that reform extends parental choice, devolves more power to headteachers and provides far more freedom in the state sector. If we do not, the educational futures of too many young people will be at stake. I ask members to support the motion in my name.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees with the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning that \"choice and diversity are the hallmarks of a mature and confident society\" in the provision of state-funded education and that it is now time to explore alternative models for delivery of school education with a view to empowering head teachers, raising standards and increasing parental choice; welcomes the community trust model for schools put forward by East Lothian Council as worthy of further examination and believes that this and other models to be found elsewhere in Europe should be the subject of detailed consideration and debate, and calls on the Scottish Government to publish an options paper on models of school organisation to facilitate this.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20683045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Management)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Macintosh should go back and consider his socialist credentials.

If there was a single reason why Scottish education made such a huge impact around the world in the days when it first established its reputation, it was Scotland's concern for the international community and the role that Scotland played in the economic, social and political development of many nations around the world.</p><p>The Scottish enlightenment in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, whose benefits were felt many thousands of miles from these shores, was remarkable for its great outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments, which rivalled those of any other nation at the time. They were even more remarkable because they took place in a country that was considered to be one of the so-called more backward nations in western Europe. Scotland was remarkably forward in recognising the values that underpin a good education. The achievements in philosophy, economics, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture and chemistry were extraordinary, and the contributions of Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period, such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Robert Burns, Adam Ferguson and James Hutton, were outstanding.</p><p>The belief that a good education should be available to everyone was also extraordinary. There is no doubt that, if pupils are to become well-educated, rounded human beings, they must have a full awareness and understanding of the global community, and tolerance and respect for the many and varied cultures around the world. Today's pupils have at their disposal a huge array <place-holder colnum=\"24315\"/> of means of communication and a wide number of opportunities to visit other countries and to host visitors from other countries, which cannot do anything other than benefit their education. It is good to see that the recent HMIE report provided many examples of good practice in that respect.</p><p>I would like to pursue the theme of parental and teacher priorities at a time when there is much else of pressing need to debate in the chamber. Indeed, it is only by pursuing those priorities that we can best deliver the desired objectives in international education. That requires some of the most sophisticated skills to understand other cultures, build better relations with communities that are far removed from our own, and cross the boundaries of religious and racial divisions. That is not easy, and it is particularly difficult if too many of our young people lack good-quality skills in the basics. To pick up on the point that Margo MacDonald made, how can we expect youngsters who struggle to read and write properly to be furnished with the ability to learn a second or third language or the depth of understanding that is required to appreciate the historical and economic differences of other societies? That point is well made in the Liberal amendment.

We have heard from all parties this morning that we have evidence of situations, in more or less every constituency in Scotland, in which residents have encountered difficulties with factors. There can be no doubt that in many cases, although by no means in all cases, those residents are from older and perhaps more vulnerable groups, as both Sarah Boyack and Ken Macintosh said. Therefore, the issues deserve full parliamentary scrutiny.</p><p>Before I sum up our party's overall position on the matter, I have to say that we recognise that many factors do an excellent job and provide first-class facilities across the board. Of course, that in turn means that we have to be mindful that we support those factors and do not design new legislation that would be overbureaucratic or which would restrict either them or&#8212;as important&#8212;the consumer's choice.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon and David McLetchie have already made clear this morning, we want three specific concerns to be addressed: first, how we strike the right balance between accreditation, regulation and quality assurance; secondly, as Margaret Curran highlighted, the absence of effective complaints procedures against factors who default; and thirdly, the need for greater transparency in obtaining relevant financial information about the managing company's accounts.</p><p>Let me summarise our position on each. We fully appreciate the calls for better quality assurance and a level playing field across Scotland. Currently, as Malcolm Chisholm hinted, there is often a big contrast between conditions in older title deeds that make almost no provision for common decision making, and newer title deeds in which such provisions are much more extensive and comprehensive.</p><p>Although we understand the calls for mandatory regulation, which were made particularly strongly by Patricia Ferguson and Pauline McNeill, we need to keep an open mind about what that would mean, and we need to begin by listening to the arguments about whether the approach should <place-holder colnum=\"24261\"/> include compulsory registration or whether the problems would be better solved by a system of voluntary accreditation. I have listened to and understand the reasons behind the strong calls for the need for more than a voluntary system, but we want to explore the arguments a little more. In that respect, I echo the request that was made by Robert Brown and David McLetchie to the minister to tell us his current position with regard to seeking additional information. After all, there are arguments on both sides, but the key principle must be to ensure that consumers have effective choice, that they will not be restricted from switching and that changes will not involve unnecessary and expensive red tape.</p><p>On the second point, we are absolutely clear that there must be an effective complaints procedure that leaves no scope for the difficult factor to manipulate a situation or to discriminate against the consumer. There must be clarity about the respective roles, responsibilities and legal rights of the managing company and the owners and residents body.</p><p>We believe that there must be much greater financial transparency to ensure that owners and residents can see clearly what their money is being spent on, and the value for money that they are getting every time they are asked to pay a bill. On that point, we also seek clarification about trading standards and whether any related issues involve purely reserved legislation and might therefore bring into question the Scottish Parliament's competence. We note in particular the Scottish Consumer Council's concern in its submission to the Office of Fair Trading that, in too many cases, consumers find it very difficult to exercise collective choice and switch. That can act as a considerable constraint on suppliers and prevent consumers from getting best value for money.</p><p>The relationship between the property manager and the owners in a shared property is defined by complex legislation, property deeds and agreements, so many consumers do not understand their rights and obligations. Likewise, consumers often fail to understand the processes that are involved in switching; in any case, there is no effective mechanism for pursuing complaints, which allows dishonest factors to play the system even more. We also note the calls to set down the minimum requirements for best practice so that complaints can be investigated against clear standards.</p><p>In short, we will support measures that increase consumer choice, that provide a level playing field of quality assurance, and which weed out the bad factor. We will oppose measures that might tip the balance in favour of too much bureaucracy rather than self-regulation, and which might raise barriers <place-holder colnum=\"24262\"/> that stifle competition and eliminate diversity of provision.

In the world of politics, it is not always easy to find issues that bring politicians together rather than divide us, but the Perth 800 bid is surely one of them. There is <place-holder colnum=\"24122\"/> every sign that the campaign has already done much to unite not only members, but the people of Perth, its many close communities and many businesses and institutions, which make up the fabric of Perth and Kinross.</p><p>Members will not be surprised to hear that I believe that Perthshire is one of the best places in which to live in Scotland&#8212;although perhaps it is not today, with the power cuts and heavy snow. However, generally speaking, it is a fantastic place to live. Perth 800 presents an opportunity not only to celebrate the 800<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the granting of the royal burgh charter to Perth by King William the Lion of Scotland in 1210, but to celebrate and promote the long and distinguished traditions that the city can boast in local heritage, sport, arts and culture.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned several of the 100 or so exciting events that will be held throughout Perth and Kinross during 2010, that will have something for young and old alike. Events such as the Johnnie Walker golf championship at Gleneagles will add the usual international glamour and, we hope, a much-needed boost to tourism and local business, but I particularly congratulate the Perth 800 team on its work to provide an extensive grass-roots sports programme, including the Perthshire festival of rugby, the Scottish orienteering championships and the Perth mini Olympics. For those who prefer a slightly more sedate sport, there is also the international grandmaster simultaneous display, a name which brings up interesting imagery. As a sports enthusiast and someone who has a strong interest in encouraging young people to become involved in sport, I think that these events have a particular importance, and I am sure that they will do much to inspire wider participation in sport and enjoyment of the great outdoors.</p><p>One of the most encouraging aspects of the planning stages of Perth 800 has been the enthusiasm of the many local businesses&#8212;from the one-man businesses in Perth High Street to the large companies such as Scottish and Southern Energy&#8212;that play their parts in stimulating the local economy. Through them, we have been able to ensure that Perth 800 can engage with every part of the community, whether in Perth city itself or its immediate hinterland. That has helped to encourage a sense of civic pride as well as enhancing the national and international profile of Perth and Kinross.</p><p>As Murdo Fraser said, Perth 800 also presents an opportunity to progress Perth's bid to gain official city status. I believe that that city status presents an opportunity to bring major benefits by increasing the potential to market the area as one that contains the premier city in Scotland for business, education, art, culture and sport, as well <place-holder colnum=\"24123\"/> as putting Perth on the map as Scotland's seventh city.</p><p>I hope that Perth 800 will prove to be a great success&#8212;the positive signs are already pointing to that. That is welcome in what are difficult economic times in which to plan such a wide-ranging programme of events. As we look forward to the legacy of Perth 800, I hope that we will also be able to rejoice in what will be a successful bid to regain official city status for Perth, which will restore Perth to her rightful place at the heart of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649099", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Perth 800"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate my colleague Murdo Fraser on securing the debate, and I congratulate all those who have worked so hard under the guidance of Provost John Hulbert, Brigadier Mel Jameson and Ken MacDonald, who are with us in the public gallery, to ensure that the Perth 800 bid has been so professionally presented.

A good education is about acquiring the basic skills in literacy and numeracy at an early age, acquiring a good understanding of the world around one and the ability to gain qualifications. However, it is about far more than just passing exams&#8212;it is about the qualities that give people good judgment, self-confidence, self-esteem and a sense of responsibility as a citizen in a community. For me, the curriculum for excellence must be about striking an effective balance between improving the academic rigour of our qualifications and making learning more relevant and meaningful to each child, so that they are better prepared with the skills that they require for life after school.</p><p>So far, so good. However, as other members have said, there is no doubt that serious questions remain about the implementation of the curriculum for excellence. That is why we have sympathy with the content of the Liberal motion and the timescale that it proposes. If, as I am sure the cabinet secretary has done, we listen to classroom teachers, headteachers, the teaching unions and various educational commentators, representatives of whom have appeared before the committee, we find that there is deep concern&#8212;even, dare I say, despair in some quarters&#8212;that teachers, especially those in secondary schools, do not feel that they have been fully engaged in the process of developing the curriculum for excellence, that too many of the <place-holder colnum=\"23971\"/> guidelines are woolly and vague and that insufficient time has been allocated to improving teachers' CPD training in this area.</p><p>There is enough concern to suggest that it might be preferable to introduce a short delay in implementation. Six years down the line on the curriculum for excellence, the Scottish Government should be able to make a timing decision. One teacher summed up the situation well in a comment to the <em>Times Educational Supplement</em> that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"this is the biggest and most exciting curriculum change in schools for a generation but the one for which teachers are least prepared.\"</p><p>In other words, they were positive about the principles that underpin the curriculum for excellence but warned that time is crucial if the change is to work to best advantage.</p><p>Of course, matters were made much worse by the fact that, at the same time as introducing this major reform, the Scottish Government piled substantial other pressures on our local authority education departments&#8212;expensive and, dare I say, wrong-headed priorities such as insisting on class sizes of 18 or fewer in primary 1 to 3 and universal free school meals. Those policies meant that in some cases, resources were diverted away from the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>In my final minute, I turn to the question of raising standards throughout Scottish schools. Rightly, the cabinet secretary identified that as the main ambition of the curriculum for excellence, but it will happen only if there is a determined effort to provide more formal vocational options for pupils in the early years of secondary school and to restore more academic rigour to the SQA examination system&#8212;academic rigour that recognises the importance of what the cabinet secretary described to the committee as the \"deepening experience\" of the curriculum for excellence, involves pursuing greater knowledge and understanding of relevant subject content and enables those pupils who wish to pursue academic courses to develop sophisticated interpretive and analytical skills that are so eagerly sought by employers in this country. I take nothing away from the excellent teaching and hard work that our teachers and pupils undertake, but I worry greatly that the constant \"improvement\" in exam passes increasingly reflects the ability to recall key bullet points of a limited range of knowledge rather than the ability to develop more sophisticated argument and analytical thinking.</p><p>On the same point, the cabinet secretary is aware of my concerns about the accessibility of the advanced higher, which I consider to be one of the best aspects of Scottish education. That will not remain the case if too few pupils are able to <place-holder colnum=\"23972\"/> access the course that they need and we cannot stretch our brightest pupils to the full.</p><p>We have a huge opportunity to get this right, but we need to be much more far-sighted about promoting excellence in its widest sense. If that means a slight delay in the implementation of the curriculum for excellence, so be it. However, we must also ensure that the proposed reforms of the SQA reflect our ambitions.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5809.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further seeks an assurance from the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning that the reform of the exam system accompanying the Curriculum for Excellence will provide sufficient academic rigour and skills-based testing so as to ensure the highest possible standards of attainment in Scottish schools.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20648695", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the fact that the Liberals have brought this debate to Parliament, as it affords us the opportunity to reaffirm our strong commitment to the principles of the curriculum for excellence.

It is good to hear that the Scottish Government has provided more assurances on the skills strategy than it did when the original version was overwhelmingly rejected by the Parliament for the simple reason that it did not provide a coherent policy across all sectors.</p><p>I listened carefully to the minister's opening remarks and I hope that I can press him to deal with a bit more of the detail, which relates, as far as we are concerned, to two fundamental issues. I hope that we can elicit an assurance in the minister's summing up that the Government will address those issues as a matter of urgency.</p><p>Two weeks ago, we had a very good debate on literacy. It would not be appropriate to go over all aspects of that debate again, much as I would like to, but I reiterate our strong belief that literacy and numeracy are the blocks upon which all else must be built. The sizeable amount of money that Scottish businesses have to spend in their training budgets on remedial work rather than on new skills is evidence of how serious the problem is. The Parliament is well aware of our views about the need for more rigorous testing in primary schools, which have been reinforced in the past 24 hours by concerns among primary teachers. I am sure that the Scottish Government has the best interests of our pupils at heart when it comes to the curriculum for excellence, but we simply cannot proceed much further until we have demonstrated unequivocally&#8212;on a basis that is both understood and accepted by employers&#8212;that standards of literacy and numeracy are improving. If we can get the balance right between greater rigour in the school exam system and the need to create imaginative and responsible citizens, which is the vision of the curriculum for excellence, we <place-holder colnum=\"23286\"/> will have a far better chance of fulfilling a successful skills strategy.</p><p>However, far more than that is required. If the main appeal of the curriculum for excellence is its desire to tailor the educational experience more towards the needs of individual pupils, by definition we must allow much greater flexibility within the education system. For me, that means challenging the status quo of the comprehensive system beyond the middle years of secondary school&#8212;perhaps even beyond secondary 2&#8212;since it is clearly not working for many pupils in the last two or three years of their schooling. Professor Howie tried that in 1992 and was shot down for his unorthodox views. He has been proved right, big time, and I have no doubt that we need to make that change now.</p><p>Will the cabinet secretary agree at least to examine the case for allowing pupils to engage in formal vocational training while they are still at school&#8212;that already happens in several other European countries&#8212;and for allowing pupils to leave school at an earlier age if they and their teachers agree that the pursuit of a purely academic curriculum is neither appropriate nor relevant to their best interests? One of the worst things that we can do is to force youngsters to stay on at school in academic classes in which they have little focus and on which, frankly, they waste valuable time when they could be learning a trade or a craft&#8212;that should never be seen as somehow inferior to an academic education. It is time to acknowledge fully that far more youngsters would be able to get much more meaningful focus if they could harness their talents outside the academic classroom. Such an approach works tremendously well in many European countries and it would go a long way towards solving the problem of some disengaged youngsters in our society.</p><p>Another extremely important aspect of the debate, which forms the second part of our amendment, is the need to ensure that skills training is based far more on the needs of employers than on what can be provided through different training institutions. My colleague Gavin Brown will outline the main details of our thinking on that matter, which has been reinforced by much of the powerful evidence that was submitted to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee.</p><p>It is essential that the Scottish Government accepts that it needs to rethink its policy as quickly as possible. I say that not only because of what the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee was told by experts in the field, but because of the results of good practice elsewhere. Just before Christmas, my colleague Murdo Fraser and I spent a day in York hearing about the progress that had been made by the skills academies in England for exactly the same reason: they had ensured that <place-holder colnum=\"23287\"/> skills training was demand led. Each academy has a different business model, and they are drawn up according to employers' needs in the different industrial sectors. Each academy also has an employer-led board, and approval of training providers is based on how well they can deliver the training needs of local employers. The structure was very impressive in terms of the quality of training that was provided and the number of students who went on to full-time jobs in a range of industries, and given the fact that skills academies are financially self-sustaining within four years.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives firmly believe that we need to develop a more consistent and coherent strategy on demand-led skills training. We ask the Government to pay considerable attention to that area.</p><p>Let me just summarise our position. First, if the overriding objective is to provide a workforce that is fit for the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and which allows Scotland to develop her full economic potential such that she can compete successfully in the international community, we must not ignore the concerns that are raised by about one third of employers who say that their school leavers are poorly prepared for work. Secondly, we need to champion vocational training and provide the flexibility that will allow all pupils&#8212;not just some&#8212;to pursue their aspirations. The Scottish colleges have made huge progress on that, but much more needs to be done to help our youngsters to become career focused and to take an active part in planning their educational futures without the fear of any stigma being attached to them. Thirdly, we must ensure that we have a coherent national framework that involves all levels of training, with neither too much nor too little focus on any one part of the education sector. The national strategy must meet the demands of everyone, especially the employers who, at the end of the day, are the means by which the Scottish working population can find jobs and develop their skills.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5619.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; believes that pupils in secondary schools who wish to do so should have the opportunity to pursue formal vocational training, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the system is more demand-led and that publicly funded training matches far more closely the needs of employers.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20534753", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There can be no doubt about the importance of a skills strategy to the development of a more successful economy and more meaningful and fulfilling opportunities in the education system.

Cathy <place-holder colnum=\"23231\"/> Jamieson may be surprised to know that I, too, was once in <em>The Himalayan Times</em>, although I am afraid that I was confined to the back pages.</p><p>As Pauline McNeill said at the beginning of the debate, we do not always like what newspapers say about us, but they are crucial to our lives and to the lives of everyone in this country. I will dwell on that point in summing up for the Conservative party, because I believe that the core argument is very much about the democratic process and allowing communities to find both a strong voice and a reliable and regular source of information and news. As many members, including Robert Brown, Robin Harper, Hugh Henry and David Whitton, have eloquently said, this is not an easy age, when the communication process is so sophisticated and highly competitive, but we must address that situation.</p><p>When the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee took extensive evidence on two occasions, various witnesses made a very powerful and cogent case for concentrating much of the debate on sources of revenue and the fact that there have been significant falls in advertising for jobs, retail, property and motor cars. For a large newspaper that can mean a reduction in revenue of up to &#163;11 million or &#163;12 million, and for a smaller local paper it can mean a reduction of anything up to &#163;1 million, so it is not rocket science to work out the resulting effect on journalism and jobs in the industry. It is an encouraging aspect of the undergraduate job market that many students aspire to a career in journalism, but that will not be the case if there are far fewer jobs for them to go to because of the collapse of the local newspaper industry, which is often the essential training ground for young novice journalists.</p><p>The current squeeze on newspapers' revenue has resulted in staff cuts and reduced resources across the industry, but much of the brunt has been borne by local newspapers, which means that it is often very difficult for them to retain their photographers or part-time contributors and, in many cases, to maintain their premises. I would like to think that that trend can be reversed when the economy finally picks up, but it will not be easy to breathe new life into the industry, especially when there are further worries about the effect of competition from community newspapers and a growing number of local authority publications, which overlap on certain aspects of news and information.</p><p>Journalists are, in many cases, having to become experts at a multimedia role, with the inevitable pressure that that brings in respect of training costs and the time that they have to devote to acquiring new skills rather than being out developing stories. As Robin Harper said, the <place-holder colnum=\"23232\"/> knock-on effect is that fewer journalists feel that they have time to develop an in-depth knowledge of their local area and to attend local events or court hearings. They therefore have less time for investigative journalism. It would be a huge pity if, as a result of local newspapers losing some of their local identity, there were an even greater collapse in their circulation. That is why the revenue return from advertising is so crucial to the sustainability of the industry, especially for the smaller newspapers, for which, frankly, it can be a matter of being in print or not.</p><p>The debate is also about the process of how we receive information and news. As many members have said, it is important to remember that people in different age groups and from different backgrounds will have different preferences. Labour's motion makes the important point that 40 per cent of people do not have access to the internet, and therefore removing the legal requirement for local newspapers to print PINs will cause huge difficulty for many people and be a way of disenfranchising them. That point was fully debated at UK level, including at the Scottish Affairs Committee, and it was decided that there should not be a policy of publishing such notices solely online. Having to make a conscious effort to search the internet, and not always starting from a well-informed position, is not the same as being provided with a news sheet on which the general information pertaining to one subject is put in front of the reader&#8212;a point that has been made time and again by those who have provided evidence to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee.</p><p>Johnston Press made the strong remark that the Scottish Government could become</p><p class=\"indent\">\"more secretive\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"less open\"</p><p>to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"consultation or debate.\"</p><p>That is a strong criticism, but nonetheless we have to be mindful of it, because one of the unintended consequences could be that we become less democratic.

That is what it is all about.</p><p>Much has been made&#8212;and rightly so&#8212;of the success of Clackmannanshire Council and West Dunbartonshire Council in bucking the trend. They have done so because of the highly successful&#8212;and, yes, traditional and perhaps old-fashioned&#8212;means of combining phonics spelling with rigorous testing, such as the Schonell spelling test or the British ability scales reading test. I challenge anyone, including any Labour member, who disputes that testing works or persists in the assertion that illiteracy is necessarily a problem in areas of high deprivation such that testing should not take place against nationally agreed criteria. That is why most parties in the Parliament agreed to our previous motion. It is disappointing to hear that some have now changed their mind.</p><p>I do not accept that stand-alone papers in literacy and numeracy in secondary 4 are the answer, not just because of the reasons that Carole Ford of School Leaders Scotland outlined in a letter to <em>The Herald</em> last summer but for the simple reason that S4 is too late. I have no doubt whatsoever that, on the issue of testing, we require not to increase the number of tests but to improve their quality and to ensure that, first and foremost, they are set against nationally agreed criteria. That is why, exactly one year ago, we moved amendment S3M-3164.1, which called for more rigorous testing of reading, writing and arithmetic by the time that a pupil leaves primary 7 and which was supported by all other parties in the Parliament. That is also why I am moving an identical amendment today.</p><p>Unbelievably, some argue that we do not need tests at all&#8212;an argument that I find extraordinary given what the evidence shows and given the opinion of the vast majority, which is to say 72 per cent, of employers. However, I do not doubt that other things can also help. Where schools have initiated parents advice forums and workshops that help parents to work with the school on supportive work at home, they have proved immensely successful. The high turnout at many of those workshops shows just how many parents recognise the need to address literacy issues as a top priority. Internet sites, as the cabinet secretary said, can be designed to help parents who struggle to find time to visit school to see their child's teachers by providing them with the information in their own home. The literacy commission also made an important point about the scope within the General Teaching Council teacher training programme for improving the skills of teachers in delivering the basic skills to their <place-holder colnum=\"22726\"/> pupils. I note that media coverage has suggested that the training should include more about grammar.</p><p>I also suggest that some attention needs to be devoted to the skills that are required for the Scottish Qualifications Authority's examinations. Increasingly over the past 10 to 15 years, there has been a move in some subjects towards bullet-pointing of answers and more descriptive comment rather than expansive analytical answers, which allow pupils more scope to demonstrate their intellectual abilities. I suggest that that is one reason why employers so often complain about the poor linguistic skills of their employees. Anything that constrains the use of language is in itself a major obstacle to literacy.</p><p>Nothing is more important than literacy, not just in advancing opportunity but in promoting confidence, self-esteem and self-discipline. Far too many people are disengaged from society and the economy because they are illiterate. It is our duty to address that, so nothing is more important than ensuring that we return to tried and tested teaching methods and introduce far more rigorous testing of the three Rs in primary schools.</p><p>We will support the motion and the other amendments in addition to our own. I move amendment S3M-5512.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and, in particular, recognises the need to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly schooled and tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary seven and also to ensure that the qualifications structure better reflects the specific needs of all pupils, whether they wish to pursue courses that are more academically focused or more vocationally focused.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20497705", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Literacy Commission"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Regarding the primary set-up, I think that most teachers are anxious that there should be considerable improvement in the testing process to ensure that pupils are tested against identified nationally agreed criteria.

No one can deny that those issues <place-holder colnum=\"21897\"/> deserve a united approach from all the political parties.</p><p>GIRFEC is crucial because it promotes certain key principles: the development of a much more local approach to policy making that better reflects the needs of the local community; improved communication between the different agencies that are involved in caring for vulnerable children; much greater consistency in the team that looks after each child; a reduction in the bureaucracy&#8212;on which the minister has given us good evidence today&#8212;that accompanies the process; and an end to the wide regional variations in the quality of care that is offered.</p><p>Therefore, I am particularly pleased to welcome the report on the results of the Highland pathfinder GIRFEC project, especially the progress that has been made on measuring outcomes much more effectively, making improvements in professional practice with better multi-agency working, and developing a more holistic approach to the needs of the child&#8212;something that we all agree is one of the most important issues.</p><p>There are extremely encouraging signs that those better approaches have led to a reduction in the number of children on the child protection register and an improvement in the educational attainment of the weakest-performing children. Better-integrated planning has meant that a wider range of needs can be met, with a greater emphasis on engaging with young people and more help on handling the transition from care into adult life&#8212;a process that can often be fraught with many difficulties.</p><p>In turn, there are signs that parents and children feel much more integrated in the process, such that there is growing confidence in the system. As a result of the different agencies speaking a common language, people are more aware of when things are happening and what the processes are likely to involve. Perhaps the most encouraging signs are the likely reductions in cost if problems can be detected at the earliest possible point.</p><p>As Karen Whitefield said, although much can be learnt from the progress in Highland, more needs to be done elsewhere, especially in areas that are showing an increase in the number of registrations. We need to pay particular attention to the harrowing cases that are referred before the child is born, and we must not lose sight of the fact that the number of looked-after children has increased every year since 2001.</p><p>The GIRFEC evaluation report recognises that change will take time, but central to making that happen is ensuring that staff who are involved in the care of children are engaged in the process of change, even if that means a slight shift in the <place-holder colnum=\"21898\"/> culture of what is best practice in child care. Staff must be properly supported. I note that the workload of and burden of paperwork for health visitors and school nurses would be greatly reduced by the introduction of an electronic version of the paper record that was used in the Highland area. That is good news. Additionally, in a period when local authorities are financially stretched, the Scottish Conservatives maintain that far more must be done to utilise the work of the excellent voluntary sector, which is often staffed by people who are closest to the needs of our communities.</p><p>A key part of the process will be the reform of the children's hearings system. The Scottish Conservatives welcome the Government's decision to delay the progress of the children's hearing's bill due to apparent flaws in the initial consultation process. We hope that the information that is provided by the minister in the intervening period will help us to address the issues so that we can consider ways of strengthening the system without, as Karen Whitefield said, losing the central ethos that was set out in the Kilbrandon report.</p><p>Children's hearings have traditionally brought many benefits to our Scottish justice system, but it is clear that there are issues that relate to representation at hearings and the fact that panel members do not always feel fully supported by their local authority. Credibility within the system is not as strong as it should be, and much more needs to be done to enhance the public's knowledge and understanding of children's hearings and to ensure a more holistic approach by involving the various professional agencies effectively.</p><p>It is vital that we respond to the main messages from the recent HMIE report that looked at inspections across Scotland. It found that around a quarter of inspections revealed serious weaknesses in aspects of child protection that increased the risk of harm to children. It is not satisfactory that serious problems were identified in 10 council areas. That shows that much work remains to be done. Improvements are needed in the quality and rigour of assessments and in planning. As we all know, the consequences of such deficiencies can be life threatening. The Scottish Government has stated that it is working with the local authorities that have been criticised to ensure that urgent action is taken.

In particular, the historic concordat, which was so trumpeted by the First Minister as representing the beginnings of a new and more mature relationship between central and local government, has been blown apart, as Peter Peacock eloquently described.</p><p>Although my party is clear that the purpose of this morning's debate is to set out exactly where we think school education should be going, we have also taken the opportunity to send a strong <place-holder colnum=\"21842\"/> warning to the First Minister that he will do the greatest possible harm to our public services if he attempts to further weaken the trust within, and the accountability of, our local authorities.</p><p>The debate about Fiona Hyslop's failings as a cabinet secretary goes to the heart of what is wrong with the SNP Government, for the reasons that my colleague David McLetchie spelled out, but as Aileen Campbell said, the most important thing now is to identify the way forward. It is all very well slinging mud&#8212;perhaps it is good fun&#8212;but the bottom line is that teachers, pupils and parents need and deserve meaningful action to improve our schools. They need to know that this Parliament will deliver that improvement as quickly as possible and, in the view of the Scottish Conservatives, that action must not be a decision to retain in any way the status quo.</p><p>That is why one of our most important demands is for a firm commitment from the SNP that it will abide by the unanimous will of the Scottish Parliament, as expressed in a vote in January 2009, when it determined that it would undertake to ensure that there would be much more rigorous testing&#8212;not more testing, but more rigorous testing&#8212;of the three Rs by the time pupils reach the end of primary 7. That was an extremely important commitment for the Parliament to make, and it was based on the overwhelming wishes of parents and teachers, who see improving proficiency in those skills as being the key that will unlock the door to so much in the way of educational attainment. It is essential that that commitment be honoured by the new cabinet secretary.</p><p>Even before the SNP took office, there were occasional mutterings from education experts about the poor rate of progress in the educational attainment of too many of our pupils, and about the fact that Scotland was being overtaken in the international league tables. In recent months, those mutterings have, quite rightly, become clarion calls. In September this year, the Scottish Conservatives ran a special schools conference, to which we invited a range of the education experts by whom those clarion calls were made&#8212;who, before anyone accuses us of any bias, by no means had Conservative views&#8212;to discuss the way forward. They included someone from Sweden, who talked about a system to which we are greatly attracted&#8212;for Mr Rumbles's information, it does not use vouchers. It was abundantly clear that, in this country, there is a serious desire for reform.

To my knowledge, we have not had a debate on PE or modern languages; we have certainly not had the further debate on reading, writing and arithmetic in primary schools that the cabinet secretary once promised.</p><p>Scottish history's rich diversity and our deep-rooted links with many other parts of the world are good enough reasons to study the subject. In addition, everyone in Scotland should learn about Scottish history, because by doing so we become much better equipped to understand ourselves, where we came from and the complexities of our cultural, economic and social heritage. Learning about Scottish history also provides us with necessary insights into many other academic disciplines. Without a good understanding of Scottish history, our understanding of our nation is at best incomplete, and at worst insular and sectarian.</p><p>Tom Devine wrote that Scottish history is a subject</p><p class=\"indent\">\"of enormous dynamism and relevance\".</p><p>He was right. He also made the valid point that the erosion of Scottish history teaching began with the insistence by some that there could be a place for history in the curriculum only if it was shared with geography and modern studies. As a result, history became no longer part of the compulsory curriculum beyond the second year, and it is not without reason that groups such as the Scottish Association of Teachers of History express deep concern about the decline in the number of principal teachers of history. Throughout Scotland, history departments are feeling that they are being continually squeezed out of the curriculum, with the result that they are forever being asked to condense the subject down to tight, simplified modules that bear little resemblance to the Scottish history courses of the past. That is regrettable.</p><p>I am concerned about the replacement of knowledge with skills-based learning. People such as Professor Lindsay Paterson of the University of Edinburgh have referred to that. Modern approaches to teaching should be introduced, by all means&#8212;otherwise, we could never hope to move forward or even stand still&#8212;but it is wrong to suggest that that can happen only if some of the knowledge-based curriculum gives way.</p><p>Conventional wisdom has also been challenged by people who think that history can be taught only in the context of concepts such as war, migration, industrialisation and revolution.

That picks up on many points that have been made. The Scottish National Party might in many cases be well intentioned in that respect, but let us consider things such as \"Braveheart\" being paraded as a cultural icon of modern Scotland.

Quite apart from delivering the crucial element of education, it binds together families and people of different age groups and is usually <place-holder colnum=\"21436\"/> the focus for a wide variety of community activities. In a rural area, that focus is even more pronounced. As Alasdair Allan and Kenny Gibson said, it is the difference between having a community and having no community. As the bill has progressed through its various stages, the evidence to support that view has been compelling.</p><p>I thank all the groups that have provided members with excellent briefings. Those groups, particularly the Scottish rural schools network, have been instrumental in forming opinion and helping members become much better informed about some of the inadequacies in the existing legislation.</p><p>We are delighted by the Scottish Government's response to the work that has been undertaken by many members in the chamber and to my colleague Murdo Fraser's proposal for a member's bill, which brought the issue back on to the agenda just recently. He has campaigned tirelessly on the issue, as have many others. The Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill is in the best interests of our children and our families, and passing it is the right thing to do to support our communities. Of course, I could say that we are also delighted that it is another example of the SNP adopting Conservative party policies&#8212;a common feature these days&#8212;but I will stick with the original point.</p><p>The Scottish Government and the other Opposition parties have done a very good job in recognising just how important it was to get consensus on this matter. It is good to see that the Scottish Government has recognised the different categories of rurality, which is vital in the context of ensuring that schools are treated according to their individual merits rather than universal structures, which can sometimes ignore local circumstances. Those definitions are also important in relation to the implications of the defining principles of the bill as they relate to all schools.</p><p>One of the key principles is improving transparency and democracy in the consultation process. Margaret Smith's amendments 13 and 13A, which we debated earlier, raised important issues in that respect. There have been bad decisions about the future of schools because information was not properly made available to all parties or because it was not entirely accurate. We cannot allow that situation to continue and I am grateful to the Scottish Government and Margaret Smith for lodging amendments that allowed us to probe that matter much more fully. We have made the bill much better. I look forward to the cabinet secretary providing us with more details on the statutory guidelines for councils in due course, because tightening the regulations that govern the <place-holder colnum=\"21437\"/> consultation process is vital, as is having a more consistent and equitable approach throughout all 32 local authorities.</p><p>Conservatives support the new power that will be introduced to allow ministers to call in a closure decision after it has been made, if they feel that it does not comply with the new requirements in the bill, or that the local authority has failed to take account of all the relevant information. Like other members&#8212;Ken Macintosh mentioned the important issue of cost&#8212;I raised at earlier stages concerns about consequences that were perhaps unintended but still had to be addressed.</p><p>A more holistic approach should now be taken to the educational benefits statement, which will be crucial to any decision, so that we can give communities confidence that, although the economic and social aspects are being considered, the educational benefits statement will be properly weighted in the equation. Addressing that was important, as was giving a proper hearing to all the evidence at stage 1.</p><p>HMIE is a hugely important stakeholder. The bill team was right to identify that the educational benefits statement necessarily includes a wide range of factors, such as the after-school facilities that are on offer to children, links in the community and the school's ethos. All that raised the question whether HMIE could cover all that work from its existing resources. Some such issues will need to be monitored, but I am satisfied that the cabinet secretary has had close discussions with HMIE and that the matter has been explored, if perhaps not yet 100 per cent resolved.</p><p>Another question was whether the financial settlement might be revised in the future, which raised the unfortunate spectre that, at the very time when we are making huge progress to protect rural schools, the Scottish Government would unwittingly create a financial incentive to close them. I am sure that Opposition parties will take a robust stance on reviewing that, but the Scottish Government has again confirmed to me that it will not make such a change.</p><p>Presiding Officer, time is short&#8212;[<em>Laughter.</em>] I am sorry; I did not mean that&#8212;I cancel that.

It is never easy to ensure that our talented sportsmen and women from our rural areas, particularly the most remote areas, have a level playing field when it comes to the pursuit of their sporting talents. It is a matter not only of geography and the related travel issues, but of available coaches and facilities, plus the inevitable additional expense of finding accommodation when people are away competing.</p><p>When we hear stories circulating that Moray Council is considering closing all its local authority swimming pools in the mornings and that Highland schools are complaining that some pupils' Duke of Edinburgh awards are in jeopardy because of the closure of the outdoor centre at Muir of Ord, we should be under no illusions about the potential problems that such issues can create for anyone from our rural communities who wishes to participate in any sport, particularly competitive sport. We should also acknowledge that too many of those people miss out on the opportunities that are afforded to athletes in our more populous areas.</p><p>Sportscotland is very aware of the issue&#8212;indeed, I am having a meeting with two senior representatives of sportscotland in a few weeks' time to discuss it further. The issue has also been raised by Margo MacDonald on the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on sport. I take up the theme of both Rob Gibson and Jamie Stone that this is not about party politics.</p><p>What can we do to help? One of the most important issues is to promote genuine recognition and understanding of the challenges that rural athletes face. This debate can be part of the process, but there is no doubt that real action is required to improve both the quality of facilities that are available and the ability of rural athletes to use them. In relation to school events, in <place-holder colnum=\"21303\"/> particular, we need to be aware of the central belt mentality when it comes to staging competitions. Some sports in Scotland have made a conscious effort to use locations in the Borders, the north-east and the Highlands, but other sports seem totally wedded to the central belt, which means that some competitors must regularly travel hundreds of miles just to participate.</p><p>From my experience of 30 years of taking a variety of sports teams to events across Scotland&#8212;I still do it from time to time&#8212;I believe that some organisations would help matters a lot if they provided participating schools with as much notice as possible of their calendar of events, so that rural communities would have a much better chance of planning ahead to organise family life around someone's athletic interest. Likewise, if an extensive training programme is in operation, it must be accorded practical timings. We cannot expect a young athlete from Oban, Mallaig or, as Rob Gibson said, Orkney to make a long journey to Glasgow every weekend simply to find that their training session lasts only an hour. On the subject of better information, I am keen that local authorities should encourage their schools to publish details of the facilities and competitions that are available in their areas. Sometimes children are left out because their families were unaware of the facilities that were available; that is not good enough.</p><p>Of course, we have the benefit of the 2014 Commonwealth games and the welcome announcements of new facilities, which will provide a lasting grass-roots legacy. That is good news, but we must remember that a great deal of grass-roots work takes place in facilities that are not necessarily state of the art. Across Scotland, especially in many rural communities, there has been a deterioration in facilities such as pavilions, changing rooms and pitches, which is sad. However, there are communities that, through their joint efforts, have provided new goalposts, painted their changing room facilities, fixed the leak in the roof and, in some cases, built a new clubhouse. I am well aware of the fact that funds are tight and that there is not an endless pot of gold, but I like to think that the percentage share of national lottery funding that is spent on sport could be increased, so that we can be more helpful when it comes to assisting community trusts to look after the best interests of their grass-roots sports.</p><p>Nor should we forget the excellent work that has been undertaken by many outdoor pursuits bodies to improve the diversity of sports facilities in areas such as the Highlands. I refer to the mountain bike tracks at Laggan and Aonach M&#242;r, the cycle tracks on the west coast, the geological trails in Assynt and the John Muir Trust's work at Loch Ossian. Such bodies are crucial to allowing youngsters to <place-holder colnum=\"21304\"/> develop a love of the outdoors and to providing better outdoor experiences on their doorstep.</p><p>However, the bottom line is to encourage more people to help to run and coach our athletes. That is why the volunteering theme is crucial, in an age in which volunteering is threatened by health and safety, a fear of litigation and an increasing unwillingness among adults to put themselves through the disclosure system. I suggest that that is the biggest area of concern. I have no easy answers, but I believe that our grass-roots policy must be the strict focus in that regard.</p><p>I reiterate my congratulations to Jamie Stone on bringing this extremely important issue to the Parliament.

That amendment received unanimous support, so the importance of the family unit to helping our young people through a loving, caring and supportive environment clearly struck an important chord with every party in the Parliament. From the Scottish National Party, we heard that children do best in a strong and supportive family environment; from Labour, we heard about the need for a coherent strategy to enhance the quality of life for our families; and from the Liberals we heard that it is no doubt the best option to support children living with their own families.</p><p>So there is cross-party agreement, but just as was the case in the drugs debate, the next stage will be the real test. That is when we will find out whether we can lift the debate to another level, away from warm words and into meaningful action, however difficult and challenging it might have to be. As with the drugs debate, the problem that we are considering is hugely complex and pervasive and there will be many pitfalls along the way. My party would never pretend that we have all the answers&#8212;it would be grossly naive and arrogant for anyone to assume that they do. However, we have the courage of our convictions that we cannot stand by and do nothing. This morning, we issue a challenge to every member of the Parliament to stand together to address a matter that threatens to further destabilise the broken society that exists for far too many people and which costs the United Kingdom more than &#163;20 billion a year, while the resulting burdens on family relatives, social work services and our justice system go much deeper than just the money.</p><p>The extent of the breakdown was never more obvious to me than on the day in 2002 when I was <place-holder colnum=\"20862\"/> present when lain Duncan Smith made his first visit to Easterhouse. Like him, I heard for myself the harrowing accounts of the broken relationships, poverty, substance abuse and psychological turmoil that affected some of the families whose lives were described by Bob Holman and Sandy Weddell from the Easterhouse community. I saw the emotion on lain Duncan Smith's face and I heard the conversation in the car thereafter. In his words, it was a political journey that had hurt. We saw a community that was so remote and so far removed from any hope that it was tempting&#8212;so very tempting&#8212;simply to cross the road and walk away. lain Duncan Smith committed himself that day&#8212;no one can doubt that that commitment is real&#8212;to the fact that the issue goes well beyond party-political boundaries and that it will never be addressed by a simplistic solution or in the absence of consensus on the way forward.</p><p>I will set out some of the things that we have to do, beginning with the most important issue, which is parenting. Although it is right to acknowledge that the majority of parents in the country provide caring and effective support for their children, we must also acknowledge that there is a growing minority of parents who genuinely find it difficult to pass on parenting skills to their children because they are the children of parents who did not possess those skills. That is not their fault, but neither is it acceptable simply to say that they are a sad reflection of modern society. Those parents, particularly those whose problems stem from alcohol or substance misuse, need our help and they most often need that help from within their immediate communities.</p><p>That is why it is important that we make more effort to support those who work in the voluntary sector&#8212;the unsung heroes who are often best placed to change lives for the better. Our voluntary sector is outstanding, but at present many groups are under threat, partly because of funding issues, but also because they feel that their future is uncertain. I appreciate just how tight budgets are and the pressures that that brings, but we cannot accept some of the hindrances that are placed on the philanthropists and charitable foundations that are potential donors. An example is the crippling effect of the change from advanced corporation tax to tax on revenue income, which has reduced the available funds for some of Scotland's biggest foundations by &#163;0.5 million a year. Another example is the gift aid system, which is plagued by expensive and time-consuming bureaucracy that diverts resources away from good causes.</p><p>The Conservatives are determined to solve those issues with new policies that will remove the barriers, improve the uptake of gift aid from its very low take-up rate of 34 per cent and enshrine the principle that charitable giving should be made <place-holder colnum=\"20863\"/> out of untaxed income. We will also reform the national lottery, so that it returns to its roots as a supporter of good ideas from within communities, rather than being a vehicle for directing voluntary income into Government priorities and one that is often disproportionately skewed towards the public sector. We have plans to put in place a voluntary action lottery fund, which will replace the Big Lottery Fund and be completely independent of Government.</p><p>Beside that, we will put on the table policies that will end the perverse financial incentive against couples who choose to marry and end the part of the benefits system that penalises married couples. As other countries have done, we must structure our tax and benefits systems to end any financial disincentives and an overdependence on the state. A large part of that is about creating better employment opportunities and a single back-to-work programme for everyone who is on out-of-work benefits to replace the complex and inefficient current system. The Scottish Conservatives have got major commitments out of the Scottish Government&#8212;on lowering the burden of business rates, a town centre regeneration fund and the freezing of the council tax&#8212;but we also want a business dividend fund to encourage local authorities to be better placed to support new business start-ups. We want far more flexibility on child care and the provision of nursery school facilities.</p><p>We must also provide help in the home and at school. The Scottish Conservatives have made a &#163;20 million commitment to begin the introduction of a universal health visitor service for under-fives, so that parents get regular professional help with looking after their children's health and welfare from the earliest possible stage. Nothing could be more important than trying to break down some of the health barriers that exist in the lives of too many young children. Those barriers often mean that the children encounter other social and educational difficulties. In many schools, pupils learn about the social and financial responsibilities that come with being a parent, and we are keen for that good practice to be developed in all schools throughout the country.</p><p>I return to the main reasons for the debate, which are that 137,000 children have no parent in work; that 200,000 children in Scotland live in poverty; and that 60,000 children live with parents who are addicted to drugs and maybe as many as 100,000 live with parents who are addicted to alcohol. It is not rocket science to recognise the extent of the problems. We are setting out on a difficult and probably tortuous journey, but not to make that journey would be to deny our responsibilities as elected members and to deny many of our young people the right to be part of a <place-holder colnum=\"20864\"/> loving, caring and supportive family. We have no choice, so I will move the motion in my name.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament considers that the family is the natural building block of our society; notes the significant pressures facing families in Scotland today arising from relationship breakdown, poverty, unemployment and substance abuse; regrets that one in four Scottish children is growing up in a single-parent household and that 137,000 Scottish children have no parent in work, and believes that action is required to improve parenting support, to expand the role of health visitors, to fully harness the voluntary sector in this work and to recognise marriage in the tax and benefits system.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354169", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On 24 September, in Labour's debate on child protection measures, the Scottish Conservatives submitted an amendment that made abundantly plain our firm belief that the family is the most important building block in society.

We must also take account of the projected local developments that are set out in the St Andrews and East Fife local plan, particularly those that relate to local employment patterns.

Members right across the chamber have shown a widespread recognition of the <place-holder colnum=\"20268\"/> increasingly vital role that our colleges play not only in the economy but in the education and lifelong learning sector. As David Stewart said in his remarks about UHI, colleges have a great diversity and flexibility that other educational institutions lack. That reflects the fact that the labour market is increasingly demanding such features and, in many cases, much stronger links have been built between colleges and the workplace and between schools and colleges. That can be only a good thing.</p><p>As Claire Baker said, the fact that colleges make no distinction between adult and young learners and their ability to provide more educational opportunities to those from deprived backgrounds are important in upskilling and motivating both groups. However, we must also pay heed to the comment made by employers, including many members of the Confederation of British Industry, that too often in the past our workforce has not had the right skills, particularly in literacy and numeracy. As a result, it is good to hear that the Scottish Government is concerned about the matter.</p><p>Like many people, we feel that the valuable role that Scottish colleges can play in the development of apprenticeships must be a priority. In recent years, there has been excellent progress on that front. Indeed, on Monday, Murdo Fraser and I had the pleasure of meeting three outstanding college apprentices at Vector Aerospace in Almondbank and hearing about their future aspirations. Their technical skills and motivation were plain for all to see, and there is no doubt in my mind that this must be the way forward. At long last, we seem to be getting over the unfortunate myth peddled by some that college apprentices are somehow lower class citizens because they are not interested in attending university or do not have the ability to do so. Anyone who has been persuaded of that view should take the time to visit companies such as Vector Aerospace or some of the state-of-the-art technology companies that are forging ahead as a result of existing top-class college apprenticeship schemes.</p><p>As Professor Harvie said, we should take note of the highly successful dual system in Germany, where a combination of formal curriculum learning and work-based experience is the basis for teaching vocational courses. Indeed, that is often a recommended, and sometimes a mandatory, part of a university degree. As a result, competition for apprenticeships is strong, which is far removed from the idea that they might be a last resort.</p><p>We must be absolutely clear that the reform of the Scottish Qualifications Authority exam system provides the opportunity to realign the qualifications structure, which forms the basis for <place-holder colnum=\"20269\"/> the choices of our young people. We should not repeat the mistake of 1992, when Professor Howie's excellent paper on reforming the secondary school system was ignored because of political dogma and a failure to recognise that comprehensive education did not best serve the needs of pupils in secondary 4 to 6. I think that, 17 years on, we all regret that. Professor Howie's recommendations for a two-route system beyond S4 were eminently sensible, and colleges have a huge role to play in delivering just that.</p><p>If apprenticeships are the way forward, so too are business bursaries that are similar to those in the US. The system allows an employer to set up a contract with a college and receive a weekly allowance for releasing an apprentice. At a time when colleges are rightly pointing to the additional demand that is being made on their resources, extra money from the private sector can provide an important boost for the employment chances of many people.</p><p>On resources, I reiterate the important plea that my colleague Murdo Fraser made in his opening remarks when he identified discrepancies in the support for colleges that serve rural communities. That is surely not acceptable. I am pleased that the cabinet secretary has accepted the specific request from the Scottish Conservatives. Let us be clear that those colleges do a first-class job and that they should not in any way be the victim of financial discrimination.</p><p>Successful colleges are all about matching up the incentives among the student population with those around the economy. It is good to hear that the Scottish Government recognises the need for better local interpretation of national and regional data, the lack of which has been a major issue for teacher recruitment in schools. I hope that the Scottish Government means business in that respect: students will have a far greater chance of success if they are provided with clear routes into employment opportunities and a good knowledge of what is on offer in their local community.</p><p>A major part of that is whether the student feels that he or she has adequate support in tackling hardship and, as the Liberal Democrats have highlighted, in accessing child care. The Scottish Government has finally come to terms with just how urgent that matter is and with the need to produce policies that provide better support for those who are most in need so that our students are offered much greater flexibility whatever their personal circumstances. How sad it would be if Scotland had to sacrifice any part of its economic potential just because a large number of students could not find the means to support themselves throughout their studies.</p><p>As with everything in education, there are no easy answers. Success in the future will depend <place-holder colnum=\"20270\"/> largely on careful analysis of how the economy tomorrow can work and on harnessing the rich potential of all whose motivation and enthusiasm directs them towards a college career so that they are better prepared to enter the workforce.

First, there is the growing number of reports into child protection services, which, as Labour has rightly identified this morning, have too often been found seriously wanting when it comes to looking after the best interests of the child. Secondly, there is the crisis&#8212;I use that word advisedly&#8212;in parenting skills. While each of the three speakers so far has identified the first issue as extremely important for the Parliament, the second issue must be a priority for debate in every corner of Scotland. We want to use this debate to pursue that theme in order to help deal with the root causes of the problem. After all, a substantial number of child protection cases, though not all, would never occur if more parents were better able to harness the appropriate skills.</p><p>Let me deal first with the question of child protection procedures and the fact that, earlier this month, 23 per cent of local authorities were rated as \"weak\" or \"unsatisfactory\" in relation to their child protection services. That is a deeply worrying statistic, particularly for local authorities such as Dundee City Council, Moray Council, Aberdeenshire Council and Midlothian Council. On top of that, we have had deeply disturbing high-profile cases, such as the death of little Brandon Muir.</p><p>There has been consensus across the chamber about how to improve child protection procedures in line with national legislative changes. The Scottish Government has made good progress in some areas through simplifying structures, such as those that surround disclosure procedures, and trying to end the culture of crisis management that has often been the result of too much buck-passing of responsibilities. In addition, the more carefully targeted inspection programme will bring benefits, as will the determination of all parties in the chamber to support earlier intervention strategies. However, it remains the case that the lives of far too many young people have been blighted by incompetence within the system.</p><p>It will be important that the Scottish Government gets the forthcoming children's hearings bill right. Ministers have been forced into a major rethink because they did not consult fully and because some of their initial proposals were rightly seen as <place-holder colnum=\"19936\"/> a challenge to the traditional ethos of the children's hearings system. The Government has said that it will ensure that that ethos is looked after. I hope that that happens, because that system is vital to children in Scotland and we must get it right.</p><p>For me, the issue of parenting skills lies at the heart of the debate. It is a hugely difficult and complex issue, which is similar to that of drugs and substance misuse, but that is no reason to shy away from it or be reluctant to take bold and radical action. Indeed, as Annabel Goldie made very clear in her recent speech to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, there is no option to be anything other than radical. Family breakdown from one cause or another costs the UK over &#163;20 billion a year. The resulting burden on society, especially on family relatives, social work services and our justice system, goes much, much deeper than just the money. We do not pretend that our party has all the answers&#8212;we do not&#8212;but neither do we believe that there is any time to waste in bringing the matter to the top of the political agenda.</p><p>We totally accept the Scottish Government's focus on the early years, but why can it not also tackle child protection within education spending? Why must we spend &#163;30 million a year on providing free school meals to those who do not need them? That money could go into providing better support for the very young children who are the victims of irresponsible parents, providing universal health visitors for all young children, or providing support for the hard-pressed voluntary sector, which does such a fantastic job for so many children.</p><p>It is also time we had a major reform of the UK tax and benefit system to end the perverse financial incentive against couples who choose to marry, and to end the benefit system that penalises married couples. Last week, the Conservative party received from lain Duncan Smith and the cross-party Centre for Social Justice a three-point plan to help more households into work and tackle the penalties that work against constructive parenting.</p><p>A very large number of parents in society genuinely find it difficult to pass on parenting skills to their children because they themselves are the children of parents who do not possess those skills. Those people need our help because they have also been let down in some way or another. I understand the call to remove children from parents whose behaviour puts them in danger, but we must not delude ourselves about the numbers involved. Children's panel members will be the first to tell us that not even using multistorey tower blocks in each area of Scotland, which would <place-holder colnum=\"19937\"/> involve prohibitive costs, could cope with all those suffering from parental neglect.</p><p>This debate is not easy, and I fully agree that there is an issue about child protection. However, there is a much bigger issue about parenting and engaging parents in their responsibilities and their child's education and about ensuring that the welfare state supports rather than penalises them. I hope that all parties will be able to sign up to my amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-4911.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further calls on the Scottish Government to acknowledge the concern about the growing number of parents in society who lack the necessary skills to bring up their children responsibly and to address this issue as a matter of urgency.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20197282", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Protection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate sits in the context of two main issues.

That is why this morning various speakers&#8212;with considerable passion&#8212;have been right to identify the current disgrace of a large number of teachers, both new and experienced, being unable to find a job. If headteachers were free to comment on the matter, I doubt that one of them would be prepared to accept that situation. Like every parent and pupil, they know that a good school depends on the headteacher's ability to recruit the best staff. They also know that, at present, they cannot do that job properly because of local authorities' ability to restrict the labour market. That makes it exceedingly difficult for headteachers to ensure that there is stability in teacher appointments, with the result that far too many classes have to put up with a change of teacher during the school year.</p><p>Of course, difficult economic circumstances mean that more of the older generation of teachers are postponing their retirement, but there are also far too many constraints in the teaching marketplace, not least those that are imposed by the Scottish Government's disastrous class size policy, which becomes more chaotic by the day.</p><p>Workforce planning has been dealt a severe blow by the fact that local authorities, many of which are geographically large and diverse, operate a centrally controlled recruitment policy that pays little heed to the needs of individual schools. We all know headteachers who are told from which employment pools they must appoint staff. <em>The Herald</em> newspaper has reported that newly qualified teachers across the country are finding it difficult to find permanent jobs because of a worrying trend&#8212;the fact that some local authorities are deliberately preventing new teachers from getting jobs because they have stronger employment rights than probationary teachers, who are a cheaper option. What became of the 12 key recommendations of the teacher employment working group report, which the cabinet secretary told us in June 2008 would remove some of the rigidities?</p><p>It is ludicrous for any Government to assert that it can find every qualified teacher and probationer a permanent job. That is simply not in its power&#8212;we would not expect it to be. However, it is in its <place-holder colnum=\"19919\"/> power to carry out a complete reappraisal of the recruitment process to allow much greater flexibility within the demand structure so that it better reflects supply and to prevent the situation of 564 unfilled posts, which was the case in the previous two sessions. Rigid central control has failed, and it is time to let headteachers make more of the running. They should be free to choose the best staff, instead of being hide-bound by the bureaucracy of local authorities, many of which do not even keep a good record of data on teacher numbers, and the disastrous central diktats of a failed class size policy.</p><p>Thanks to the excellent progress that the GTC has made in recent years, the standard of teacher training is improving all the time. That also has the effect of raising standards among older, more experienced teachers. What a waste it is that so much talent is currently consigned to the sidelines. It does not take a genius to see what effects that will have on those who are currently at college and university and may be considering teaching as a career.</p><p>Worse still&#8212;if that were not enough&#8212;teachers look at the SNP's flagship schools manifesto pledges and its subsequent school report. On class sizes, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will reduce class sizes in Primary 1, 2 and 3 to eighteen pupils or less\"&#8212;</p><p>I would still rather that it had said \"or fewer\". That is now a chaotic policy, which finally bit the dust yesterday. On physical education, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we will ensure that every pupil has 2 hours of quality PE each week delivered by specialist PE teachers.\"</p><p>That is an important policy, but only two councils say that they can achieve it. On outdoor education, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will work towards a guarantee of 5 days outdoor education for every school pupil.\"</p><p>That is another important pledge, but no councils are delivering it. On teacher numbers, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will maintain teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls\",</p><p>yet we have 1,000 fewer teachers. On raising standards, the SNP said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will pay particular attention to raising the achievement of the poorest performing 20 per cent of school pupils\",</p><p>but we find that many standards are declining.</p><p>What a catalogue of failure, and what a massive turn-off to anyone who is either in or considering the teaching profession.

For all the allure of sport on the big stage, there are deeply worrying signs at the grass-roots level about the lack of activities that are undertaken because of pleasure rather than because of competition, especially in schools. Gone are the days of compelling virtually all schoolgirls to play hockey and all schoolboys to play football or rugby. I was never one to worry about unfashionable kit or freezing cold winters spoiling my hockey, but I do not want us to return to those days. That said, they carry a strong message, as do the lifestyles of a generation that was in general much fitter and leaner than the current generation.</p><p>I read the Health and Sport Committee's report with great interest. As Ken Macintosh rightly pointed out, many good things are happening, but it is abundantly clear that pupils are not getting two hours of PE in far too many schools. Indeed, as Mary Scanlon pointed out, even the intention of providing that does not exist in far too many schools.</p><p>It is clear that, in their varying degrees, certain issues are seen to be having a detrimental effect on PE in schools. Those issues are: the lack of an integrated strategy for sport and PE; concern about the availability of and access to sports facilities; the lack of specialist PE teachers in primary schools; a lack of focus when it comes to HMIE PE inspections; concerns about the health and safety bureaucracy and the accompanying litigious society; curriculum pressures; budget pressures; the aggressive and ugly behaviour of some key sportsmen and some sections of supporters; and the changing nature of teaching jobs. The story is not very happy, but what can we do about it? I want to pick up on some of the key themes.</p><p>What struck me most about the Health and Sport Committee's report was its comments about the lack of an integrated structure. One of the biggest difficulties has been confusion about definitions, although perhaps that is not a valid excuse. I share Sandra White's and Margo MacDonald's concern about the term \"physical literacy\", which is pretty meaningless, but it is important to come up with meaningful and accurate definitions of the terms \"physical education\", \"physical activity\" and \"sport\" because, <place-holder colnum=\"19631\"/> as Margo MacDonald and Ian McKee said, those terms are far too readily confused. That was clearly shown when the Scottish Government got itself into deep water about whether walking to school was PE. We are talking about two hours of good-quality physical education, which I am sure should mean two hours of PE instruction in normal curriculum time by a professional teacher with the relevant skills.</p><p>East Renfrewshire Council and Clackmannanshire Council have been praised for their pathways into sport programmes. One reason for their success is the fact that they have had an understanding of the overall strategy, which has involved not just schools but clubs and bodies such as SwimScotland that have done a huge amount to push forward innovative programmes and youngsters. I also mention Cricket Scotland. That might upset Sandra White, as it is not a body that appeals to her, but it too has done a huge amount and extremely well to get far more people involved in a short time.</p><p>Those local authorities have not taken a piecemeal approach that lacks clarity and vision, but the committee notes that such an approach is far too prevalent throughout Scotland. To me, what is essential is a willingness to make structural changes to the school timetable. Although I fully acknowledge that that is not easy, particularly in this day and age when so much presses on the curriculum, it can be done with willpower, as Richard Simpson and Mary Scanlon have said.</p><p>There is also the issue of facilities. It is important that up-to-date facilities are available, and I hope that the new school build programme is on the way to helping that. However, it is a question not just of the availability of the facilities but of their accessibility and cleanliness. In my view, local authorities and local communities could do a lot more to improve those aspects.</p><p>I also believe that an important lesson to be learned from East Renfrewshire is the importance of getting commitment at teacher-training level and harnessing volunteers. Those are, sadly, among the most difficult tasks that we face. It used to be the case that the majority of teachers in Scottish schools&#8212;of whatever type&#8212;would willingly take on extracurricular activities. They do not do so now, as the job demands so much paperwork and more teachers feel heavily under pressure about health and safety issues. It used to be easy for volunteers to gain elementary coaching certificates from schemes such as those that were run way back in the 1970s by Green Shield stamps and the Prudential&#8212;coaching schemes that were designed specifically to ensure maximum grass-roots participation rather than to develop sporting <place-holder colnum=\"19632\"/> superstars. We have largely lost those schemes, and we are failing a generation because of it.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee's report is extremely important, but what is even more important is how we react to it. To put it mildly, the current Government is sleepwalking on the issue and needs to wake up to the reality of the stark message that the committee has sent out.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to Christine Grahame and the Health and Sport Committee for their extensive work on one of the most important issues that the country faces in improving health.

Is it definitively the case that the Scottish Government has no other option, and no option in this particular timescale? As we understand matters, the Scottish Government conceded the case because the overwhelming weight of legal advice to it was that it was in breach of ECHR requirements.

It is also their duty to uphold the principles of the Scottish justice system, including those that underpin our different tribunal processes.</p><p>For the past week, members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee have been asked to scrutinise the arguments of the Scottish Government and of Ken Macintosh on his motion to annul the statutory instrument. At the end of that process, which involved a vote at yesterday's committee meeting, I chose to abstain on the ground that I did not have sufficient information to judge whether the instrument should remain in force or be annulled.</p><p>I will be very specific. First, and most important, the matter hinges on a ruling in the Court of Session that is yet to be made. Voting in favour of the instrument would pre-empt that legal ruling, and would mean that the Scottish Government was asking a committee of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise a proposal without the benefit of the certainty of the ruling. The minister assures us that that is not the case, because he has been formally advised about what the legal ruling will be: namely, the Scottish Government will lose its case.</p><p>The minister argues that both the Court of Session and Scottish Government ministers have a duty to ensure that the principles of the ECHR are upheld, which undoubtedly is the case, but I challenge the Scottish Government to produce the unequivocal evidence that the legal opinion that it has presented to the members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and to Parliament this afternoon is correct.</p><p>It is incumbent on the Scottish Government to explain fully exactly why it has conceded the case <place-holder colnum=\"19356\"/> prior to the legal ruling being made. I understand that in at least one other case when a Scottish Government predicted the outcome of a Court of Session ruling, it was in fact wrong. On that basis, is it right for the Scottish Government to attempt to force committee members into believing that the outcome of the appeal is certain? Past experience suggests that that is not the case.</p><p>Secondly, there is the issue of conflicting legal advice. The minister clearly asserted that if members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee voted to annul the instrument, various individuals&#8212;including members of children's panels&#8212;could find themselves in breach of ECHR regulations. However, my impression, having sought legal advice, is that that is simply not true: only the Scottish Government can be in breach of ECHR regulations. I am disturbed that other committee members may have received conflicting legal advice on what I would have thought was a very straightforward matter of fact: either those bodies can be in breach of the ECHR or they cannot. The time that has been spent on establishing the truth of the matter has not been helpful, especially for those who do not have the privilege&#8212;or should I say the curse&#8212;of a legal background.</p><p>Thirdly, I have had great difficulty in assimilating some of the minister's responses to questions at committee sessions. At the committee meeting on 1 September, I asked him to confirm whether or not there would be implications for the conduct of children's hearings if the instrument were approved. He replied:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Clearly, the instrument will have a significant impact in that a parent in the circumstances defined by the criteria will have legal representation, which they do not have at present.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 1 September 2009; c 2619.]</p><p>However, in the next breath he cautioned me that the instrument was a separate matter from the children's hearings bill, which is designed&#8212;and is about to be redesigned&#8212;to change the procedures that govern children's hearings. Likewise, the minister said in his opening statement at that meeting that there would be an \"interim route\" and that a \"permanent scheme\" would be proposed at a later date. That implies that changes are to be made.</p><p>I believe that all members of the Parliament, including the minister, wish to protect the central ethos of the children's hearings system&#8212;a system that has served Scotland well and which enshrines the principles of the Kilbrandon report. That ethos is clearly at the heart of the representations that we have received. I ask all members to think carefully about the matter.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190435", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Legal Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Rules 2009 (SSI 2009/211)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not doubt for a moment that it is one of the principal duties of the Parliament and its Government to uphold the principles of the ECHR as they scrutinise relevant matters of justice.

I think that is a very good choice of name. As members will be aware, Murdo Fraser has a strong personal interest in the bill. It was good to hear the cabinet secretary paying tribute to him and giving him credit for taking some of the initiative on this front. I know that he is genuinely sorry to miss the first stage of the bill's parliamentary process.</p><p>The school is, perhaps more than any other institution, often the defining characteristic of a community. Quite apart from delivering the crucial element that is education, it binds together families and people of different age groups, and is usually the focus for a wide variety of community activities. In rural areas, that focus is even more pronounced and is, indeed, often the difference between there being and there not being a community. We are therefore very pleased by the Scottish Government's recognition in section 12 of the specific concern about closure of rural schools, not least because of the much wider implications for sustainability of their local areas and the fact that&#8212;as was put very strongly to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee by the Scottish rural schools network&#8212;in the case of several rural school closures, the combination of increased travel costs, increased overheads at the receiving school and the possible loss of revenue from grant can result in additional costs, rather than savings.</p><p>It is also good to see that the Scottish Government recognises the different categories of rurality. That recognition is vital to ensuring that schools are treated on their individual merits rather than as universal structures, which can sometimes ignore local circumstances. Those definitions will be important when we debate the principles of the bill as they relate to all schools.</p><p>The second principle&#8212;tightening the regulations that govern the consultation process&#8212;is also important. It is a matter of concern that there has not always been a consistent and equitable approach across our 32 local authorities.</p><p>The Conservatives will support the new power that will be introduced to allow ministers to call in any closure decision after it has been made, should they think that it does not comply with the new requirements of the bill, or if a local authority <place-holder colnum=\"19117\"/> fails to take account of all the relevant information. Accurate information is essential in the process. We have seen too many situations in which inaccurate and misleading information has been presented as justification for a school closure. The legal requirement to challenge any inaccuracies is therefore crucial.</p><p>In general terms, we fully support the principles of the bill. However, in case the Scottish Government thinks that it is in for too easy a ride, I suggest that clarification is needed in some areas. First, the educational benefits statement, which is essential to any decision, needs to be balanced with a more holistic approach so that we can give confidence to communities that the economic and social aspects have been correctly identified and properly weighted in the equation. I think that we all agree on that, but the cabinet secretary knows that opinion was divided among those who provided evidence on who is competent to comment on each of those aspects. Unless an attempt is made to clarify fully which factors will be contained in the educational benefits statement, I foresee a little difficulty.</p><p>I still think that there is a little concern about the role of HMIE, which is a hugely important stakeholder. The bill team rightly identified that the educational benefits statement should necessarily include a wide range of factors, such as the after-school facilities that are on offer to children, the links with the local community, and the school's ethos. Indeed, HMIE's role is paramount&#8212;probably in the minds of most parents, too. I ask the Scottish Government to reflect again on whether HMIE's new role is possible, given the available existing resources. I understand from the cabinet secretary's full reply in committee on 3 June this year that the main difference between the role of HMIE as proposed in section 8 of the bill and the current situation is that it will be involved in every proposal from the beginning, even if the case is not called in by ministers. That could mean quite a lot of extra work for it, especially if the educational benefits statement continues to include more and more factors. Members would like an assurance that HMIE has the resources to cope with that change, both in respect of the number of available staff and relevant experience.</p><p>There is a question of whether the financial settlement's terms might be revised in the future&#8212;Ken Macintosh referred to that. Currently, local authorities receive a revenue grant for the percentage of pupils who are educated in rural schools with fewer than 70 pupils, which means that if those small schools close, the local authorities will lose that financial entitlement. Obviously, that will mean a loss of revenue. There has been some discussion about possible future changes to those financial arrangements, but that <place-holder colnum=\"19118\"/> might be just rumour. It would therefore be helpful if the Scottish Government clarified its position. As Ken Macintosh said, it would be unforgivable if, at the very time when huge progress has been made on protecting our schools, the Scottish Government was unwittingly to create a financial incentive to close them down.</p><p>I reiterate the Scottish Conservatives' strong support for the bill. As I said in my opening remarks, my colleague Murdo Fraser has campaigned long and hard with many other people for such legislation. We believe passionately that it is needed.

Before the economic downturn, many students could supplement their student loans with income from part-time jobs, but such jobs are now more difficult to find, so students are left with no choice but to borrow from credit card companies. That is a major issue for students.</p><p>As Murdo Fraser and Claire Baker both said, a much better use of the &#163;30 million of available funds would be to target the poorest students. The money could be used to help about 19,000 students who currently receive the full young students bursary and a further 15,000 students who receive part of that bursary. On top of that, we propose providing a &#163;200 increase for all students by increasing the amount that is allocated through the non-means-tested loan, which in turn would help about 78,000 students. We would also provide close to &#163;2 million in discretionary funds. Those measures would go a long way towards relieving the current pressure on child care and hardship funds, although it is good to hear the commitment that the cabinet secretary gave on that issue.</p><p>We believe that our proposals are the first step to addressing the urgent need to support our poorest students. Our proposals would tackle student hardship and help students to move away from a situation in which they become permanently trapped in debt. By supporting the Labour motion, we have shown that we are ready to engage with other parties in order to progress the proposals. They are affordable, achievable and fair and could be delivered within the &#163;30 million that is already available.</p><p>Finally, let me say a word on the on-going debate about tertiary education. Our universities and colleges are to be warmly congratulated for their success. As George Foulkes said, their qualities are vital to ensure Scotland's continuing success in the future. They should not be compromised by political dogma or hollow rhetoric in an election manifesto.

Secondly, we needed to ensure that the bill could be complemented by reducing the wide variation in local authority interpretation of the code of practice.

They felt let down because the existing legislation does not provide them with the necessary support to deliver the best services to families whose children have additional support needs.</p><p>In particular, I am mindful of the need to identify additional support needs at the earliest opportunity and to ensure that the relevant support is given from day one. As well as the educational, health and social benefits of doing so, huge costs could be saved in the long run through a reduction in the number of cases in which families find themselves in difficult and adversarial circumstances. That was one of our principal concerns in dealing with the bill.</p><p>We have worked hard to improve the provisions on representation and advocacy and on the workings of the tribunal process. We have also worked hard to clarify the responsibilities and duties of local authority education departments because we wanted to reduce the scope for buck <place-holder colnum=\"17639\"/> passing that has enabled some local authorities to hide behind the complexities of the existing legislation.</p><p>If there is a proper, graduated response to the needs of the child in the first instance, if there are proper relationships between parents, school and partnership officer and if there is much greater clarity surrounding the process of what should legally be provided in a support package, the best interests of the child will be promoted through an holistic support mechanism that gives people the best possible chance in the future.</p><p>As the convener of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee has just said, the bill should not have become a party-political issue. It could have been better. Indeed, it is deeply regrettable that, during its passage, debates sometimes became so highly charged that they even raised questions about parliamentary procedures.</p><p>That aside, the bill is about our commitment to the future of children with additional support needs and the families and carers who support them.

In those areas, parents have little assistance with regard to what support services are available or what procedures they should follow when things go wrong. In those cases, it is all too easy for a local authority to make a token reference to what <place-holder colnum=\"17608\"/> is available and hope that parents and families have the good sense to know automatically where to look for help. There is a clear need to provide a level playing field in that respect and to ensure that we are doing everything possible to identify all the cases in which there are additional support needs, to correctly diagnose the problem, and to ensure that the relevant support is provided.</p><p>It has been my intention&#8212;and, I believe, that of Margaret Smith and the Labour members&#8212;to ensure that parents are physically given the necessary and relevant information so that they are better informed and, therefore, better able to supply the appropriate support to their child. That should be a statutory obligation on local authorities. The Scottish Government has argued that that is the case under section 26 of the 2004 act, and that by lodging amendment 4 it is seeking to ensure that only a summary of the necessary information is provided, because the placing of the word \"any\" before \"information\" would mean families being provided with all the information that was relevant to any form of additional support needs, which inevitably would mean them ending up with far too much information.</p><p>I do not accept that argument, but I made it clear that I was willing to consider a Scottish Government alternative, which we see in proposed paragraph (i) of amendment 4.

However, it is sad that some pupils and their teachers have to put up with a small but nonetheless growing minority of persistent troublemakers who make life impossible for everyone else.</p><p>It is a source of considerable concern to me that groups such as the Educational Institute of Scotland, the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association and the General Teaching Council for Scotland regard indiscipline in the classroom, particularly violent indiscipline, as an increasing problem for their members. The acting general secretary of the SSTA, Jim Docherty, said just a few months ago that the figures released by the Scottish Government bear no relation to the real situation in classrooms. Ronnie Smith of the EIS has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the issue of pupil indiscipline is seldom far below the surface of the educational debate in Scotland ... the evidence is that the problem is getting worse and consuming more and more of each teacher's time.\"</p><p>It is even more concerning that there is such indiscipline in primary schools. We know that around 40,000 pupils are excluded from Scottish schools each year and that almost half of the exclusions involve the same pupil on more than one occasion. The most worrying thing of all is that physical attacks with weapons increased from 286 in 2006-07 to 366 in 2007-08.</p><p>However, the Scottish Government still refuses to allow the publication of the full facts. That is a little surprising, because the now Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning said in a debate on a Conservative motion on education in 2005:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At First Minister's question time on 20 January, I raised the serious issue of the proposal to end the publication of <place-holder colnum=\"17148\"/> annual indiscipline statistics and to replace them with a three-yearly survey. A couple of weeks later, the Conservatives woke up, smelled the coffee and realised that the matter should be taken up&#8212;I applaud them for doing so. If we regard indiscipline as a serious issue, it is important that regular statistics be produced so that there can be accountability. The production of statistics every three years is not good enough.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2005-03-17.15453.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 17 March 2005; c 15444.]</citation></p><p>Does the cabinet secretary still agree with that?</p><p>The statistics are bad enough, but the fact that in 85 per cent of exclusions there is no proper educational provision while the pupil is away from school is worse still. That is staggering and unacceptable by any standards. It is little wonder that many in the teaching profession despair about what can be done.</p><p>It is not for me or any other member to comment on the details of specific cases, but the sad events surrounding the Mike Barile case in Dundee threw up a major outpouring of public concern, anger and discomfort because of our inability to tackle the problem. There was a host of articles in the <em>Daily Express</em>, <em>The Courier</em>, <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>The Scotsman</em>&#8212;I have them in front of me&#8212;in which former teachers, former headteachers and former pupils said that indiscipline is the biggest problem that we face in Scottish schools. The Scottish Conservatives do not believe that any pupil who is guilty of such behaviour should be allowed anywhere near a mainstream classroom until they learn how to behave. We should learn lessons from the highly effective second chance units that have worked well in several states in America, in Northern Ireland and in Scandinavia, and we should pay strong attention to groups such as the Scottish Police Federation and our armed services personnel. Such groups believe that such policies can go a long way to sorting out persistent troublemakers and getting them to refocus their lives in a positive manner.</p><p>To those who think that I am being too harsh and that I have not signed up to the concept of inclusion in Scottish education, I say that inclusion should mean that all our pupils are able to work and learn in a disciplined environment without the fear of the bully or of retribution. If some people do not like that idea, that is tough.</p><p>We should not forget the huge range of voluntary sector groups that do much to help troubled youngsters make good. We have a wealth of talent in Scotland in Fairbridge, the Prince's Trust, the eTEN project and in private sector groups such as Spark of Genius, for example. Those groups are often the unsung heroes when schools are unable to find a solution, and we need to do far more to support them. That is why we will support the Liberal Democrat amendment.<place-holder colnum=\"17149\"/></p><p>That takes me to another issue. Every member knows that the best form of discipline is self-discipline and that that comes when pupils feel fully engaged and supported by a loving and caring family&#8212;my colleagues will develop that point&#8212;and when they pursue courses that they see as relevant, enjoyable and constructive in respect of what and how they learn. The curriculum for excellence should be well equipped in that respect, but its success will be compromised if there is not also a more extensive co-curriculum for all pupils, no matter their background or academic abilities. Evidence that was given in the recent inquiry by the Health and Sport Committee into health, physical education and sport issues laid bare the postcode lottery that exists with regard to the ease with which pupils can access a range of extra-curricular activities, which are taken for granted in many schools. The Government claims that it is keen to do something about that, but under its watch we are already seeing cutbacks in staffing in music, drama and outdoor education. Those staff are often crucial in running extra-curricular activities, and we should not underestimate the effects of that. If we can harness a child's interests in and outside the classroom, we will go a long way to channelling self-discipline in the right direction.</p><p>It is wrong to get too prescriptive about discipline in individual cases, because it should always be a matter for headteachers to decide what discipline procedures should operate in his or her school. However, they must be able to do that without fear of compromise or contradiction from either an overburdensome local authority structure that tends to assume that the one-size-fits-all approach suits everyone or excessive red tape. It should be the duty of national and local politicians to stay out of interfering in headteachers' jobs, but it must also be our duty to debate the barriers that stand in their way and to give our fullest support to the teaching profession in its desire to remove those barriers.</p><p>I look forward to the Government's response and to the statement of a coherent strategy that says what needs to be done to tackle the bullies in the classrooms. The Scottish National Party said that it would provide that back in 2005.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament deplores the rise in the number of exclusions from Scottish schools attributable to weapon attacks by pupils; notes the growing concern expressed by teachers and parents that serious and persistent offenders are not being punished appropriately; calls on the Scottish Government to publish detailed information at regular intervals on the level of reported physical and verbal attacks in schools, as called for by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning when in opposition, and believes that the Scottish Government should devolve more power to head teachers to deal with indiscipline in schools.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14966961", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Discipline"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At the outset of the debate, I make it clear that it is my firm belief that the vast majority of pupils in our schools in Scotland are well behaved, well motivated and keen to succeed.

I know that everyone has concerns about ensuring <place-holder colnum=\"16038\"/> that pupils at school&#8212;dare I say it, girls in particular&#8212;have the best opportunities to take up science subjects. I share the Liberal Democrats' concern about that. That is even more important in 2009, but it simply will not be possible if schools feel that they cannot staff or resource the science subjects.</p><p>I note the comments of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which highlights its concerns and its request that the Scottish Government, along with the General Teaching Council in Scotland, do more to improve the quality of CPD training for science teachers. Ms Brankin made a very good point about that being extended in primary schools.</p><p>The RSE report also highlights the need for a slightly more American approach to how we take on board advice from the many scientific bodies that present to the Government. There is a feeling in some of our specialist science areas that that process is sometimes just a mechanism by which the Government will operate something, rather than being about presenting information on key issues. We should consider that message.</p><p>The Scottish Government believes that the twin approach of the curriculum for excellence and the introduction of the Scottish baccalaureate exam&#8212;a group award based on highers, advanced highers and an interdisciplinary project&#8212;can resolve the science problem in schools. That is fine, up to a point. The curriculum for excellence brings the potential for much greater innovative work in science in primary schools, but there is a fundamental issue about the Scottish baccalaureate. I have absolutely no problem with the principle of a baccalaureate; in fact, I am strong supporter of the international baccalaureate exam, because of the breadth of its approach and its compulsory units in the theory of knowledge and community service, as well as the academic disciplines. However, if the Scottish baccalaureate is really to be made to work properly, we need to address the specific issue that its component parts have to be available in schools. I am referring especially to the advanced higher element. If, to use the words of Brian Lang, universities are to continue to believe that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"university places must continue to be awarded on academic merit\",</p><p>we need to ensure that we retain that strength in our university system.</p><p>In recent times, it has been good to see the upgrading of the tariffs for the advanced higher, but that will mean something only if we know that pupils have the opportunity to take the advanced higher. I believe that, within the Scottish baccalaureate, the advanced higher will matter more than the higher and the interdisciplinary <place-holder colnum=\"16039\"/> approach. That is something for the cabinet secretary to think about.</p><p>As I understand it, we are still waiting for the University and College Admissions Service to look at the tariff points. That is crucial, because they matter to youngsters who are about to make their decisions. The more we can speed that up the better.</p><p>A science strategy is extremely important, but it has to be consistent right through primary school, secondary school and into tertiary education and beyond. There is a lot of scope for development within business and industry and to have partnerships and more teachers and pupils on exchanges. In ensuring consistency, it matters that the Government has an approach on science. If it is going to introduce science baccalaureates, we have to know where they sit in relation to the arts and social sciences. If youngsters&#8212;and their parents&#8212;want one thing, it is to know what their qualifications from school mean in terms of their continuing on to university.

However, there has still been no SNP-led Parliament debate on school discipline. Despite the fact that discipline issues are at the very top of the agenda for teachers and teaching unions, nothing has been done to tackle the problem. \"Never mind,\" says the SNP, \"because smaller class sizes will be a far more effective way of addressing both the 3Rs and discipline issues.\" This is the SNP's great flagship policy:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will reduce class sizes in Primary 1, 2 and 3 to eighteen pupils or less\"&#8212;</p><p>although I think that it meant to say \"or fewer\".</p><p>What happened?

If we were to get the situation right, we would not, in an ideal world, have quite as many CSPs in the beginning. If earliest intervention took place, there would perhaps be no need for some of that.</p><p>I turn to some of the detailed evidence that was given to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee. It is clear, as the committee's <place-holder colnum=\"15378\"/> convener said, that the current legislation is too complex in relation to establishing who is responsible for what, specifically with regard to the costs that are involved. That was one of the strongest pieces of evidence that we heard, and came from groups such as Govan Law Centre, School Leaders Scotland, Barnardo's Scotland and Sense Scotland. Those organisations made it clear that there are issues about responsibility and costs.</p><p>Three other aspects of the legislation need improvement. The first concerns the issue of representation and advocacy. Throughout the process of evidence taking, we heard several times that, under the current situation, children are often not well represented, both because their parents do not have access to good advocacy&#8212;partly because they do not always have the right information or financial resources&#8212;and because section 11 of the 2004 act does not confer on them a statutory right to advocacy. When that is set against the situation for local authorities, which often have the ability to pay for representation, there is a problem. It is appropriate at this stage to flag up the fact that the child at the centre of a placing request is currently unable, in a legal context, to express their own views, which is very much at odds with other aspects of Scots law.</p><p>The second issue is that the tribunal process is viewed as unnecessarily adversarial, which can be a disincentive for parents to come forward. We heard worrying accounts of that, and I hope that we can address the matter.</p><p>Thirdly, we heard compelling evidence from Children in Scotland, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and Sense Scotland that the current legislation should be amended in order to ensure that the responsibilities and duties of local authority education departments continue beyond the time when the person reaches 18, so that there is an affirmative obligation to develop a transition plan for the older student to pursue into the post-school environment.</p><p>It is all very well to improve the current legislation, but we must also ensure that its interpretation within the local authority code of practice also improves. From the beginning of this debate, it has struck me that there is presently far too much scope for buck passing and for local authorities to hide behind some of the complexities of the legislation instead of facing up to their true responsibilities.</p><p>Let me be quite clear&#8212;and this might go back to the point that Robert Brown raised. If there were a proper, graduated response to the needs of the child in the very first instance, and if there were a proper relationship between parent and partnership officer from day 1&#8212;as there is in many local authorities in England and in countries such <place-holder colnum=\"15379\"/> as Australia&#8212;then there would not be quite such a need for so many CSPs to be brought in, especially when the problem is already too far down the road. We should not forget that the cost of tribunals&#8212;of around &#163;8,000 or &#163;10,000&#8212;could instead pay for 20 hours a week of classroom support for the child. That is a strong message for us to hear.</p><p>During one evidence session at the committee, I was appalled to hear that some local authorities do not provide comprehensive information to parents about their rights and the support available.

I will concentrate on three areas. First, Carers Scotland has collected worrying evidence that 40 per cent of carers find that their access to services is poor and that the services that are available do not always meet their needs. The situation often means that the carer must make a personal sacrifice: for example, many carers are forced to stop working, to reduce the hours they work or to move to a more junior position. The problem can be more acute in rural areas, where fewer resources are available and the cost of accessing centralised services is often higher. Carers Scotland has raised an important issue.</p><p>Secondly, in an age in which we are witnessing a huge increase in the elderly population, it is essential that we consider young carers. None of us knows how many young people are involved in caring for elderly grandparents. They face problems at school because of the time that they have to give up to care for another person&#8212;that gives cause for concern about the qualifications that they are undertaking&#8212;and there are emotional and social issues. Such problems can lead to truancy, neglect and the development of hostile relationships. The issue is sensitive, and it is extremely important that we take it seriously.</p><p>Thirdly, the work of carers in the paid sector could be seriously undermined by members of the European Parliament in certain parties who have <place-holder colnum=\"15133\"/> voted to abandon Britain's opt-out from the 48-hour working week. If Labour and the Liberals get their way on that, it will be the end of caring arrangements as we know them in the formal sector. We must think carefully about what that would mean for people in the unpaid sector, because there could be serious repercussions for shift workers and continuity of care. That is a very serious message for Scotland and for those MEPs.</p><p>I have argued in previous debates that far more must be done to use work that is carried out by voluntary sector organisations. During a debate a couple of weeks ago, I said that the sector is a \"gold nugget\" as far as provision is concerned. That message also emerged strongly from the committee's consideration. Good projects are happening, but there is not enough such activity. Members have made plain exactly what we must do. Margaret Mitchell talked about the increased media attention that carers have received, particularly as a result of John Suchet's comments about Alzheimer's disease. Carers experience great pain and suffering; they can be left feeling utterly isolated and unsupported as well as emotionally drained.</p><p>Carers save the Scottish taxpayer billions of pounds each year, and we are indebted to them for that. It is crucial that we recognise the sacrifices that they make every day to provide a future for the person in their care. I hope that the Government will take away the message that this is a serious debate, which deserved much more than an hour of parliamentary time.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14734043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Unpaid Carers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate and echo the concerns that members expressed about the amount of work that has to be done.

I warmly welcome the huge amount of work that has already been done on constructing a network of core paths around Scotland, and particularly the concept of a Scottish coastal path. History proves the success of walks such as the west highland way, the southern upland way and the Cape Wrath trail, of which I had the privilege of walking approximately 80 miles last year, in fairly treacherous conditions, a bit like those of today. That tested my Gore-Tex clothing and map-reading skills to their fullest extent. Those routes are well known in Scotland as excellent facilities.</p><p>It goes without saying that some of the most magnificent scenery in Scotland is on the coastal edges&#8212;a fact that, for many centuries, has drawn our artists, photographers, musicians, authors and, of course, tourists. There are also many benefits to be enjoyed by local people, and I have no doubt whatever that, by securing a well-mapped and well-marked Scottish coastal path, <place-holder colnum=\"15109\"/> we would be providing much greater incentives for people to enjoy their immediate environment and the best resource that Scotland can provide, namely her scenery. Who can deny the outstanding beauty and solitude of being at one with the elements in locations such as Sandwood Bay, with its extraordinary mixtures of Torridonian gritstone and Lewisian gneiss? Those sites are testimony to the rich geological, archaeological and cultural history of Scotland, and it is little wonder that they have become a Mecca for tourists from all over the world.</p><p>In John Muir, we have the perfect example of a pioneer in the field of ecology and environmentalism, who showed why it is so essential that we ensure that everything possible is done to preserve and enhance our natural world.</p><p>Members are aware of my lifelong passion for outdoor learning and the benefits that it can bring, particularly to young people as they learn more about themselves and how to cope with life in a different environment and acquire the essential life skills that they need when they move away from school. There has been a very encouraging growth in the number of schools participating in the John Muir Trust, and I have no doubt that a Scottish coastal path would bring more opportunities and an enriched learning experience to a wider school community. If the Fife Coast and Countryside Trust is able to report an increase of 100,000 visitors between 2005 and 2006 on 90 miles of coastline, what numbers might appear if all 2,300 miles were opened up. I got that figure from the 11<sup>th</sup> edition of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\", incidentally.</p><p>Although the prime interest must be in making best use of Scotland's outstanding natural resources, there are many other dimensions to the issue, not least of which is the benefit to the economy. There are obvious benefits in terms of the revenue from visitor spending, but there are other benefits that might be less obvious but are nevertheless hugely important, and they concern the use of many places of accommodation along the routes.</p><p>This week, I was passed information by one of our top-class outdoor education experts, who told me that two local authorities have been in contact with him to tell him that they might no longer have the resources to use his centre because of budget cuts. That concern is shared by many other outdoor education centres. How tragic it would be if excellent work were done to ensure that Scotland has a coastal path but some people were not able to get there because of inappropriate accommodation or, in some cases, a lack of expertise in staffing. Once again, I appeal to all parties in the chamber to ensure that our outdoor <place-holder colnum=\"15110\"/> facilities are used to the best possible advantage, especially now when there is so much economic uncertainty.</p><p>There is also a marketing issue. We should learn from other tourist attractions about how we can improve marketing methods. I agree with what Alasdair Morgan said about focusing on articulating the best interests of neighbouring communities, as well as of those who are likely to benefit directly from the new amenity. Scotland needs some joined-up thinking in that respect. Perhaps we should look to best practice in countries such as Switzerland.</p><p>There is also the issue of the much needed marine bill for Scotland. A coastal path would be crucial in raising public awareness of our precious marine environment, and allowing us a better understanding of why it is so important to future generations that we look after that environment better than we have done in the past.</p><p>When the nation's health is under intense scrutiny, and more of us are being advised to take regular exercise, the motion could hardly come at a more important time. With our rights to enjoy Scotland's natural resources must come an even more important sense of responsibility, which must be to the fore when planning Scotland's coastal path.

No one disputes the need to get the approach right in children's very early years but, on this side of the chamber, we believe that there is an important debate to be had about exactly where the main focus should be, and for us that concerns support for parents, which is reflected in our amendment.</p><p>It is a given assumption that children will invariably fare better when they grow up in a loving, caring and well-balanced environment in which family life is the centrepiece. The problem is that there is no ready-mix version of those factors. It is important to recognise that success can never <place-holder colnum=\"14823\"/> be prescribed merely by the actions of any Government. Of course, a Government can put in place a raft of policies that can help to create a more conducive environment in which parents and their children can thrive, but there must also be greater support for parents to recognise and adopt their full responsibilities when it comes to fulfilling their challenging role.</p><p>As has been identified in many reports, the growing number of negative statistics on childhood is worrying. For example, family breakdown now costs the United Kingdom more than &#163;22 billion a year, and one in four children is being raised in households without a resident father. A particularly sad statistic is that one in five young Scots believes that they cannot and will not make a success of their life.</p><p>What needs to be done? First, parents need to be able to enjoy and feel inspired by the experience of being a parent. Two reports that were published in the past week expressed grave concern that, for too many parents, that is not the case, and although I appreciate that some of the more controversial aspects of the Children's Society report raised the hackles of some people, I share that organisation's basic concern that the modern pace of life and the obsession with economic materialism and individualism are part of the root cause of the high levels of family break-up. Too often, there is an unwritten expectation that the modern way of life, with all its slick technology, allows parents to access more diverse social and economic opportunities than ever before. That might be true for some, but I suspect that it is not true for many. Being a parent is not easy, and it is inevitable that there will be stresses and strains if both parents feel the need to work long and tiring hours as well as providing the necessary good management in the home. We need to recognise those strains and alleviate that pressure.</p><p>I have been criticised in the chamber before for stating that reform of the UK benefits system can help to address the issue, but I strongly believe that it can and should. Whether we like it or not, financial resources are important. There is no reason why we cannot change the focus of child benefit to greater assist those with particularly young children. Nor is there any reason why we should ignore the warning of the Civitas report of last month, which identified that married couples can be up to 20 per cent worse off than parents who live apart.</p><p>Secondly, to take up Robert Brown's point, it is essential that we extend health visits to all families with young children so that we are more responsive to the needs of individual families. It is interesting that that view is increasingly supported by general practitioners. Very early advice on <place-holder colnum=\"14824\"/> health and lifestyle is usually the single biggest factor when it comes to giving a child the best start.</p><p>If there is a second given, it is the strength of the correlation between those who have poor prospects and live in deprived areas, and children who do not make progress. Many children who live in difficult economic circumstances feel disengaged from school, their families and their community. Indeed, I am amazed by the amount of public money that is spent on telling us that well-known, long-established fact. In my book, it would be far better for that money to be put directly into supporting the excellent voluntary sector groups throughout Scotland that do so much to help disadvantaged groups. Often, they are prepared to take on work that is difficult for local authorities to do within their limited scope and resources.</p><p>The voluntary sector is a gold nugget when it comes to the services that it provides. I know that every party in the chamber shares that view, but I have a specific request for the cabinet secretary. The Scottish Government should fulfil its responsibility to help local communities to harness and better co-ordinate the available voluntary sector resources, especially when it comes to help with parenting skills.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14684715", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Years Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is not only an important debate but a highly topical one, given the extensive and sometimes controversial coverage that the issue has generated in recent weeks.

Following the abolition of advance corporation tax and its replacement with a tax that is imposed on the income revenue of the trusts, many potential charitable donors are facing the loss of much-needed financial resources that would otherwise be available for good causes. In Perthshire, for example, a large, experienced and long-established trust is facing a drain on its resources of up to &#163;600,000 a year. That is a not inconsiderable sum, and the state of affairs does <place-holder colnum=\"14825\"/> not help to persuade more benefactors to come forward.</p><p>Finally, I come to the most sensitive part of the debate, which concerns the attempt to change attitudes. I agree with the Children's Society that we need a significant change at the heart of society so that adults, be they parents or teachers, are less embarrassed to stand up for the values without which a society cannot flourish, and that includes standing up for the family. Children need and want stability, and it is what happens in a child's earliest years that provides the biggest influence on their life.</p><p>There is a fine balancing act between, on the one hand, the Government standing aside to allow society to place its full trust and faith in parents and the family and, on the other, its legislating, when it has to, to provide better welfare.

It is essential that we recognise the importance of the Gaelic language and culture in Scotland today. However, unlike all the other members who have spoken so far, I am not going to attempt to speak any Gaelic. Despite my passion for Scotland's Munros, I have never mastered Gaelic and it would be purgatorial for members to have to listen to my attempts to speak it.</p><p>I come from a party that, as Ted Brocklebank rightly said, has given considerable support to Gaelic in the past. The Scottish Conservatives have always understood that Gaelic is an essential part of our heritage and, indeed, our social fabric. <place-holder colnum=\"14584\"/></p><p>If nothing else, it is important to reassure the 58,000 or so people who speak Gaelic that they have the Parliament's full support. That number is very close to the figure of 50,000, which is regarded as the minimum number of speakers who are needed to sustain a language. In the light of the decline that took place in the 1990s, they need that reassurance for the reasons that Johann Lamont set out in her thought-provoking speech.</p><p>It is also important to congratulate all those who have been involved in preparing the draft Scottish Government Gaelic language plan consultation paper&#8212;that is as difficult for me to pronounce as the Gaelic&#8212;which has been launched today. The plan will join others from various public bodies to ensure that the recommendations of the national plan for Gaelic are met. It is good that the Gaelic board is making such progress. I understand that the next tranche of public bodies to be asked for their Gaelic plans will be the national education organisations. I am pleased about that because education is so important for the future of the language.</p><p>On such an occasion it is important to mention the progress of Gaelic-medium education and of Gaelic education in general. The growth in the development of Gaelic-medium education is one of the great success stories of Scottish education in the past 25 years. More than 2,000 children throughout Scotland are now taught through the medium of Gaelic, and the exciting development is the fact that so many of them are in primary schools.</p><p>We welcome the development of new Gaelic schools in Glasgow and Inverness. Research has shown the benefits of bilingualism in the intellectual development of young people, and it is critical to the survival of the language that growth continues. The fact that it has taken place largely in the nursery and primary school sectors is a reflection of the marked improvement in the facilities that are available in schools such as Sleat primary school in Skye. That is a perfect example of what can be done.</p><p>As members have said, the worry is that, with budget cuts and times of economic uncertainty ahead, that progress will not be continued, so we must ensure that the children who have been taught through the medium of Gaelic at primary school can develop their language skills at secondary school. Much effort has been made in the recent past to recruit more Gaelic-speaking teachers. Although that has been relatively successful at primary school level, we desperately need to attract more teachers into secondary schools, not just to teach Gaelic but to teach other subjects through the medium of Gaelic. We must not lose the momentum that has been built up in the primary school sector; it would be a great <place-holder colnum=\"14585\"/> shame if we could not continue it in secondary schools. That is a major area to be tackled, which will depend heavily on improvements in local authority workforce planning.</p><p>The Scottish Government's draft education plan mentions its commitment to the adoption of Murdo Fraser's proposal to introduce a legislative presumption against the closure of rural schools. That is very good news for the schools and communities where Gaelic has been a traditional feature.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are hugely supportive of the Government's ambition to support Gaelic speakers and to promote Gaelic in schools and in our arts and culture. Although it can never be right to force any language on a reluctant community, we believe firmly that parents should have the right to educate their children in the language of their choice. That is why we fully support the motion.

I would be the first to argue that a good education is about far more than examinations, but we cannot get away from the fact that they are a crucial part of the process, so we have an obligation to get the reform process right.</p><p>We face three challenges. First, we must retain the successful parts of the existing system&#8212;yes, it has some, despite what some people think&#8212;while removing or reforming the parts that are not working, so that the qualifications structure is fit for all pupils, whether they wish to have a predominantly academic focus or to be more vocationally focused.</p><p>Secondly, the reform must have the confidence of the teaching profession, of the further and higher education sectors and of employers. It is imperative to recognise that whatever reform takes place must articulate fully not only with changes in the school curriculum but with the tertiary sector. Our colleges and universities face demanding times ahead economically, financially and academically, as Duncan Rice eloquently laid out in his outstanding principal's report to the University of Aberdeen, which was published last month. Qualifications reform must be debated in that context and not in a vacuum.</p><p>Thirdly, we must not repeat the mistakes of 1992, when Professor Howie produced what was widely regarded as a top-class blueprint for reform, but political dogma&#8212;chiefly, the obsession with comprehensive education in late secondary school&#8212;got in the way and we ended up with a halfway house that did no one, least of all our pupils, any favours.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives fully support the Government's desire for reform, and I will use the debate to outline three specific proposals. First, it is abundantly clear that far too many pupils in Scotland do not meet basic standards in literacy and numeracy. Too many pupils leave school without being able to read, write or count up properly. The Government has acknowledged that problem, and I am sure that it is why the cabinet secretary proposes stand-alone exams in literacy and numeracy in S4 or perhaps in S3. I have no problem with more rigorous testing of the three Rs in S4 or S3, but that should happen within whatever new exam succeeds the discredited standard grade and the intermediate level. That would be similar to the previous situation with parts of the old O grade, but S4 or S3 is too late.</p><p>If we examine the evidence that the schools, teaching unions and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of <place-holder colnum=\"13687\"/> Education prepare so carefully, we see that many primary school pupils have problems grasping the three Rs. Indeed, it is far too easy for pupils in Scotland to progress through successive years in primary school without ever gaining competence in reading, writing and arithmetic. Understandably, such pupils have difficulties when they enter secondary school; it is often why they lack confidence and can become disengaged.</p><p>My specific demand is for a set of nationally recognised tests against which a primary 7 pupil's ability to read, write and count up can be measured properly. That does not have to be done by way of formal exams or certification, but it must be done in a way that meets national criteria, perhaps as a key component of the new curriculum 3-18 programme.</p><p>The second proposal concerns pupils who wish to pursue a more vocationally focused education. Frankly, at the moment, too many of them are given a raw deal. As a result, they often face the stigma of being lower-class citizens, which is a totally unacceptable state of affairs. I remind Parliament of what Professor Howie said in 1992, which was that the comprehensive system of education had failed pupils in the upper years of secondary school because of the insistence in its one-size-fits-all approach to course work that all pupils pursue some form of academic qualification.</p><p>Howie recommended a two-route system from S4 onwards, with clearly differentiated curriculum options for those who want to enter higher education as opposed to those who want more vocationally focused opportunities. This time round, 17 years on, we need to learn that lesson and provide many of the opportunities that our European competitor states offer.</p><p>Thirdly, the new structure must ensure that the system caters properly for our brightest pupils by stretching their academic potential and ensuring that they can access their courses of choice. I hear the argument for greater flexibility in allowing bright pupils to take S4 exams in S3, but my line on greater flexibility is to let those bright pupils bypass S4 exams altogether. Instead of the hated two-term dash for highers in S5, bright pupils would have two years in which to study for those exams. Such pupils get a good group of highers and advanced highers in any case; their S4 exam passes become irrelevant to universities and employers alike.</p><p>It goes without saying that the advanced higher is a first-class exam&#8212;in most subjects, it is superior to the A level. Indeed, it is now more widely recognised as such by a good cross-section of universities north and south of the border. That is as it should be. Is it not therefore sad that some of our brightest pupils cannot access advanced higher level courses because <place-holder colnum=\"13688\"/> their school has had to make budget cuts? Sadly, for reasons of political dogma, pupils are not allowed to take advantage of facilities in the private sector where subjects at that level are taught. Similarly, why cannot private sector school children go into the state sector? We must enter into a different ideology on the sharing of resources.</p><p>Too often, people have subscribed to the fallacy that bright pupils will achieve in any environment&#8212;that the system does not matter for them. I beg to differ, and if the Government really wants to create a much better alignment between education and developing Scotland's economic potential&#8212;Scotland's education system was once renowned across the world for that very feature&#8212;I suspect that it does, too.</p><p>We have a golden opportunity to improve the structure of our SQA examination structure so that it better reflects the needs of all our pupils. The current structure is far too complex and has lost much of its rigour. We need to ensure that all pupils grasp the basic skills and go on to develop their potential.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-3164.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and, in particular, recognises the need to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly schooled and tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary 7 and also to ensure that the qualifications structure better reflects the specific needs of all pupils, whether they wish to pursue courses that are more academically focused or more vocationally focused.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551236", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Qualifications"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is fitting that the first parliamentary debate of 2009 is about the future education of our young people.

We welcome this opportunity to review the position one year on.</p><p>During last year's debate, the minister said that we must do better and assured us of the Government's commitment to providing much better-quality care for the most vulnerable children in Scotland. I believe that that was a genuine commitment, but I cannot find evidence to support the view that the Government has managed to move things forward since December last year. In her opening speech, Rhona Brankin provided evidence that she believes shows that there are serious discrepancies between what was promised in December 2007 and what is being delivered in December 2008&#8212;namely, 14 councils are not delivering the policy. It is also true that many people who find themselves in kinship care circumstances perceive that they have been badly let down by the Government; I am sure that members have been on the receiving end of complaints in that respect.</p><p>The current state of affairs is particularly unfortunate given the belief of all parties represented in the chamber that kinship care often offers the best option when children are unable to live with their parents, and our desire to see foster care and kinship care allowances placed on a much more equitable basis. Last year, we agreed that kinship care placements usually give children the best chance of overcoming the disruption and stressful circumstances that they have faced and of developing new confidence and self-esteem. Surely it is important that policy commitments reflect that objective.</p><p>I share the concerns of Labour and the Liberals when they criticise the minister and the First Minister for the language that they used in December 2007. It was easy to read into that language that the Government believed that it could address the discrepancies in support for kinship care in April 2008. In particular, the language that was used implied that there would be parity between kinship carers and foster carers, because the minister said clearly that the cash settlement within the concordat covered the payments due to kinship carers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"as it covers payments for foster carers.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 5 December 2007; c 4085-6.]<place-holder colnum=\"13312\"/></p><p>That was an unfortunate statement. The fact of the matter is that it was slightly disingenuous because it was perfectly clear then&#8212;as it is now&#8212;that there were other obstacles in the way. What the minister meant to say was that payments to kinship carers would be phased in over the period 2008 to 2011.</p><p>Just as important, the minister should have been much more up front about the issue of UK benefits. That is a genuine problem that has nothing to do with the terms of the concordat&#8212;which is not a legally binding document and, frankly, is not worth the paper it is written on. The Government should know by now that it was very dangerous to place any flagship commitment in the concordat at the same time as allowing councils to have discretion about which priorities they chose&#8212;class sizes, school meals, school buildings and teacher numbers all tell that story.</p><p>Ironically, the Government's main failing on the issue has been to put far too much emphasis on a concordat deal that becomes shakier each day. It would have been much better if the focus had been on addressing the anomalies that result from the fact that kinship carers can claim child benefit, which means that, technically, they lose that amount when they are compared with foster carers, who are unable to claim child benefit. Those are the issues that will determine whether real progress is made in the area and help to eliminate the substantial discrepancies between different local authorities in Scotland, which are one of the main reasons for complaint among kinship carers. We should not forget that the overall growth in demand for these vital services means that the problem could get worse, rather than better, if we do not address the inconsistencies in the child benefit system.</p><p>What matters most are the best interests of children and their carers and the need to achieve a workable and effective balance between family and state support. By definition, that means that we must establish greater consistency between Westminster and Holyrood legislation, especially on where the final responsibility should lie. We should tighten up the definition of \"looked-after child\" and the legal status that is accorded to the various categories.</p><p>No one doubts that the area is complex and that it has suffered from a lack of clarity on the part of the Scottish Government, which is acknowledged&#8212;albeit too late in the day&#8212;in the Government's amendment. Labour's motion has forced the Government's hand. The Government has had to acknowledge the extent of concern among Scotland's kinship carers, who expected more progress to have been made by now. However, it is not reasonable to put all the blame on the concordat, because even if it worked better, many issues would remain that leave kinship <place-holder colnum=\"13313\"/> carers at a disadvantage.

Ofcom's review highlighted the fact that public service broadcasting is at a crossroads, and John Lamont flagged up some of the implications for the Borders. Audiences might value competition for the BBC, but we need to monitor carefully the underlying economic challenges that public service broadcasting faces.</p><p>Audiences might place a high value on UK-made public service programming from a mix of providers, but Ofcom makes it very clear that the costs of making programmes is going up while their main financial benefit&#8212;privileged access to spectrum&#8212;is going down. For example, if ITV is to <place-holder colnum=\"13057\"/> retain its PSB licence, the cost of having two STV licences will exceed the benefits probably by 2009-10. As a result, the Scottish Conservatives believe that the evolutionary method of reforming public sector broadcasting has most merit, even if that view is not shared by the minister. Under such an approach BBC, ITV1, Channel 4 and Five would continue to provide public service programming as they do at present, with either reduced commitments or extra public funding. As Ken Macintosh said, competition is vital if the media are to maintain transparency.</p><p>As UK broadcasting history shows, Conservative Governments have largely been responsible for plurality of provision. For example, we licensed ITV way back in 1955&#8212;just before my time&#8212;and oversaw the launch of the new satellite Channel 4 in 1982 and Channel Five in 1997. I have to say, without wanting to sound too modest, that that is why we are championing a new Scottish digital channel. Such a move would give a welcome boost to smaller independent production companies to provide local news and documentaries. I once again emphasise our commitment in that respect.</p><p>Mr Blair Jenkins has made it clear that there is a greater need for accountability within Scotland for the programmes that are run, and for greater influence on policy in responding to demand for different types of programme.

They want to have the freedom to use their own limited resources as they deem appropriate in their own local areas. That is very much in keeping with allowing local authorities to decide on their own priorities.</p><p>At the same time, the Government is trumpeting a universal policy approach, because it says that there will be a level playing field approach to all pupils in primary 1 to 3. Let us pursue that theme. The Scottish Government assures us of three facts. It says that there is &#163;40 million, signed, sealed and delivered, for the policy to be rolled out in Scotland; that there are 118,000 additional pupils who will be helped by the policy; and that a quarter of Scottish schoolchildren are in poverty. The minister did not seem to get his sums right, but even simple arithmetic&#8212;and perhaps even logic&#8212;tells us that the substantial proportion of those 118,000 additional pupils are not in poverty.</p><p>Is spending precious resources, perhaps up to &#163;30 million, really the fairest and most efficient way forward? I think not, and I would not mind betting that parents across Scotland would rather see the money going to more deserving cases. For example, &#163;4 million could be spent on building a new primary school, and there would not have to be any arguments about using private finance initiative, public-private partnership or Scottish Futures Trust funding sources. It would be an easy option.<place-holder colnum=\"12930\"/></p><p>Whether we like it or not, one of the given laws of economics is that choices must be made on how best to spend limited resources. The SNP proposal promised faithfully that it would deliver free school meals to all P1 to P3 pupils. Incidentally, that is despite much of the dietary evidence suggesting that the money would be better spent on the under-fives. The historic concordat clearly says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Assuming the legislation is passed, local authorities will provide free school meals to all P1 to P3 pupils\".</p><p>The truth is that that promise is based on a false premise. In relation to the Scottish statutory instrument, we are debating councils being given powers, not an obligation, to provide free school meals across the board. If this is such a flagship policy, why was the Scottish Government not prepared to legislate? Is not the real truth that it knows that this policy, just like the policy on class sizes, cannot be delivered?</p><p>I move amendment S3M-2958.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but in doing so, calls on the Scottish Government not to impose any financial penalty, directly or indirectly, on any local authority that exercises its discretion not to provide school meals free of charge to all pupils in primaries 1 to 3.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271716", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Bureau Motion"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Throughout this entire debate, I have been persuaded of two compelling pieces of evidence.

Last week's television images were a stark reminder of just how vulnerable some children are, and of the difficulties that we face in adopting policies that can deal successfully with cases in which the child's voice is never heard.</p><p>Members will be aware of the vast array of reports on the subject. I thank people from the huge array of public bodies who regularly provide members with informative briefings. The Centre for Social Justice estimates that family breakdown now costs the United Kingdom about &#163;22 billion a year, not including costs to the care system. That speaks volumes about the scale of the task that is in front of us. The centre makes it clear that our current care system is overloaded, that too much is demanded of our social work services, and that morale can, at times, be very low. Naturally, none of that is helped when serious mismanagement occurs, as was revealed last week both north and south of the border. Members will also be mindful of the fact that the number of children and young people who come under the \"looked-after\" heading has been increasing year on year for the past two decades, as has the number of child protection referrals.</p><p>I have no doubt whatever about the Government's commitment&#8212;or, indeed, the commitment of the other political parties&#8212;to addressing the matter, including the very difficult and sensitive issue of child protection legislation. Such commitment was evident in the cabinet secretary's swift and honest response to the publication of the damming report on the state of children's services in Aberdeen City Council, to which Karen Whitefield referred.</p><p>In addressing all such matters effectively, I hope that the Government will be mindful of the following important principles. First, it would be totally unacceptable if the large number of financial commitments that are being placed on councils at present&#8212;a time of economic downturn&#8212;were to mean that there will be a squeeze put on the funds that are available to support children's services. It is to be hoped that councils and the Government will, via the regular concordat discussions, recognise just how important this area of support is. We need to be sure that councils are able to provide a structure that is both secure and transparent, and which represents best value for money.<place-holder colnum=\"12572\"/></p><p>In that context, it will be important to make the most effective utilisation of the services that are offered by the voluntary sector, which in so many cases is able to provide vital support and expertise to local authorities in providing quality care. Just last week, I was told by a charitable trust that because of tax changes in the past few years&#8212;principally, the fact that advanced corporation tax was replaced with taxes on income revenue&#8212;the trust is more than &#163;500,000 less able to support good causes each year. That area of policy needs urgent attention.</p><p>There is also the question of educational provision for looked-after children. The recent publication of the HMIE report on improving education provision for our looked-after children makes clear what was already known&#8212;that, overall, looked-after children face a bleak outlook when it comes to educational opportunities, particularly in the tertiary education sector. The report recommends that a number of improvements be implemented, including a clear vision for councils on the specific educational needs of looked-after children; increased support for children leaving care who are beyond the school-leaving age; and better methods for assessing the needs of looked-after children, especially in regard to access to the wider curriculum. That is why the Scottish Conservatives also believe that better educational support must be offered to children who are excluded from school, so that they can be provided with a more focused and disciplined approach that allows them to gain more confidence and self-esteem.</p><p>We have a wealth of expertise in many voluntary sector bodies&#8212;whether in groups such as the Prince's Trust, Fairbridge or eTEN, or in private sector groups such as Spark of Genius&#8212;and we need to ensure that they are fully supported and known about by the communities that wish to make use of their excellent support. It is simply not acceptable that some of our children are excluded and have nothing to do or any means of feeling they have something worthwhile to contribute.</p><p>We welcome the pilot schemes that have been conducted across 18 council areas in Scotland, and have examined a variety of techniques to provide direct support to help youngsters become the major stakeholders in planning their educational and employment futures. The outcome of those pilots saw improvements in attendance, advancement in assessment levels, faster and more effective educational progress, and indirect improvements in the level of support for parents and carers. As Karen Whitefield and Margaret Smith said, those areas require considerable attention.</p><p>However, as the minister said in his opening remarks, perhaps the most important issues to <place-holder colnum=\"12573\"/> tackle in the longer term are the problems with parenting. I hope that we in Parliament can agree that the problem is among the most acute social difficulties that face this country. In far too many cases we are now witnessing a third generation of parents who lack basic parenting skills&#8212;parents who no longer know how to pass on the skills because they themselves were children of parents who did not possess those skills. Although the Government can help&#8212;as it is doing in improving kinship and foster care, in reforming the children's hearing system, and in developing legislation that is presently under consideration&#8212;it cannot be expected to bear the entire burden of the problem. As Margaret Smith said, parents are the most effective means of bringing up children, so we need to ensure that we have social policies that address that issue, and that we have tax policies that create much greater incentives for families to stay together and which help a parent to stay at home in the earliest years of a child's life. Care at that early stage is vital.</p><p>We will work with the Government and, more important, we will work on a cross-party basis to improve the outcomes for our looked-after children and for all those who are such vital links in the human chain. However, we also believe that we have to do more in other policy areas in order, we hope, to reduce the numbers of children who are placed in care in the first place.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246612", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It would be a very dispassionate human   being who could remain untouched by recent events related to child care and looked-after children, so let me say unequivocally that we support the Government and the other political parties when it comes to taking this matter very seriously indeed, and especially when it comes to finding a more joined-up approach between the professionals and carers...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Elizabeth", "last_name": "Smith", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80387", "house": "4", "member_id": "80387", "person_id": "14096", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "Mid Scotland and Fife"}, "section_id": "14246612", "hpos": "10", "gid": "2008-11-20.12570.0", "epobject_id": "14246620", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2008-11-20.12559.1&amp;s=speaker%3A14096+section%3Asp#g12570.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "09:48:00", "speaker_id": "80387"}, {"body": "<p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to address the decline in breeding seabird populations.

There is a very fine line between ensuring that the law is measured and protective but not intrusive and autocratic, especially in a country such as Scotland, where the relevant laws often cross international, European, Westminster and Holyrood boundaries.</p><p>Furthermore, let us not forget that along with the long list of rights comes just as long a list of responsibilities. We want to inculcate those responsibilities in our children as they grow up, but as adults we also have responsibilities to ensure that we protect the physical and mental status of childhood, which is a distinct phase of development in a young person's life that is not adolescence or adulthood. Too often these days, we are guilty of expecting the young, and sometimes very young children, to think and understand like adults, and in some cases to have views on some of the most complex and sensitive matters.</p><p>I do not know the answer to this, but while being a parent has never been easy, I suspect that there is some justification these days for believing that it has become increasingly difficult. For example, there is the modern obsession with rights and how they can be used to challenge almost every aspect of our social, political and economic lives. The more we legislate, the greater the danger of making bad and inappropriate legislation and stifling human freedom.</p><p>The five-yearly audit report that we are required to submit to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child is intended to be a check and a balance when it comes to how we protect our children. It is designed to ask searching questions, as it should, and to help us take stock of how far we have travelled and how far we still have to go to make improvements. While on the Conservative benches we accept most of the recommendations, we feel that the legal and libertarian implications of some should be the subject of more extensive debate. However, I welcome any report that makes us think carefully about what we do in this hugely complex area.</p><p>I will finish by addressing education and health policy. Perhaps the greatest gifts that we give children are health and education, but, sadly, those are denied to far too many children throughout the world. The many submissions that I and other members received prior to the debate made it abundantly clear that effective policy making in education, health and economic development, rather than more and more legislation, is far more likely to deliver improvements for our vulnerable children.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14210336", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It goes without saying that it is the moral as well as the legislative obligation of any Parliament in the democratic world to ensure that we protect our children, both in relation to their inalienable human rights before the rule of law and as looked-after individuals who have not yet arrived at adult independence.

They create the potential for cutbacks in other year groups&#8212;indeed, many councils have said that.</p><p>Last week, I was strongly critical of the rigidity of the Government's class size policy, and I will be so again this morning. Indeed, I will ask for the abandonment of the policy as a directive from central Government. Having spent a great deal of time listening to evidence in the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and to the parliamentary responses that have been given to my colleague, David McLetchie, I am utterly convinced that the cost of the policy to the rest of the education service&#8212;especially in respect of teaching jobs&#8212;has not been properly thought through. If, on one hand, we try to free up the market by allowing COSLA, through the historic concordat, to have more say in the placing of teachers yet, on the other hand, we fix one side of the market, we will end up with two incompatible economic systems. Given Alex Salmond's recent conversion to Thatcherite economics, I would have thought that the Government could work that out for itself.</p><p>The rigidity of the policy manifests itself in other ways. Yesterday, I listened to a headteacher telling the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee that, if he wants his school to advertise a vacancy, three things can happen. The vacancy can be advertised in the newspapers; there can be a transfer of a surplus teacher from another school; or a commitment can be made to take on a probationer, once they are fully qualified. However, the decision is not his&#8212;it is the local authority's, and he has to go along with it even if he has interviewed some very good candidates. Because of the barriers of the situation, he is in a difficult position. That cannot be right. There is a complete inconsistency between the aspirations in the teaching profession and what councils will allow because of red tape and budgetary restraints. We need a much more flexible approach that is properly driven by the demand for jobs as opposed to the artificial targets that the Government is trying to impose. Above all, headteachers must have far more power.<place-holder colnum=\"10708\"/></p><p>Another issue is the mismatch of skills, and I find it especially worrying that the Government is not spending enough time on the matter.

I will address those later.</p><p>In my speech yesterday, I was critical of the Government's education policy in other areas, but I want to make it clear that getting it right for every child is crucial because of the following key principles, three of which are successfully embedded in the pathfinder schemes: the local development of policies, dependent on the needs of the particular local community; improved communication between the different agencies involved in caring for vulnerable children; much greater consistency in the team that looks after each child; a reduction in the bureaucracy that accompanies the whole process; and an end to the wide regional variations in the quality of care that is offered.</p><p>The most frequent complaint that we hear&#8212;I am sure that this is true for many MSPs&#8212;is that a child is passed over to too many different individuals in the process of their care. That factor can create confusion and sometimes raise <place-holder colnum=\"10470\"/> questions of trust for the child and for the parents or guardians. That is why it is so crucial that a lead professional is identified when several different individuals or groups are involved. It is good to see that that principle is at the heart of the Government's proposals.</p><p>We also warmly welcome the Government's consultation process to look at reform in the children's hearings system&#8212;a system which has not been short of its critics in recent times, despite the fact that it has traditionally brought many benefits to our Scottish justice system. It is undoubtedly in need of reform, principally to ensure that its workings are much more efficient, but I hope that the Government will also accept that the reform process, as well as the developments set out by Fiona Hyslop this morning, can be strengthened if we adopt other measures too.</p><p>Before the recess, Annabel Goldie made clear our commitment to having the courage of our convictions to examine other issues on the parenting front&#8212;suggestions that are not always very popular. She made it clear that we need to show both compassion and determination when confronting the fact that a large number of parents in society today genuinely find it difficult to pass on parenting skills to their children because they themselves were the children of parents who did not possess those skills.</p><p>In 2003, the number of children referred to the children's reporter on the ground of lack of parental care was more than 16,000, and by 2006 that figure had increased to 19,500. When we consider, as Rhona Brankin mentioned, that many of those children suffer neglect because of drug or alcohol abuse, we cannot shy away from confronting the problem head on. A national debate is needed on the subject.</p><p>I want also to stress our commitment in the Conservative party to policies at United Kingdom level that will encourage families to stay together and allow parents real choices when it comes to deciding what is best for their children. Family breakdown now costs the UK &#163;20 billion a year, and if we do not have that underlying support through the UK tax and benefit system, the policies over which this Parliament has control will probably be much less effective. We believe that the foundation of the family unit is based on the institution of marriage, and it is vital that we end the perverse financial disincentive against couples who to choose to marry. The working tax credit received by couples should reflect that, and there should also be a transferable tax allowance for married couples.</p><p>In the previous session, the Education Committee and the Parliament both held important debates on the two issues of kinship care and <place-holder colnum=\"10471\"/> child protection. As the minister will acknowledge, they are difficult areas of legislation but nonetheless important when it comes to proper care for our most vulnerable children. We are very supportive of the Government's ambition to improve support for kinship and foster carers, despite some of the complexities that such legislation involves. Such carers are hugely important, given that both kinship and foster care can often&#8212;though not always&#8212;provide a more stable environment than when children are placed in residential establishments. We will also do everything that we can to support the Government on the difficult issue of child protection.</p><p>I have no doubt that there will be much scope for controversy in other areas of policy debate, but I hope that we can reach a consensus on the basic principles. We would be letting down our children if that was not the case.</p><p>I have one serious word of caution. The services are both expensive and time consuming, given the specialist nature of professional care that is required. In a time of economic downturn&#8212;in all probability, recession&#8212;there will be even stronger temptations for local councils, which are largely responsible for the services, to make cutbacks. Councils are already facing severe difficulties because of other policies. The figures are plain to see, and it would be all too easy for exactly the same to happen with child care services, too.

I refer most especially to the imposition of artificial and unworkable targets instead of policies that would allow Scotland to deploy better the outstanding professional talent that it has in the teaching profession, too many members of which cannot get a job at the moment, and to deal with the pressing issue of discipline in our classrooms. I am in no doubt that parents, teachers and pupils want the focus to be on providing the best teaching and educational opportunities that are available and on developing policies that will remove from our classrooms the persistent troublemakers who stop other children learning properly.</p><p>I will now deal specifically with two of the Government's policies&#8212;the class size policy and the policy on physical education&#8212;and explain why the Scottish Conservatives believe that radical change is required on both fronts. A year ago in the Parliament, I raised serious concerns about the ability of my local authority in Perth and Kinross to deliver the class size policy, citing the implementation costs estimated by the council's department of education. At the same time, Glasgow City Council and the City of Edinburgh Council stated their concerns, and it was not long before other councils expressed the same views. Witnesses who have appeared before the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and members of the media have made it plain that the majority of local authorities cannot implement the policy within the given timetable with the extremely limited resources that have been provided. It is our contention that they should never have been forced to attempt to do so.</p><p>Of course smaller class sizes help the learning process&#8212;that is a given in virtually every educational institution in the land&#8212;but the decision about numbers should rest with a headteacher, who is best placed to know what his or her school is getting up to, rather than with a Government or a local authority that wants to impose a rigorous one-size-fits-all policy that pays <place-holder colnum=\"10374\"/> no heed to local circumstances or to different teaching experiences.</p><p>What do we say to the parents of the twins in East Lothian who have had to face the threat of their family being split apart because of the bureaucracy of a Government target, to the teachers in rural primary schools who might lose an outstanding colleague because of a Government target, or to the pupil in a secondary school in the Borders who finds that his advanced higher courses will not run because of the priority that the Government gives to meeting class size targets? That is not my idea of what good-quality education is all about, and I am pretty sure that it is not what parents and teachers think it should be all about, either. The class size policy is not working and it is time that the Government admitted that.</p><p>I turn to PE, outdoor education and the Government's manifesto pledge to give children two hours of PE a week. The situation did not look too promising when Maureen Watt suggested that the two hours might involve walking to school. That was followed by an embarrassing Fosbury flop when the Government got itself in the most unbelievable muddle about whether PE activities would be undertaken by specialist PE teachers. That does not sit well with one of the five great mantras of the Scottish Government&#8212;to foster a healthier Scotland&#8212;nor does it sit well with what our Olympic gold medal winners are saying.

In that respect, the consultation processes of the Scottish Government and the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee have both been effective in bringing forth comment from a wide range of interested stakeholder groups, whose expertise is crucial in advising the Parliament about how Scotland can refocus flood protection policy. Indeed, the scientific debate appears to be well advanced. However, there are some key messages that we need to take on board, principally those that involve addressing the current shortage of engineers and people with hydrological expertise.</p><p>There was a strong message from several witnesses that national legislation must clearly define where responsibilities lie in a language that is familiar to the general public as well as to the scientists and the technical experts. If there seems to be overwhelming support in favour of the catchment principle of flood management, legislation must reflect that in an unambiguous and workable way so that there is no repeat of the difficulties that were encountered in the aftermath of the recent Kinross and Milnathort floods. Transparency and accountability are essential, as is the existence of strong working relationships between all those involved, rather than there being scope for buck passing.</p><p>The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee has been clear about the need to avoid another layer of bureaucracy. We do not believe that we require an additional watchdog. However, there is undoubtedly a need for a national nerve centre, in the form of SEPA, to provide more accurate flood warning information and more careful and co-ordinated planning of flood management, which, I hope, will be of huge help to Scottish local authorities when they create their maps of old drainage ditches and streams in their areas.</p><p>It is essential that lines of responsibility are clear and that an assurance is given to people that their communities will be safeguarded.

For the very reasons that Karen Whitefield and Mary Mulligan mentioned, issues that do not always make the headlines are nonetheless important to us in the Parliament.</p><p>As the report explains, the routes that young people take out of care and into independent living are numerous and complex. No two cases are the same, so we must be careful not to make sweeping generalisations. The report is right to focus on the large number of looked-after children who are due to leave care, particularly from residential units, once they reach 16. The situation surrounding the provision of care and the circumstances that lead to a young person being placed in care vary immensely. So too do the personalities and capabilities of the young people involved. While leaving care for independent living might be the correct choice for one 16-year-old, it may be entirely inappropriate and extremely difficult for another. I am wary of suggestions that all those young people must remain in care until the age of 18, but I support the idea that no young person should feel obliged to leave care, or be pressured into leaving care upon reaching their 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, simply because it is \"the right thing to do.\" As highlighted by the report, the transition from care to independence, regardless of destination, is a tricky and uncertain time. To aid the transition from care to independent living, support for young care leavers should be available and, if <place-holder colnum=\"10174\"/> appropriate, it should continue to be available once that transition has been completed. Moreover, the decision to leave care prior to 18 should be that of the individual involved. We should seek to better educate young people on the options available to them and the implications of making certain choices. At the moment, too many young people choose to leave care, especially from residential units, without the help or support that we would wish to be the normal practice.</p><p>It is vital that young care leavers are adequately equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to cope with the challenges that independence can bring. Too often, that is not the case. We must never forget that these are some of our most vulnerable young people, who frequently&#8212;through no fault of their own&#8212;lack the basic levels in education and have little in the way of training or national qualifications. Currently, too high a percentage of 16 to 18-year-olds are not in education, employment or training, and all too often young care leavers encounter financial, education and employment problems that can result in them ending up in that bracket. There are strong and powerful messages in the report, to which it is important that the Parliament listens carefully.</p><p>I am grateful to have had the opportunity to debate such a worthwhile subject. Social care does not always get the attention or the profile that it deserves. However, in light of this debate and the work of the commissioner, Kathleen Marshall, and her team, I hope that all the political parties will work together to ensure that young care leavers can make the transition from care to independent living as successfully as possible and at a time that is appropriate for them.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13776935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Age of Leaving Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to those already offered to Karen Whitefield on securing the debate.

As Ian McKee rightly said, defining those terms is not an easy task, but Malcolm Chisholm in his eloquent speech and Robin Harper made the important point that we must have parameters as we debate the bill. Dr Donald Smith of the Scottish Storytelling Centre told the committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"if we do not begin with a workable definition, all the rest becomes difficult.\"</p><p>He said that that might affect the accountability for delivering the remit. That is a lesson to learn. It is not easy to give definitions but, as Malcolm Chisholm said, we should not shy away from that important task.</p><p>That issue precipitated debate in the committee about whether legislation is necessary. At times, the minister was not entirely convincing in speaking about why the bill is required to provide the new body, creative Scotland, with its functions. Those functions will be more diverse than the combined Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen functions, but the funding will be fairly tight. However, on the basis that the committee has agreed to accept the minister's assertion that a legislative requirement exists, the key focus of the debate must be to ensure that we make the bill as good as possible and worthy of the time that it has been given. We must live up to our name as a committee&#8212;Dr Smith described it as having done</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an effective job in bringing all the issues to the surface.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 7 May 2008; c 947, 948.]</p><p>It is now Parliament's job to deal with those issues head on.</p><p>I hope that the minister means what she says when she states that we must end the doubt and confusion over whether creative Scotland or Scottish Enterprise will be the lead body. As <place-holder colnum=\"9881\"/> Jeremy Purvis said, we have had a raft of contradictory statements on that, which is not convincing. I reiterate the point that many other members have made that we need clarification on that before stage 2. That debate may reflect the conflict between the objectives of fostering artistic excellence and ensuring economic viability. Those two objectives do not always go together, but it is extremely important that ministers resolve that issue before we move on. Heather Jack, of the Scottish Government's Europe, external affairs and culture directorate told us:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there must be value ... in having a more coherent approach between the bodies\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 30 April 2008; c 897.]</p><p>As Ted Brocklebank rightly said, into that debate must come the role of our universities and local authorities, which are often in the front line in supporting artists who are starting out on their professional careers.</p><p>A second challenge that we face concerns the desire to retain the arm's-length approach by ministers to cultural and artistic direction. The bill properly aspires to ensure that ministers do not interfere in creative Scotland's funding allocation process or in the judgments that affect the overall artistic direction of our national companies. Those judgments must always be reserved for those who have specific knowledge and experience in the relevant areas. We must be mindful of the need to ensure that the bill does not undermine that independence in any way. We need a little clarification of some of the language in the bill in that respect.</p><p>Scotland is blessed with immense talent in our artistic, creative and cultural industries and I have no doubt about the Government's passion&#8212;or that of any political party in the Parliament&#8212;for developing that further.

There is also the instance of Renfrewshire Council, which, as Rhona Brankin said, is scrapping current class size limits in English and maths in S1 and S2 to pay for the new ones in P1 to P3.

It was a life-changing experience, so there is no doubt in my mind that educating youngsters about the Holocaust is not only an important lesson in history but one that is extremely valuable when it comes to understanding the many human conflicts that affect our world today, especially those that are so complex in relation to inequality and racism. As Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Holocaust Educational Trust's Lessons from Auschwitz Course is such a vital part of our work exactly because it gives students the chance to understand more the dangers and potential effects of prejudice and racism today.\"</p><p>I understand why visits to the locations are a far better learning experience than anything that could happen in a classroom, especially when they include hearing real-life accounts from the survivors of the Holocaust. I have been more than persuaded of the need to allow as many pupils as possible from throughout my constituency area to take part in those visits, although I am also clear that how teachers and pupils engage in Holocaust <place-holder colnum=\"9500\"/> education should be a matter for the individual school to decide.

Like the outstanding work that is undertaken by the Holocaust Educational Trust, such a museum could help to ensure a permanent reminder to us all of the horrors of that period in history and, more important, a permanent reminder of the need for reconciliation in future generations. Together with the priceless value of Holocaust education in the school curriculum, that is why such projects are so important for this country's heritage and why the motion, so eloquently moved by Jackson Carlaw, is important both in its praise for what has already been achieved and in relation to what can, I hope, be achieved in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13727654", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Holocaust)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "One of the most moving presentations that I heard during my former career as a teacher was about Auschwitz.

I add school discipline to the topics to which Mr Macintosh referred. Perhaps the decision to hold this debate was to do with the fact that the Government has been taken to task via the <em>Daily Mail</em> by the Scottish Association of Teachers of History for apparently thinking that history teaching, with all its international aspects, is being taught in a rather boring, dry and old-fashioned manner. Who knows? However, I will say something constructive.</p><p>If there was a single reason why Scottish education made such an impact throughout the world in the days when it first established its reputation, it would be its concern for the international community and the role that Scotland had played in the economic, social, political and philosophical development of many nations around the world. The 18<sup>th</sup> century Scottish enlightenment was remarkable for its outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments, which rivalled those of any other nation at any time in history. It was made even more remarkable because it took place in a country that was considered to be one of the more backward <place-holder colnum=\"7892\"/> nations in western Europe. The achievements in philosophy, economics, engineering, architecture, law and so on of people such as Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Robert Burns and Adam Ferguson speak for themselves.</p><p>The effects of the Scottish enlightenment went far beyond Scotland. It was one of the most important forces in ensuring that Scottish education has always been underpinned by a strong international commitment. That commitment, especially in respect of the breadth of interest, has always been a cornerstone of our education system, and there is no question but that it must be maintained and enhanced. If pupils are to become well-educated, rounded human beings, part of the process must be their acquisition of a full awareness and understanding of the global community, and tolerance and respect for the many and varied cultures around the world.</p><p>I turn to Mr Macintosh's amendment. One of the most moving presentations that I heard during my former career as a teacher was on Auschwitz. Many people think that educating youngsters about Auschwitz is extremely important. We have no problem in supporting that principle, but we have a problem with the Labour amendment, because we do not believe that it is up to any Government to decide to ring fence the money that is involved, and we think that it is up to headteachers to make decisions about best experiences. However, I repeat that educating youngsters about Auschwitz can play an important part in their education.</p><p>We have many opportunities to learn from experiences in other parts of the world, which can only be good, whether the Government says that we should learn from China, Malawi or France. Indeed, the Conservatives urge members of the Government to undertake their next international trip to Scandinavia. In Sweden, they will see what happens when headteachers and parents, rather than the Government, are put in control of schools, and in Finland, they might be able to study a system in which pupils start school at seven years old.

He rightly believes that that is especially important in areas where there is a higher percentage of deprivation. For him, the schools of ambition programme was a much-needed lifeline and an essential starting block for expanding excellence in schools. The key words are \"expanding excellence\", particularly in developing the skills that employers value so highly and in allowing schools to realise their objectives according to their own circumstances.</p><p>HMIE was also impressed, and it commented on the highly effective implementation of the programme in several schools. I say frankly to Mr Coffey that it does not matter whether HMIE believes that it is motivation or the whole effort that has gone up&#8212;the fact is that it has increased.</p><p>Given what the Government itself says, what one of our leading businessmen and philanthropists says, and what HMIE says, I am at a total loss to explain how the Government can decide to wind down the schools of ambition programme, which has so far benefited 52 schools, whether now or in three years&#8212;there is a huge debate about what the policy is now. I am <place-holder colnum=\"7177\"/> told that that is being done because the cabinet secretary simply cannot tolerate anything in educational policy that does not meet the standard one-size-fits-all mantra that currently drives the SNP agenda.</p><p>In the introduction to the skills strategy, the cabinet secretary wills us to praise those who are hungry for new skills, but at the same time she is prepared to deprive them of food, simply because she thinks that they have too much of a good thing. That is ridiculous logic and, despite the excitable eloquence of Mr Neil, it is socialism at its worst. It does the cabinet secretary's credibility no good whatsoever if she wants us to accept that she is serious about ambition.</p><p>Surely we should use the highly successful schools of ambition model&#8212;especially as it has worked so effectively in some deprived areas&#8212;to build for the future and to offer much greater choice and diversity in meeting the aspirations of our children. The current comprehensive system has failed to deliver that choice and diversity by its constant obsession with one size fits all and by basing everything on the lowest common denominator.</p><p>Schools of ambition have proved how we can turn things around for some of our weaker performing schools. The programme has proved what happens when schools receive money directly and they, rather than the Government, decide how best to spend it. The staff and pupils of such schools deserve huge credit for what has been achieved. The Government should celebrate that success and not cut off schools in their prime. The Conservatives ask the Government to reverse its decision and do what Sir Tom Hunter wanted: to stop playing politics with our children's education.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401069", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools of Ambition"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When the Government produced its famous skills strategy last autumn, the first part of the foreword by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning was deliberately all about how we could make Scotland a nation of ambition.

However, we firmly believe that its innovation affords us a much-needed opportunity to address several other pressing issues in Scottish education, especially the need to ensure that there is much greater articulation between schools and other educational institutions. It was good to hear that the cabinet secretary agrees that that is needed.</p><p>I heard what the cabinet secretary said about reform of the examination structure. Thank goodness for what she said. However, I give her a word of warning: we need a long overview of the whole structure. We need much greater rigour and the system to be decluttered. Hugh Henry and Margo MacDonald asked accurate questions. We need answers about what will come. If we are to add a Scottish science baccalaureate and a Scottish language baccalaureate, it sounds as though there will be two extra items in a muddled field. In two weeks' time, we will consider with considerable interest what the cabinet secretary announces.</p><p>I hope that the debate was designed to give us the opportunity to stand back and view the direction of Scottish education as a whole unit. In that context, I want to define the merits of the curriculum for excellence and the main challenges that we must embrace if we are to ensure that its benefits move well beyond people's years in formal school education.</p><p>Most people know when they meet somebody who is well educated. Their education shows in the way that they behave, their conversation, their range of interests and the skills that they bring to their occupation. A good education is about far more than passing exams; it is about the qualities that give a person good judgment, strong ethical values and a sense of responsibility as a citizen in a community. Good schools, colleges and universities, strong families and efficient workplaces have always provided mental and <place-holder colnum=\"7067\"/> physical wellbeing, a sharp focus on what really matters in life, and a sense of self-esteem, as they always will. They have always ensured that the individual is able to make a meaningful contribution to the economy. The curriculum for excellence marks a real watershed, from which we will achieve such things or yet more bureaucratic change that is built around spurious targets, with more measurable league tables and endless quantitative assessment that will almost certainly be rejected by a paper-weary profession.</p><p>I commend the architects of the curriculum for excellence for taking the bold step of encouraging teachers to think for themselves instead of being the recipients of Government diktats; for building a curriculum in which flexibility will better serve the individual; and for ensuring that the diversity of local communities and the outdoor environment can be fully utilised in the delivery of school activities. We believe that that message should be echoed by much greater devolution in school management, so that educational decision making is put back into the hands of the professionals who are best able to decide the needs of their individual pupils. Good schools have always done that, but far too often there has been a constraining hand of Government, with the result that there has been an obsession with quantitative measurement and testing.</p><p>At two sessions of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, we heard evidence from various witnesses about the curriculum for excellence. It was noticeable that there was deep concern&#8212;even despair in one quarter&#8212;about the fact that teachers, especially in secondary schools, did not feel that they had been fully engaged in the process of developing the curriculum for excellence or in the careful thinking that is required to ensure that there is a fully coherent exam structure. Last week's edition of <em>The Times Educational Supplement</em> seemed to tell exactly the same story. As one witness put it, the curriculum for excellence is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the biggest change in Scottish education for a generation\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 27 February 2008; c 650.]</p><p>However, it is the one for which we are least prepared.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400900", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start the Scottish Conservatives' contribution to the debate with an unequivocal declaration of support for the curriculum for excellence.

A lot of the debate is about the underlying <place-holder colnum=\"7068\"/> philosophy of the curriculum for excellence, which must be decided at the input stage, not the outcomes stage. We need a little bit more thinking about the delivery of the curriculum for excellence in order to carry the teaching profession along with us. As the minister knows, teachers are committed to the underlying principles, but they want to see how those underlying principles can be broadened out, especially beyond 15 to 18. There are big question marks about how the curriculum will articulate with the exam structure. We will have to wait two weeks to see the new proposed structure.</p><p>I will finish by identifying two crucial areas that must be addressed if we are not to waste our opportunity and deny too many of our children the best possible chance in life. First, we must take up the challenge that is laid down by the curriculum for excellence, which values all pupils, no matter whether their skills lie in vocational or academic subjects or a mix of the two. The curriculum for excellence is serious about that. It ensures greater focus and greater self-discipline&#8212;which a lot of our children are crying out for&#8212;but we must ensure that our educational structure properly caters for and respects those who opt for a more vocational balance.</p><p>Secondly, it is time to grasp the nettle of the clutter and complexity of qualifications. I cannot say it often enough&#8212;it is a clutter. Many employers and parents know that. We must do something about it. We particularly have to do something about the sixth form in Scottish schools. Far too many sixth formers around the country are twiddling their thumbs because, for one reason or another&#8212;sadly, in an increasing number of cases, because of budget cuts&#8212;they are unable to pursue the courses that they want to pursue. That is totally unacceptable.</p><p>It is also important to recognise the growing importance of our further education colleges alongside our universities, for which there is rising demand. It is time to examine properly what we expect from our universities and whether continually widening access at that level is the right answer. There are other options to be considered.</p><p>We have a huge opportunity to get this right, but we need to be far-sighted. We need a vision of Scottish education in its all-round capacity&#8212;not just a vision that suits the economy, but one that promotes a fair-minded and ethical society in which individuals are valued for who they are. We need an education system in which every individual is encouraged to reach for the stars&#8212;with schools of ambition, perhaps&#8212;and in which, every step of the way, we promote excellence rather than the lowest common denominator, which all too often has been the trademark of educational policy.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400900", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to the minister for her intervention, but I do not entirely accept it.

It was an important debate for all sorts of reasons, but perhaps most of all for one question that went largely unreported. I hope that the focus of today's debate will be that question: what is education for?</p><p>Today, I choose to praise the contributions to that earlier debate made by Robin Harper, Margo MacDonald and Peter Peacock, each of whom, in their different ways, dealt with the intrinsic values of education&#8212;an issue that I discussed originally with the headteacher at Crieff high school. In the difficult and, perhaps, perplexing quest for the answer to that question, we need to stand back and ask ourselves from an holistic perspective what we should expect our schools to do.</p><p>I believe that extra-curricular activity&#8212;which is perhaps better named co-curricular activity&#8212;with all its many definitions, should be an integral part of the process. That view is not popular in some quarters. After all, extra-curricular activity is not measurable in the same way as the scores in a maths test or the A passes that the Scottish Qualifications Authority awards are. There is no national framework for such activity, which often appears on a school timetable only because of the personal and voluntary interests of an enthusiastic member of staff, not because it has been forced on the school by the strictures of the normal curriculum. Extra-curricular activity is often time consuming and irregular in terms of time allocation, and it does not lend itself to inclusion in league tables. Thank goodness for that, as I do not believe that such activity can or should be <place-holder colnum=\"5819\"/> condemned to obsessive quantitative measurement.</p><p>Extra-curricular activities can be more important and more enriching than what I dare to call the run-of-the-mill education in the classroom, important though that is. I believe firmly that part of that quality is the deeply personal experience that the individuals who take part in it encounter. Some of my most rewarding days as a teacher were spent many miles away from the classroom, on the mountains beside Loch Ossian or in Wester Ross, working with children who had been taken well outside their comfort zone&#8212;I, too, was outside my comfort zone&#8212;and learning how to survive in an environment that was totally alien but richly educative. There are many thousands of teachers in Scotland just like me.</p><p>In the build-up to this debate, I was privileged to receive a huge response from the many groups and schools who do outstanding work in the area. I take this opportunity, as I did when I submitted their names to the press this morning, to put on record the debt that the Parliament and all Scotland owes them for the work they do, especially with children who may be denied such opportunities elsewhere.</p><p>It is impossible in seven minutes to do justice to all of that work, but I will summarise the essential qualities that it brings. It enables young people to take decisions in difficult situations, builds confidence and self-esteem, helps them to understand what commitment and responsibility mean, teaches them to work in teams&#8212;which is not always the most popular theme these days but is fundamental to the successful development of young people's skills&#8212;and, perhaps most important of all, allows them to start out on the journey of finding their inner selves. The groups that help children in that way do as much for our young people's social and spiritual well-being as anything else, which is a priceless asset in this day and age.</p><p>I have lodged the motion for the simple reason that I do not believe that enough of our youngsters are able to experience such activities and that many of those who do are unable to experience them for a prolonged period, when the benefits are at their greatest. Whether the school that someone attends offers such opportunities is often a lottery; extra-curricular activity does not feature as a top priority for far too many people in education officialdom.</p><p>I understand why. There is no doubt that one of the most damaging influences on such activity is the increasing reluctance of teachers, especially headteachers, to take responsibility for ensuring that pupils are able to participate in it. We are told that the risks are far too great and that the effort is not worth it, if one considers the mountain of <place-holder colnum=\"5820\"/> paperwork and potential litigation that goes with it. My extensive questioning of those involved suggests that, sadly, that has become a major issue. I have great sympathy for them, but it will be an indictment of education if we decide that there is nothing we can do about the matter. Have we really arrived at the stage of allowing political correctness and the doom merchants to override our logic and deep-rooted educational values?</p><p>I fully appreciate that there is no easy answer, but I believe that, as well as encouraging all headteachers to ensure that they have a diverse and extensive extra-curricular programme in their schools, we as parliamentarians have an obligation to ensure that the legislation that covers risk is as simple and straightforward, and as supportive, as possible. We need clear guidelines that are based on common sense rather than bureaucracy. Above all, they should be based on the good practice of practitioners rather than of civil servants or people who have never been out on a hill or in a canoe. One of the difficulties that we face when it comes to extra-curricular activity is that that has often not been the case.</p><p>The Scottish National Party manifesto made it clear that the Government believes that every child has the opportunity to experience the extra-curricular domain. As a politician who is a former teacher, I am passionate about the responsibilities that we have in that regard. With the exciting prospects that the curriculum for excellence offers, we now have the opportunity to enshrine such activities in the curriculum for every young person in Scotland, and I firmly believe that we can do so at a relatively low cost.</p><p>As I said in my opening remarks, extra-curricular activities are worth their weight in gold when it comes to what real education is all about. Depriving pupils of that experience deprives Scotland of the ability to make the best use of the undoubted talents of our young people. As parliamentarians, we have an obligation to do something about that state of affairs.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397735", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Outdoor Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Earlier this month, the chamber debated the educational challenges that confront Scottish schools.

However, as Rhona Brankin said, the school estate plays a large part in determining an environment that is conducive to learning and which fosters good discipline and a sense of pride in the community. Just look at the <place-holder colnum=\"5683\"/> positive responses this week in Dumfries and Galloway and Perth and Kinross as new school buildings have opened or embarked on the first stage of the construction process. An attractive, clean, well-heated and spacious building plus an attractive, eco-friendly and energy-efficient campus can do a huge amount not only to boost the performance of a school, but to instil a sense of pride and common purpose. Therefore, it is only right that the building and maintenance of the school estate is a priority.</p><p>Schools these days are used increasingly by pupils and teachers and by members of the local community. That is greatly to be encouraged, but it brings added pressures and costs. It is therefore extremely important that we take into account the diverse uses and the multipurpose nature of schools as we debate the appropriate use of resources and finance. We want our schools to be well built, to make efficient use of scarce resources and to provide best value for money. Those issues should be matters of economics and social welfare, not political dogma. The decision on which route to take to satisfy the criteria should be made on a project-by-project basis, as there is no one right way in which to build a school, nor is there always only one appropriate source of finance. So, in our view, quality outcomes demand flexibility in the system.</p><p>In that respect, the Conservatives are proud to have devised the private finance initiative. Together with the public-private partnerships that were constructed by the Labour and Liberal Executive, the PFI has met the urgent need for the construction of school and other public buildings, which capital grants from the Government or traditional prudential borrowing by local authorities could not have done. Another substantial benefit of PPP/PFI has been the transfer of the risk of maintaining schools to the contractor, thereby leaving local authorities to concentrate on the vital task of providing education services, rather than being preoccupied with bricks and mortar. Local authorities have become increasingly used to the system and are now far better placed to avoid any mishandled tendering and the consequent unnecessary costs that occurred with some projects in the past.</p><p>For some projects, up-front financing from capital or conventional borrowing might be a better option than a PPP or PFI scheme. The SNP has made much of its Scottish futures trust as a preferred finance option. We would not rule out a version of that, if the aim was to increase flexibility in the system so that the much-needed rebuilding or refurbishment of individual schools can take place without the need to wait for a uniform scheme to be put in place to redevelop a whole local authority school estate in one phase. However, it is incumbent on the SNP to come to <place-holder colnum=\"5684\"/> the Parliament urgently with a full statement to provide the details of its proposal, because the current signals reflect confusion and indecision.</p><p>Before the election, the SNP seemed to suggest that the Scottish futures trust would mirror the American-style trusts, in which investors can invest in public infrastructure bonds on a not-for-profit basis. However, following the election, perhaps&#8212;just perhaps&#8212;as a result of the warnings of economists and legal experts that there could be complications in relation to tax liability and the operation of the policy in relation to the Scotland Act 1998, the proposals seem to have been watered down considerably. Any delay in making such a statement to Parliament would, by definition, mean more uncertainty and confusion, especially for those who want the go-ahead to build new schools.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397251", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: School Buildings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I think we agreed yesterday, first and foremost, the quality of the teaching profession is what matters in education.

A teacher put the matter firmly into focus by telling me, \"History educates people; politics usually destroys them.\" I leave it to members to decide which subject I chose.</p><p>The debate has been good. I want to put it on the record that there is no need to convert the Scottish Conservatives to the importance of Scottish history and the subject's inclusion in the Scottish curriculum and SQA examinations. Scottish history's rich diversity and our deep-rooted links with many other parts of the world, to which Dr Macdonald referred, are good reasons to study the subject but, in addition, all people in Scotland should learn Scottish history, because by doing so we become much better equipped to understand ourselves, where we came from and the complexities of our cultural, economic and social heritage.</p><p>Tom Devine has written that Scottish history is a subject</p><p class=\"indent\">\"of enormous dynamism and relevance\".</p><p>Scottish history also provides the necessary insight into many other academic disciplines. Without a good understanding of Scottish history, our understanding of our nation is at best incomplete and at worst insular and sectarian. Jeremy Purvis alluded to that.</p><p>Tom Devine has made the valid point that the erosion of Scottish history teaching began with the insistence of some education zealots that there would be a place for history on the curriculum only if it was shared with geography and modern studies. As a result, history was no longer part of the compulsory curriculum beyond the second year. I agree with Tom Devine's analysis, but I add that that approach coincided with a belief on the part of the same zealots that skills were far more important that knowledge. Knowledge, whether it was about dates or anything else, was thought to be boring and irrelevant; skills were much more important, so it was incumbent on all teachers to change their methods. Perhaps there was a need for change, but the pendulum swung far too far. In many cases, children and teachers were left confused by an emphasis on skills that was not always accompanied by the knowledge that is necessary if people are to make best use of their skills.</p><p>Conventional wisdom was again challenged by people who thought that history could be taught only in the context of concepts, such as war, industrialisation or revolution. Such an approach is fascinating at university and postgraduate level, but how can we expect children to understand events that are not put into chronological context? Great damage has been done to the teaching of <place-holder colnum=\"5618\"/> history in our classrooms by the obsession with skills to the detriment of knowledge and by the absence of chronology.</p><p>As the minister said, the curriculum for excellence is one of the most exciting things on the education horizon. I do not mean this in a political context&#8212;that is surprising for me&#8212;but at long last we appear to be taking seriously the need to ensure that what we teach is relevant to the lives of young people, so that they can understand their responsibilities and have the appropriate knowledge to understand who they are and how their nation has been shaped. Scottish history must be part of that process. However, as Kenneth Macintosh and Murdo Fraser said&#8212;and, as Duncan Tom said in <em>The Scotsman</em>&#8212;it is vital that Scottish history is put firmly in its context. We must never succumb to the trite and inaccurate characteristics of \"Braveheart\" history.</p><p>Scotland has a proud history; we need no contortion, twist or attempt to alter our past. Our pupils deserve to learn Scottish history. Whether they are being taught about Bonnie Prince Charlie or Mary, Queen of Scots, they deserve to be taught by evidence, not myth.

It is therefore vital that the large proportion of local government activity should be underpinned by constructive greener politics. Of course, that has a major implication for many of our higher education institutions.</p><p>Without any question, there is an issue for schools, universities and colleges. As has already <place-holder colnum=\"5469\"/> been said, they can be the driving force. In the first instance, it is vital that they understand the bigger picture and are provided with a clear statement of the objectives or targets that they are expected to meet, of the initiatives that they can adopt and of how government at whatever level can help them. In that respect, it is important that all action to change our attitudes on climate change is based on sound scientific reasoning. There should be a clear understanding of the level of commitment&#8212;especially of financial resources&#8212;that will be required both to ensure the success of green projects and to find the appropriate incentive for essential economic growth. I am all too well aware of the different tensions that pull in opposite directions.</p><p>Clearly, budget spending in the area is extremely tight. On top of that, our educational institutions in Scotland face major difficulties in funding their basic teaching duties&#8212;which, as we know, are already under considerable strain&#8212;as well as in finding adequate resources to address the green agenda.</p><p>People &amp; Planet and its go green campaign have done a huge amount to highlight the problem, but there will have to be a much wider debate on the need to balance an extremely ambitious&#8212;sometimes overambitious&#8212;set of green targets with the academic priorities of institutions and the needs of the rest of the economy.</p><p>If anything was thrown up by the recent good but controversial debate about AI Gore and the Oscar-winning \"An Inconvenient Truth\", it was the need to keep hold of the true perspective&#8212;arousing the powerful emotive responses that are required to change our attitudes, while at the same time ensuring that policy is based on scientific fact. On that front, results from the green agenda will be important.</p><p>In summing up, I will give a brief list of what I think we have to do better. First, we should not overlook the role of our universities and colleges and their outstanding research into technological innovations that are aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of mankind's activities.

The unit would allow local food producers to serve the <place-holder colnum=\"5470\"/> institutions and therefore reduce the carbon footprint.</p><p>People &amp; Planet's intentions are admirable, and it has done a huge amount of work for which it deserves great praise.

As a regional member for the area, I am acutely aware of DARA Almondbank's important role as a world-class centre of excellence and as part of the fabric of the local economy, as Roseanna Cunningham said. DARA provides the expertise and ability to strip completely, replace, repair and rebuild everything, from systems, components and equipment to whole aircraft, for military and commercial organisations. As Roseanna Cunningham outlined, it has an impressive record in providing component support for the Sea King and Tornado aircraft, which has rightly given it an unparalleled national and international reputation. Over the years, DARA Almondbank has achieved state-of-the-art status and I join Roseanna Cunningham in paying tribute to the outstanding professionalism of all those who work at the site.</p><p>Everyone knows that the helicopter forces are among the most pressed of our military resources in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because insufficient numbers of helicopters are available&#8212;as evidenced by the recent hurried Government decisions to buy six Merlins from Denmark and to convert eight Chinooks that had been intended for special forces into so-called standard configuration&#8212;those that are being deployed at present are being used at a rate that is far in excess of what was planned. Scottish Conservatives therefore support the retention of DARA Almondbank so that, at this critical time, the expertise that is available to Her Majesty's forces is in no way impaired.</p><p>Although our first concern must be for the national interest, we want the site to develop a strong future within Scotland's manufacturing industry. There is no doubt that the closure of DARA Almondbank or any scaling down of operations at the site would have a devastating effect on the Perthshire economy. We must approach the issue of how best to provide for DARA's future in the United Kingdom with that in mind. It is clear from Roseanna Cunningham's comments that the activities that DARA Almondbank currently undertakes will continue to be required to provide essential services to our military capabilities, especially when there is a <place-holder colnum=\"5280\"/> growing need for those military capabilities to be enhanced to meet the extensive demands of our foreign policy. The challenge therefore is to ensure that the potential is achieved not only in the short term but in the long term.</p><p>The UK Government's indecision over DARA is unacceptable. It cannot be right to put in jeopardy a vital support operation when our troops are engaged in some of the most demanding military operations since world war 2. The great uncertainty that that poses for the workforce in Perthshire is likely to undermine the workers' morale as they do their very best to provide support for our troops on the front line.</p><p>The role played by DARA in the supply of helicopters to the front line is critical, and the military logistics that it provides are pivotal. Our front-line forces are currently at full stretch. They need to be confident that the essential back-up is in place. DARA Almondbank has demonstrated on many occasions that it can meet the challenge.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives welcome any moves designed to make the logistics back-up for our armed forces more efficient. We shall resist any measures that so cut our logistics capability that they starve the front line of vital support.</p><p>It is vital that SNP ministers are in close contact with the MOD on this and other defence issues that are important to the Perthshire economy.

They have had remarkable success in combining good teachers with the right teaching methods, high expectations and good discipline for pupils right across the ability range. There is a lesson to be learned from that.</p><p>A second interesting finding in the report is the fact that the attainment gap in Scotland begins to develop in earnest in primary 5, rather than in earlier years, which is sometimes assumed to be educational wisdom. The attainment gap gets bigger when children are aged around 10. If the problem continues to worsen in the early years of secondary school, that is an important lesson about where remedial help is most required.</p><p>The report's third important finding is that our curriculum and its accompanying exam structure do not currently serve the best interests of our pupils. Although there are many exciting developments in the curriculum for excellence, especially the initiative to ensure that education is about developing a well-rounded and responsible citizen, as well as one who is fit for the workforce, there is a key message in the OECD report that our system is failing too many youngsters. It is failing them because it is not providing enough focus for those who do not wish to pursue a purely academic career. I know that the Government is interested in developing that line of thinking.</p><p>The public exam system needs to be simplified, to be made much more rigorous and to put greater emphasis on basic competence in literacy and numeracy than it does at present. As we have said before, we entirely agree with the OECD that there needs to be a much more radical approach to vocational opportunities.</p><p>It is my contention that public exams should continue to start in secondary 4. Standard grades should be replaced by an exam that takes on board the best of the current intermediate 2 courses and puts much heavier focus on the use of literacy and numeracy. If that means that pupils take slightly fewer but more rigorous exams at that stage, so be it. The Scottish higher, which by and large retains its place as a highly respected qualification, remains the focus for the end of S5 and, therefore, the basis for university and college entrance, but we need to think about what happens post higher. The advanced higher, which is an excellent exam in many cases, far superior in <place-holder colnum=\"5064\"/> some areas to the English A-level, is not being taught in enough schools, and the danger is that universities will soon start to disregard its worth. During the Christmas holidays, there were many calls on that issue. I hope that the Government will take up the cause of listening to what people are saying about reform of the exam. The debate about a Scottish baccalaureate is still to be had.</p><p>Finally, I come to the OECD recommendation that schools should have more autonomy in their governance. Members will not be surprised when I say that Conservative members are delighted to hear that, because if there is one fundamental problem that is holding back the whole system, it is the straitjacket of central control, which pays no heed to regional differences, the needs of different types of schools or the needs of individual pupils. Conservative members believe that standards in schools will improve only if we put control back into the hands of the professionals on the front line and take it away from the bureaucrats. The same is true of all other public services.</p><p>The OECD has said some extremely important things about what Scottish schools do well, and rightly so. However, it has also said a lot about the important challenges that we face. It is incumbent on all members of the Parliament, including members of the Government, to address those specific challenges without further delay. I have pleasure in moving amendment S3M-1131.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"further notes that the report's key challenge to Scottish schools is to make them work consistently well and equitably and that this outcome is dependent upon greater autonomy within school management, much greater emphasis within the curriculum on basic skills in English and mathematics and greater opportunities for pupils to follow vocational opportunities.\"</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries: \"Reviews of National Policies for Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am saying that background does not necessarily determine performance, although of course it can have a big impact.

If anyone needs proof of what they do, they only need pick up a copy of the local newspaper to read about all the various activities that take place throughout the community, whether it be building mountain paths&#8212;maybe not quite on the scale of Everest, but they have been doing it in Perthshire&#8212;or delivering the Christmas post at a very competitive price.</p><p>The role that the scouting movement plays in the development of our young people can never be overlooked. From the learning stages of the beavers at age six through cubs to scouts to scout explorers and on up to age 25, it is an impressive framework in which to develop the well-rounded young people of tomorrow. Sadly, too many people now seem desperate to wrap our young people in cotton wool and keep them away from life's challenges.

We are happy to support the motion this afternoon, given the Government's determination to pursue that strategy's main objectives. The importance of the issue cannot be overestimated, as Mary Mulligan said, nor can the need for cross-party effort to take significant steps to address the need for greater provision and better care for some of the most vulnerable children in Scotland.</p><p>In difficult situations where children cannot live with their parents, we fully appreciate that they usually want to live with a family member or friend under kinship care, or, if that is not possible, in a family environment with appropriate foster care, rather than in a residential establishment. In our view, such placements usually give the child the best chance of overcoming the disruption and stress that they had to face in coming to terms with their previous circumstances. There is likely to be more stability and continuity in kinship or foster care, both of which are major factors in developing new confidence and self-esteem.</p><p>However, we also recognise that in some cases, perhaps when the child has been severely scarred by an experience at home, or if they require intensive specialist health care or educational support, residential care plays an important role. Whatever route is taken, it is imperative that the child's best interests come first in their educational development and their social and economic integration.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have advocated a national system of kinship care allowances, a national system of fostering allowances and more <place-holder colnum=\"4093\"/> careful allocation of placements. We have also expressed concern that the provision of care varies widely throughout the country. Areas of significant shortages and poor practice persist, so it is good to hear that the Government is trying to address them.</p><p>We are most concerned by the overall growth in demand for vital services and the question mark over whether the present funding arrangements are adequate. Professor Arthur Midwinter flagged up his concern about the funding shortfall between the provision of grant-aided expenditure and local authorities' spending on core social care for children. The Government has made provision for some extra funding. We welcome the announcement that was made in the past 24 hours. There will be some transfer to local authorities, but the budget's 17.7 per cent reduction in funding for child care services over the next three years raises serious questions, as Mary Mulligan said, about how we can finance all the changes when demand is growing so quickly. More important, Professor Midwinter flagged up the need to tie the overall policy objectives to financial arrangements much more coherently than they are at present. We urge the Government to debate that point fully.</p><p>Everyone recognises the importance of a child's first placement. If it works well, it increases the chance that the child will develop confidently and will have the maximum security and permanence during their time in foster or kinship care. Thus, the assessment processes that the young person and the prospective foster or kinship carer undergo before the placement is decided are crucial. The bodies that are responsible for matching children with care arrangements&#8212;local authorities and independent fostering agencies&#8212;must continually review their procedures and make the area a priority for the deployment of their best qualified and most experienced staff.</p><p>The previous Administration made the sensible suggestion that the child should be more involved in the choice of placement. It is good to hear that the Government is also approaching the matter in a child-centred way.</p><p>Obviously, once a placement is made, it is essential that the relevant parties have an opportunity to agree the care plan for the child, under the supervision of a lead professional. The child needs to feel entirely confident that all the key people are involved, just as the team needs to feel confident that there are strong links between the child, family members and the members of the professional bodies. That is a matter not only of trust, but of adequate resources and, increasingly these days, adequate funding. The social care sector has had to put up with increasing expectations from Government, therefore <place-holder colnum=\"4094\"/> Parliament has a duty to clarify the role that it expects kinship and foster care to play and to ensure that carers are fully supported.</p><p>It is vital to recognise the growing importance of the kinship role&#8212;I am pleased by the Government's announcement in that respect&#8212;and the need to remove some of the barriers that currently affect its status. Only 12 of the 32 local authorities pay the main categories of kinship carers the same basic allowance that they pay foster carers. A further 10 local authorities pay a fraction of that allowance&#8212;usually only around a third. That seems grossly unfair.</p><p>What matters most are the best interests of the child and the achievement of a workable and effective balance between family and state support. That latter issue is never going to be easy, given the conflicting influences that can sometimes cloud the matter in defining where final responsibilities should lie, especially in an age when vulnerable children face increasingly complex problems.

We have a beautiful country that has some of the finest scenery in the world&#8212;notwithstanding the rain, the mist or the midges&#8212;and which offers a wealth of opportunity to exploit rewarding outdoor activities. In addition, there is the warmth of a traditional Scottish welcome and its accompanying hospitality&#8212;which Mr Allan did not experience&#8212;the lure of several world-class historical sites and entertainment centres, and the potential that exists to develop many of our resources that have such a distinctive Scottish brand, as David Stewart and David Thompson mentioned.</p><p>A successful tourism industry matters not only from the economic and social perspective, however. If we marshal our resources effectively, it should play a large part in the feel-good factor that applies to Scotland's role in the global community. If I may be allowed to be slightly less compassionate for a moment, I firmly believe that a much more integrated approach must be adopted&#8212;one that combines a clear and coherent strategy for all the related businesses and stakeholders. From listening carefully to the views of various stakeholders in the tourism industry, including representatives of local tourist boards, two chambers of commerce and people who are on the front line of service delivery, I know that there are many good tourism initiatives around the country&#8212;many of which have been mentioned&#8212;that are not always co-ordinated or publicised in the most effective manner. It is good to hear that the minister is aware of that.</p><p>In addition, as Gavin Brown and Nanette Milne said, there are concerns that in some areas, we do not seem to be attracting the footfall of tourists that we had hoped for. On that point, although Patricia Ferguson would like to take the credit for the increase in the number of international visitors to Scotland in 2005-06, she will share our concern about the decrease in the overall number of visitors in that period.</p><p>I have read the manifesto of the Scottish Tourism Forum, which points to three fundamental failings in the current set-up, the first of which relates to the difficulties with the transport infrastructure. Those failings deserve more attention than has been paid to them this morning. Nanette Milne flagged up the fact that the position on their map that Flybe gives to Inverness does <place-holder colnum=\"3921\"/> not help matters. Equally unhelpful is the situation on the west Highland line, whereby one arrives in Oban on a train, only to find that the ferry to Barra and South Uist left a few minutes before the train got in. That is not about new infrastructure, but about better organisation. The point has been made that it would not happen in Switzerland or France.</p><p>The STF also highlights the fact that many jobs in tourism are not particularly well paid and it identifies technology problems in the sector. We must take all those issues seriously. Again, it was heartening to hear that the minister is trying to address them.</p><p>As Gavin Brown said, the biggest challenge that we face is the need to find a coherent national strategy that will also allow for plenty localism when it comes to making best use of our resources in the diverse parts of the country. On that front, we would have deep concerns if the Government's new strategy was driven only by the desire for greater centralisation. We need more detail on how we can make best use of the local diversity that enriches the tourism experience in this country. Assurances must be given that there will be effective forums across the country that will allow full representation of organisations that are on the front line, whether they are small businesses, large enterprises or local services such as tourist information offices. Worryingly, too many stakeholders point to concerns about the replacement of the area tourist boards with VisitScotland hubs, especially given the proposed decrease in the number of hubs.</p><p>What must be done? First, there is an issue about management of the industry. Under the previous structure, tourism operatives were members of a tourist board and had ownership of the body to which they paid their fees. They had a direct say in what went on and a vote in the election of local board members. The new model moves away from that set-up to a much more centralised structure. As I mentioned, it is worrying that the number of hubs will be reduced to six. Instead of being partners, tourism operatives will become clients who must buy services from their tourist board. We worry about how much that might curtail the driving force of the private sector, which is so crucial to the industry.</p><p>Some of the most successful tourism initiatives have been in areas where local businesses have combined effectively to take advantage of local resources and changing signals from the market. We should not forget about the huge importance of local services, particularly those that are provided by tourist information centres. Although TICs are having to adapt to changing needs, they are still central to provision of effective services, in <place-holder colnum=\"3922\"/> the same way that local post offices and other such public facilities are.</p><p>There is an unequivocal case for a better transport infrastructure with much greater linkage between routes and better planning of existing connections. We support the reduction in business rates&#8212;although we firmly believe that it should happen in the next financial year rather than be phased in over a three-year period. We are fully aware that lower business rates are only part of the answer, but if we are to ensure that small businesses have a first-class future, such a policy will be welcome.</p><p>I finish by returning to the Conservative amendment. We must strive for the improvement we know Scotland can deliver. We must be ambitious&#8212;it is important to recognise that we are talking about an ambition rather than a target.

Because of the situation, the Conservatives want a child benefit system that more heavily supports families with children in the age range zero to two, when costs are often at <place-holder colnum=\"2859\"/> their highest and are, in many cases, prohibitive if one parent wishes to stay at home.</p><p>Besides that, it is important to remind ourselves of the Government's appropriate role, namely that it should support, not interfere. Thousands of parents in Scotland are perfectly capable of bringing up their families successfully, and they should be able to get on with it without the burden of a nanny state. So when we use the phrase \"early intervention\", let us be specific about the terms of reference: it is a relevant and appropriate description when it refers to the additional support for those families who genuinely need it&#8212;there are many of them&#8212;but it is not appropriate if it relates to developing a one-size-fits-all strategy that dictates how every child should be brought up.</p><p>Frankly, that is what is wrong with some aspects of SNP policy, and it is most clearly exemplified in its universal or one-size-fits-all policy of reducing class sizes in primaries 1 to 3 even when that cannot be funded properly and it is not the appropriate priority.

As Peter Peacock has just said, flooding can have deep psychological and social effects as well as the obvious economic costs. Those costs amounted to something in the region of &#163;40 million in the case of the Tay and Strathearn floods in 1993. It is obvious that flood management is hugely important, but the Government is absolutely right to stress that the sense of urgency is increased because of recent climate change trends. We should be under no illusions about the dangers of delaying new legislation.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already indicated that it takes flooding extremely seriously, and its proposal for a new flood prevention bill for Scotland is to be warmly welcomed. I hope that work can begin immediately on investigating best practice in other parts of the world and on ensuring that we have a comprehensive understanding of the complex science that underlies flood prevention. Clearly, a variety of interested stakeholder groups wish to participate in the debate, and the facilities to allow such participation should be put in place as soon as possible.</p><p>That said, the key focus has to be on responsibility&#8212;first, responsibility for what happens when flooding takes place, and secondly, responsibility for flood prevention. Scotland needs national legislation that clearly identifies where the responsibilities lie in both cases, and it should be in language that is familiar to the general public as well as to the scientists and technical experts.</p><p>As members are fully aware, Perth and Kinross Council faced severe criticism from many residents in Milnathort for its response to the flooding chaos. That criticism has now prompted a full investigation into where the different responsibilities should lie. Perth and Kinross Council has taken matters very seriously indeed, as is evident from the paper that its enterprise and infrastructure committee produced in August. It is absolutely right to initiate procedures to not only investigate what went wrong but put in place measures to improve transparency and accountability.</p><p>With that in mind, it is important to recognise that the primary responsibility for ensuring that water is kept out of a property lies with the property owner or occupier. That is not always recognised by the individuals concerned. It is therefore the owner's responsibility to undertake precautionary measures, and in particular to ensure that their property is adequately covered by their insurers. That is particularly important in light of the fact that the costs incurred by the insurance industry after the recent UK floods were <place-holder colnum=\"1935\"/> sufficiently high to make the industry re-examine its commitment to provide full insurance cover. Incidentally, such cover is not always available in other countries. Measures will be successful only if the other parties involved in flood prevention are fully responsible and accountable in that role, so that insurers have confidence that they are not the only people to carry the economic cost.</p><p>The new bill must concentrate on that aspect of policy, and it must do so in three main areas. First, it must streamline the decision-making process to allow a much more holistic approach to be taken throughout the UK. As things stand at present, a large number of groups are involved in flood management and prevention, and it may take time to rationalise that structure so that responsibilities are more clearly defined and there is less scope for buck passing.</p><p>Secondly, the science that is relevant to flooding is changing all the time, which inevitably means that an important debate has to take place to find the appropriate balance between soft and hard engineering defences. That will undoubtedly involve additional resources.</p><p>Thirdly, if we are to continue to place on the individual the primary responsibility for keeping water out of their property, emphasis must be placed on assisting responsible landowners and punishing those who default. Huge amounts of money can be involved&#8212;to say nothing of the amount of work that is required&#8212;in maintaining efficient defences. Flood management will therefore not be successful unless individual landowners are able to recognise and deal with their responsibilities.</p><p>I said at the beginning that no one needs reminding of the horrors that flooding can bring.

Both are needed so that the impact of proposals on different <place-holder colnum=\"1897\"/> communities and local environments can be accurately assessed.</p><p>At the early meetings that I attended at Crieff community hall and Kinbuck community hall, Scottish and Southern Energy gave us specific assurances that extensive research on the proposals had been undertaken, that there had been a comprehensive consultation process involving local authorities, interest groups and the general public, and that sufficient work had been undertaken to ensure that the proposals were consistent with Government regulations and land use policy. However, in time, it became clear that the conduct of the inquiry was falling well short of public expectations and the democratic process. Members of the public were frequently left without complete information. In particular, written records of meetings were absent; there seemed to be no flexibility within the timetable for hearing important evidence; and access to a great deal of information seemed to be limited to internet access. Those difficulties&#8212;particularly the lack of written records of deliberations&#8212;were exacerbated by the meetings being held across a wide geographical area, which made it difficult for the public to keep up to date with what was going on.

That seems to be grossly unfair when it is set against Scottish and Southern Energy's application to the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets to be reimbursed to the tune of &#163;7 million from electricity customers throughout the UK.</p><p>In short, there seems to have been anything but a public inquiry.

I say to Mr Neil that, today, I am beginning to wonder.</p><p>At the time, I was a bit puzzled that the Scottish Executive, as it was known back in May, gave so little time to debating education and skills. That seemed particularly odd, given that the SNP's two flagship policies of removing the graduate endowment and reducing class sizes for all primary 1 to 3 pupils were hailed as top priorities for the Administration, and were trailed in the press and the SNP manifesto as such. Was the explanation that there were so many other priorities on the agenda that education was beginning to be squeezed out, or was it that the Administration had woken up to the fact that some <place-holder colnum=\"1689\"/> of its manifesto pledges were already hostages to fortune?</p><p>Like Labour, the Conservatives have grave misgivings about the SNP's ability to deal with the real issues that currently affect education in Scotland. I begin with the wrong-headed policy of abandoning the graduate endowment, which&#8212;as Hugh Henry rightly said&#8212;will do nothing to secure better funding for our further and higher education institutions so that they can maintain both the highest possible standards of teaching and research and an important level playing field for students throughout the United Kingdom.</p><p>The cabinet secretary must be aware of our universities' concern that they will be unable to maintain their international reputations if they lose staff and resources to better-funded universities south of the border. She must&#8212;I hope&#8212;question the wisdom of a policy that, instead of putting money into the system, will in fact take it out. We repeat our demand that she should establish an independent review of higher education as soon as possible, to convince colleges and universities that we are taking the matter seriously.</p><p>Secondly, the policy of a universal reduction in class sizes to 18 for all pupils in primaries 1 to 3 is simply not sustainable and should not be paraded as a one-size-fits-all panacea that will drive up educational standards in the first three school years. Although it is true that reducing class sizes can, in some instances, help to improve both educational standards and discipline, that is by no means a universal assumption that can be made about every school in the land, and it should not be the Government's role to decide on class sizes and what is best for individual pupils in individual schools. That should be a matter for the head teacher, and I know that many teachers and parents throughout Scotland agree.</p><p>Effective learning is, first and foremost, about good teaching in a calm and disciplined environment. There are many circumstances in which parents would opt to have their child taught in a slightly bigger class if it meant better teaching, better discipline and better access to a better school. There is by no means always a direct correlation between lower class sizes and better attainment, so the cabinet secretary must acknowledge that a one-size-fits-all policy is not the best way forward. It is increasingly out of date, and it is out of tune with the need for more diversity in education.</p><p>Last Thursday at First Minister's questions, I raised my concerns about the ability of local authorities to deliver that policy. I cited some estimated costs from Perth and Kinross&#8212;incidentally, an SNP and Liberal council&#8212;which says that it cannot put the policy into operation. No sooner had I raised those points than the council <place-holder colnum=\"1690\"/> administrations in both Glasgow and Edinburgh told the cabinet secretary that they, too, will not be able to deliver on the policy, given the resources that she is proposing to make available.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387288", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I first entered this Parliament as an inexperienced member a few months ago, one of the wise old heads, in the form of Mr Alex Neil, told me that it would be a different experience from the classroom.

Discipline is the most important issue currently affecting our schools, and I believe that parents, teachers and the wider public would agree with that. I ask the cabinet secretary again, as I did on 20 June, to place the improvement of school discipline at the very top of the school agenda. Without scaremongering&#8212;and I stress that point&#8212;and without taking anything away from the excellent teaching that goes on across Scotland all the time, I say that head teachers must be given the appropriate powers to deal with unruly pupils. In my opinion, those pupils should not be allowed back into the classroom until they have learnt how to behave.

In that respect, it is good that a skills strategy is now a priority on the Government's agenda.</p><p>As my colleagues Murdo Fraser and Derek Brownlee have said, the Conservatives will support the basic principles behind the cabinet secretary's announcement. We especially recognise the need for a much more coherent and consistent approach in delivering skills training. However, we believe that the strategy, as it stands, does not go nearly far enough in dealing with some of the fundamental issues. We therefore seek to use this opportunity to receive assurances from the cabinet secretary that she will address those issues as a matter of considerable urgency in the next few months.</p><p>First, with regard to basic skills in literacy and numeracy, the cabinet secretary has correctly identified that there is a need for far higher standards. That is self-evident from the worrying statistics on the number of Scottish school children&#8212;and, in some cases, university graduates&#8212;who leave education unable to meet the requirements of employers. Does the cabinet secretary accept that the situation will improve <place-holder colnum=\"1626\"/> only if there is even greater emphasis on the three Rs in the primary 7 and secondary 1 and 2 curricula? Does she also accept that there must be much greater rigour in the school examination system to consolidate those basic skills?</p><p>The cabinet secretary will be only too aware of the fact that many people in the teaching profession&#8212;and, sadly, many employers&#8212;are deeply concerned about the dumbing down of the knowledge content of exams and about the fact that pupils can arrive at the end of their school careers without the necessary skills to move into a 21<sup>st</sup> century workplace. The sizeable amount of money that Scottish businesses must spend from their training budgets on remedial training rather than on training for new skills is evidence of just how serious the problem is.</p><p>On the same theme, I urge the cabinet secretary to ensure that there is absolutely no slippage in the timescale for the curriculum for excellence, which is, as she says, an exciting new challenge for Scottish schools in dealing with many aspects of broadening the skills base and the adult responsibilities that go with that. In my view, the curriculum for excellence has much to offer Scotland. It is essential that subject teachers be given the necessary assurances that resources and information will be given as soon as possible to allow them to develop their own areas. If we can get the balance right between greater rigour in the exam system, which is much needed, and the creation of imaginative and responsible citizens, which is the vision behind the curriculum for excellence, the skills strategy will have a far greater chance of success.</p><p>Secondly, we believe that we should go much further down the road to formal vocational training and apprenticeships. We welcome the cabinet secretary's moves to improve the links between schools and colleges although it is, ultimately, merely tinkering at the edges. Will the cabinet secretary agree to consider the practice of other European countries of allowing pupils to leave school at 14 if they and their teachers accept that pursuit of an academic curriculum is neither appropriate nor relevant? Learning a trade or a craft should never be regarded as being somehow inferior to an academic education. It is time to recognise that far more youngsters would be much more able to get a meaningful focus if they were able to harness their talents outside an academic classroom. That would also go a long way towards dealing with the growing number of young people in the NEET category.</p><p>The key point is that we must ensure that the skills that are fostered are the most appropriate for the jobs that are available. We should be mindful of the 8 per cent of vacancies in the workplace that remain unfilled because applicants do not <place-holder colnum=\"1627\"/> have the necessary skills, qualifications or experience.</p><p>Murdo Fraser has asked the cabinet secretary to rethink her hostile approach to skills academies&#8212;I hope that she will do so as soon as possible. They are a logical extension of some of the principles that she has set out and that we have underlined this afternoon. They would do much to enhance the opportunities for specialist training, especially in areas such as technology, music and sport, in which Scotland potentially has so much creative energy. It is to be hoped that the reluctance to embrace the idea at the moment is not bound up with an obsessive attachment to a one-size-fits-all education system that, frankly, is increasingly out of date and is not meeting the needs of many youngsters in our society.</p><p>We agree with the cabinet secretary's desire to merge Careers Scotland and learndirect Scotland, but we urge her to go further and to create a single skills agency for Scotland that would not only take on the functions of those two existing bodies, but would incorporate the skills training that is currently undertaken by Scottish Enterprise. There is a clear need for streamlining, greater simplicity and much greater accountability.</p><p>I conclude by returning to my original point, which is to pledge the support of the Scottish Conservatives for a skills strategy as a priority of Parliament. We will support some of the basic themes that have been announced this week, but we are of the very strong opinion that there are still far too many missed opportunities to deal head-on with the problem that employers face as they seek a fully trained workforce that is capable of delivering greater economic progress for Scotland as a whole.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387100", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members have unanimously made clear the importance of a skills strategy in developing a successful economy and more meaningful and fulfilling opportunities in education.

We continue to support strongly the excellent work that is done at Crichton, and we praise the spirit that has been shown by staff and students in their campaign to protect their institution.</p><p>Many people have praised MSP colleagues in the south-west who have done so much to make the case for resolving the impasse in favour of the University of Glasgow's retaining its status at the campus. If I may borrow a phrase that is usually associated with other political parties, and \"speak up for those who have been denied a voice\", I too pay great tribute to those efforts.</p><p>In the introduction to the prospectus for the University of Glasgow at the Crichton campus, Professor Ted Cowan, its director, says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As long as humankind has been resident on this planet, individuals have wondered about the meaning of existence, asked questions about the plight of humanity ... and have speculated on whether there might be a better way of doing things.\"</p><p>In six minutes it would obviously be totally impossible to explain the meaning of existence, but it is right today to ask questions about the plight of people who live in rural areas and who may wish to take up the challenging questions that are encountered in higher and further education. On this side of the chamber, we will not hold back <place-holder colnum=\"1553\"/> from suggesting that there is perhaps a better way of doing things. Wider lessons can be learnt from Crichton, including lessons on university funding.</p><p>I want to refer to the specific events that have given rise to this debate. At the time, we made plain our concerns over inaction that would have resulted in the withdrawal of the University of Glasgow from the campus, which would in turn have burdened the local area with further social and economic difficulties. The loss of young people to the cities has been a major contributor to those difficulties. Between 2001 and 2005, there was a fall of 6.3 per cent in the population of people below working age in Dumfries and Galloway. That figure is disproportionately high for Scotland as a whole, but it reflects a picture that is common in rural areas. It is imperative that depopulation be not allowed to continue unchecked; if it were, that would store up serious employment difficulties for the future.</p><p>Many of the young people who leave are intelligent and hard-working. They leave to go to university but never return, and although school leavers from Dumfries and Galloway are actually slightly more likely to enter full-time further education than those from other regions, only 12.7 per cent of those undergraduates stay to study at the Crichton. I presume that the rest study outwith the area. The problem is much worse for postgraduates, almost all of whom, although they are registered as living in Dumfries and Galloway, currently attend institutions outwith the area.</p><p>As the introduction from Professor Cowan that I quoted implies, the Crichton campus was founded on noble ideals. Giving rural areas higher education provision is not least among those. If both undergraduates and postgraduates are given opportunities to access higher education in their local area, it is much more likely that young people will stay put, for reasons of convenience and cost.

Like health, education matters to everyone and it is often used as the yardstick by which we measure the progress of a nation.</p><p>It is tempting to focus solely on the need to ensure that all children across Scotland, whatever their backgrounds or physical and mental abilities, have their respective educational needs addressed. That is a major challenge in itself, but the wider moral issue of what to do about the international situation is also at stake. In that context, it is right that education is defined as an inalienable human right and that it should be defined as such in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, it is not right that education is still denied to almost 80 million children across the world. It is our duty to rectify the situation in whatever way we can and to ensure that the privilege of education is extended to the many millions who are currently without that fundamental human right. What should we do?</p><p>In the first instance, our international aid programme must be refocused to ensure that money goes to those who are most in need. Currently, only 32 per cent of our aid budget is spent in the poorest nations.

Not only is it important to end the practice of tied aid, <place-holder colnum=\"695\"/> but my party would also like there to be more opportunity for money to be sent directly to those who are most in need. Perhaps that would be best managed in the form of aid vouchers that can be redeemed collectively by individuals in the poorest communities for development services that can provide new schools and new medical centres.</p><p>There is a moral obligation on the British Government not only to meet the United Nations' target figure of 0.7 per cent of gross national product being spent annually on aid, but to try to ensure that that happens before 2013. In particular, more money needs to be spent on medical services&#8212;for example, on projects such as the millennium development goal on malaria&#8212;so that more children have the opportunity to have a better health record that will allow them to attend school regularly.</p><p>One of the most important ways that we can assist with education is to export knowledge; to ensure that a growing number of businesses and individuals with professional expertise have the incentive to work with the poorest nations to build new infrastructures and public services that give people a better start in life.</p><p>Such is the scale of poverty and educational disadvantage that it is all too easy to be overwhelmed by the challenge that we face.

I extend my condolences to the families involved.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the issue has caused much concern among local fire officers for the very reasons that Ms Cunningham has outlined. It is principally on those grounds that I am happy to support her motion.</p><p>Scotland has more than 50,000km of moving water, so it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a coherent water safety strategy under which there is a statutory duty to rescue people who become trapped in moving water. The Fire (Additional Function) (Scotland) Order 2005 places a statutory duty on fire and rescue authorities to make provision for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"rescuing people trapped, or likely to become trapped, by water ... in the event of serious flooding\"</p><p>in their areas. However, it is unclear whether the provision covers direct responsibility for carrying out rescues from moving water when no authority in Scotland has a statutory duty to do so. In Norway, for example, the police have a core responsibility for responding to such emergencies, with additional headquarters in each of its 19 counties so that such incidents can be managed directly.</p><p>In the past, our fire and rescue services have demonstrated their ability to deal with many difficult and challenging incidents. I pay specific tribute to their professionalism during the recent flooding in the Milnathort area of Kinross-shire. That professionalism should not be compromised by a lack of clarity in the laws of the land.</p><p>Naturally, firefighters have voiced concerns about the need for dedicated water rescue equipment, and they believe that further training is necessary to ensure that such rescues can be carried out.</p><p>I take the opportunity to highlight another arm of our rescue services that is often overlooked and its specialist training and rescue service potential. I refer to the Scottish mountain rescue teams, which could play a vital role in a Scottish water rescue strategy. Made up of volunteers who are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, many mountain rescue teams are more used to carrying out rescues from rivers and dangerous gorges <place-holder colnum=\"447\"/> where rivers are in spate. They should be included in any legislation.</p><p>As with climbing, perhaps the most important safety aspect in relation to moving water is the fact that people need to be aware of the hazards and have the appropriate skills to prevent themselves or others from getting into incidents. The Safe-Tay charity in Perth, which was established to promote water safety and to prevent future tragedies in our rivers, is to be commended, and I hope that the idea will be extended to other parts of Scotland.</p><p>Above all, it is important to take a much more co-ordinated approach and bring together all our rescue services. On that point, I fully agree with the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Moving Water (Rescue Arrangements)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Roseanna Cunningham on   securing the debate and commend her diligence in seeking answers to the questions that, as yet, remain unanswered.

It is a theme that is close to my heart and on which I am grateful to make my first speech in the chamber.</p><p>There is no doubt that Scottish education can rightly claim many distinguished achievements in its long history, for which we have been admired throughout the world. However, the Parliament should be in no doubt about the concern among today's employers that in some areas we are failing to live up to that reputation, given our inability to produce a workforce that is adequately <place-holder colnum=\"215\"/> skilled to cope with the demands of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>In particular, it is deeply worrying that the CBI, in its recent manifesto for the elections, highlighted the fact that it is now commonplace for the Scottish business community to spend an unacceptably high percentage of its &#163;2 billion annual training budget on what is, in effect, remedial education&#8212;I use its term&#8212;rather than on new skills and on ensuring that Scotland is better able to compete on the international stage. The reality is that the basic levels of reading, writing and arithmetic of too many of our school leavers is simply not good enough, and is often accompanied by a lack of awareness and understanding of the world of enterprise.</p><p>In my view, three things need to happen, and they must be an urgent priority for this session of Parliament. First, we must get away from the policies that are driven by artificial targets and focus on quantitative rather than qualitative measurements of academic standards. Governments that insist on dictating the numbers of students who will end up with graduate-level qualifications do no service to our young people or our economy as a whole. University entrance should be based on merit alone, certainly not on some pie-in-the-sky percentage that is dreamt up by civil servants or ministers.</p><p>Secondly, there is the related need to provide youngsters who wish to pursue a vocation or apprenticeship rather than a degree with the facility to do so from the age of 14. Far too many Scottish pupils feel trapped in school, where the pursuit of an academic career is of neither interest nor relevance to their aspirations. Subsequently, too many of them get into trouble. They become disaffected and lose confidence and, most important, lose out on the opportunity to earn an income and the adult responsibilities that go with it. There are sufficient problems with discipline in schools already without our adding to them with more disaffected young people who do not want to be there.</p><p>Thirdly, there needs to be much greater consistency in educational standards throughout Scotland&#8212;a problem identified by Her Majesty's chief inspector of education as one of the main reasons why too many young people are leaving school short of the basic skills that are required in any workplace. Local government must play its part in responding to that concern and it must refuse to accept the lowest common denominator when it comes to education policy.</p><p>Scotland was once renowned for its industry and enterprise. It can be again, but to achieve that, tough decisions will have to be made in the Parliament, especially those that focus on the pursuit of excellence rather than on misplaced and <place-holder colnum=\"216\"/> expensive political correctness, which rewards too many of our youngsters with nothing other than mediocrity and negativity.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When it comes to the creation of wealth in this country, no policy could be more important than the education of our young people.
