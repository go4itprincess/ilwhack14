I certainly found that form of budget scrutiny to be more interesting than the forms that I experienced in previous years. The one thing that has not changed since last year is that we remain in a very difficult economic climate in which to bring forward a budget. We must recognise that.</p><p>I believe that checking the budget against the aspirations of the NPF is a more useful way of scrutinising the Government&#8217;s proposals because, regardless of whether a budget line rises or falls, the ability to meet the NPF&#8217;s aspirations will always be the measure against which we judge a budget&#8217;s efficacy.</p><p>Whereas before we simply argued about whether we believed that we were being presented with a budget that would do what the Government said it would, now we can identify the outcomes that are expected of it against the Government&#8217;s set of indicators. We will still have disagreements about whether we believe that the Scottish Government is addressing the correct priorities, but we should be able to do so in the context of whether the outcomes that it has set itself can and will be met via its budget proposals.</p><p>Clearly, there are spending commitments in the budget that deserve our support overall, but the budget is, sadly, devoid of a coherent strategy to achieve the Government&#8217;s own declared objectives in areas such as creating jobs, growing the economy, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality, although there are clear budget lines that relate to each of those well-intentioned purposes. The major concern for me is bedroom tax mitigation, but I will come to that later.</p><p>As a member of both the Finance Committee and the Welfare Reform Committee, the perspective of the budget that I have developed leads me to believe that, in purely presentational terms alone, the Scottish Government must enhance the budget document to show more clearly how the welcome additional contribution that it has made towards mitigating the impacts of welfare reform will help.</p><p>For example, in relation to advice services, Scotland received &#163;1.7 million a year as Barnett consequentials between 2013-14 and 2014-15. The extra money allocated by the Scottish Government, gives an overall projected expenditure on advice of &#163;7.9 million up to 2015. The &#163;5.4 million that is going to advice work is presented, on a different page in the budget document, as &#163;7.45 million. That higher figure includes &#163;2.35 million from Money Advice UK, but it is left out when it suits the Government&#8217;s purpose.</p><p>The budget document gives two values for the Scottish welfare fund: &#163;33 million and &#163;37.6 million. The reason for that is that the latter figure takes account of &#163;4.6 million for administration, but that fact is disguised in different parts of the budget.</p><p>The component elements of the Scottish welfare fund should be clearer, as doubts are already emerging. For example, Citizens Advice Scotland has stated:</p><p>&#8220;We have not seen much evidence of the holistic approach that was envisaged for the scheme&#8221;.</p><p>Clarifying those budget details and having guidance on the scheme would undoubtedly assist people who are looking for information on what is being made available and would help them to assess the fund&#8217;s efficacy.</p><p>Clarifications can be found in the budget, but the contributions made by various measures are not always explained, and I am left to wonder why that is the case. We need single, consistent totals for expenditure, and no expenditure should be cited that is not associated with an identifiable cost.</p><p>We really should not have to trawl through supplementary information from a range of sources to establish what spending is actually being proposed by the Government.</p><p>I could list a few other examples, but time does not permit. Suffice it to say that, in future budgets, all available breakdowns of costs should be reported.</p><p>However, no amount of smoke and mirrors can mask the fact that it has now been verified, on more than one occasion, that there is no legal impediment to the Government spending more of its own money to fully mitigate the impact of the bedroom tax.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22858354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have pointed out, this year the Finance Committee was asked not just to look at whether the figures in the budget added up and moneys were being spent where the Scottish Government said they were but to scrutinise the budget by examining its contents against its ability to meet the aims of the national performance framework.

The NHS in Scotland may not be broken, but is not at present in a good place. That is regrettable, because Scotland cannot afford our NHS to be doing anything other than addressing the current health needs of our people, and positioning itself to face the increasing pressures that will face it in the longer term.</p><p>Whatever views are expressed in the debate, the one word that should not be taken with any seriousness is &#8220;surprise&#8221;. We have known for some considerable time that pressures have been growing and what the strains are. Primarily, they are demographic change and staffing difficulties. Those are not new issues. They did not emerge as problems for the Scottish Government after the last election or even after the 2007 election. They have been concerns that have been facing the NHS throughout the devolution period and before. Given that we knew that this was coming, why has it come to pass that our nursing and medical bodies are telling us today that things are as bad as they are?</p><p>So, before we look forward, let us look back a few years to 2004. That was the year when, faced with the same growing demands on the NHS that confront it today, the then Minister for Health and Community Care, Malcolm Chisholm, set up the national framework advisory group to consider the future shape of the NHS in Scotland. Its report was delivered in 2005 and confirmed a lot of what we already knew. The NHS has a highly trained and committed staff who were capable of delivering health care that was on a par with that which was offered anywhere in the world. It confirmed that our medical and nursing schools produce first-class graduates and that huge progress has been made in tackling some of Scotland&#8217;s killer diseases.</p><p>However, the report also noted that it was also apparent that over a range of health indicators we compared badly with some of our neighbours. It concluded that we needed to transform the NHS with a series of bold initiatives that would provide a framework to deliver safe, quick and sustainable health care for the future. It also concluded that we had to put aside what is sometimes seen as narrow self-interest and pull together to reconfigure Scotland's NHS to better serve our old, our infirm, our poor and our children&#8217;s children so that at last we might cast off our label of the sick man of Europe.</p><p>When, on 20 October 2005 we debated that report&#8212;which was to become known as the Kerr report, and which has been denigrated this afternoon by the cabinet secretary&#8212;it was clear that there was widespread support for it. Indeed, when opening the debate for the SNP, which was then in Opposition, its health spokesperson, Shona Robison, said:</p><p>&#8220;If the minister ensures implementation and delivery, he will have our full backing&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 27 October 2005; c 20038.]</p><p>In closing the debate that day, Stewart Maxwell was not so much concerned about the content of the Kerr report as he was exercised by a fear about the then Executive's commitment to implementing it. Indeed, he went so far as to say:</p><p>&#8220;There are underlying concerns that the proposals that are laid out in Professor Kerr&#8217;s report will either not be fully implemented or will be&#8221;</p><p>subject to</p><p>&#8220;cherry-picking.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 27 October 2005; c 20064.]</p><p>However, barely a year later, the SNP&#8212;foremost among whose members was the man who is now the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&#8212;began campaigning to have the Kerr report ripped up and to cherry pick NHS board decisions that it did not like. While the Kerr report was all about working smarter, looking ahead and planning to prevent crisis, the short-term electoral priorities of the SNP saw it being consigned to the dustbin.</p><p>We should be in no doubt that that is one major reason why our hospitals are in crisis, why our nurses and doctors are under such pressure, why we have had to have investigations into the increasing mortality rates in NHS Lanarkshire and why there is such disarray in parts of the NHS. It is why, despite the warnings in the Kerr report, Audit Scotland has said that the NHS is focused on short-term measures and has no long-term financial plan. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will listen to Audit Scotland, if he will not listen to me.

To an extent, that approach has created a lack of clarity and certainty about issues such as rates of tax and the power to change the list of materials to be taxed, as Iain Gray pointed out.</p><p>Although the use of subordinate legislation has been somewhat contentious, members will know that I have been particularly exercised about the potential for the landfill communities fund to be raided for purposes that are beyond communities that are directly impacted by having landfill sites located near them. There can be no doubt that the landfill communities fund&#8217;s purpose is to provide benefits from the taxes that have been raised from landfills where there is a clear and recognisable disamenity to local communities.</p><p>During evidence taking in the Finance Committee, I became concerned that organisations with a good appreciation of environmental issues indicated that they have designs on the resources available from the fund and are seeking to siphon off some of the moneys to help projects that are no doubt worthy but are entirely unrelated to the communities around which the landfill tax is generated.

There is no doubt that communities that are near landfill sites face more environmental problems as a result of landfill than those that are not. People who live near landfills have to deal with odours, dust, litter, noise and often visual intrusion, and changing the latitude of the fund would leave their communities with less money to mitigate the effects of landfill.</p><p>Opening the fund to broader environmental objectives coupled with the envisaged reduction in landfill tax receipts will inevitably produce less funding to landfill communities in the long run. It is only fair that the communities that are the dumping ground for waste should receive the maximum possible benefits from the taxation of those landfill sites. At the end of the day, the money is raised at the expense of communities near landfills, so the money should be dedicated to those communities.</p><p>I thank the cabinet secretary for taking the issue on board.

Before the scaremongering klaxon sounds, let me explain why the defence sector is so important to the wider manufacturing sector.</p><p>When I was a welder during the 1980s and 1990s, engineering in Scotland was going through a very difficult period. If we were not losing whole companies such as Caterpillar, Cummings, Findlay&#8217;s and many others, we were seeing downsizing on a massive scale. Skilled tradesmen in Lanarkshire had to travel further afield to the oil-rig manufacturing yards or to defence contractors on the Clyde or at Rosyth in order not simply to find work but to retain their skills.</p><p>Recently, I was in discussion with union representatives at a major manufacturing company in my constituency, which has undergone a very difficult period of rationalisation, redundancy and short-time working. The unions expressed concern that many tradesmen had left that company rather than trying to continue to eke out a living under the financial constraints that were inflicted on them by the firm&#8217;s circumstances. Those welders, platers and electricians were looking for some stability and they saw it in the shipyards, where defence work is being carried out at present and could be carried out in the future. Why then, when up to 90 per cent of the orders that are received by Scotland&#8217;s shipbuilding industry are from the MOD, would the SNP want to introduce a barrier to that trade and put at risk the job prospects of so many highly skilled workers?</p><p>Lodging an amendment that raises the issue of Trident, while making the SNP back benchers happy, does nothing to address the reality facing workers in the defence industry in Scotland. Academics have clearly said that as many as 16,000 defence jobs would be affected by independence, including those on the Clyde and at Rosyth, and yet the Government seeks to deflect attention away from that by throwing in an issue on which even it cannot agree any longer but which suits its purposes this afternoon.</p><p>Also, the SNP blithely promotes the idea that Scottish shipyards could be used to build submarines but rather than provide a well-considered answer to diversification, that idea merely illustrates the SNP&#8217;s lack of knowledge about the defence sector and shipbuilding. Although the Motherwell Bridgeworks company benefited from large contracts in the 1980s to build submarine hulls, not only has that work gone but the factory itself is now a housing estate. That company had the highest level of coded welders in Scotland at that time, as the skills that were required to build submarine hulls were so extensive. The shipbuilding workforce in Scotland does not currently have the specialist skills that are needed to build submarines. That is a sad reflection&#8212;it is an indictment&#8212;but it is a fact. In the longer term, such work could lead to the creation of good jobs, but acquiring those skills would be a lengthy and costly process; it would not be a short-term solution to the adverse impact of losing major defence contracts due to Scotland becoming independent.</p><p>That is why people who know a bit about these things, such as John Dolan, the GMB convener at Scotstoun, are not just sceptical about the SNP&#8217;s defence contracting plans, but scathing about them. As John Dolan rightly points out:</p><p>&#8220;if Scotland votes yes, we will not be building ships for the UK Government&#8221;.</p><p>That is simply a fact, and yet, according to Nicola Sturgeon, as John Dolan went on to point out,</p><p>&#8220;we're the only shipbuilders capable of doing the work.&#8221;</p><p>Clearly, Nicola Sturgeon has never heard of an organisation called the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, which brings together the workforces of all the shipbuilding sites across the UK. It has 1.2 million members. That hardly suggests that there is no other place in the United Kingdom that can build ships. The very existence of those shipyards means that Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s claim that there is nowhere else for the work to go is either ill informed or deliberately misleading. The SNP needs to stop playing with people&#8217;s livelihoods in that way. It is far too important.</p><p>Next week, we expect the much-heralded white paper from the Scottish Government. Obviously, that will be after the media get hold of it first, as it will not be for the Parliament to have its place recognised. However, we will supposedly learn what we can expect in an independent Scotland. We will be expected to believe in what the white paper contains, because the Government says it is so. They are the Government&#8217;s policies, and the white paper will tell us how things will be. When the UK Government and the UK-wide political parties state their policies, they are simply dismissed and denied if they do not sit with the SNP&#8217;s view of the world. When Whitehall states that, post independence, the rest of the UK would not award certain defence contracts to Scotland, just as it will not presently give them to foreign countries, we are told not to believe that. Not only will the white paper tell us what Scotland will do; it seems that it will also tell us what Scotland will tell other countries to do. That is not good enough for the workers on the Clyde. It is not good enough for the defence industry in Scotland. That is why we should support the Labour motion.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Defence Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although it is undoubtedly welcome that BAE Systems has chosen the Clyde for the construction of the future type 26 combat ships, we should be in no doubt that that work will materialise in Govan and Scotstoun only if they, like the rest of Scotland, remain part of the UK or if the white paper tells us next week that an independent Scotland will see massive investment on a similar scale to...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "McMahon", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80418", "house": "4", "member_id": "80418", "person_id": "14059", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Uddingston and Bellshill"}, "section_id": "22752431", "hpos": "120", "gid": "2013-11-20.2.108", "epobject_id": "22752539", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-20.2.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14059+section%3Asp#g2.108", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80418"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member give way?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Defence Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member give way?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "McMahon", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80418", "house": "4", "member_id": "80418", "person_id": "14059", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Uddingston and Bellshill"}, "section_id": "22752431", "hpos": "128", "gid": "2013-11-20.2.116", "epobject_id": "22752547", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-11-20.2.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14059+section%3Asp#g2.116", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80418"}, {"body": "<p></p><p>9.

I am confident that the Scottish landfill tax will do the same. I therefore welcome and support the overall Scottish landfill tax scheme.</p><p>However, concerns were raised during scrutiny of the bill about the fact that many aspects of the tax are to be dealt with through subordinate legislation. That has created a lack of clarity and of certainty&#8212;as some members have outlined&#8212;with regard to issues such as the rates of tax and the power to change the materials that are taxed. The bill is a framework that leaves the specifics to subordinate legislation, and the Scottish Parliament must ensure that future action on the Scottish landfill tax is open to debate and further scrutiny.</p><p>A specific area in which details will be set out in subordinate legislation is the landfill communities fund. I support continuation of that fund, which was created to benefit places that are blighted by close proximity to landfill sites. The fund works by providing benefits to such communities from the taxes that are raised from those sites.</p><p>In Scotland, the idea that communities should have access to environmental justice is spreading, which is welcome. That has led the Government to take a dual approach to environmental justice, by stating first that</p><p>&#8220;deprived communities, which may be ... vulnerable to the pressures of poor environmental conditions, should not bear a disproportionate burden of negative environmental impacts&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>which is absolutely right&#8212;and secondly by stating correctly that</p><p>&#8220;communities should have access to the information and to the means to participate in decisions which affect the quality of their local environment.&#8221;</p><p>I represent an area in which there are four landfill sites in close proximity to each other, and my community has been disproportionately burdened by the negative effects of those sites. However, in the past, the landfill communities fund has helped my community by funding local projects to mitigate the effects of living near the sites.</p><p>In that way, the landfill communities fund has helped to move Scotland towards fulfilling the principles of environmental justice. However, it has now been suggested that the scope of the fund should be reviewed, which leaves me with some concerns. Organisations such as SEPA and COSLA have suggested that money from the fund could be used for funding wider environmental objectives that are not specific to any one location, instead of being used exclusively for communities that lie within a 10-mile radius of landfill sites.</p><p>I take on board the points that have been made by members such as Rob Gibson&#8212;for example, that for rural communities a 10-mile radius may be too restrictive because communities beyond that limit may be affected by a landfill site. However, we are talking about specific projects that may be Scotland-wide and have nothing to do with landfill at its location, so we must be concerned if that is to be the case. A change in the current scope of the landfill communities fund would be fundamentally unfair, and would violate the principles of environmental justice that those who are interested in the subject have sought to uphold.</p><p>It is widely known that communities that lie near landfill sites face much greater environmental injustice than those that do not. Those living near landfills have to deal not only with the emissions that pollute the air, water and soil, but with the burden of costs to address the local nuisances including odour, dust, litter, noise, vermin and visual intrusion that result from living in close proximity to a landfill.</p><p>Landfills not only affect the quality of life in a community, but present an actual cost as exemplified in house prices; in Scotland, homes that are in close proximity to landfill sites are valued at 40 per cent less than similar homes that are not. To change the current scope of the fund would leave communities with less money to mitigate the effects of landfills.</p><p>It is estimated that the landfill tax will generate &#163;107&#160;million in the first year of implementation, but it is also estimated that the fund will fall to &#163;40.5&#160;million in 2025. To open the fund to broader environmental objectives&#8212;coupled with the projection that landfill returns will dissipate&#8212;could in the long run leave the communities that are most affected by landfill with less funding.</p><p>Although the amount of waste that is dumped in landfills is projected to decrease as a result of the landfill tax, communities in the vicinity of landfills will continue to need funding. Landfill sites will, even if they are closed, continue to affect communities negatively for years to come, and those communities will need access to the funds long after the sites have closed. Communities that are dumping grounds for the rest of Scotland should receive all the benefits that result from taxation of landfills, and should be the only ones that have a say in how those funds are used. At the end of the day, that money is being raised at the expense of communities that are near landfills, so it should be dedicated to those communities.</p><p>As was said earlier, it has been suggested that the bill, like other bills that have been introduced as a result of the Scotland Act 2012, would be dry and detailed.

I also commend Marie Curie Cancer Care, the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian for producing their study, which was published recently.</p><p>I want to focus on the section in Nanette Milne&#8217;s motion that highlights the reality that we in Scotland have a real collective difficulty in talking about death. Death, dying and bereavement affect all of us, but talking about and planning for the experiences and practicalities associated with them can be difficult. We simply do not open up as a country when it comes to talking about dying and bereavement, and that is not good for us as individuals or as a society. Indeed, studies have shown that unnecessary harm is caused because people in Scotland are not open about the subject.</p><p>As the study that we are discussing found, GPs can find it difficult to discuss death and dying with patients. Few patients openly discuss the possibility that they might die from their condition, although doctors think that that can be helpful. A lack of understanding around terms such as &#8220;palliative&#8221; and &#8220;hospice&#8221; can be barriers for starting palliative care and support.</p><p>It does not have to be that way. At a meeting of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s cross-party group on palliative care a few years ago, we had a presentation from palliative care specialists who had recently returned from west Africa, where they had witnessed an entirely different cultural attitude towards death and dying. Professor Scott Murray, one of the authors of the report on palliative care, was one of those specialists. They told us that they had gone out to learn about the delivery of palliative medicines but that they were struck most not by the difficulties that face medical practitioners in the developing world in delivering adequate palliation in challenging circumstances of high mortality rates and severe poverty, but by the way in which death and bereavement is celebrated in those cultures.</p><p>Another CPG meeting was on the history of death and dying in Scotland, and I was amazed to learn just how much of an impact that the reformation had in creating the closed culture around death that still pervades Scottish society today. As a member of the Irish Catholic community in Scotland, I am familiar with wakes, so I found it fascinating to learn of the strictures placed by the Church of Scotland on burials and associated rituals. I am pleased that those restrictions have loosened over time, but there is still some way to go before Scotland becomes more comfortable with burials in the future than it was allowed to be in the past.</p><p>I particularly welcomed the creation of the good life, good death, good grief initiative, which seeks to engage support for and enhance the assets of organisations and individuals who have the potential to improve the experience of death, dying and bereavement in Scotland. The initiative is an alliance of more than 700 organisations and individuals who believe that Scotland should be a place in which people can be open about death, dying and bereavement. I believe that Scottish society would benefit from being more open to death, the dead and dying, and that we would become more aware of the options and choices that are available when we are faced with the end of life.</p><p>Health and social care professionals and volunteers in all care settings would undoubtedly feel better about being able to discuss with patients and their families and friends a wider range of issues relating to death and bereavement. If people were better placed to talk about death and deal with related issues in a constructive way, there would be more effective support for those dealing with death and bereavement.</p><p>Death is an inevitable part of life, but we would face it better if we could make palliative care more available, accessible and appropriate to meet the various needs of each individual person requiring additional care to live well until it is time for them to go and leave the rest of us behind to celebrate their lives.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Nanette Milne on securing the debate, which allows us to speak positively about the role of palliative care in Scotland.

We must have a positive agenda. We can work towards and share the same objective without necessarily having to agree on the direction for going forward.</p><p>I genuinely welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s efforts to overcome the negative mindset against the surface coal mining industry. I recognise the contribution that the extraction of indigenous coal supplies could make to driving economic growth and achieving energy security.</p><p>Just as I have said that it is wrong for opponents of opencast to close their minds to its potential, I fully recognise that genuine issues relate to the restoration of sites, protection for local communities during excavation and other major considerations, which Claudia Beamish and Graeme Pearson outlined. The consultation that the minister announced, which will look at the regulation of sites that is required, will benefit by building up the confidence that communities need when plans for opencast mining emerge in their areas.</p><p>As other members have said, the collapse of Scottish Coal has raised a variety of issues in relation to the restoration of opencast mines and environmental concerns. I recognise the importance of the Scottish coal industry task force in identifying solutions to the problems that the coal industry faces and I look forward to seeing what emerges from the consultation in that regard.</p><p>I come from a community that was built around mining and I am the grandson of a coal miner, so on no account would I wish to diminish the importance of deep coal mining in developing the history and psyche of Lanarkshire and Scotland as a whole. However, I am aware that many miners wanted a better prospect for their sons than a life spent howking coal hundreds of feet underground.</p><p>According to many industry analysts, open-pit mining is cheaper, safer and mechanically easier to operate. Open-pit mining poses some dangers to mine workers, but it has safety advantages over shaft mining, as open-pit mines are not subject to cave-in accidents and open-pit miners are not exposed to the same explosive poison gas dangers as deep-shaft mine workers are. Open-pit mining will never be completely safe, but it is safer than shaft mining in some ways.</p><p>It is more than a little disappointing that, at a time of increasing demand, Scottish Coal failed to take proper advantage of the potential for the commercial viability of opencast mining and missed the major opportunity to increase activity and output that was available in Scotland. Across Britain, surface coal mining directly employs about 2,000 full-time workers and creates an extensive supply chain.</p><p>The loss of such employment in areas that already have extremely limited opportunities for skilled and permanent employment is a major challenge as, in addition to providing well-paid and skilled jobs in economically depressed areas, the surface coal mining industry generates significant funds for local economies and provides significant tax contributions via rates to local authorities. Apart from those obvious economic benefits, the surface coal mining industry plays a significant role in the rejuvenation of derelict land. In my constituency, there was an opencast mine adjacent to the former mining village of Legbrannock, which was James Keir Hardie&#8217;s home for a number of years. That site is now home to a fine 18-hole golf course designed by Sam Torrance, which is&#8212;unsurprisingly&#8212;called Torrance park.</p><p>It is regrettable that a major manufacturing firm in my constituency has been adversely affected by the liquidation of two of its largest opencast customers in the Ayrshire coalfields and has lost significant customers for the product that it manufactures. As with coal extraction, reparation work will require the use of that firm&#8217;s product.</p><p>The facility in my constituency has endured long periods of short-time working, so I hope that the input of any taxpayer funding can be used to ensure that equipment that is used in the restoration process is manufactured here in Scotland rather than by overseas competitors. I welcomed the opportunity to have a brief conversation with the minister about that last week.

Starting from such a low baseline, in the short term we might be expecting too much to hope that one in four MSPs might have some form of disability, but there is no doubt in my mind that it would be better if the membership of this Parliament looked a lot more like the society that it represents as soon as possible.</p><p>The independent living in Scotland report on disabled people&#8217;s involvement in politics contains much that cannot be refuted, and I congratulate ILIS on its production. As a member of the cross-party group on disability since the outset and its convener for the past 10 years, I have heard many testimonies from disabled people about the barriers that prevent them from participating in many aspects of life that are taken for granted by the majority.</p><p>I have also heard too many examples of the difficulties that people face just as political activists, let alone elected representatives. I have had many discussions with disabled people in my party, so I know that the pool of human resources from within the disabled community is large&#8212;yet it is largely untapped. I have always tried to encourage disabled activists to put themselves forward for selection&#8212;members might even know one who was successful, although she never needed much encouragement from me&#8212;but I have been left disappointed on most occasions, when party members could not see past the wheelchair or the crutches to see the potential of the candidate before them.</p><p>Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the recommendations in the ILIS report. In particular&#8212;I know that it might hurt some colleagues to hear this&#8212;we should follow Westminster&#8217;s lead by establishing a Scottish fund for access to elected office for disabled people.

Among the most important of them for me was helping to bring forward the first ever report of the Equal Opportunities Committee in 2001, after the issue of discrimination against Gypsy Travellers was brought to my attention, as the race reporter at that time, in a letter from an individual Traveller. Having taken on board the issues that were highlighted in that letter, I convinced the committee, of which you were a member, Presiding Officer, as was Linda Fabiani, to hear evidence from organisations that represent Gypsy Travellers and from individual Gypsy Travellers. We were so concerned by what we heard that we decided to appoint an adviser and to conduct a full inquiry in order to ascertain the level to which public sector policies discriminated against Gypsy Travellers.</p><p>That committee published its report in June 2001. It contained 37 recommendations&#8212;a similar number to the report that we have before us today. The 2001 report covered a range of issues relating to the standards and location of accommodation, on-site facilities, the management and cost of local authority and private sites and the lack of facilities for roadside encampment.</p><p>So, what has changed? Virtually nothing has changed, according to the new report. On education, worrying evidence highlighted key areas of difficulty in accessing services for Gypsy Traveller children and in the management&#8212;or lack thereof&#8212;of interrupted learning. So, what has changed? Clearly, not much. On health and community care, institutional discrimination in health service provision was identified as an issue. So, what has changed? Little, if anything. On police and criminal justice, key issues were raised about the lack of awareness of Gypsy Traveller lifestyles and culture. So, what has changed? Not very much&#8212;next to nothing.</p><p>When we debated the report in 2001, the committee took the unanimous view that the then Scottish Executive&#8217;s response was a disappointment that fell into two categories: the problem was someone else&#8217;s responsibility, or the issue was already covered by a Scottish Executive policy. Sadly, I have to ask again: what has changed? We concluded that if all those issues were already covered, it was obvious that the policies were not working, because Gypsy Travellers were still facing discrimination in every area of public service delivery.</p><p>How disappointing it is that here we are 12 years on and the Equal Opportunities Committee in the fourth session of Parliament has also completed a report on Gypsy Travellers after hearing virtually all the same evidence, and has arrived at more or less the same conclusions.</p><p>Yet again, the key findings of an Equal Opportunities Committee report point to Gypsy Travellers&#8217; widespread experience of the systematic failure among local authorities and organisations to ensure that they have access to the levels of service and legal rights that are available to other inhabitants of Scotland. I could not agree more with the EHRC that absence of leadership lies at the heart of the problems that are faced by Gypsy Travellers and the settled community. That means that instead of focusing on solutions, we get short-term action that is more about fighting fires than about sorting out long-standing problems.</p><p>No one can dispute the fact that Gypsy Travellers have the right to travel or that local residents have the right to be protected from unacceptable behaviour from anyone. With all rights come responsibilities, and a balance has to be struck, but it will require more than warm words to achieve that. We need real understanding and commitment and, in my experience, those remain all too sadly lacking.</p><p>In responding to the debate in 2001, the minister who was then responsible for the matter said that it had been painful to hear the criticism that had been levelled by the committee at the Administration, but that</p><p>&#8220;it is to the credit of the committee and the Parliament&#8221;</p><p>that we had a debate that</p><p>&#8220;puts the Executive under pressure to account for itself&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 5 December 2001; c 4514.]</p><p>Some things have clearly not changed when it comes to equal opportunities. I hope that the Scottish Government is equally discomfited by this latest report.</p><p>More regrettably, the Gypsy Traveller community is still facing a situation in which far too few local authorities understand its issues and make the necessary provisions. Just as in 2001, the Scottish Government has pleaded in its defence that it is doing what it can to address all the points that the committee has raised. Unfortunately, the evidence is just not there to support that assertion. As was the case 12 years ago, Government policies could be identified and resources highlighted that pointed towards solutions for the issues that were being raised. The fact remains that much of what we have today points to the fact that the buck is being passed and that the relevant policies are little more than dead letters that have never been delivered.</p><p>Let us hope that this latest report takes the issue further forward than the last one did, so that in a decade, those who take part in any reporting on the condition of Gypsy Travellers in Scotland do not have to suffer from the d&#233;j&#224; vu that we have had here today.</p><p>In conclusion, I will recount an anecdote that other members have brought up. There is a tale of the pilgrims arriving in what we now know as America. When they asked the natives, &#8220;What did you call this country before we came here?&#8221; they said, &#8220;Ours&#8221;. That is part of the problem and we must bear that in mind when we are talking about the Gypsy Traveller community in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mary Fee, the committee members and the clerks on the report that we have before us.

However, in the meantime, the technical aspects of the referendum vote must be addressed. Therefore, I welcome the bill, although, like organisations such as SCVO, I look forward to moving towards that wider discussion on how we encourage all those Scots who will have the opportunity to vote next year to get involved in the debate.</p><p>On the technicalities of the referendum, I remain concerned about one aspect of the financial memorandum that came to the attention of the Finance Committee, of which I am a member. Unfortunately, the bill is another in an increasing list of bills whose financial memorandum has not withstood the rigours of the committee&#8217;s scrutiny. When the committee considered the recent underoccupancy legislation, we found that the Scottish Government was less than robust when defending the financial assumptions that it had presented to Parliament. For that legislation, the projected costs were tens of millions of pounds out, but the best defence that the officials could come up with was a hope that they were right, rather than a detailed rebuttal of the concerns that had been raised about their financial assessment. Although the degree of disparity in relation to the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill is much less&#8212;it can be counted in a few thousand pounds&#8212;the fact is that there remains a difference and therefore a technical problem with the financial memorandum. The principle remains the same, in that a lack of financial robustness emerged during our scrutiny that is worth highlighting.</p><p>In the case of the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill, we were told that the figures in the financial memorandum were calculated on the basis of advice from printing companies that printing and postage costs accounted for roughly 25 per cent and 75 per cent respectively of the cost of printing and distributing the forms. I welcome the fact that the Government&#8217;s officials agreed to look again at their assumptions about the cost of sending out reminders. Unsurprisingly, when they did so, using information provided by contractors who currently provide such a service to registration officers in Scotland, they concluded that the cost of issuing and receiving the reminders for the young voter registration form, which will be sent to 40,000 households, will be much more than the &#163;6,000 that is outlined in paragraph 14 of the financial memorandum.</p><p>It might well be that, in the event, significantly fewer than the 40,000 reminders that are projected in the assumption are needed. However, the issue needs to be taken into account. It is not acceptable practice to make an assumption in the financial memorandum and then later to dismiss it. The estimate that was set out in the financial memorandum was too low and must be corrected.</p><p>I appreciate that officials have already written to the software providers to ask for revised quotes given the changes that might be necessary as a result of the possible changes to the electoral software. As a result, the financial memorandum might have to be amended. I welcome the commitment that the officials gave the Finance Committee that they will do the same in relation to printing companies and forms. However, the officials advised that they will be able to submit any revisions to the financial estimates in the financial memorandum only just ahead of stage 3. I would therefore be grateful if the cabinet secretary could update us on progress and commit to providing the information that has been promised as soon as possible, rather than leaving it to the last minute.</p><p>I doubt that the problem would, or even should, prevent the passage of the bill but, given the pattern of contentious financial assumptions being brought before the Parliament, I would welcome more accurate projections for members&#8217; consideration so that reassurances could be sought sooner rather than later.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate on an issue that I do not think has come up yet.

However, the truth is that, having listened to the often highly technical and complex evidence that an array of witnesses provided, and having read the detailed and informative written submissions to the Finance Committee, we can do no more than conclude that the land and buildings transaction tax is a welcome addition to the powers that are available to the Scottish Government to make decisions here in Scotland that will better reflect the circumstances that exist in relation to property markets in this part of Britain.</p><p>Little can be found to criticise in the detail of the bill. The concerns that were raised were more to do with issues such as implementation of the tax within the overall taxation regime across the UK. As others have said, major challenges will now be faced when agreement on block grant adjustments has to be reached between the different legislative jurisdictions.</p><p>However, the structure of LBTT is not the subject of any great concern. Indeed, more than one voice was heard to say how welcome it was that the Scotland Act 2012 had provided the opportunity to replace stamp duty land tax, with all its inherent flaws. As has been said, among the most welcome aspects of LBTT is the removal of the slab structure and its replacement with a progressive structure. Witnesses were highly supportive of that approach. No organisation was more supportive of it than the Council of Mortgage Lenders Scotland, which rightly identified that it is inevitable that there would be winners and losers in any new system but preferred to look at the positive side. It highlighted the fact that</p><p>&#8220;a progressive system would be more equitable and overcome some of the inefficiencies created by the slab system.&#8221;</p><p>However, there was some concern that there could be a disproportionate effect on high-value transactions that are liable to the top rate of LBTT. The CMLS was joined by the Confederation of British Industry Scotland in identifying that concern, but I am less concerned about that aspect of LBTT, as the Scottish Government will continue to ensure that people in higher-cost houses get a nice wee discount on their properties through the council tax freeze, which gives most to those with the deepest pockets and the biggest homes. However, the CBI is right to argue that, when setting the rates for higher-valued domestic properties, the Scottish Government would need to be take cognisance of rates that apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Most concern arises&#8212;with some justification&#8212;regarding the uncertainty that may emerge around LBTT rates in the lead-up to the introduction of the tax, especially in relation to commercial property, because that may discourage investment in the Scottish market. Although Adam Smith would perhaps be very proud of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s adherence to the laissez faire free-market policies that he laid down, he would not be very keen to endorse the cabinet secretary&#8217;s position with regard to the uncertainly around taxation. I have read and re-read all the evidence that was made available to the committee, and I cannot find anyone, other than the cabinet secretary himself, who gave evidence that ran counter to the view that such uncertainty might be a problem. For us to conclude that there was a range of views on the subject stretches credulity to the limit. Any statistical analysis of the evidence that was brought before the committee could lead us only to the view that the cabinet secretary is an outlier when it comes to where the weight of evidence lies.</p><p>The Law Society of Scotland, while commenting that residential rates would not be quite so important, expressed concern that a forward timescale was important for commercial property. In general, witnesses were very clear regarding their view that the absence of any indication of likely future rates of LBTT creates an additional layer of uncertainty. Most important is the view that was posited by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which argued that the lack of clarity even on provisional figures for tax rates or bands goes against the principle of certainty in taxation.</p><p>Given the concerns that have been raised over the slump in construction, which emerged again in this morning&#8217;s gross domestic product figures, it is worrying that the Scottish Building Federation conveyed a message to the committee that, in relation to commercial rates, it would prefer a minimum of 12 months between the publication and the impact and that, if we could get towards 18 months, that would be even more preferable for the federation. Homes for Scotland and the Scottish Property Federation were both supportive of that view, and Brodies informed the committee that the feedback that it had received from commercial clients revealed their concern about uncertainty. I urge the cabinet secretary seriously to reconsider his position on the matter, as it could have a direct impact on the construction industry in particular, in its battle out of the economic downturn.</p><p>As many witnesses attested, if specific rates cannot be published, guidance about the intentions and an indication of the top rate, at least, would be welcome. That is the very least that people should be able to expect.</p><p>Overall, the bill should be a good piece of legislation, delivered under the devolved settlement, which will help Scotland to consider its own property markets and address the concerns that currently exist in the sector.</p><p>I would be encouraged if the cabinet secretary could give us some indication that he will reconsider that major point of concern&#8212;the only one that divided the committee. It would be useful if we could have the gap closed between those who have concerns and the Government as it pursues the new legislation.</p><p>The bill is very worthy of support, although it just needs a little more effort to make it a bit more perfect with regard to what we actually need.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is not the first time I have taken part in a stage 1 debate in which there has been very little to say that has not been said already by the time I have stood up to speak.

In having this opportunity to address the topic and speak on behalf of constituents who are extremely concerned about the impact that welfare reform will have on their families, I feel confident in saying that representatives in this Parliament are all in it together.</p><p>The motion invites the Parliament to note the research that the Welfare Reform Committee commissioned from Sheffield Hallam University. I place on record the committee&#8217;s thanks to Professor Steve Fothergill and Professor Christina Beatty for their work in producing the research.</p><p>The purpose of the research was to analyse the impact of welfare reform on Scotland, nationally and across each of the 32 local authority areas. The headline figure is that the UK Government&#8217;s package of welfare reforms will result in a loss of &#163;1.6 billion per year to the Scottish economy. That averages out to about &#163;480 for every working-age adult in Scotland.</p><p>I want to go beyond the headlines and say a little about what the figures actually mean. The loss per year is averaged out across the working-age population, but we know that it will be experienced by a far smaller group of people. Within that smaller group, we know that particular people face the biggest losses. Women, one-parent families and disabled people will be faced with losses that are far greater than the majority of members would think are fair.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report details the impact of nine aspects of welfare reform. I will highlight the potential impact of just three: incapacity benefit; the move from disability living allowance to personal independence payments; and the underoccupancy provisions for people in the social rented sector, which are otherwise known as the bedroom tax.</p><p>I quote from page 10 of our report:</p><p>&#8220;Sickness and disability claimants can also expect to be hit hard. The individuals adversely affected by the incapacity benefit reforms can expect to lose an average of &#163;3,500 a year, and those losing out as a result of the changeover from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payments by an average of &#163;3,000 a year. Often these will be the same individuals: most DLA claimants of working age are out-of-work on incapacity benefits and in both cases the groups most exposed to benefit reductions are those with less severe disabilities or health problems. The same individuals may also find that they encounter reductions in Housing Benefit entitlement.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, a person could be faced with a loss of income of around &#163;7,000 a year, simply as a result of three of the nine benefit changes that were analysed in the research. That is a &#163;7,000 loss each year for individuals who are among the most vulnerable in our society.</p><p>Beyond that financial loss, vulnerable people are being threatened with the loss of security in their lives, such as the security of a safe home, close to the support of family and friends. Just this morning, the committee heard from people who feared the loss of those securities.</p><p>Who is being affected by these so-called reforms? Is it the apparently feckless claimants who see a life on benefits as something to which they are entitled? Is it the families who have not worked in three generations&#8212;families that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found no evidence of when it carried out research in some of the country&#8217;s most deprived areas? Or is it the many people who have told the committee their stories, expressing their fear, confusion and anger when faced with the tattered rag that has replaced the safety net of the welfare state? Those people include Ian Megahy, a veterinary surgeon, who explained that, when he had to stop work:</p><p>&#8220;I was a senior partner in my own practice and a part-time university lecturer.</p><p>Before I stopped work, a client took my business partner aside and virtually accused him of being a callous so-and-so for allowing me to be at my work. A lot of the general public think that the chronically ill are feckless people who give up, sit about and do not try. I have made massive efforts to get better. I have a list of 38 treatments&#8212;medicines, procedures and so on&#8212;that I have tried. I desperately want to get back to my work. I love my work.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Welfare Reform Committee, 5 February 2013; c 530.]</p><p>They include Henry Sherlock, who said:</p><p>&#8220;I fear, without a doubt, I will only lose more income once I have to go through this undignified process once again. I am tired of fighting officials who seem to think they know more about my disabilities and needs than I do. It now makes me feel ashamed of who I am. I am being punished for being disabled and feel powerless.</p><p>Being blind is an isolating disability. If my benefits are slashed in any way, I will become even more isolated.

He was a young man who had never been in trouble with the police in his life up to that point, but he found himself with road traffic offences against his name and a string of trumped-up breach of the peace arrests, which had been carried out for no purpose other than to break his spirit and undermine his efforts to act as a committed trade union activist.</p><p>I know that the police do a good job on the whole, and I value and support the efforts that they make to secure our communities, but there remains the ability for the power that they wield to be a destructive force when it is allowed&#8212;or even directed&#8212;to be unleashed against groups in society who are deemed to be a threat to the designs of the Government of the day. We need therefore to look back at what happened during the miners&#8217; strike and learn the lessons of history, so that we do not allow them to be repeated today.</p><p>There is no justification for individuals and groups&#8212;other than those who might genuinely pose a direct threat to our country&#8217;s security&#8212;to be subjected to surveillance. No one in Scotland today should face trumped-up charges and organised police harassment for having nothing more than political views that do not suit the Government of the day.</p><p>To show that those lessons have been learned, we must say to those who were wronged during the miners&#8217; strike that we know that to be the case and that the stains that were placed on them by the past mistakes are to be removed.

I also thank everyone who gave evidence to the committee and made the inquiry such an enjoyable experience.</p><p>In particular, the event that I attended in Ardrossan along with the convener was very informative and thought provoking. Coming from Lanarkshire, I was keen to see whether the employment initiatives and the skills and training environment in Ayrshire compared more or less favourably with those of the area that I represent. Perhaps not surprisingly, I found that there were many general areas of similarity, even where local circumstances may make the specifics quite distinct. It confirmed to me that the overall conclusions of the committee&#8217;s report are applicable across Scotland.</p><p>What struck me most and confirmed my prior experience was that the expectations of the private sector are far too often at odds with the structures for the employment programmes that are designed and run by public sector agencies such as Jobcentre Plus and Skills Development Scotland. That is why it is right that the report calls for the earliest possible private sector involvement, so that employment initiatives have the best possible chance to succeed in meeting the needs of the business sectors that we will rely on to provide the sustainable economic growth that we all desire.</p><p>A recent meeting that I held with a youth training group in my area highlighted one of the main points raised with us in Ardrossan, which was that public agencies are so intent on delivering numbers of people through the system that too often they lose focus on matching the needs of employers with the skills and abilities of those who are looking to find work, especially those who are furthest away from the job market.</p><p>A number of participants in Ardrossan commented that they would rather have fewer trainees with longer periods in training than lots of people going through schemes in short bursts, only to find themselves devoid of the employability skills needed to make their transition into the workplace more viable and sustainable. That chimed with what I was told in Lanarkshire, where there is genuine concern that SDS is so focused on inputting large numbers of jobseekers that it is not effectively and sustainably delivering people into the workplace.</p><p>Too often, it would appear that SDS identifies the outcome that it wants and then tries to fit round small and medium-sized enterprise pegs into square training place holes that it has designed to meet its targets, rather than the needs of the business community.</p><p>That is why it is important to emphasise another conclusion of the committee&#8217;s report. There has to be much more robust, independent evaluation of current Scottish Government skills and employment initiatives. Evidence has to be produced to show how employment programmes, rather than simply counting the number of people who go through the system, actually support people into sustainable, valuable and worthwhile employment.</p><p>We often hear that businesses and Government are under intense pressure to become more strategic about developing and assessing employability initiatives and the skills sets that need to be created to meet current and envisaged skills shortages. Business groups claim to be linking strategic planning more directly with training, development and recruitment, while our education and skills system claims to be moving toward skills-based outcomes. Those messages were delivered repeatedly throughout the inquiry.</p><p>Government agencies were identified as being keen on certifying learners&#8217; employability skills&#8212;be they modern apprenticeships, Scottish vocational qualifications or other vocational courses&#8212;as a means of indicating that people have been enabled to negotiate their transition to the world of work. What is missing is robust evidence that that is being achieved.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry shows that while employers and educators know that the development of skills is essential to Scotland&#8217;s competitiveness and growth in highly competitive global markets, they find it difficult to take effective, concerted action to establish programmes for delivering those skills.</p><p>Whether or not it disagrees with that opinion, SDS appears to be unclear about what employability skills are, how they are connected to one another and how to approach the process of developing them. The early problems in relation to the my world of work website are clear evidence of that. I would not make a general point of attacking the website&#8212;I want good initiatives to be introduced and information technology can be used to enhance young people&#8217;s learning experiences. However, careers advisers in SDS have told me of their concern that, although the my world of work website can be a useful tool, there is now a lack of personal contact. They fear that, metaphorically speaking, careers advisers will be left standing at the school gate, hoping to catch the students with whom they used to engage one-to-one before they disappear down the road, never to be brought back into the advisory service again.</p><p>There are problems and it is not good enough just to say that the my world of work website is a great idea.

However, like the majority of members on the Finance Committee, many members might consider that, having decided to update the legislation, the Government has introduced a bill that is, to say the least, far from adequate.</p><p>How strange that the Government started off with consensus and ended up introducing contentious issues that broke the initial accord and went against the will of the stakeholders who supported the proposals in the initial consultation. In short, there was a general desire for FOI to be extended and there was no disposition towards the extension of exemptions, yet the reverse of those positions has been put before us. The Government seeks no extension of FOI to cover arm&#8217;s-length organisations, housing associations and a range of other bodies that provide public services, and it has bewildered us all with its aim of extending the exemption from FOI to include the royal family.</p><p>In recent weeks, Salus, which is a health board&#8217;s arm&#8217;s-length organisation, has signed a contract with Atos Healthcare, which has recently come in for a great deal of criticism. Why would the Scottish Government not want to bring Salus into the ambit of FOI and allow us access to information that might be useful as we deal with issues in relation to the Welfare Reform Act 2012? That baffles me and many other people.</p><p>In effect, the Scottish Government has disregarded the views of stakeholders, which, regrettably, is becoming an all-too-familiar habit. For example, in response to the question</p><p>&#8220;Did you take part in the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation on the Bill and how have your views been reflected?&#8221;,</p><p>the Campaign for Freedom of Information in Scotland responded bluntly and said:</p><p>&#8220;Yes, but our views have been mainly ignored.&#8221;</p><p>That cannot be a good situation to have when we are considering the bill.</p><p>The campaign advocates that private and voluntary organisations that receive funding from the public purse should be subject to the scrutiny of freedom of information. Surely such bodies should be subject to scrutiny by the eye of the public whom they serve. I agree with that principle, but the Government seems to have taken a different view.</p><p>The Government once advanced the concept of the arc of prosperity, but it now exhibits a predisposition towards the arc of secrecy, which extends from Victoria Quay to the High Court and which will continue to encompass far too many publicly funded bodies. For example, housing associations, which members have mentioned, benefit from high levels of funding from the Scottish Government&#8212;or, at least, they used to. If a local authority that builds council housing is subject to freedom of information laws, surely housing associations, which build social rented housing with public money, must be brought under the same scrutiny.</p><p>Equally, the basic principle of providing exemptions in a freedom of information bill is not only contradictory but incongruous. As the Scottish Information Commissioner has stated, that</p><p>&#8220;erodes the right to information enshrined in the Act.&#8221;</p><p>The bill makes only limited improvements to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. As Unison aptly put it, to fail to extend the act is to weaken it considerably. The Scottish Government has turned what was seemingly a simple and easy job of extending the 2002 act into an overcomplex task.</p><p>The Government said in its consultation on independence, &#8220;Your Scotland, Your Referendum&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t have a constitution which constrains us, but one which frees us to build a better society ... We must renew democracy and strike a new bond between government and the people based on trust and humility.&#8221;</p><p>How can the Government renew democracy if it allows organisations that provide crucial public services to continue to remain secret?</p><p>The Government must accept the calls from various stakeholders for amendments to the bill. I am pleased that the cabinet secretary indicated a desire to engage in discussion. As the Campaign for Freedom of Information in Scotland said in its submission:</p><p>&#8220;The ability to exercise our human rights ... is crucial in our modern democracy.&#8221;</p><p>I am puzzled as to why the Scottish Government appears to be intent on pressing ahead with the bill in a way that is reminiscent of the approach that Westminster took&#8212;wrongly&#8212;in 2010. The amendments that were agreed to two years ago were not subject to full scrutiny in the House of Lords, due to the imminence of the general election. The House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution said:</p><p>&#8220;It is inexcusable that the Government should have taken so long to prepare this Bill that it has effectively denied both Houses of Parliament ... the opportunity of subjecting this important measure of constitutional reform to the full scrutiny which it deserves.&#8221;</p><p>Why would the Scottish Government take two years to consult, only to make the same mistake that the Lords, of all people, identified at Westminster?</p><p>Unison said in its submission that it was</p><p>&#8220;disappointed that the Scottish Government is making only minor changes via this Bill.&#8221;</p><p>Unison went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;the existing legislation is weaker and less clear than it should be for the growing number of public services delivered by private companies and other bodies not currently covered by FOISA.&#8221;</p><p>I could not agree more. I am not surprised that Unison thought that its views had been disregarded and said:</p><p>&#8220;Ministers have effectively ignored ours and others&#8217; calls for action on extending the Act.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677175", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not many members would disagree in principle with the Government&#8217;s view that there is a need to reform the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.

As is the case in other jurisdictions, including at Westminster and in the D&#225;il, I hope that in future the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly will be not the subject of a members&#8217; business debate&#8212;John Scott has had to use his member&#8217;s time for this&#8212;but an issue that is built into the programme of the Parliament. As the work of BIPA is becoming much more important, it should become an integral part of our debates and discussions in this Parliament.</p><p>I first became involved in BIPA when it was the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, which was more commonly known as &#8220;the body&#8221;. I was an associate or substitute member at first, but I was slightly frustrated by that because, although I could participate in debates at the plenary sessions, where I could hear a vast array of speakers from a host of different jurisdictions speak on important matters, I could not follow through on the on-going work of the body&#8217;s committees. I could hear the work of the committees being reported back to the plenary session, but I was unable to engage in taking that work forward. That was a bit of a frustration, especially for anyone who had an interest in a particular subject. As a full member of BIPA, I now participate on an on-going basis in committee D, which deals with environmental and social issues.</p><p>The development of BIPA from the BIIPB is a good-news story, but I have some criticisms about my early experiences of the body. Although Willie Coffey is right that there is a social dimension to what goes on and that meeting colleagues from other jurisdictions in a social setting can be beneficial to building up good relations, I felt that initially that was the focus of the body and there was too much emphasis on that. One cannot say that now about BIPA, which is a much more substantial institution. The elected representatives who have got us to this point deserve great credit for removing that almost talking-shop-type attitude from the discussions and for introducing much more important, substantive and substantial issues.</p><p>However, I understand that the body, as it was, had to walk before it could run. In the initial stages in the post Anglo-Irish agreement days, many of the issues were pretty tortuous and there was a lot of trepidation&#8212;there was a lot of finessing and caressing of political issues&#8212;and things were pretty difficult. It is to the great credit of the MPs, TDs and others who were involved in those initial days that the body played such a huge role in bringing people together and helping to move forward the peace process. Having served that purpose well, BIPA can move on to discuss, in a much more constructive and substantive way, economic, social and political issues, and I think that it is starting to do that.</p><p>As someone who is now more involved in the committees, I feel that their work has become more central to the work of the plenaries and involves other members much more as we move forward. When I first became a member of committee D, it had just completed a substantive report on the Irish diaspora in Britain. Although I had criticisms of the report, it is useful. We went on to produce a short report on flooding that helped to inform all the jurisdictions. Last night, I was in Belfast, where we had the latest leg of our inquiry into human trafficking, which has been an important piece of work. In January, we will be in Edinburgh to talk about the issue again.</p><p>We must congratulate all those who are involved in BIPA, which is an important organisation. I am delighted to be a part of it and I look forward to the years ahead and to continuing to put effort into identifying areas in which we can work together across the British isles so that we benefit from one another&#8217;s knowledge.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly (Autumn Plenary 2012)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate John Scott on bringing the debate to the Parliament.

I welcome Lord Carloway&#8217;s report, as it is an insightful commentary that I have found extremely helpful in understanding some arcane aspects of the law.</p><p>Although the Scottish Government has already responded positively to several of Lord Carloway&#8217;s proposals, it is clear that some of his other proposals that are being consulted on will require a lot more consideration, given their more controversial nature.</p><p>Not surprisingly, most members have focused on one of Lord Carloway&#8217;s more contentious proposals: the removal of corroboration. We must look at that objectively to arrive at a firm conclusion as to whether corroboration is suitable in modern day Scots law. Some will argue strongly that the principle of corroboration ensures that innocent people are not convicted on the basis of one person&#8217;s oral evidence. Others will argue that if it is removed, subsequent changes must be made to Scots law to preserve the integrity of the practice of the systematic use of evidence to convict an individual. It is in that area&#8212;the conviction of people in Scottish courts&#8212;that I have a particular interest. Whatever opinion people hold on the matter, few would argue that the three-verdict system of guilty, not guilty and not proven is uncontentious.</p><p>I thank the cabinet secretary for his recent letter to me, in which he expressed an interest in the outcome of my consultation on the three-verdict system. I am happy to tell him that I will provide him with the final analysis and any relevant information I obtain, in order to inform his deliberations. In the meantime, he may be interested to know that I have included in my proposal for a reform of criminal verdicts bill a mock juror study that established clearly the relationship between the strength of evidence presented to a jury and the verdict delivered by that jury.</p><p>Although we cannot categorically say what impact removing corroboration will have, evidence and studies show that it is highly probable that it will increase the number of not proven verdicts arrived at by juries. To mitigate such potential effects, additional measures will have to be introduced if the Scottish Government goes ahead with its plans to remove corroboration.</p><p>First, as has been said a few times today, the number of jurors that is required to reach a verdict must be increased from the current simple majority. In normal circumstances a minimum of eight over seven jurors is required. I do not have a definitive proportion for what the majority should be, but I believe that no less than two thirds of the jury should be required to reach a decision. I invite anyone to give their views on this subject by responding to my consultation, which is currently published and in which I seek an answer to that question.</p><p>Secondly, if we change the threshold that is required for a jury to make a decision, the outdated three-verdict system used by Scots courts must be done away with. If we stick with a three-verdict system after increasing the majority required, it will be more difficult for a majority verdict to be reached. It is highly probable that that will result in an increase in the number of controversial and unsatisfactory verdicts being reached in Scottish courts. I advocate that the three-verdict system in Scotland should be changed to a simple two-verdict system. I am unsure whether the two verdicts should be named &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;not guilty&#8221;, &#8220;proven&#8221; or &#8220;not proven&#8221;, or whether different terms, which can be suggested, should be used.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reforming Scots Criminal Law and Practice (Public Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The American Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said: &#8220;This is a court of law, young man, not a court of justice.&#8221; That may have been his view of the American judicial system from where he sat, but I would like to think that anyone who looks at or works within the Scottish legal structure would believe that justice is what should be pursued here at all costs.

Like Jamie Hepburn, I apologise, as I have to get to a cross-party group meeting in around eight minutes, or I will leave many people without someone to lead the debate.</p><p>The debate is on an issue that is of great importance not just to communities in the shadow of Ravenscraig but to communities throughout Lanarkshire and in many other parts of Scotland. Steel making was as much a part of the lives of people in those communities as breathing. This debate is not just an opportunity to remind ourselves of the past and the fundamental role that the steel industry has played in shaping Scotland; it is also an opportunity to celebrate the industrial capacity and skills that we still have at our disposal.</p><p>It is true that Scotland&#8217;s steelworkers have revolutionised the Scottish economy over the centuries, and there can be no greater legacy than to see it contributing to Scotland&#8217;s future growth and the emerging markets, especially in the renewable sector. In that regard, I pay special tribute to the Clydesdale tube works in my constituency and the many generations of highly skilled workers whom it has produced. As a boilermaker, he might be a bit surprised by this, but I particularly welcome my colleague Pat Donnelly from the Community trade union. Pat is the national executive representative for the steelworkers&#8217; union in Scotland and a union stalwart of the Clydesdale tube works. I place on the record the invaluable role that the Community trade union&#8212;which was formerly the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation&#8212;has played in the industry over the years, all too often in the face of enormous difficulties. It has led the way for independent working-class representation in one of the most traditional industries, and it deserves the Parliament&#8217;s respect for doing so.</p><p>Contrary to the general perception, it is a fact that, of all the steel-finishing processes to be carried out in our area, the most extensive and longest lasting was tube manufacture. By the latter half of the 20th century, Stewarts and Lloyds had the monopoly of that industry in the United Kingdom, and it had four large facilities in the Monklands district, at the Imperial, Calder, British and Clyde works.</p><p>The decline in the industry began in the 1960s, and that led to many Lanarkshire workers transferring with it to follow the work to Corby. Many of those families originally came to Scotland from Ireland, Poland and Lithuania&#8212;the Mossend area is synonymous with the Lithuanian community in Scotland&#8212;in the 19th century as the steelworks grew. They migrated again to continue to work in the steel industry away from Lanarkshire as it declined.</p><p>By the 1980s, the centre of tube manufacturing was in two mills in the Clydesdale works at Mossend. That plant is now owned by Vallourec Mannesman Oil &amp; Gas UK, which, is the largest&#8212;indeed, the only&#8212;United Kingdom-based manufacturer and supplier to the North Sea oil and gas industry. I would like it not only to maintain that position but to grow and expand in the years ahead.

We might well criticise the Westminster Welfare Reform Act 2012&#8212;and there are very good reasons for doing so&#8212;but, as we move forward, we must remember that the job of the Welfare Reform Committee and the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.</p><p>I also thank the voluntary sector for the work that it has carried out and the abundance of information that it has provided.

As a result of contact with the stakeholders who represent the interests of those affected by this legislation, unanimity on the view that the bill was necessary and welcome was easy to reach. Moreover, in spite of arguments that we had over the piece&#8212;at stage 1, at stage 2 and today&#8212;we should not forget that those stakeholders held a uniform view on the need for scrutiny of the subsequent subordinate legislation. Unfortunately, that unanimity was not shared among committee members. However, we will move on, as others have said. I am confident that today we will rightly unite on the bill, but it remains to be seen whether we will be able to stay unified as we scrutinise the subordinate legislation that will follow. Alex Johnstone has made it clear that, even in good humour, we may not always be able to agree.</p><p>It was utterly apparent to me from the feedback received from stakeholders that the transparency of the legislative process is as much a matter for general concern as the detail. Numerous groups strongly advocated the view that the affirmative procedure should be used, among them the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, which urged MSPs to ensure that</p><p>&#8220;the first regulations made under the new powers in the Bill that amend existing regulations&#8221;</p><p>are</p><p>&#8220;subject to the affirmative procedure.&#8221;</p><p>Despite what was said during previous debates, including the earlier debate on amendments, CPAG and others are not naive. They knew exactly what they were asking for, and why. It may be the case that the affirmative procedure will not always be used, but it would be wrong for the cabinet secretary to dismiss the intent behind those requests. We should have the maximum possible scrutiny so that we can ensure that the legislation that we bring forward reflects the concerns that were expressed by stakeholders such as Inclusion Scotland, which said:</p><p>&#8220;Any small error in the regulations could incur unintended and further damaging consequences to people who will already be suffering cuts to their income. It is crucial that the secondary legislation proceeds with the fullest scrutiny possible to guarantee that it provides positive outcomes for those affected.&#8221;</p><p>That has been the Labour Party&#8217;s motivation in the discussions that we have taken forward.</p><p>I am pleased that the cabinet secretary did not follow the lead of her party colleagues on the committee on the subject of reporting and instead lodged a very good amendment today to address that issue. Groups such as Citizen&#8217;s Advice Scotland recognised the importance of that issue, as did Children 1st. I agree whole-heartedly that we should ensure that</p><p>&#8220;everyone with an interest in welfare reform and in particular, the impact of particular measures on individuals, families and households, has access to the fullest possible information about the Scottish Government&#8217;s work in this area&#8221;.</p><p>The Welfare Reform Committee has to ensure that the concerns raised by various organisations are taken forward.

An oft-heard refrain from the nationalists in the Parliament&#8212;if there are any nationalists left in the Parliament, given what Angus Robertson has said&#8212;is that everything that Scottish Labour does results from its having to dance to the tune of London Labour. Once that old tripe has been dished out, we are often challenged to be like Labour in Wales, which has done this or done that differently from Labour in London. It is therefore ironic that the SNP demands that we copy a misguided but well-intentioned policy that was introduced by a Labour Government in London and which the minister has confirmed he wants to emulate. It is strange that, on this occasion, the SNP wants us to ignore the fact that Labour in Wales has looked at England&#8217;s situation and taken the same view as Scottish Labour, which is that the policy will not achieve the intention.</p><p>As has been clearly exposed in evidence to the Finance Committee and in this morning&#8217;s debate, such legislation has been tried and has failed and should not be copied in Scotland.

We must see the evidence. As it stands, the evidence is not there. It is regrettable that the Government continues to assert that it is right and expects everyone to accept that proclamation without question. It is clear from the debate that SNP members accept that, but that is simply not good enough. Parliament and the business community must be listened to. So far, that has not occurred.</p><p>Too many questions have been asked about the bill&#8217;s efficacy for us just to accept that the Government should follow England&#8217;s lead.

I hope that that will aid the management of the debate and earn me some brownie points.</p><p>The bill is set in the context of its Westminster parent, the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Much of the evidence that the committee heard related to that act or to other welfare reform changes that are already under way. Some of that evidence was harrowing, but I will leave it to others to speak about those issues, if they wish to. I will restrict my remarks to what the committee&#8217;s report says about the bill.</p><p>First, there was much in the bill and in the report on which the committee agreed. Fundamentally, we agreed&#8212;given the decision on the legislative consent motion on the Welfare Reform Bill&#8212;that, as a Parliament, we must make good on our commitment to take responsibility for these matters.</p><p>That was very much the view of stakeholders. Citizens Advice Scotland spoke for many when it said in its submission:</p><p>&#8220;As the Scottish Parliament rejected aspects of the UK Welfare Reform Bill Legislative Consent Motion, this bill is absolutely necessary to ensure that the citizens of Scotland still have access to passported benefits on 1 April 2013 when a raft of current benefits are effectively abolished and replaced by the new Universal Credit&#8221;.</p><p>Speaking at the start of our first evidence session with stakeholders, Jeanette Campbell of CAS said:</p><p>&#8220;We all agree that the bill is absolutely necessary&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Welfare Reform Committee, 17 April 2012; c 93.]</p><p>The Welfare Reform Committee concurs with stakeholders and agrees with the general principles of the bill. We agreed on the main powers that will be taken under the bill: we agreed on the powers that the Scottish Government wishes to take on universal credit and on those that it wishes to take on personal independence payments.</p><p>We went further than that&#8212;we also agreed some important principles to do with how we felt that those powers should be used, and it is those points that I most want to draw to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s attention.</p><p>We agreed that the powers should be used, in so far as it is possible, to mitigate some of the problems that the Welfare Reform Act 2012 will create. With that aim in mind, we also agreed that the regulations should be designed&#8212;for the transitional period at least&#8212;to preserve passported benefits for those who presently qualify for them.</p><p>In short, we look to the Scottish Government to protect the most vulnerable of our citizens who will be affected by the changes. We appreciate that it can do that only within the powers that it possesses and we acknowledge that there are no easy answers or, as we put it in the report, that</p><p>&#8220;there is no magic bullet&#8221;.</p><p>On all that we agreed, but I would be doing the Parliament a disservice if I did not mention, as the report does, that there were some areas on which we did not completely agree. It would be fair to say that Alex Johnstone, as the sole representative of the UK coalition parties on the committee, was not entirely appreciative of our critique of the parent UK legislation or of our &#8220;grave concerns&#8221; about its impact. He dissented from those findings.</p><p>In addition, Jackie Baillie and I did not agree with the committee&#8217;s view on the process for agreeing the regulations under the bill&#8212;we dissented on that. We wanted a more open process for the development of the regulations. First, we wanted a consultation to be held on draft regulations. Secondly, we wanted the affirmative procedure to be used for regulations that would have a significant impact, as the Subordinate Legislation Committee suggested. Thirdly, we wanted an overall policy statement to be produced on the regulations as a whole. It would be fair to say that the committee as a whole was not comfortable with that view or with the prospect of tying the cabinet secretary&#8217;s hands in what we all accept is a difficult situation and one that is not of her own making.</p><p>I think that all members of the committee recognise how important and potentially controversial the regulations will be, in that they will involve deciding who gets free school meals, concessionary travel, blue badges for parking and so on. I know that the cabinet secretary has offered to respond to the Subordinate Legislation Committee&#8217;s concerns, and we welcome that.</p><p>Anything that the cabinet secretary can do to help to overcome the outstanding difference of view on regulations among members of the Welfare Reform Committee would be welcome. Perhaps she could come back to the committee in September, when the picture on the regulations is clearer. We are open to offers.</p><p>I close by making it clear that the committee was unanimous on some key issues. We unanimously agreed that the legislation is not just welcome, but essential; we unanimously agreed that we should speed its passage so that everything is in place in Scotland for the start of the new welfare regime in April 2013; and we unanimously supported the general principles of the bill.</p><p>I hope that that gives members a clear starting point for debating the bill.

As with most of this Government&#8217;s political choices, a snappy headline is the prize for which some other area of public spending has had to pay the price. As ever, what the headline giveth, the small print taketh away. We have 1,000 more police officers, but as Unison told us and as ACPOS recently confirmed in evidence to the Finance Committee, we have lost 1,000 full-time-equivalent civilian staff. Police staff are being sacrificed on the altar of SNP populism.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the carnage is due to continue unabated, because the Government stubbornly refuses to listen to the legitimate concerns of people who have identified flaws in the financial provisions in the outline business case for the new single police force. Given the significant financial implications of potential VAT liability for the new police and fire services, the police and public would be better served if Mr MacAskill spent more time pursuing the issue instead of praising himself for delivering 1,000 new police officers during the past five years.</p><p>ACPOS predicts that more than 2,000 police staff posts will be lost in the next three to four years, on a best-case scenario, and that more than 3,000 jobs might be lost if pay and conditions are not further reduced and the exemption from VAT is not attained. That is not a good policy to pursue.</p><p>Unison is right to point out that the Government&#8217;s</p><p>&#8220;aim should be to ensure the maximum number of police officers &#8216;on the street&#8217;,&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>in operational roles&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;not substituting for police staff roles.&#8221;</p><p>However, that truth cannot be fitted into a smart headline, which is what always matters most to the populist Scottish Government. The Government can deny all it wants that decivilianisation is taking place, but the people who have been affected and&#8212;this is important&#8212;the trade union that represents them know where the truth lies.</p><p>I say to Mr Finnie and other members who made the same point that the fact that someone does not ask for the evidence does not mean that the evidence does not exist. Mr Finnie made clear that he had read the e-mail from Unison. He must therefore know about the survey that the union conducted and he must have seen the examples that it gave of jobs that have been transferred and are now being done by higher-paid police officers, who are no longer on the front line delivering policing services.

I found that process to be stimulating, and I am sure that not only will individual members have benefited from being challenged on many axioms but that, collectively, the committee will profit from having acquired such a body of instructive depositions.</p><p>Some of the areas that we looked at were non-contentious and can be taken almost as givens. For example, there is no doubt that the OBR could win the award for stating the blindingly obvious when it advised us that the public finances are likely to come under pressure as a result of an ageing population, but there is no harm in emphasising that reality, as a number of members of the committee, including the convener and Gavin Brown, have done.</p><p>Underpinning almost all the evidence that the committee received was the need for good and reliable information to inform the choices that Government and other public agencies make when they allocate resources and set policies to address the challenges that society faces. Elaine Murray referred to that, and it is interesting that Dr Lena Wilson re-emphasised the point at this morning&#8217;s meeting of the Finance Committee.</p><p>It is all well and good for us as politicians to set policy directions or to pursue agendas that are based on our ideological or political interests, but without verifiable evidence, we cannot know whether those decisions are justified, or even whether they are achieving the aims that we set for them. The point has been well made that although the public sector collects a great deal of data for different purposes, often best use is not made of it.</p><p>For example, we all know that the Government believes that the hundreds of millions of pounds that it has spent, and which it intends to continue spending, on the small business bonus scheme is helping our economy. That may well be true, but producing figures that show how many businesses get the SBBS is vastly different from producing analysis that shows in what way local economies are benefiting and how many jobs are being created. Without the latter, all we have is assertion. Without evidence to back it up, all that we are left with is knowledge that a lot is being spent and that the recipients are happy with that.</p><p>In the context of fiscal sustainability, it is entirely right to ask whether we can continue to fund a policy, the efficacy of which we have no evidence of, when we have to find resources to address the facts that, according to numerous witnesses, in educational terms the gap between the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent in Scotland is the widest in Europe; that Scotland has one of the highest proportions of people not in education, employment or training among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries; and that levels of relative poverty have remained stubbornly high, even though they initially fell in the years immediately after devolution. My conclusion is that we certainly have a populist policy, but we have no verifiable evidence of the policy intent being achieved or of its being sustainable.</p><p>Various witnesses indicated that, within the devolved powers, there was action that could be taken, and they pointed to the role that the private sector could play. An extremely interesting round-table discussion addressed the issue of additional models of finance&#8212;on which Elaine Murray, Mary Fee and Gavin Brown, among others, have commented. Again, that is a real challenge to the Government, which has consistently set out its stall against the use of private finance and has pledged to prevent private involvement in delivery of public services, particularly in the NHS.</p><p>However, we know that the Scottish Government is now using the NPD form of private finance initiative and is considering the nascent idea of payment by results across various social service areas. It is also investigating social impact bonds, which involve the Government using investment that is raised from socially motivated private investors&#8212;I emphasise that they are private investors&#8212;to fund a range of interventions to improve a set of mutually agreed social outcomes, and in which the financial returns that the investor receives are dependent on the degree to which the outcomes are achieved. Like Mary Fee, I am not averse to such innovations being examined, but I wonder why ministers keep telling us that they are opposed to private investment in public services while we know that they are considering ways of securing it.</p><p>Ken Macintosh questioned the short-term populism of the current Administration. In closing, therefore, I would like to quote what Thomas Frank, a former commentator on The Wall Street Journal, said about the inherent hypocrisy of populism. He opined that it</p><p>&#8220;only benefits the people it is supposed to be targeting&#8221;</p><p>and said that populist politicians march</p><p>&#8220;irresistibly against the arrogant ... shaking their fists at the sons of privilege ... laughing at the dainty affectations of the toffs&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;while the millionaires tremble in their mansions, they are bellowing out their terrifying demands. &#8216;We are here,&#8217; they scream, &#8216;to cut your taxes.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>For me, that sums up this Government. It wants to be seen to be progressive and to be on the side of the poor and the disadvantaged, but the reality is quite different. A cut in corporation tax, a cut in this tax, a cut in that tax and free services for wealthy families are all dressed up as benefits to disadvantaged groups. However, at some point, the populist largesse will prove to be unsustainable and the SNP, or someone else, will have to pay the bill. The denial will have to give way to reality and the tough decisions will have to be made.

That situation must be understood. What is not understandable, however, is the Scottish Government choosing to exacerbate the problems that bus operators face when it should be seeking to ameliorate the economic environment that bus operators are enduring, bus passengers are being subjected to and transport company staff are paying the price for with their jobs.</p><p>As Transform Scotland has pointed out, Scottish ministers&#8217; attempts to blame the UK Government are &#8220;complete rubbish&#8221;, as it is entirely within the power of Scottish ministers not to make the cuts.</p><p>What is even more perplexing is that, reverting to type, the Scottish Government and SNP members choose to decry those who raise concerns rather than genuinely seek to address the concerns that have been highlighted. James Dornan and others have accused us of scaremongering, but I remind the Government that, less than two weeks after it rained down its bombast in the chamber to reject concerns over the curriculum for excellence a few months ago, it had to concede that remediation was needed. As with hospital blankets, we were not scaremongering then and we are not making up the problems now.

That is why my colleagues in South Lanarkshire Council are listening to the people of Hamilton and Uddingston and why councillors such as Davie McLachlan and Maureen Devlin have been out collecting hundreds of names on a petition that I hope will soon be before the Parliament, to ensure that something is done to address the issue.</p><p>Unlike the SNP, Labour has been listening to people such as Ralph Roberts, the managing director of McGill&#8217;s bus company, who is, as Elaine Murray pointed out, an SNP local council candidate. His comments are worth rehearsing. He claims that the Government is being &#8220;pig-headed and obstinate&#8221; in pushing through the cuts to the operators and that it is in denial about the impact of the grant changes.

Like most SNP soundbites, that claim is more about self-serving and rhetorical trumpet blowing than factual analysis of its policies. Child poverty in Scotland is increasing while the SNP Government is giving handouts to millionaire bus owners through the council tax freeze. It takes the biggest of brass necks to proclaim that that is progressive. Add to that the funding proposals that prefer the university sector to our colleges and the propensity to look after the already better-off shines through yet again. Once more, the haves are looked after at the expense of those for whom university education is too often an unrealisable aspiration, even for those who have the ability to go on to higher education. What sort of progressive budget is it that cuts college funding while protecting the share of the likes of Mr Russell&#8217;s alma mater?</p><p>While Mr Russell was enjoying the benefits of University of Edinburgh tutelage, as a lesser mortal I was leaving school at the age of 15 to take up an apprenticeship as a welder. I wanted to go to university and my teachers tried to convince to me stay on to achieve that aim but, for me and the majority of my peers, getting a good trade was the level of aspiration set for us by the financial reality of the family income.</p><p>My education continued through day release at Motherwell College. I was able to achieve the highest level possible in City and Guilds, and I am eternally grateful for the solid grounding that the college gave me. Fifteen years later, with manufacturing going through the floor under the Thatcher regime, I began to look for an alternative career path and was fortunate to obtain a place at Cambuslang College on a higher national certificate course in social sciences that was made available through a partnership with the University of Paisley and Glasgow Caledonian University. Completion of the HNC guaranteed access to second year on the social sciences course at either of the two higher education institutions and in 1996, 19 years after leaving school, I graduated with honours in politics and sociology at Glasgow Caledonian University. I know at first hand the value of both college and university education.</p><p>Recently, the Finance Committee has discussed the sustainability of funding.

That is why, when the SNP was bragging about its progressiveness, I was standing in the forecourt of Motherwell College with the staff and students, who had come together to protest at the funding cuts that will inevitably lead to staff cuts, cuts to courses and hardship for students.</p><p>Their choosing colleges as the subject of this morning&#8217;s debate shows that even the Tories can see the need for equitable treatment. Yes, there are budgetary restraints, but we cannot allow ourselves to be forced into agreeing with a Government that, because of populist decisions, looks after its own and forgets those who might be left behind.

The picture that they painted of the impending decimation of jobs in that sector is frightening.</p><p>It is bad enough to learn that Mr Neil intends to make himself a latter day Dr Beeching with his rail franchise proposals, but it is worse to learn that he is taking a lead from Arnold Schwarzenegger, not in terms of his political leadership, but in his role as &#8220;Demolition Man&#8221;, when it comes to urban regeneration companies.</p><p>I know that times are hard financially, but that is why resources that are available from central Government and local government need to be used smartly to maximise positive outcomes for people and to create virtuous cycles of education, employment, equity, civic pride and community cohesion. That is why our amendment focuses on the creation of jobs, particularly for young people. As we state:</p><p>&#8220;persistent youth unemployment will have an impact on communities for generations to come.&#8221;</p><p>There has to be a place for community enterprises, credit unions, co-operatives, housing associations and other community-based organisations in regeneration strategies. The bottom line, however, is that the Government simply cannot choose to slash the housing, regeneration, enterprise and tourism budgets and still claim to have sustainable growth as its purpose, as it is trying to do.</p><p>Neighbourhoods frame people&#8217;s lives, and provide a bundle of services that people need and an environment on which families depend. They also provide a vital anchor to individual lives, as the cabinet secretary pointed out. That is why our amendment asks Parliament to recognise that the cutting of funding for further education colleges will undermine the important role that colleges play in providing local people with the skills that they need to gain the qualifications that they need for work.</p><p>That is why we highlight that the provision of quality social housing is increasingly important as more people in our disadvantaged communities are classified as being fuel poor. Finally, it is why our amendment notes with disappointment that the Scottish Government has chosen to cut the funding to URCs, which will have a negative impact on areas such as Inverclyde, and why we are calling on the Scottish Government to come forward with details about its cities strategy and proposed enterprise areas as soon as possible. We will give those elements our support, because they are vital, but there will have to be constructive dialogue to ensure that we all move together in the same direction.</p><p>As I have said previously on this subject, Government must create the space and capacity to assist communities in regeneration of their areas, and the planning framework is central to that.</p><p>We know that communities need access to funds to help them regenerate their areas, to bring derelict properties and waste ground into productive use and to promote community engagement while creating local jobs and training opportunities. However, regeneration is not just about paying for new buildings; it must also increase social justice and quality of life by overcoming poverty and disadvantage and by producing more inclusive, equitable and sustainable areas.</p><p>Neighbourhoods help to shape people&#8217;s lives because they do more than house people. They form a base for wider activities and provide many of the social services that link individuals with one another and give rise to a sense of community.</p><p>Many neighbourhoods that are labelled &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; are in areas where there have been major and long-term disruptions to the local economy, often through the closure or shrinkage of major employers. Regeneration programmes can claim some success in terms of the physical renewal of public space, the development of commercial properties in some areas and the provision of new and refurbished homes&#8212;although not necessarily on the scale and in the forms that are needed.</p><p>As was identified in last week&#8217;s debate on architecture, people who live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods tend to feel they have very little influence over what happens to their area, and that the interests of those who fund developments often seem to come first. I am therefore delighted that the cabinet secretary has mentioned the importance of involving communities at the outset of regeneration. There must be a continuing emphasis on housing renewal that is dominated not by the interests of developers but by the needs of communities.</p><p>There has been an associated lack of attention paid to the cultivation of social capital and community. We have also seen the continuing provision of housing that does not meet the needs and wishes of families, and there has been a tendency, for various reasons, to go for clean-sweep schemes at the cost of restoration and reintegration. That is a disappointment in too many cases. Regeneration initiatives often promise far more than they can deliver, but they will certainly fail to produce the positive results that we all want if the Government rolls back on any commitment on urban regeneration.</p><p>If the Parliament does not wish to see any more backsliding on regeneration, I urge members to support Labour&#8217;s amendment.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01336.1, to leave out from second &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;considers that central to this will be the creation of jobs, particularly for young people, as persistent youth unemployment will have an impact on communities for generations to come, the important role that colleges play in local areas to provide people with the skills needed to get them the qualifications that they need to work and the provision of quality social housing, which is increasingly important as more people in disadvantaged communities are classified as fuel poor; notes with disappointment that the Scottish Government has chosen to cut the funding to urban regeneration companies and the impact that this will have on areas such as Inverclyde, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward details of its Cities Strategy and proposed enterprise areas.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654773", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to make some progress.

The debate has also been helped by the fact that members have had the time to take interventions and engage in a discussion. That may be an indication that less is more and that, when we have such debates in the future, having fewer speakers and giving them more time to elaborate on the points can help us to have a better debate on a subject that is so interesting.</p><p>I congratulate the minister on lodging a motion that allows us to unite&#8212;that is vital&#8212;and I agree with her argument that investment in creative industries can make an important contribution to other areas, such as construction. She was right to outline that point, as it is important that we consider cross-cutting investment. Investment in less prolific areas can play a vital part in assisting the delivery of overall economic growth. I agree that we need collaboration with the creative arts in all the areas that she outlined in order to expand the growth in the economy that we all want.</p><p>There were lots of comments on the need to cut VAT. We cannot support the Tory amendment because it would remove the recognition of that point from the Government&#8217;s motion. The motion rightly identifies the stimulus that VAT reduction could have on the building industry. That said, I must disagree with Mr MacKenzie. We would benefit from such a reduction not just in Scotland but in the United Kingdom as a whole. It is important that we do not draw a distinction at the border when it comes to trying to help the economy. Scottish companies will benefit from any work that becomes available from a cut in VAT for the building industry down south. Not everything comes down to independence.</p><p>In looking forward to the debate, I was drawn to recollections of having the good fortune as a young person to visit big cities such as London, Paris and Madrid. Who could not, regardless of their age, be impressed with the historic buildings in those cities? Their palaces, castles, parks and places of interest have made them interesting for centuries and continue to do so, along with their newer buildings. We can see the contrast between the old and the new, which are sometimes side by side and sometimes in different parts of the city.

Equally, many people of Scottish, Ulster Scots and/or British Protestant backgrounds see their songs as being expressions of their religious, political and cultural inheritance, which is as much of a source of pride and distinction to them as the Irish nationalist disposition is to many from the Irish community in this country.</p><p>When the First Minister claims that he wants to stop people reliving 1690 and 1916 on our streets, I ask him to reflect on that glib sentiment and to ask himself how prepared he would be to consign William Wallace and 1297 or Robert the Bruce and 1314 to the dustbin of history, and to set aside the celebration of his culture and heritage just because it may give offence to someone.</p><p>This is one issue where a one-size saltire does not fit all. Many observers believe that the bill will be no more than a victims charter that invites fans to take offence. We know from our mailbags that football fans are already spying on rival fans and reporting offences, so although the Government claims that the bill is a means by which religious intolerance will be tackled, it is actually the Government that is showing intolerance. It is somewhat ironic that it is the vilified football fans who have best articulated the case against this draconian and illiberal proposed legislation.</p><p>Demonising and criminalising fans of any club for their beliefs shows astonishing intolerance by the Government of behaviour that does not conform to its narrow view of Scottish society. The bill is not the solution. Education, the promotion of understanding and the development of mutual respect between the diverse traditions in Scotland is the route that we should pursue. I do not want my religion and culture to be tolerated; I want it to be celebrated.</p><p>Sectarianism is a strand that runs through our national tartan; it will take a skilled and thoughtful hand to unpick that thread. The bill is not a scalpel to be utilised in that task but a blunt set of shears that will rip through the fabric of Scottish society and leave it tattered and torn.</p><p>Parliament is, rightly, unanimous in its opposition to sectarianism but it is not united on the desirability or potential efficacy of the bill in dealing with the historical societal scars that have been left by centuries of religious division and hatred.</p><p>I urge the Government to think again about the bill. In the words that are sung loudly and proudly at Celtic Park, &#8220;Let the people sing.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill (Stage 2 Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would not make legislative change.

Contrary to what he said in his statement, there is no agreement with COSLA on the substantive issues in the budget.</p><p>If we need an example of the new relationship with COSLA, we need look no further than the wheeze that Mr Swinney has come up with to reprofile local government capital allocations. Asking our councils to raise money through prudential borrowing to fill the gap that he is causing by pushing back the capital budget to 2015-16 may have a superficially adroit air but, in reality, it is a bit like Mr Swinney booking his summer holiday, nipping next door to get his neighbour&#8217;s credit card to pay for it and giving them a verbal IOU to ease their fears about whether he will pay them back. It might have his mates down the pub&#8212;or in sections of the Scottish media, which is much the same thing&#8212;toasting his audacity, and it might give the Scottish Government some short-term breathing space on certain infrastructure commitments, but not all councils may be in a position to deploy the borrowing that Mr Swinney hopes for. He should know, because he has been told by COSLA, that some local authorities&#8217; capital borrowing credit cards are maxed out.

He may not care that local authorities do not deliver on their capital programmes as long as his national priorities are met, and he appears not to have given COSLA any commitment on whether the sum he finally pays back will include the outlay costs and interest payments incurred by councils in obtaining the borrowing that he needs for his plan to work.

To be honest, they are still not the most important issues for me; nevertheless, over the years I have come to realise that we generally spend too much time doing things that undermine our ability to enjoy our tenure of this rather beautiful country. Although it did not occupy much of my initial thinking, I am now firmly of the view that creating waste is both a consequence and a symptom of living unwisely.</p><p>To date, too much thinking has been directed at accommodating our excesses, and we rarely consider curtailing our use of the resources that we have. For many years, rubbish was seen as a health issue and a problem to be dealt with; then it began to be seen as a resource and something of value. That is why it is important for us to have an effective, deliverable and clear zero waste management strategy. To meet the target, all our local authorities need to become zero waste local authorities. Some have done a good job of waste minimisation, but we cannot ignore the warning from Audit Scotland which, in its report from 2010 that is cited in the motion, concluded:</p><p>&#8220;Collectively, councils&#8217; plans are not sufficient to meet landfill and recycling targets beyond 2010.&#8221;</p><p>Although councils such as North Lanarkshire Council easily exceeded their 2010 target, the average was simply not good enough and there is little prospect of future overall targets being met, according to Audit Scotland.</p><p>There remains a reluctance to spend even the amount that councils previously spent on burying the stuff to find more productive uses for the stuff that we throw away. Where a job was done well, it owed more to the enthusiasm and passion of environmentally and socially aware officials and stakeholders, who forced local authorities to think about the long-term consequences of throwing stuff into holes in the ground. Reducing environmental stress means not only reducing the amount of waste that we generate, but changing the way we think about our use of resources.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s zero waste strategy should therefore be a good launch pad, but we need more than a launch pad; nothing less than changing the culture of waste will suffice. No one should claim that that will be easy, but to those who argue that culture shift is too difficult and that we should do only what is easily achievable, we must respond by saying that we should at least expect it to be the overarching goal that underpins our activities.</p><p>If we are genuinely committed to zero waste strategies, we must commit to what is necessary to achieve zero waste. The waste management hierarchy is an accepted guide for prioritising waste management practices with the objective of achieving optimal environmental outcomes. It sets out the preferred order of waste management practices from most to least preferred. The waste management hierarchy must be one of the guiding principles of the zero waste strategy, and I am pleased that the Government recognises that green pecking order.</p><p>Reuse requires less energy than recycling, although factors such as the consumer desire for newness can conspire against reuse. There are many ways in which clothes, books and other materials are currently reused, even through the use of new technologies such as eBay. It is already part of our society and there are precedents on which we can build. Reduction also requires less energy, by designing out waste before it is created. We must also recycle and recover, but it would certainly be best to avoid waste. That is the ultimate zero waste challenge&#8212;the highest point on the hierarchy. To address zero waste effectively, there needs to be a move beyond recycling to the largely uncharted territory of the higher end of the hierarchy.</p><p>To get to that point, we must also plan. When a local authority is asked to deliver on waste management targets, it is vital that the planning framework, based on which it makes decisions, is as clear as it can be. Local authorities that respond to the concerns of local communities cannot be left to carry the can for decisions that are made&#8212;against the wishes of local people&#8212;when their decisions are overturned by ministers.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, from previous answers to me and others, Aileen Campbell is committed to recycling, to reusing and to preventing waste, and has conceded that production of energy from waste is a part of that. However, the former Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, Jim Mather&#8212;in recognising that energy from the waste process has a role to play&#8212;stated that current regulatory measures prevent the building of large-scale energy-from-waste plants.

Working every day with people who have spent their lives struggling to provide for their families is an education that no level of tuition fees could pay for. As a raw 15-year-old, there I was, working beside men who had been on the upper Clyde for many years before coming to our factory. Some of them had been involved in the work-in. Those men did not just teach me how to weld. They showed me the importance of commitment to my workmates, and I learned the importance of loyalty, collective responsibility and solidarity.</p><p>In my early 20s, I became convener in the factory for what was by then the GMB. I recall well the first time that I had to lead the joint shop stewards committee into our annual pay and conditions negotiations. They did not go well, and we had to turn to our full-time officials for assistance after failing to agree a deal.</p><p>The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union official who attended the negotiations was none other than the legendary Jimmy Airlie. In one obituary I read about him recently, it stated:</p><p>&#8220;His strong streak of pragmatism ... refused to let him take workers out on strike if he thought they could not win.&#8221;</p><p>He said:</p><p>&#8220;Workers don&#8217;t pay me or any other trade-union official to conduct a revolution. They pay me to get the best deal possible, and you only get that by ducking and diving and compromising.&#8221;</p><p>I remember to this day the advice that Jimmy Airlie gave me just before we went into the boardroom, which chimes with that analysis of the man. &#8220;Listen son,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you get into that room, you look them straight in the eye, you remember the men you are here to represent, and you tell them what you need and why you need it. You make sure they know you mean business. You bang the table and then you get up and you walk out. And if you&#8217;ve let the door slam shut behind you and left yourself no way out, I&#8217;ll boot your&#8212;&#8221; and then I recall some industrial language that brought the lecture to a close. We did okay in those negotiations, and my only direct experience of Jimmy Airlie is a good one.</p><p>I enjoyed learning from other veterans of the UCS in my own union, such as Sammy Barr, in subsequent years. The lessons that I learned from them at the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, or Confed, conferences and the other boilermakers events and branch meetings remain invaluable.</p><p>Saving shipbuilding on the Clyde was the obvious outcome of the work-in, but the legacy of the example that they set of pragmatic but determined collective action stretches well beyond the banks of that great river and lives on in me and others who may not have been there but have learned just how important that event was in forging Scotland&#8217;s industrial and social history.

I refer to discussions between the Scottish Government and the actual COSLA, not the Labour-controlled COSLA that seems to exist only in Clare Adamson&#8217;s mind.</p><p>Those discussions concern serious matters that the two parties must conclude. I might not approve of what ultimately transpires from them, but there can be no doubt that local government will have a huge role to play in implementing much of the First Minister&#8217;s statement under difficult financial circumstances. It has a huge role to play in helping Scotland&#8217;s economy to grow out of the economic morass, so I expected to hear much more about local government issues than I have done this afternoon.</p><p>Public services reform, particularly the shared services agenda, is an area in which I expected the First Minister to come up with more than 16 lines in his statement. With huge pressures being brought to bear on local authorities by internal necessity and Government direction to deliver efficiencies that it requires, the Government should not be standing on the sidelines while local authority after local authority walks away from the implementation of the few blueprints for the sharing of existing services. The issue should not divide local government from central Government, nor one political party from another, but a problem is emerging with the development and delivery of shared services, and the Government cannot allow it to worsen. Any outcome from the Christie commission report would be welcome as soon as possible and I welcome the First Minister&#8217;s commitment to delivering it in the near future, but I suggest that that be done in 2011 rather than later, as we must get on with that agenda.</p><p>What was missing from the First Minister&#8217;s statement, but which could have been included, was new legislation or reviews of existing laws on matters for which responsibility lies with our councils. Increasing numbers of individual constituents, communities and businesses will be concerned at the lack of any recognition in the statement of a need to address the increasing problem of planning regulations and guidelines on waste management facilities, especially incinerators. Just where does the SNP stand on that issue?</p><p>From answers to previous questions, I know that the Minister for Local Government and Planning has no plans to review the situation, so it comes as no surprise that the First Minister&#8217;s statement left the area untouched. However, it is becoming increasingly unacceptable that waste disposal companies that are acting in accordance with Government targets on waste management and energy from waste are met with a confusing picture because of the planning regime in that area. Planning authorities will always exhibit inconsistencies from local authority to local authority as attitudes to certain developments will always differ. It is therefore not surprising that some will always reject proposals for waste disposal plants while others are inundated with them. If the Government is genuine about its waste management targets and the solutions that it supports for meeting them, it must get serious about the planning regulations that govern the sector. If it does not, local communities will continue to war with business in conflicts that will hamper the economic viability of some businesses and the achievement of waste reduction and recycling targets.</p><p>Another area in which greater clarity is needed is the planning of housing developments. Although it is bad enough that the Government has watered down its commitment to build 6,000 social rented homes, as Lewis Macdonald rightly pointed out, it is also not good enough that it is showing scant regard for the problems that are being encountered in local communities over where houses will be located. We need the right type of home in the right place but, too often, planning authorities and developers and local communities are at odds with one another because the desire for good quality and sufficient numbers of affordable private developments, shared equity homes and social rented accommodation is hindered either by nimbyism, poor planning, irresponsible development or a combination of all three.</p><p>I accept that the situation could have been avoided by the better designation of land in local plans, but the fact is that we are in another unacceptable situation that highlights the need for a review of the implementation of planning legislation. I am disappointed that the Scottish Government programme has not indicated that that will happen.</p><p>I will finish off on a matter that is slightly less important but still reasonably significant and worthy of comment. Where is the high hedges legislation that the former Minister for Community Safety promised last session? I know and regret that the issue could and should have been dealt with by the Governments that I supported prior to 2007. However, in September 2010, Fergus Ewing specifically briefed MSPs that Scottish Government officials had started preparatory work to enable a draft bill to be introduced shortly after the election, should any incoming Government decide to do that. Evidently, the Government does not think that there is any need for a bill and the issue is not going to be addressed yet. Indeed, the new minister has informed my colleague John Pentland in a written answer that we will not get the bill shortly after the election, as was promised, but will get it during the current parliamentary session. That could mean 2016. I assure members that the people in my constituency whose lives are being blighted by their neighbours&#8217; high trees and hedges will be bitterly disappointed by the minister&#8217;s backsliding.</p><p>There will be measures in the Government&#8217;s legislation programme that I will be able to support, but there are more missed opportunities than there should have been.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate that important discussions are under way between the Scottish Government and COSLA and that it would be dangerous to predict, or speculate about, what may emerge from those discussions.

A war of words and chattering-class cogitation has abounded on the subject of sectarianism, but a comprehensive and discerning course of action has never been forthcoming.</p><p>The First Minister&#8217;s&#8212;no doubt genuine&#8212;intention to stop re-enactments of the battle of the Boyne on our streets betrays a failure to recognise that sectarian conflict existed in Scotland for a century and a half before William met James on an Irish riverside. It certainly began more than 300 years before the first Celtic-Rangers game, so the need to have legislation in place before the start of the next football season truly baffles me.</p><p>Although we will soon have legislation to address the modern phenomenon of e-sectarianism or cyber-racism, I fear that the forthcoming legislation will not, or cannot, begin to tackle the real problem. If sectarianism is not to be defined, how can it be tackled or eradicated? If anti-Irish racism is to be subsumed into strategies on sectarianism rather than treated distinctly for what it is, I hold out little hope for a solution to it. The issue is hugely complex and the means of tackling it need to be much more multifaceted than the rhetoric to which we are all too often subjected.</p><p>We hear a lot about the good work that is being done on the issue by different groups, and I know that sincere efforts are being made by such bodies. However, although anti-sectarianism is the recognised label of the work of those groups, I am afraid that it could more accurately be called non-sectarianism. As one academic put it, the term &#8220;non-sectarianism&#8221; refers</p><p>&#8220;to a neutral position, reflecting the fact that it is about staying in the middle&#8221;.</p><p>That is what we have in Scotland. Too many people are trying to claim neutrality, sitting on the fence and proposing measures to deal with the problem based on an attitude that sees the problem as being two sides of the same coin: one lot is as bad as the other&#8212;Celtic versus Rangers. That is far too simplistic an attitude and results in people pontificating rather than taking a proactive and positive approach that is aimed at removing the ignorance that underpins sectarianism.</p><p>I would prefer people to gain respect for one another&#8217;s values and place in society than have non-sectarianists monitoring the number of parades and trying to eradicate the traditions and cultures that divide us. I do not want people to stop singing the famine song because they are afraid that they will go to jail; I want them to understand why it is offensive for them to sing it, and why it is important for me to value my Irish heritage and for them to welcome the diversity that Irish immigration has brought to this country. I want people to stop singing the famine song because they appreciate the offence that it causes to people such as me, whose traditions are different from theirs. No amount of legislation will bring that about, and very little that has been done so far encourages me to think that the work that is being carried out will lead us to that positive outcome.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648581", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sectarianism and Anti-Irish Racism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Bob Doris on securing this evening&#8217;s debate, and I endorse the motion, which specifically asks Parliament &#8220;to develop a long-term consistent strategy for tackling sectarian-motivated behaviour&#8221;.

Iain Gray gave me a specific remit on that soon after he took over as leader of the Labour Party, as he wanted to make it clear that he saw local government, which spends more than 30 per cent of the Government&#8217;s money, as a major priority. I am therefore pleased that the First Minister has followed Iain Gray&#8217;s lead.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that the new minister&#8217;s responsibility includes planning, as that is another key field in which policy will play a principal role in pursuit of the economic growth and job creation that we all want to develop in the period ahead. The Scottish Government&#8217;s 100 per cent target for renewable electricity production is just one area in which planning policy will be important. Some have called the target ambitious, while others have gone as far as to say that it is undesirable. Regardless of what view we take on the promise, having made the commitment the Government will now be held to account for its delivery, both in the Parliament and outside it, by the energy generation sector and the environmental lobby.</p><p>As Iain Gray pointed out last week, we need to establish what else needs to be done to deliver the required level of renewables capacity by the end of the decade. I firmly believe that we need to revisit the national planning framework to make clearer what needs to be provided and&#8212;possibly more important&#8212;where that capacity might be installed.</p><p>We also need much clearer guidance on the less desirable but ultimately necessary technology for waste management in energy generation. Not to put too fine a point on it, agreement must be reached on the location of incineration and biomass plants, as well as wind farms, so that the politics is taken out of the subject in the planning process. For all our sakes, we need to end the nimbyism that, as history shows, too often skews debates on such matters, but we must also protect communities in which overprovision or unsuitable developments are proposed. Those are as much a blight on local communities as they are a bonus to the environmental benefit of Scotland.</p><p>To move away from such practical planning considerations, we await the report of the Christie commission to see its suggestions for the future development of our public services in general. I am particularly keen to see what it holds in store for local government, given the general raspberry that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities blew towards the reform plans that all the parties outlined in the election. It will be no easy task to consider the suggestions for reform of public services and to implement them while retaining the confidence of those who run the services, those who are employed in them and the communities that they serve.</p><p>A particular concern of mine is that too many local government employees&#8212;who, on the whole, do a great job&#8212;still do not receive salaries that are commensurate with the responsibility that they hold. They are now faced with the prospect of long-term financial restrictions, which might further prevent their terms and conditions from being raised to the level to which they are already entitled but have not yet reached. In particular, far too many female employees are affected by the fact that equal pay settlements remain outstanding in a number of local authority areas.</p><p>Last week, the First Minister used colourful prose to paint a picture of a fairer society, but Scotland will not be a fairer place if public sector workers are forced to pay a disproportionate price for five years of council budget restrictions. Willie Rennie was absolutely right to mention that there is a price to be paid for the council tax freeze. We have accepted the reality of the existing settlement between the Government and our 32 local authorities, but it comes at a price. People in poor sections of our society now pay for services that they previously received for free, while MSPs, doctors, lawyers and millionaire bankers benefit from the council tax freeze.

Surely when we look at our local services it would be bravado to ignore those bodies and the pressures that are being brought to bear on them.</p><p>That said, Robert Brown made a fair point about the current position of the SNP, which seems to be trying to patch up its difficulties in different parts of the country. As representatives of the north, Rob Gibson, Dave Thompson and Maureen Watt will of course want to speak about the situation in that part of the country. However, it does not really help the debate to create geographical divisions by talking about where a particular headquarters should be located or what services should be run from the north rather than from the west or the south. We have to get away from that when we discuss police services. We have to get away from the kind of ludicrous, bizarre nonsense in which, when the Pope or some senior figure visits the country, a team of police officers has to sit at Harthill service station to meet those coming from the east, simply because they are not allowed to travel the extra 20 miles into Glasgow.</p><p>However, I do not want to be too critical of the SNP; after all, Maureen Watt warned us not to be cynical. I cannot believe that a couple of weeks before the election a Government would discover that it wanted to look at, say, another solution for a unpopular electricity line that it had already passed but I could not possibly make such a cynical remark in a debate in the run-up to an election.</p><p>I have always been of the opinion that the best defence against a commandeering Government is an assertive citizenry and that is what can be achieved in the reforms to our police service, our fire and rescue provision and our national care service that I believe are necessary. There is absolutely nothing inherently centralist or undemocratic about reducing the number of police and fire authorities, or about combining adult care services in one public sector area instead of keeping them split between the NHS and local government. Indeed, Labour&#8217;s avowed intention is that, in restructuring these services, priority setting will be devolved to the local level and that democratically elected representatives who listen to the communities that they represent will have even more of a say in the delivery of services than they do at present. The governance of local services must, by its very nature, be as local as possible.</p><p>Moreover, as necessity is the mother of invention, any Government of Scotland must do all that can to shield people from the worst effects of the global financial crisis while delivering social and economic reforms. Although we must protect public services as best we can, the public sector&#8217;s structure, approach and objectives should not be immune from reform, the main aim of which must be to provide public services that are more flexible and are adaptable to individual local needs. There must be more of an emphasis on moving towards a delivery-based philosophy that encompasses a radical dispersal of power, in which people have more say over the services that they receive and front-life staff have more of an input into the services that they provide. In no way can that be described as a centralising power grab.

I thank the Local Government and Communities Committee and all concerned for bringing us to this point.</p><p>Fortunately, this is a debate on a piece of legislation that has broad consensus. There are no major political or ideological differences between the parties on it, so there is nothing for anyone to get heated about. Unfortunately, as there is broad consensus in the debate and there is nothing for anyone to get particularly exercised about, the bill is likely to be placed on the growing list of worthy but dull legislation with which the Parliament has had to deal.</p><p>However, the bill is worthy of our consideration and support&#8212;for a very important reason. No one can forget the problems that we encountered with the ballot in the 2007 local government and Scottish Parliament elections. Lessons must be learned. We must move on from those events and the scarred memories that most of us carry from the 2007 election counts, and must introduce measures to improve electoral administration in Scotland.</p><p>I am particularly pleased that the bill will extend the remit of the Electoral Commission to include local government elections in Scotland and that the commission will now be required to produce an annual report.</p><p>I believe that the electoral management board for Scotland&#8212;the EMB&#8212;will be of great benefit to many people in promoting best practice and providing information, advice and training for local government elections.</p><p>Given the faith that those who took part in the consultation and in the consideration of the bill have placed in the future of the board, we have to wonder why it was not set up a long time ago to deal with the complex issues of local government elections. The bill creates the body to fill the gap that was identified in the Gould report, and I welcome the proposal to establish it now.</p><p>Like other members, I would like the remit of the board to be extended, as the Electoral Commission has called for, although I recognise that that has to be decided elsewhere. It surely makes sense to have one board covering all elections in the future, which would provide a great deal of stability for us all.</p><p>It is important to note, as the Local Government and Communities Committee did, that concerns have been expressed that the bill does not give the EMB powers to sanction those who do not follow a direction. I encourage the committee to look a bit further into that issue, to ensure that opportunities are not missed and that potential pitfalls are addressed.</p><p>I am also concerned that if a direction that is issued by the EMB is followed but subsequently leads to court action, a returning officer could be petitioned but the EMB would be exempt. Surely that loophole should be considered further.</p><p>I do not wish to add too much of a note of discord to what is otherwise a non-contentious debate, but this point should be made. The Gould report highlighted</p><p>&#8220;the additional complexity faced in Scotland in 2007 due to the use on the same day of the single transferable vote system for local government elections and the first past the post system and the Additional Member System for Scottish Parliament elections.&#8221;</p><p>We find ourselves facing the same problem with the election this May, with the potential alternative vote referendum likely to fall on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections. I hope that Liberal Democrat and Conservative members will speak to their colleagues in the coalition Government in Westminster and remind them how difficult it was in 2007 when we had that problem. I will leave it at that for the moment, but I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to take part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate.

As I said at the beginning of the debate, it is a worthwhile piece of legislation that, in hindsight, should have been in place a long time ago.</p><p>Having listened to the debate, I remain of the view that there is a valuable debate to be had around the extension of the electoral management board&#8217;s remit to cover all elections in future. However, I am pleased that, through the bill, local government elections will for the first time be managed in an appropriate way.</p><p>As we have heard, all political parties recognise the need for the bill and agree with most aspects of it. However, I hope that the proposed greater powers for the EMB, which would enable it to order sanctions against those who do not follow directions, will be re-examined; I would be interested to see how that debate continues to move forward.</p><p>It is important that we listen to the views of the EMB and support its requests if and when we can, as Patricia Ferguson mentioned. I understand that the committee is of the view that effective planning will result in fewer directions being given, and I hope that that is the case.</p><p>I believe that greater and more effective management of local elections will provide for the smoother running of elections. That will ultimately benefit all political parties and, it is hoped, lead to greater turnout at those elections, which would be welcomed across the political spectrum.</p><p>I heard David McLetchie and Alex Johnstone valiantly trying to defend their party&#8217;s decision to go ahead with an AV referendum, even though they probably do not believe in what it is about in the first place. Mr Johnstone gave us the opportunity to ponder that.</p><p>John Wilson, Patricia Ferguson and Bob Doris made very strong arguments. I was reminded of the time when I was on the Local Government and Communities Committee during its consideration of the changes to the electoral system for local government elections. I was quite struck by the fact that when we looked at America, we saw that they were able to hold elections to elect the local dog warden, the local sheriff and the President on the same day without much difficulty. Having seen the evidence from Northern Ireland, where European elections, Westminster elections and local elections were all held on the same day with different voting systems, I felt confident that the people of Scotland would be able to manage two elections on the same day with different systems.</p><p>However, as Bob Doris pointed out, something went badly wrong. The problem was due not necessarily to the voting systems, but to the fact that the electorate was not put at the centre of the considerations for the arrangements on the day. That is the fundamental problem that we have to address.</p><p>The bill is not contentious. Other non-contentious bills have failed in the Parliament because their financial memorandums have not been robust enough, but on this occasion we cannot even look to that issue for a dispute that will divide us, because the committee has made it clear that it considers the information on the resource implications of the bill to be robust. It is useful to know that, and we can take confidence from it.</p><p>In outlining all the issues on behalf of the committee, Duncan McNeil made it clear that there are some caveats in the committee&#8217;s report and that it will look at those issues further. That is reassuring. Any matters that are outstanding after stage 2 can be looked at again at a later stage. I look forward to the stage 3 debate, even though what we say then might reflect very much what we have already heard this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is standard practice in debates such as this to thank all those who took part in the discussion of the bill at the start of the debate, when one begins to consider the analysis of the bill and the consultation that took place.

Ravenscraig was under threat, and the 12 Gartcosh to London marchers set off, determined to fight against the plant's already announced closure. We all know that the steel works are no more, but what is not so well known is the fact that Bellshill, which was one of the worst-affected areas in Lanarkshire, managed to recover by exploiting its geography and transport infrastructure links to become a hub for distribution and logistics. Central to that was the development of the Mossend rail freight terminal and Peter D Stirling Ltd's Mossend railhead depot.</p><p>In November 2003, the then Labour-led Administration announced the award of a freight facilities grant of &#163;650,000 to English, Welsh and Scottish Railway Ltd for additional freight facilities at Mossend to enable the transfer of an express parcel service from road to rail. Other grants were also awarded, such as one for the then Safeway logistics depot in Bellshill to put trailers on to rail for transportation north to Inverness. Mossend was rightly identified by that Labour-led Administration as a strategically important centre for rail freight in Scotland, and those grants reflected the Scottish Executive's recognition of the site's significance in enabling the transfer to rail.</p><p>However, along comes the Scottish National Party Government and its transport myopia: no Edinburgh airport rail link, no Glasgow airport rail link, delays in the M8 and Raith upgrades, and many more transport projects postponed or shelved.</p><p>The Government has the stated policy, in its freight action plan, to make</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the movement of freight through the entire supply chain ... efficient and sustainable\"<place-holder colnum=\"32279\"/></p><p>by pursuing activities that promote modal shift to rail and shipping, and we have heard that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"moving more freight to rail contributed to the Government's targets of making our transport network 'smarter' and 'greener'.\"</p><p>Mossend is geared up to play its part in that strategy.</p><p>As ASLEF has pointed out, there have been almost &#163;70 million of FFGs in Scotland through 40 grants since 1997, which has taken 30 million lorry miles from Scotland's roads. By freezing FFGs, the Government is not only undermining its own policies, but is putting the brakes on the regeneration of Lanarkshire and the economic fightback against the cuts that started 25 years ago and which led to the fight to defend our steel industry. I ask the minister to ensure that, this evening, he sends out a signal that we will not have to look back to those days for an example of what has to be done to defend the industries that have grown in Lanarkshire out of the mess that was created so long ago. He has an opportunity to do the right thing. It is asking for money in a tight budgetary period, but the failure to deliver that money will undermine the Government's own strategy. That is the problem for the minister. He can throw figures around as much as he wants tonight, but it is the Government's problem&#8212;the Government created it and he must solve it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178263", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freight Facilities Grants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister makes a clever argument, but he can see the importance of his strategy&#8212;I will come on to that later&#8212;and he is undermining his position rather than making me defend the difficulties that he faces.

In speaking today, I have the support of my colleagues Elaine Smith, who represents Coatbridge and Chryston, and Karen Whitefield, who represents Airdrie and Shotts. They cannot be here today, due to the inclement weather, but they would have joined me in opposing the bill at decision time.</p><p>As the convener of the cross-party group on palliative care and the cross-party group on disability, I have had the opportunity to listen to a range of expertise on this matter, and can arrive at no other conclusion than that this bill should be opposed.</p><p>My main concern with the bill is that its supporters say that it is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"consistent and compatible with palliative care as an important part of comprehensive end of life care\".</p><p>Fundamentally, though, palliative care has nothing to do with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.</p><p>It has been made absolutely clear to me that the fact that physician-assisted suicide is currently illegal allows palliative care professionals to discuss death and dying freely with patients. In fact, the question, \"Have you ever thought that life is not worth living?\" is one that palliative care professionals often ask, and frank discussions about such subjects are an essential part of end of life care and helping people to move past suicidal thoughts. Changing the law to legalise assisted suicide could cause patients to see such discussions as a cue to consider ending their life, and would therefore prevent professionals from providing that integral component of palliative care to patients.</p><p>The bill assumes that autonomy is a generally accepted principle on which to base law. In fact, the law exists to protect us all, and often curtails individual autonomy in order to safeguard others.<place-holder colnum=\"31053\"/></p><p>Many of those approaching the end of their lives are vulnerable, but that does not make them weak. Vulnerability is part of a person's humanity. It should be respected but not exploited, and as legislators we must offer protection against the situation that is emerging in which someone could be exploited.</p><p>The proponents of physician-assisted suicide constantly reference the Oregon Death with Dignity Act 1997 and cite evidence of good practice there and in Holland to support their position. However, palliative care as we know it in Scotland and the United Kingdom does not exist in Oregon and Holland. No hospice or hospital in Oregon allows physician-assisted suicide on its premises, so Oregon does not provide any evidence that physician-assisted suicide and palliative care can co-exist.

The development of palliative drugs is very expensive, and there is a danger that money would not be spent on such development if assisted dying became an option.</p><p>Just because we cannot relieve all pain does not mean that we should change the way in which doctors and nurses work.</p><p>Many places think that they are providing the best palliative care possible, but they are not. Palliative care has much room for improvement, and the bill would undermine those improvements. As the cabinet secretary said, the living and dying well action plan is a positive measure, which requires our support and should not be undermined.</p><p>The proposed new law is dangerous and unnecessary.

From the IBR report, it would appear that the same could be said about some Government advisers. The document is more of a catalogue than a road map leading us towards the solutions to the problems in our public finances that were caused by the global recession.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary was an optimist, like me, he could view the report as being a glass half full. It is a helpful document, as far as it goes, because it challenges us to seek reforms, modernise services and deliver effective monitoring and scrutiny processes. We could use it if we saw it as a menu of options that could help us to make the decisions that we have to face.</p><p>It would be understandable if Mr Swinney had taken a pessimistic, glass-half-empty perspective on the picture that has been painted by the Beveridge committee, and considered the panel's diagnosis as simply pointing us towards an inevitable and unpalatable amputation of the limbs of public services. The fact that he was 11 minutes into his speech this morning before he outlined his plans to go for another town hall tour to prevaricate shows how typically cynical the Scottish Government is. It spends its time hunting for someone to blame for taking what is missing from the glass rather than looking to do what it can with what remains. Public engagement is all well and good, but decisive action seems to be beyond this Administration when a scapegoat serves it better.</p><p>Like the programme for government that was trooped out yesterday, the cabinet secretary's response to the IBR report is more noticeable for what it does not say than it is for what it does say. In addition to not proposing anything constructive to deal with the problems that Beveridge has identified, the Government has added to them by cutting 2,500 teachers and 4,000 national health service jobs while concentrating on wasteful initiatives such as the Scottish Futures Trust when its budget was growing. The mess that the <place-holder colnum=\"28379\"/> Government has made of public services as a consequence is not so much the result of hard times coming but of soft times going.</p><p>We have known for three years that local authority services in Scotland have had to bear the brunt of economic pressures because of the additional burdens that have been placed on them in combination with the underfunded council tax freeze.

The motion correctly states that access to and provision of lymphoedema services varies throughout the country. We need a high-quality and equitable service that meets the needs of people in Scotland who have lymphoedema or who are at risk of acquiring it.</p><p>My knowledge of lymphoedema comes from the issue having been for several years a standing item on the agenda of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on palliative care, and from family experience. My mother currently benefits from the services that are provided for her by a lymphoedema clinic. However, to access that necessary service&#8212;which she obtained only in the past few years, having suffered from the condition for almost 50 years&#8212;she has to travel by ambulance from her home in Lanarkshire to a hospital in Glasgow three times per week. Although I appreciate the assistance and treatment that she is receiving, I cannot help but wonder why she cannot receive the service at one of her local hospitals or health centres.</p><p>The lymphoedema research report that the University of Glasgow published in 2008 confirms the information that has been provided by Breakthrough Breast Cancer&#8212;that there is inequity in provision of lymphoedema treatment in Scotland. The report states that some services actually exclude lymphoedema sufferers who did not acquire the condition because of cancer. My mother suffers from lymphoedema as a result of childbirth, not cancer treatment, but her pain is no less real than that which is suffered by my wife, who contracted lymphoedema as a result of breast cancer. However, their treatment has differed significantly, and that must be addressed.</p><p>Patients with primary lymphoedema and those with lymphoedema that has resulted from causes other than breast cancer are least well served. I know of a young boy who fell from his bike and damaged the lymph nodes in his groin, which resulted in lymphoedema. He did not receive treatment for his condition, because the priority at that time went to cancer patients.</p><p>The University of Glasgow study concluded that a referral to a specialist lymphoedema service provides patients with a feeling of security and assurance that their condition is taken seriously <place-holder colnum=\"26367\"/> and is manageable. It can transform patients' lives, even in cases when the condition is long-standing and less amenable to treatment. However, late referral is causing a burden for our NHS.</p><p>It is amazing to see statistics showing just how far the service has to go to provide the service that lymphoedema patients require. A study that was carried out in 2008 showed that there were only three full-time practitioners treating lymphoedema in NHS boards in Scotland at that time. In addition, only 9 per cent of practitioners reported having undertaken comprehensive training to the level of a recognised qualification in lymphoedema management. The study also revealed that at that time the perception was that there was often a mismatch of skills. In some areas practitioners with limited training struggled to manage patients with complicated problems, while in other areas specialists treated fairly routine and uncomplicated patients. I seek assurances from the minister that the situation has now been identified and that it is at least substantially on the way to being rectified, with the appropriate staff carrying out the necessary treatment with the required resources.</p><p>Lymphoedema is a growing problem for our NHS as the incidence of this long-term condition increases with age and there is no known cure. Therefore I urge the minister to make adequate funding available to treat all sufferers and to set out a national perspective and approach to planning.

Having identified the role that they can play in meeting the Scottish Government's waste management targets, the companies have set about proposing to councils how they can do so, only, in certain council areas, to be refused planning permission.</p><p>I am not asking the Scottish Government to take away planning powers from local authorities to ensure that such proposals are delivered&#8212;the companies I am talking about are not Donald Trump companies&#8212;but for the Government and our local authorities to take a joined-up approach. That would ensure that we not only reduced the amount of waste created by both the domestic and non-domestic sectors, but had the means to dispose of the waste and the funding to achieve the goals that we had set.</p><p>If we are to reduce further the amount of waste that is treated in Scotland, the Scottish Government will have to face up to its responsibilities to reduce the amount of waste that is created and secure the availability of appropriate waste management facilities. Some councils cannot be allowed to duck what is required; they are using the concordat to avoid taking their share of the responsibility. Our local authorities have rightly embraced zero waste strategies, with some already having made a good start at waste minimisation but, when it comes to waste disposal, many appear to want to leave it to other councils to do their dirty work for them.</p><p>Waste is a consequence and symptom of the type of lives that we live. The challenge is not only to come up with grand plans for living our lives in ways that do not contribute to resource depletion, but to find practical ways of addressing what we waste and dealing with waste where it happens. It is not enough to ask all the right questions and have good targets, we must also will the means to deliver on the strategy. We must go beyond doing the easy things. It may not be low-hanging fruit that we are after, perhaps it is low-lying waste, but we have to deal with the bigger issues and not just tackle the headline grabbers.</p><p>All local authorities must be made to address the planning permission problems that they are creating so that waste is processed throughout Scotland and not transported around the country for disposal.

That said, if we are genuinely committed to a sustainable future, we have to commit to the kind of planning decisions that are necessary to achieve that end.

Why has it taken three years from the first STV elections in local government for the issue to be raised again, especially since all of the pro-reform triumvirate opposite told us that the new system that had been introduced was insufficient to meet their demands and the principles of proportionality? Why have we never been asked, in the three years of this parliamentary session, to look again at the new local government system? I well remember the cries of the oh-so-principled parties opposite that we needed six and seven-member wards in local areas for STV to be acceptable to them. Yet, now that the new system has delivered SNP and Lib Dem councils all over the country and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is weighted in favour of the SNP, they have all gone <place-holder colnum=\"25858\"/> quiet. Because they now have the power that they wanted, the new system suits them just fine.

Various breeds can be considerably stronger and larger than a person of average size, and some breeds are more aggressive because of years of breeding. However, whatever type of dog we are discussing, we know that effective training, socialisation and proper care can make a significant impact.</p><p>Owners who do not properly socialise their dogs and individuals who are engaged in criminal or risk-taking activities and who keep powerful dogs as a status symbol or an accessory to their own aggressive behaviour are more often the problem than the type of dog that is being considered. We should never lose sight of that, even if we think that some breeds are problematic in themselves.</p><p>There is evidence of a growing trend for gangs to have aggressive dogs as weapons, and genuine concerns exist among some dog owners that the bill will do nothing to affect the criminal element that is most likely to keep dangerous dogs. They are concerned that we are in danger of criminalising law-abiding dog owners.

Faced with that information, it is right that we have had the opportunity to look anew at the prevailing laws on dangerous dogs, particularly as the data that have been presented appear to indicate that the existing legislation has not addressed the problem that led to such a huge outcry in the years before the turn of the century. I therefore congratulate Alex Neil on his initial work and Christine Grahame on introducing the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Bill and giving the Scottish Parliament the chance to consider how we might improve on the measures that are available to our local authorities and police to tackle this increasing problem. I also congratulate NEBU and the Local Government and Communities Committee on assisting the bill's progress.</p><p>As has been widely recognised and supported, the bill started out, rightly, by addressing the fact <place-holder colnum=\"25662\"/> that the current law's focus, which is mostly on dangerous dogs and particular breeds of dogs, is wrong. It is difficult, though, to establish hard and fast statistics on the extent of problem dog ownership in Scotland; indeed, that has been one of the discussion points about the bill. I do not think it unreasonable to accept the estimate in the bill's supporting documents that there are around 550,000 dogs in Scotland. If the percentage of out-of-control dogs in Scotland is similar to that in London, at around 0.12 per cent, there are likely to be about 650 dogs whose behaviour needs to be addressed. However, given that in 2007 there were 623 reported dog attacks that resulted in injury, never mind the number of incidents of behaviour that would cause a reasonable person a degree of alarm, we might actually be underestimating the scale of misbehaviour in our communities. I think that I have been barked at by about 650 dogs already in this general election campaign, and I have been hospitalised on three occasions because of dog bites. Of course, that might just say something about my own relationship with dogs.</p><p>In any case, if we accept that the number of control notices can be expected to be close to 1,200, we begin to get to the issue that most concerned me during the passage of the bill and which I highlighted at stage 1: the bill's cost implications. Information from local authorities indicates that the level of staff employed in the control of dogs is, at best, mixed, and that the expected burden on our councils is going to cause many of them difficulties. At a time when we are losing teachers, social workers, home care workers and other necessary front-line staff under the current local government financial strictures, it stretches credulity to be asked to believe that dog wardens and other costs associated with the bill's implementation and application will be immune from the cost pressures that are afflicting other essential services. As many councils have repeatedly flagged up, even if we accept that administration costs will be fairly minimal, the fact is that staff costs will not be so low. That is the main issue confronting our local authorities, and no amount of wishful thinking or positive gloss by the bill's supporters will eradicate local authorities' genuine concern about the financial burden that the legislation will place on them.</p><p>That said, given the abject failure of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to defend councils from the Scottish Government's cuts, I am a little surprised that it has been so exercised by the legislation's impact. So, along with the majority of those who have commented on the bill, I will be looking at its positive aspects and overlooking COSLA's concerns.</p><p>Improving the control of dogs, preventing dogs from becoming dangerously out of control, <place-holder colnum=\"25663\"/> ensuring that owners are responsible for controlling their dogs wherever they are, including on private property, and improving the care and treatment of dogs are all worthwhile objectives and good enough reasons to support the bill, whatever the misgivings about the finances.

They include young potential <place-holder colnum=\"25584\"/> tradesmen such as Nicos Lambrou from Uddingston in my constituency, who was made redundant with a redundancy package of less than a week's wages as he approached the end of his third year as an apprentice joiner with a large well-known building company. He was allowed to finish his advanced craft and design course at college, as it was already paid for, but, one year on, he is still unemployed and is in the predicament of being neither a fully qualified joiner nor an apprentice whom companies would be able to employ.</p><p>The commitment to continuing support for apprenticeships and all the other schemes is greatly welcome, but the reduction in the maximum age for support to 19 means that that young man is in no position to take advantage of any support networks that are available to allow him to complete his apprenticeship. As time ebbs away, he is losing touch with a career for which he spent a significant amount of time training. What a waste&#8212;and what an indictment of ministers, who should be straining every sinew to provide every young person with the right to high-quality training and to finish the training that they started.</p><p>We have heard how important the construction sector is, and no more so than in Hamilton North and Bellshill, which is home to more construction workers than other constituency in Scotland. Traditionally, Lanarkshire has also been the focus of the Scottish steel industry. The demolition of the Ravenscraig steelworks has bequeathed the area the largest brownfield site in Europe. It is vital that redevelopment of the site progresses, to provide the thousands of new employment opportunities that have long been promised there, but the Administration has been found wanting yet again. It has reduced the project from a national to a regional priority and has deprived it of millions of pounds of Government investment as a result.</p><p>Only the Dalzell plate mill and the heat treatment section at Clydebridge remain of Motherwell's once thriving iron and steel industry, but the Scottish steel industry retains a highly skilled workforce. The industry has been in a slump of late, as have many other industries&#8212;manufacturing has been badly hit&#8212;but the industry's work is cyclical. It is vital to retain the workforce's skills to take advantage of the upturn when it comes. The Scottish Government can help to create stable and growing demand for skills by preparing a route map of national infrastructure investment, but the Scottish Futures Trust is not achieving that. Whatever else it might be doing, it is not delivering projects that will put people into jobs.</p><p>Manufacturing is the cornerstone of any successful and balanced economy. The events of recent months should have shown us that we can no longer rely on the financial sector to prop up <place-holder colnum=\"25585\"/> the entire Scottish economy. It is essential to retain our traditional industrial base. As the Association for Consultancy and Engineering says, the Scottish Government needs to take an integrated approach to making the business environment conducive to construction and manufacturing.</p><p>We need to encourage private sector investment in construction projects. We need clarity about and consistency of funding, rather than the misbegotten Scottish Futures Trust, which whiles away the hours while schools go unbuilt and road projects go unstarted. Given that construction projects can deliver about &#163;2.50 in return for every &#163;1 that is invested, a continued slow-down in capital projects will increase costs and diminish returns for Scottish taxpayers and have a detrimental impact on Scotland's construction industry.</p><p>Scotland needs a dynamic Government, not a dogmatic one that strangles the industries on which we depend when it should draw on all the capacity that is at our disposal to breathe life into our economy. It is not good enough to have warm words; we need action. What we have seen from the Scottish Government has resulted in people such as my constituent being left behind, being disappointed and having no prospect of progressing the career to which they were entitled.

Everyone has a different perspective on the impact of the reformation; I am told that my great-great-great-grandfather died at the battle of the Boyne&#8212;an event that is one of the more contentious aspects of the history and development of Protestantism in the British isles. Apparently, my ancestor died because he was camping in the field next door and was killed when he went over to ask them to keep the noise down.</p><p>I often make light of such things as the battle of the Boyne and its on-going celebrations, because it is often the best way to address the consequences that often accompany the divisions <place-holder colnum=\"25454\"/> that persist in the wake of the reformation and its birth pangs.</p><p>I would like the anniversary of the reformation to be recognised because it provides us all with an opportunity to look anew at what it delivered, where it has taken us and what type of Scotland it has shaped, especially for those of us like me whose history and background is not within the Protestant faith but is clearly affected by it.</p><p>I believe that it is vital that the Catholic church in Scotland should officially take part in celebrations to mark the 450th anniversary of the reformation. Its involvement would help to address any concerns that may exist&#8212;rightly or wrongly&#8212;that celebrating the reformation would result in Protestant triumphalism.</p><p>Whatever view one takes of faith, it is incontrovertible that the reformation is one of the most singularly important events in the history of Scotland. It undoubtedly altered the nation's Christian heritage, and created the structures that shaped our schools, universities, democratic institutions and laws. Catholic countries have all those institutions too, and they are also shaped by the predominant church in those countries.</p><p>However, I often sense that the Church of Scotland is almost apologetic about the impact that it has had, while the church of Rome glorifies in its impact. That should not be the case, but one wonders why the Scottish Government has not done more to promote the positive side of the recognition of Scotland's Christian traditions. Perhaps it is in thrall to the secularist tradition that now permeates society.</p><p>All Christians, and all Scotland, should recognise the reformation in order to appreciate Scotland's Christian heritage.

Let me make it clear from the outset that Labour will support this afternoon's vote on the order on that basis. Although we consider that what is on offer is insufficient to meet the needs of local government, the moneys that have been made available by the Scottish National Party Government to fund the council tax freeze are all that is available, and it is better to have the money in the coffers of our local councils than not to have it.</p><p>Unison's research makes the plight of our local authorities abundantly clear. The union has uncovered cuts of more than &#163;300 million across local government, with planned job losses of more than 3,000. Audit Scotland has also confirmed that the SNP Government is responsible for a real-terms cut in council budgets, and the recent budget round provides all the evidence that we need that that is the case.</p><p>That is why, when councils were considering their budgets this year, East Ayrshire Council looked at cutting the number of community wardens and introducing charges for music tuition in schools; the City of Edinburgh Council looked at cutting funding for community groups; Dumfries <place-holder colnum=\"25214\"/> and Galloway Council looked at charging disabled drivers for blue badges; East Lothian Council looked at increasing burial charges and raising the price of school meals; and Fife Council looked at increasing charges for community alarms. The litany of decimation goes on.</p><p>Dundee City Council tells us that, although it will receive &#163;1.76 million as its share of the &#163;70 million grant for the council tax freeze, it has to find additional cuts of &#163;5.8 million if it is to achieve the freeze. That is the reality of the order. The cuts that will result from it will affect every community in Scotland and will often hit the poorest and most vulnerable people the hardest. It is simply unfair and unjust that schoolchildren and the elderly are being asked to pay for the SNP's underfunded council tax freeze.</p><p>It must also be recognised that, whatever difficult budgets must be delivered in future, this assault on local government budgets is happening at a time when the Scottish Government has nearly &#163;1 billion more to spend than it had last year. It is regrettable, therefore, that the SNP prefers to ensure that Alex Salmond and his ministers receive hundreds of pounds of savings on their council tax, while forcing our councils to lose jobs and make service reductions.</p><p>The Scottish Government is not responding to the recession. To sustain the discredited concordat, it has not made the necessary changes to local government finance that would enable local government to handle the recession.

As the minister highlighted, there were 202 unsuccessful applications for the TCRF, totalling &#163;139 million. That demonstrates the real need for regeneration in our town centres&#8212;a need that is not being met. In the communities that were left out, people have to wonder why the SNP did not commit to on-going support for our town centres.

Twenty-eight thousand construction jobs have been lost in Scotland, yet the SFT has not laid a single brick. Twenty-two members of staff and a salary bill of &#163;1 million may be many things, but it is not a regeneration project.</p><p>As ever, the shadow of the concordat looms large over the potential for economic and social regeneration. Single outcome agreements are expected to show how community planning partnerships have agreed the strategic priorities for their local area and yet the SCVO claims that many local authorities</p><p class=\"indent\">\"continue to exclude voluntary organisations in planning and delivering public services.\"</p><p>The SCVO has make it clear that in most areas, the third sector is represented in CPPs, but it also notes that being at the CPP table does not guarantee good involvement in the community planning process. That is simply not good enough. As the minister and others have said, whether or not the approach is bottom up is irrelevant if community groups are not at the table when deals are made. Ross Finnie was spot on when he highlighted the fact that so far we have not got that right.</p><p>The Scottish centre for regeneration has expressed legitimate concerns about the end of ring fencing of the fairer Scotland fund. That money will be used to fill gaps in local authority <place-holder colnum=\"24172\"/> departmental budgets, for example in education. Although the majority of SOAs contain details of how FSF moneys are being used, the fact that 10 SOAs contain no statements of that kind is a glaring omission that undermines the Government's ability to engage with local communities in effective regeneration projects. Serious action is required in that area.</p><p>It must be more than an aspiration or a good idea to have decision-making structures at neighbourhood level that bring together key players to develop a regeneration strategy, based on an assessment of community needs. Such structures must be seen to work, and evidence of the proposals must be tangible. Access to knowledge and expertise, sufficient powers to facilitate the development of networks and the effective implementation of projects are a must, but so far we have heard little beyond the platitudes in today's motion about how the Government intends to make that happen.</p><p>In all probability, communities will take different approaches to achieving the right balance of physical regeneration, training, job creation and community building, but there must be some standardisation of the overall process; at present, that is missing. Ross Finnie, Johann Lamont and others were right to ask for the issue to be addressed.</p><p>In this period of economic downturn, community-led renewal will be a vital aspect of how we climb out of recession. The current economic situation could stimulate a rethinking of the way in which we do regeneration. As we try to deal with the multitude of problems that face our localities and neighbourhoods, new approaches will need to be developed and strengthened. The resources that are available from government, both central and local, need to be used smartly to maximise positive outcomes for local people and to create virtuous cycles of education, employment, equity, civic pride and community cohesion. Third sector, community and voluntary organisations must not only be seen as a valuable additional resource but be put at the heart of the regeneration process. Often they are a mine of knowledge and increased capacity at local level, with a successful track record of action that makes a real difference to local communities.</p><p>Taking a positive outlook, the potential for community development to fill the resource deficit and offer other locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to local regeneration is an exciting prospect. Government must create the space and capacity to assist communities in regenerating their areas. As Johann Lamont explained, the planning framework is central to that. Communities do not just need access to discussion forums for their areas; they need access to funds to help <place-holder colnum=\"24173\"/> them to regenerate those areas, bringing derelict properties and waste ground into productive use, promoting community engagement, and creating local jobs and training opportunities in the process.</p><p>The minister is correct to say that regeneration is not just about paying for new buildings&#8212;it must increase social justice and quality of life by overcoming poverty and disadvantage and producing more inclusive, equitable and sustainable local areas. As Jamie McGrigor correctly pointed out, there must be a place in regeneration strategies for community enterprises, credit unions, co-operatives and housing associations, among other community-based organisations. The member was right to list the areas that have benefited from additional funding but, like Karen Gillon, I wonder whether he really believes that signs in Thurso can make up for the devastation that was caused by the pulling down of the towers of Ravenscraig in Lanarkshire.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20662587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Because budgets are not about single issues.

Earlier, I raised the issue of the cost to local authorities of the bill's provisions. Those fears have not quite abated as the debate has unfolded. Even the Scottish Government considers that the financial estimates on the establishment of a DCN regime may be on the low side. We must be careful not to burden our councils with measures that have resource implications that are not properly provided for.</p><p>Most of the local authorities that gave evidence expressed concern about the bill's cost implications. Scottish Borders Council specifically asked for central Government to make additional funds available to pay for the impact of the bill. Christine Grahame has repeated her comparison between her bill's potential financial impact and the impacts of the Dog Fouling (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 to argue that costs will not rise, but I remind her that councils have rebutted that comparison and called it \"disingenuous\", among other things. They have pointed out that her bill will place a duty on them to act and to monitor compliance, and that that will have considerable costs.</p><p>Concerns have also been expressed about the increases in costs that will be incurred by the transfer from the police to councils of responsibilities for dealing with stray dogs. It was claimed in evidence that was provided to the committee that the costs to local authorities would soar, because they do not currently provide 24-hour cover and out-of-hours working, and do not have the facilities or the funds to do so. It is also worrying that no discussions appear to be taking place between the police and local authorities on the transfer of budgets to cover any shift in responsibility.</p><p>In such a short debate, it has not been possible for me to cover all of the bill and to consider the implications and merits of provisions such as those on a Scottish dog control database or the opportunities that could have been missed in not seeking to amend further the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. I am pleased that other members have focused on those issues, which can be considered at stage 2. We can look forward with confidence to the committee dealing with those concerns and others that must be addressed at that stage.

I also thank NEBU for its efforts to ensure that the bill could be discussed today. I pay tribute to those who gave evidence on the bill and highlighted a variety of pertinent issues, some of which remain outstanding this afternoon and have already been outlined.</p><p>Whatever issues remain outstanding, the starting point of the bill is right. The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 was much criticised at the time, as it was viewed as a knee-jerk reaction to a distressing problem. The spate of horrific dog attacks that preceded that legislation were not acceptable, and the issue required to be addressed. However, the haste with which that legislation was passed prevented effective analysis of the causes of the problem and a proper determination of the necessary measures to address it. Christine Grahame is therefore accurate in her assessment that the current legislation on dogs is piecemeal, and has tended to focus on breeds of dogs and dangerous dogs rather than on why dogs become out of control and on what has to be done to tackle the dog owner who fails to control their pet.</p><p>Shining the spotlight on the act that takes place instead of on the type of dog involved is eminently more sensible, and it is hardly surprising that the Kennel Club and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals support the bill as a result. Nevertheless, Labour members are concerned about aspects of the bill.</p><p>The bill primarily aims to create an administrative regime that seeks to influence the behaviour of dog owners and to promote responsible ownership, but the measures that are outlined to achieve that will require a sizeable injection of cash into local authorities, especially to <place-holder colnum=\"23654\"/> provide for the administration of dog control notices. Christine Grahame has argued that the officers who would be involved are already employed by local authorities, which must deal with dogs, and that the new duties in the bill would be subsumed into existing duties. However, although the Scottish National Party Government has tried its best to deny the consequences of its budget, the reality is that local authorities are cutting staff by the thousand and that cuts are falling in areas such as community safety and are affecting community wardens and other people who deal with responsibilities in relation to dog fouling and dog-related antisocial behaviour.</p><p>The evidence that was presented during the consultation is a year old, but even a year ago local authorities were advising the Parliament that they would need to recruit additional staff to implement the proposed DCN regime. If the regime would have been a problem for councils in 2008-09, it would be a bigger burden on councils this year, given the fiscal constraints that they face and will face in the future.</p><p>Issues that have been raised about corroboration are of equal concern. The validity of corroboration is a complex issue, which requires much more scrutiny. The definition of \"out of control\" is an issue, because judging what it means is subjective.

However, I think that COSLA will be disappointed when the draft order falls. The Government will need to explain to its back benchers why it has let down local government if SNP members genuinely believe what they have said in their speeches this morning.</p><p>The newspaper is one of the oldest forms of mass media and it holds a number of distinct advantages over other types of media. A newspaper can be read by nearly everyone and in almost every type of condition or location. Although we are undoubtedly moving towards a situation in which the majority&#8212;if not almost everyone&#8212;have access to their media electronically or digitally, we are not there yet. The vast majority of people in this country still look to their local printed newspaper as the source of local information. Their number far outweighs the number of those who access their information via the internet.</p><p>The world of technology is undoubtedly changing the newspaper industry, and will continue to do so. Increasingly, newspapers are moving their services online and are slowly moving to integrate the internet into every aspect of their operations, as many members have noted. Local newspapers may have been slower in doing that than some of their national counterparts, but they are doing so, and some newspapers are preparing for the day when they will publish their work only online.</p><p>We can even start to consider seriously the endless amount of news blogs on the web. It is a pity that Mike Russell, who has just joined us, is no longer responsible for the media portfolio, given his expertise in developing networks of bloggers, but Fiona Hyslop will just have to fill his shoes as best she can. She may share her predecessor's enthusiasm for the internet as a vehicle for information dissemination, but she must reconsider her Government's reckless rush to use the web for public information notices. Her failure to do so will have disastrous consequences for our local newspaper network.</p><p>I am quite sure that the people who attended the conference at Glasgow Caledonian University that is mentioned in the Conservatives' amendment did not expect that, a year on, they would be offered a summit. They want action. Jim Mather gave us yet more of his PowerPoint and gobbledegook expertise and very little in the way of action.<place-holder colnum=\"23239\"/></p><p>The argument that if local papers go bust there will be no coverage of what happens in local government is not scaremongering. A vast amount of academic research points to the importance of an independent local press in disseminating hard-to-get information, mobilising the public and putting pressure on government and business for the public good. That point was made by Iain Smith in an unusually entertaining speech and was rightly highlighted by Robin Harper.</p><p>It appears from this debate that the Scottish Government wishes to ignore the important role that an independent local press must play in scrutinising our democratic institutions. There are some who argue that the internet will empower ordinary people to do the task themselves and do it better, but I and my Labour colleagues are not so sure. Even if we recognise that it is inevitable that that day will come, it has not come yet, and the Government's draft order is far too premature.</p><p>Our local papers are virtually the only media that scrutinise local politics. Putting their existence in jeopardy in the belief that the internet will enable citizens to become better informed is too high a risk to take in pursuit of the relatively small amount of money that can be saved from local government coffers.</p><p>I believe that local papers are a civic asset and that our democracy needs the local information that we get from them. As Hugh Henry and David Whitton correctly said, the pursuit of cost savings cannot be allowed to undermine our local democracy. Today's economic climate demands that political leaders work with the media to help create economically viable ways for local journalism to prosper. That should just make us more determined to ensure that come 5 o'clock, Parliament, by supporting Labour's motion and the Conservatives' amendment, sends out the signal that we know what the right thing to do by our local papers is, even if the Government does not.

Although we would all prefer to conserve buildings that play significant roles in the life and heritage of our local communities, and which have added value in our rural communities, the financial realities of sustaining public facilities within budget allocations mean that difficult decisions must be made in the pursuit of cost effectiveness.</p><p>From the cursory knowledge that I have of the situation, it is clear to me that, although Lesmahagow might well suffer the loss of a much-loved public building, the town will benefit from significant public investment.

It was, therefore, with a real sense of discomfort that, when I met a group of home care workers from North Lanarkshire recently, I heard how let down they felt by the inability of politicians and unions to end the iniquitous situation that sees them paid so much less than their fellow public sector employees. For all that I could tell them about what had been done to address the problem&#8212;there has been some movement&#8212;the reality was that those workers felt undervalued and underrewarded in spite of the essential service that they provide to deserving individuals in our communities who need support and care in their homes.</p><p>Since the implementation of the single status agreement in 1999, which was designed to end discrimination of this nature, a lot of progress has been made to ensure that the terms and conditions of workers are the same no matter what job they do. Single status and equal pay are now inextricably linked. That is only right and proper but, in implementing that policy, we knew that local authorities would need help to meet the financial pressures that were being placed on them.</p><p>Unfortunately, as a result of things like the historic concordat&#8212;or the infamous con act&#8212;local authorities face shortfalls in their budgets to deal with single status and equal pay. In fact, in scrutinising the Government's draft budget for 2009-10, the Finance Committee conducted an inquiry into this issue, such was its concern for councils that have a number of claims outstanding.</p><p>It is good to know that, by next year, all 32 local authorities will have implemented the single status agreement, but it is estimated that the number of <place-holder colnum=\"20174\"/> outstanding claims might cost local authorities hundreds of millions of pounds. We have heard many suggestions of what that figure might be but, whatever the figure is, it does not include the financial implications of the Bainbridge judgment, which John Wilson eloquently outlined.</p><p>The most worrying aspect of the committee's report was that there seems to be no conclusion in sight to the outstanding issues that are faced by councils in relation to outstanding judgments and what those decisions could mean for future judgments. As the committee's report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there appears to be no end in sight and ... as soon as one set of problems is resolved another set arises\".</p><p>I understand that, at the time when the report was being drawn up, COSLA had not issued guidance on final judgments, including the Bainbridge judgment, but it was in the process of issuing something. We must see more progress in that regard. The wait for guidance has meant that claimants who are waiting for their case to be resolved face a greater risk that they will miss out on their claim due to the five-year limit. That cannot be acceptable.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary said this morning, the Scottish Government believes that all local government agreements should be achieved without its intervention. The previous Administration, too, took that position but it also stated that it would be willing to facilitate discussions between all interested parties whenever possible, if such a need arose, and those meetings took place.</p><p>Given the circumstances that are outlined in the report and the lack of direction from COSLA, I ask the cabinet secretary to look at this matter once more and to call a meeting between COSLA, the trade unions and all other interested parties to discuss the serious outstanding issues.</p><p>I seem to recall that, around 18 months ago, the First Minister intervened to provide independent expert arbitration when there was a dispute at the oil refinery in Grangemouth between a private company and private sector employees. Why can that approach not be taken to the problem in the public sector that we are discussing today, which has been going on for more than 10 years? That could help matters to reach a conclusion much more quickly. In saying that, I recognise that responsibility lies ultimately with local authorities, but it strikes me that the matter of single status and equal pay has stagnated and we urgently need the involvement of everyone concerned.</p><p>It is time for the Scottish Government to say what it will do to assist local authorities in order to resolve the existing cases and any future cases as soon as possible so that all workers can have equal status. We on the Labour benches have <place-holder colnum=\"20175\"/> been striving for that for many years.

Like many others who are present this evening, I have made blood donations and know how vital the service is. I encourage any company that is thinking of supporting blood donation to do so.</p><p>I saw the service in action when I worked as a welder for 17 years at Terex in Newhouse. During that time, I was able to give blood regularly because the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service came to the factory and we were all given time off from our daily routine to do so. It was then very easy&#8212;much easier than it is now&#8212;to find the time to make blood donations. I welcome the opportunity to support Rhoda Grant's call for workplace donations.</p><p>When preparing for the debate, I was shocked to learn that the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service requires 1,000 donations every day to meet demand from patients. Some patients have other needs. In October last year, my constituents Robert and Jessie Colson submitted a petition to the Parliament's Public Petitions Committee on behalf of their son Richard, who at that time needed a bone marrow transplant because he suffers from severe aplastic anaemia. Thankfully, Richard received a transplant earlier this year and is making progress back towards good health.</p><p>However, Richard's parents' petition remains under consideration. They are still calling on the Scottish Government to recognise and promote the life-saving impacts that bone marrow testing and donation can have on people who have life-threatening illnesses. For that possibility to be expanded, the Government must provide adequate funding for the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to support bone marrow services and to encourage more donors. That can be done only by getting more blood donations.</p><p>As we know, the Scottish Government funds the SNBTS, which recently announced that it was entering into a collaboration with the Anthony Nolan Trust to improve recruitment of potential bone marrow donors. Again, that must follow additional blood donations. The criteria for joining the Anthony Nolan Trust register are similar to those used by the SNBTS, of which ScotBlood is a part. The only difference is in the age of donors. The age range for the Anthony Nolan Trust is 18 to 40, whereas that for the SNBTS is 18 to 50.</p><p>Earlier this year, ScotBlood and the Anthony Nolan Trust released a statement in which they said that they were joining forces to encourage more Scottish blood donors to join the Anthony Nolan Trust register. As was mentioned in the two previous speeches, we must find ways of <place-holder colnum=\"20059\"/> encouraging people to give blood. It has been suggested that people be paid to do that. Recently, I accompanied Robert Colson to a meeting with officials from the Anthony Nolan Trust, ScotBlood and the Scottish Government, at which we learned that in Germany people who make blood donations are asked to pay to be added to the bone marrow donor register. The idea is that, having invested in getting on to the register, they will remain committed to bone marrow donation. Rather than being paid to get on to the register, people are invited to pay to do so, and the system works very effectively.</p><p>I am sure that members will be aware of ScotBlood's recent initiative, which involves asking people who give blood whether they wish to put their names forward as potential bone marrow donors. People are only asked and encouraged to join the Anthony Nolan Trust register in that initiative&#8212;there is no commitment on collection.</p><p>The Anthony Nolan Trust recruits donors at their workplaces. I know that Rhoda Grant has been championing the idea of getting more blood donations at the workplace, and the benefits are obvious. Members may be aware of the links that the trust has developed with firms such as Virgin Media, which has a facility in my constituency, and which organises similar visits to those that allowed me to give donations at my former workplace. I hope that such links can be developed over the coming months and years.</p><p>I thank Rhoda Grant for bringing the issue to Parliament today. It has allowed me to inform others of the hard work of the Colsons and of others who have done so much to develop a relationship between blood donation and bone marrow donation.

It has also demonstrated that, in debates on issues on which a lot of consensus exists even before we start, it is a good idea for members to leave something out of their opening speech if they know that they will be required to wind up.</p><p>I agree with colleagues who rightly noted the system's positive aspects. John Farquhar Munro outlined the hard work that the committee has undertaken on engagement. It is right that we should thank the clerks whenever the opportunity arises for their hard work in ensuring that MSPs have the opportunity to undertake that engagement. Bruce Crawford mentioned the absence of a requirement for the involvement of MSPs in our system, which is unlike the petitions system at Westminster, where MPs must be involved. The committee took that important step some time ago, as it was found that too many petitions reflected the desire of an MSP to exploit a local situation to grandstand, rather than help a local community engage in the policy process.</p><p>Nanette Milne and Jim Hume highlighted the range of petitions that the committee has addressed and rightly looked forward to consider how we can give access to people so that they raise even more issues for consideration, even if that creates greater consternation for Marlyn Glen. Marlyn Glen identified an important issue in the report and argued that, if local authorities were to set up petitions systems, the petitions that come to the Parliament might be more focused.</p><p>Tricia Marwick and Bruce Crawford helpfully outlined how the SPCB and the Government intend to help expand public engagement, which is welcome. Nigel Don addressed the process of consideration and investigation and made valid points about the danger of making rods for the committee's back and about getting the balance right in meeting the public's needs without <place-holder colnum=\"19872\"/> overburdening the petitions system. That point was driven home by Bill Butler who, typically, put the interests of the public to the fore in considering where that balance should lie. John Wilson proved beyond any doubt that the willing horse gets the most work. My fellow business managers and I appreciate it whenever we find a member who is willing to volunteer and take on responsibilities.</p><p>Helen Eadie talked about change and referred to how John McAllion changed from being a Labour MSP. I am not sure that I welcome that particular type of change through the petitions system. Anne McLaughlin raised the important point that we need to take each petition on its merits, even if the source is narrower than we would like. She is absolutely right that we must focus on taking the Parliament to the people.</p><p>We agree on the positive aspects of the report and the petitions system, but we must recognise that flaws in the system remain and have not been addressed adequately. The main flaw that was highlighted in a report that was produced during my convenership of the committee is that the system is used mostly by people who are already politically active and that the typical petitioner is male, white, middle class and well educated. Several members rightly pointed to that. However, the fact that the issue has not been resolved should not lead to despondency; instead, it should make us all aware of how much remains to be done to make the process genuinely inclusive.</p><p>The consultative steering group identified that the Parliament must engage with groups in Scotland that are too often excluded from the democratic process. The petition that Young Scot lodged in June 2007 was therefore apposite in calling for the use of social media, online technology and other methods that should generate greater involvement with at least one of those groups&#8212;the important one of young people in Scotland.</p><p>During my time on the committee, I always enjoyed considering petitions from young people, especially school students. It was no accident that the 1,000<sup>th</sup> petition came from All Saints secondary school in Glasgow. That petition was heard as part of a civic participation meeting in one of the city's most deprived areas, so it is hardly surprising that the subjects that were covered that day related closely to the concerns that impact most on such communities&#8212;health, crime and financial support for hard-pressed families. That the committee had to get out of the Parliament building and physically meet in the midst of a deprived community to hear those petitions is perhaps indicative of the committee's problem in reaching groups in society that feel distant from our proceedings.<place-holder colnum=\"19873\"/></p><p>As paragraph 88 of the report notes, the innovative approach that the Parliament sought from the outset \"has perhaps been lacking\". That part of the report relates to the use of information and communication technology, but it could just as well refer to the Parliament's general difficulty in encouraging hard-to-reach groups to engage. The debate has shown that the Public Petitions Committee is well aware of that challenge. The test for the rest of the Parliament is to support the committee's efforts on public engagement and social inclusion.</p><p>The report contains good proposals for the use of social networking sites and web technology and on how to develop further the outreach strategy. We rightly continue to pride ourselves on having been at the forefront on civic participation since 1999, but we must now look forward, and the report will stand us in good stead in our efforts to do so.

In asking Dr Carman and Ipsos MORI to look again at our petitions system, Frank McAveety and his colleagues have taken the lead in showing that Parliament is not prepared to rest on its laurels.</p><p>When I am asked&#8212;as we all often are&#8212;what makes the Scottish Parliament different from Westminster, I invariably use our petitions system as the prime example of the central difference that exists, which is that we here are enhancing civic participation in the parliamentary process. Having had the privilege of being convener of the committee throughout the second session of the Parliament, I am particularly proud to have been involved in the introduction of the e-petitioning system. I believe that it enhances access to the policy-making process, which the petitions system was created to achieve from the outset.</p><p>Petitioning of Parliament dates back to the Magna Carta, so our system is far from being unique or novel. However, the way that it operates and the way in which the committee handles petitions make it innovatory. I can testify that the ability to submit a petition to the Parliament electronically was an innovation that intrigued e-democracy exponents from throughout the world when we discussed it in Brussels. The Parliaments of many countries told us at that conference that they use information and communication technology to engage with the public, but we showed that Scotland led the way with discussion forums on our e-petitions system, which bring the world into our deliberations.</p><p>One thing that has been confirmed through Dr Carman's analysis is that it is difficult to gauge the level of attainment of the public petitions system, because assessment of the success of a petition depends on our knowing what the expectations of the petitioner were at the outset of the process. Logic tells us that the degree of anticipation will vary from one person to another. For some petitioners, the mere opportunity to bring their issue to Parliament will be considered a success, whereas for others, no outcome short of hearing total agreement with their views will suffice.</p><p>Some petitions have had an impact on public debate. Some, such as the petition on institutional <place-holder colnum=\"19847\"/> child abuse, have led to debate in the chamber and have brought about policy change. Others have resulted in changes in the law, such as when Parliament legislated in 2003 to prohibit the spreading of raw sewage on agricultural land. More recently, the inquiry into the availability of national health service cancer treatment and the debate on knife crime, which were mentioned by John Farquhar Munro, have clearly enabled members of the public to have a direct input into the political process.</p><p>The committee's report serves to confirm that our public petitions system has developed appreciably since 1999. Dr Carman's report in 2006 identified that some petitioners felt that they were not well informed abut the progress of their petition. It is good to note that the current committee has addressed that situation by providing extracts from each meeting at which the committee considered the petition, information on decisions that the committee took, and links to the <em>Official Report</em> and to Scottish Parliament information centre briefings and the written submissions on the petition that were made to the committee.</p><p>The inquiry shows that there is still a lack of knowledge about the Scottish Parliament's responsibilities and that people are generally unaware of the opportunities that are available for engagement with the petitions system. It has also exposed the fact that, although it has been innovative on e-petitioning, the Scottish Parliament is not maximising the use of modern information technology.</p><p>We showed that we were miles ahead of Westminster on petitioning at the outset of devolution in 1999, and we moved even further ahead in 2004 with our e-democracy, so it is disappointing that, by 2008, Westminster had established a dedicated YouTube channel and was experimenting with Twitter before the Public Petitions Committee had generated its own blog and Wikipedia page. That blog and page will now permit greater interaction between the committee, petitioners and interested members of the public and are welcome additions to the petitions process.</p><p>We must acknowledge that, even with our best efforts so far, there remains a gulf between the Parliament and the public. More work needs to be done, but it is clear that Frank McAveety, his MSP colleagues and the clerks know that their response to the report provides evidence that the petitions system is continually and gradually closing the gap. The report and the implementation of its recommendations will ensure that the gap between the public and the political system will close further and I thank the committee for bringing the report to our attention.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20195663", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Petitions Process Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Public Petitions Committee for providing us with this opportunity, through producing its report, to consider how far the public petitions system has come in the first 10 years of devolution.

The sight of saltires being waved on the tarmac at the airport in Tripoli has shamed Scotland, and it will take years for us to recover from the harm that has been done. We should make no mistake that the Scottish Government's decision has damaged Scotland. The fact that that outcome was abundantly foreseeable indicates that Mr MacAskill was lacking in wisdom.</p><p>There was a clear case for providing Mr al-Megrahi with compassion, but allowing him to be welcomed back to Libya as a free man should not have been the option that was chosen. Palliative care standards in Scotland are of the highest anywhere, and such care can be delivered in a variety of settings. Hospice care does not have to be provided solely within the confines of a hospice building. If Greenock prison was found not to be a suitable location in which to deliver the care that was required, a suitable secure location should and would have been found elsewhere in Scotland had the matter been properly considered.</p><p>We are required to ensure that justice is served against those who harm others&#8212;not retribution, nor vengeance, but fair punishment for the crime that has been committed. I firmly believe that Mr al-Megrahi was entitled to have the best care possible in his illness but, given the fact that he served only 11 days in jail for every victim of the Lockerbie bomb, I do not believe that Mr al-Megrahi was yet entitled to clemency.</p><p>Equally important was the need for integrity in deciding whether compassionate release was warranted. Unfortunately, the entire handling of Mr al-Megrahi's release has been typified by media briefing, leaking and spin from the Scottish Government. Honesty and truth have been lost in <place-holder colnum=\"19055\"/> the decision-making process in this case. As has been pointed out, the Scottish Government has, among other things, misrepresented the medical evidence. Even more serious, it has manipulated the opinion of Strathclyde Police to create the impression that keeping Mr al-Megrahi in Scotland but outwith prison was not a viable option.</p><p>There is also the matter of Mr MacAskill's bizarre reference to the involvement of \"a higher power\", by which we must presume he means God. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice claimed that his decision to show compassion was made on the basis that God had intervened to inflict a terminal illness on Mr al-Megrahi. I hope that I would never be so arrogant as to claim to have more compassion than anyone else. I would certainly never claim to have more compassion than God. It is offensive to suggest that a person who develops cancer has had it inflicted upon them by God for some crime. It is also unworthy of a Scottish Government minister to make that suggestion merely in order to send an ill-judged message to a stereotypical demographic across the Atlantic. I do not know what \"higher power\" Mr MacAskill believes in, but I am confident that my God is not such a callous one.</p><p>It is important to me that Mr al-Megrahi was seen to be treated with humanity, and it is absolutely right that he should be allowed to see out his days with the dignity that was not afforded to the 270 people who died when Pan Am flight 103 was brought down. Mr MacAskill may argue that his decision was based on compassion, but it should also have been a wise, just and honest one&#8212;it was not.

Over the past two years, we have witnessed ever more examples of the strengthening of the tartan Tory alliance, which first emerged in the late 1970s, when the SNP and the Tories combined to bring down a Labour Government, heralding in the Thatcherite destruction of Scotland's economy. [ <em>Interruption.</em> ] Regardless of how many members in other parties might try to refute that, those are the facts.<place-holder colnum=\"18302\"/></p><p>As my Labour colleagues have argued this morning, the Tories could have used their time today to highlight the SNP's dangerous plans to end six-month sentences, they could have debated the state of Scottish schools, and they could have forced the issue on hospital-acquired infection, or the increasing problem of home repossessions. Instead, given the outcome of a similar debate yesterday in Westminster, they are indulging in a pointless debate in order to join with their tartan twins, not to argue for any high moral ideal, but for base political self-interest.</p><p>Even if they are not prepared to hold the Scottish Government to account, we might have found some value in this debate&#8212;I agree entirely with Mike Rumbles on this&#8212;if our opponents had used their time to outline the policies that they would bring to a general election. However, not one policy idea has been forthcoming. We are left to wonder what the purpose would be of a general election now, as our opponents are clearly devoid of any policy ideas on which they would fight a campaign.</p><p>The Tories have told us, however, that they cannot wait to get started on their campaign. I am sure that we will see David Cameron's fake concern for our disadvantaged communities soon enough. It would appear that he will be visiting as many people with no hope and no money as he can, to learn from their experience. His first stop will be Nick Clegg's office.</p><p>The debate has helped to expose yet more of the contempt with which the First Minister treats this place. Alex Salmond would prefer to pop off to Westminster to attempt to repeat history and vote down a Labour Government, than to take part in important votes on sexual offences legislation. I appreciate that he cannot vote in two places at the same time, even though his Westminster expenses claims indicate that he may have the capacity to eat in two places at the same time, but how telling it is that he hates Labour more than he cares for the victims of crime. Alex Salmond has never been able to make his mind up about whether he prefers Westminster to Holyrood. I was going to suggest that he should take a long, hard look in the mirror, but there is no point&#8212;he admires himself so much that he will be doing that anyway.</p><p>The debate has provided us with the opportunity to remind the Scottish people of the 18 years of Thatcherism. Scots remember Ravenscraig, the demolition of the Scottish mining industry and the Tories using Scotland as a guinea pig for their hated poll tax. The tartan Tory alliance claims that we need a general election so that we can restore trust and confidence in Parliament and politicians, but the motion merely exposes the SNP's desire to join forces with the Tories in order to defeat <place-holder colnum=\"18303\"/> Labour. The fact is that the next general election will be a two-horse race between Labour and the Tories. The SNP's support for an election now, as it was in 1979, is calculated to help to put a Tory&#8212;David Cameron&#8212;in office. The SNP wants not an election but a Tory Government. It knows that Scotland dislikes the Tory party and hopes that the election of David Cameron would drive more Scots towards supporting independence.

However, let us not forget that, although they have always existed, hate crimes of any sort have never really been acceptable in Scotland, either to the majority in society or in Scots law. The bill will introduce no new offence or sentencing measures, but it will bring greater and welcome consistency to the handling, recording and sentencing of hate crime. That is why I support it.</p><p>Unfortunately, as with our attempts to legislate away race hate and sectarianism, nothing in the bill says to me that our society will be freer from hate crime just because we pass the bill. Perhaps I see the situation as a glass that is half empty rather than a glass that is half full, as my colleague Bill Butler sees it. That is because, although our police have had numerous additional powers given to them by the Parliament on a range of issues, such as sectarianism and antisocial behaviour, there is little evidence that the police and our courts are using those powers in proportion to the occurrence of the crimes that they exist to tackle.</p><p>For example, a few months ago, I witnessed two inebriated men outside Central station in Glasgow singing \"The Famine Song\" at the top of their voices. Two police officers were asked by a few people to do something about the racist chanting that they were being subjected to, only to find that the officers were not really interested in tackling the incident. I can therefore only hope that the police will reflect on that, given the decision that is likely to be taken today to pass the bill. There is no point in having the law if our law officers do not act on it.</p><p>As I said, all disability organisations welcome the bill, with Inclusion Scotland calling on us to ensure in particular that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the police are equipped to recognise hate crime against disabled people for what it is. I hope that we can achieve that, but if the police's recognition of anti-Irish racism is anything to go by, I have my doubts.</p><p>The bill was introduced as a recommendation of the \"Working Group on Hate Crime Report\", which also recommended doing 13 different things in <place-holder colnum=\"18112\"/> addition to the bill. I therefore hope that all the other recommendations can be acted on as quickly as the call to have legislation enacted was. Again, though, I have my doubts about that.</p><p>In 2004, Capability Scotland conducted a survey that showed that nearly 50 per cent of disabled people had experienced some sort of hate crime in their lives. I was horrified to learn that some disabled people indicated that they accepted hate crime as part of their daily life because of their impairment. That situation is utterly unacceptable and I am pleased that the Parliament has sought to address it, but we should not let people believe that the bill will be an end to the matter. We must continue to address this serious problem in the future, because, as important as the bill is, it is not a panacea. I do not believe that Patrick Harvie believes it to be that; he said that the bill was not a silver bullet.</p><p>The bill should be the starting point of the Parliament driving forward an agenda to address the concerns of the LGBT community and disabled people, and all those minorities who are affected by hate crime, which has not been acceptable and will not be acceptable. We must all encourage the agencies involved to drive forward an agenda that will ensure that hate crime, where it exists, will not be acceptable and will be dealt with, and that Scotland will become a better society because it is the will of the Parliament that it should be so.

Why should that be? I believe that it is because Lanarkshire does not attract the same interest from the Government as those parts of Scotland that favour the governing party. For more evidence of that bias we need look no further than the strategic transport projects review, which clearly favoured projects in other <place-holder colnum=\"16694\"/> areas of Scotland over those in the west of Scotland.</p><p>At a time when unemployment levels in Scotland's traditional heartlands are on the increase, it is nothing short of shameful that the Government's concerns for those areas are diminishing. Only yesterday the latest figures revealed an increase to 5.7 per cent unemployment in my constituency. It would be wrong to blame the Government for the demise of many of the companies that have failed as a result of the worldwide economic downturn, but we can ask the Government where the investment is that is urgently needed to alleviate that adverse economic impact.</p><p>For example, Terex, in my constituency, has made more than 100 people redundant in the past six months. I met representatives of the management there a few weeks ago. I used to work for that firm as an apprentice, and I have a vested interest in seeing the company continue. I asked managers what they needed to happen, in this economic climate, for the company to return to being the thriving business that it once was. They made it absolutely clear that they needed more infrastructure projects. The company makes earth-moving equipment to lay the groundwork for roads and houses, and other capital infrastructure projects. We need investment in that area to allow companies such as Terex to make a comeback.</p><p>In Lanarkshire, we know from our experience of previous recessions that the road network, which centres on my constituency, with the M8 and M74 just 2 miles apart, and with the M80 and major trunk roads in close proximity, forms the basis on which we can combat some of the economic problems that we face. The area has become synonymous with distribution and logistics, which, in the past, have helped to attract numerous major employers, corporate headquarters and inward investment to locate in the many excellent commercial locations across the county, such as Eurocentral. However, rather than the major works that are in the pipeline being advanced, there are signs that they are being subjected to delays. Those projects would benefit from the type of intervention that that the Government pledges to its favoured areas.</p><p>The M74 link is now under construction, but the equally vital upgrade of the remaining section of the A8 to motorway status concerns many people in my area. One company in particular, which seeks to build a connecting road to the existing A8, has brought to my attention the fact that a decision on the road, which was expected in the autumn of 2008, is still no nearer.</p><p>The key junction upgrade at the Raith interchange needs to be completed as quickly as possible to secure the full economic benefits of <place-holder colnum=\"16695\"/> forthcoming schemes and to eliminate unnecessary congestion. Local knowledge is telling us that the timetable for the underpass work at the Raith is slipping. I urge the minister to tell us what he is doing to progress the matter. Delays will bring huge cost to the taxpayer and will mean that people will continue to get caught up in traffic jams at the Raith interchange every day, especially at peak times. The jams can stretch back dangerously far from the roundabout, on to the inside lane of the southbound M74.</p><p>In addition, there are delays to the Ravenscraig development, mostly due to the development's having been downgraded from a national project to a regional project. The biggest brownfield development in Europe is no longer regarded as a priority by the Administration, in yet another sign of anti-Lanarkshire bias. The subsequent shortfall in investment has delayed the dualling of the A723, which connects Ravenscraig to the A8 via Holytown.</p><p>Time does not permit me to go into detail about the many consequences of the Government's continuing failure to invest in transport infrastructure projects in the west of Scotland.

I have had to deal with the issue in one part of my constituency or another on a permanent basis since 1999. My constituency takes in two local authority areas, South and North Lanarkshire, which have different attitudes to dealing with antisocial behaviour. Much has been made of South Lanarkshire Council's initiatives regarding young people, but is it not striking that that council, which is held up as an example, has actually used the measures that are available in the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 more often than North Lanarkshire Council?</p><p>North Lanarkshire Council's strategy was introduced in 2005 and was entitled, \"Building Better Neighbourhoods\". The main aim of the strategy was to make North Lanarkshire a place where people want to live, choose to work, do business and have a fair chance in life; a place where children and young people are safe, respected, responsible and included. If we compare that strategy with the SNP Government's framework, we note that the Government has set out a similar objective. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Councillor Harry McGuigan, COSLA spokesperson for community wellbeing and safety, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I wholeheartedly endorse this new Antisocial Behaviour Framework\",</p><p>given that he is a councillor in North Lanarkshire. For me, the key word in that quotation from Councillor McGuigan is that he believes the Government's framework to be a positive \"new\" approach, but it cannot be new if the council that he serves was marked out for the antisocial behaviour pilot in 2004. It had the same objectives then as the SNP-COSLA alliance want to con us with now.</p><p>I know only too well the plight that antisocial behaviour can cause my constituents, and I understand their frustration at what can often be a lack of progress when they try to persuade the local authority to use the existing antisocial behaviour legislation. The minister spoke about Councillor McGuigan listening to local communities. I well recall the meeting at which almost 100 residents of the Jewel scheme in Bellshill pleaded for support from the local authority and the police to take action to end the blight of antisocial behaviour in their area. On that occasion, I shared a platform with Councillor McGuigan. If he heard the same message that I heard that night, I am surprised that he could put his name to the Government's document.</p><p>The difficulty of securing ASBOs is no reason not to use them. I know that Kenny MacAskill <place-holder colnum=\"16529\"/> believes that youths in our community treat ASBOs like a badge of honour, but how can he explain his comment when, up until March 2008, only 14 ASBOs had been issued on young people between the ages of 12 and 15? On that evidence, ASBOs do not appear to be as popular a symbol as he would suggest. If they were de rigueur, surely more young people would seek to have them.</p><p>A great deal of work is done with young people to prevent the need for an ASBO to be served, so the fact that only a small number of them have been used is more of an indicator of the success of intervention than of a failure in the use of ASBOs. It would be a failure to serve ASBOs on hundreds of young people whose behaviour had not been corrected.</p><p>That conclusion does not sit well with the soft-touch attitude of this Government. ASBOs relate to the prohibition of an individual and are intended to prevent further antisocial acts. They are an intervention and are not designed to be implemented as a criminal punishment. The SNP complains that ASBOs are costly, but the cost to a victim of antisocial behaviour goes way beyond the financial. The justice ministers in this cynical Administration clearly know the cost of justice but not its value: to victims, a few thousand pounds is a small price to pay in exchange for an ASBO if it goes all, or some, of the way to positively affecting someone's offending behaviour.</p><p>Until now, people on the receiving end of unacceptable behaviour could rely on an ASBO to go some way towards stopping that behaviour. Any person or group that has been on the receiving end of antisocial behaviour will realise only too well how frightening and distressing it can be.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14913150", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Antisocial Behaviour Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Throughout my time in the Parliament, I have had to do a lot of thinking about antisocial behaviour.

[<em>Laughter.</em>]</p><p>As the convener of the cross-party group on disability and the father of a disabled daughter, I know only too well the problems that disabled people experience when they try to find a suitable parking space. Not only do they often have a battle to get a car that suits them in the first place, but they then have to battle to park it&#8212;something that so many of us take for granted.</p><p>I have yet to meet a person who will admit to using a disabled parking bay to which they are not entitled, but the problem is widespread. As Duncan McNeil and John Wilson said, the baywatch campaign found that one in five disabled parking bays in Britain are used by drivers who do not have a blue badge.</p><p>I believe that people who misuse disabled parking bays know that they are doing something wrong but do not want others to think badly of them, which is why they are reluctant to confess to their inconsiderate behaviour. Passing the bill is the right thing to do for its own sake, but if the bill also makes people take note of the impact that their selfishness has on others, and on disabled people in particular, it will be a success in more ways than one.</p><p>We have all seen the selfish driver parking in a disabled spot outside the supermarket and jumping out of their car without putting a blue badge in the window. We all know that the space should be used for the benefit of the disabled, who are rightly entitled to park there. As others have said, it is regrettable that we have to legislate to enforce the necessary consideration that everyone else takes for granted.</p><p>There are more than 1 million disabled people in Scotland, of whom more than 225,000 are blue badge holders and 96,000 are wheelchair users. Nearly a quarter of the total population of Scotland are disabled and yet they have to fight their way into a parking space when carrying out a daily chore, such as visiting the supermarket.</p><p>We know that the blue badge scheme can be abused. However, people who use a blue badge might not be the stereotypical disabled person that we would recognise. I am sure that we have all made a comment or two about the selfish driver who parks in a disabled parking bay, but I urge everyone not to be too quick to judge. We must always be careful to look at the disabled person. I concur with the personal perspective that Bob Doris outlined. I have lost count of the number of <place-holder colnum=\"15244\"/> disabled people who have told me that they are often glared at if they park in a disabled bay because they can walk unaided.</p><p>Equally, the available figures tell us that not all disabled people use the blue badge scheme, but they do not tell us the reasons for that. Some disabled people say that they have not applied for the badge because they do not want to use it to take the space of someone more deserving. My daughter, who drives a Motability adapted car, does not have a blue badge, because she believes that the space that she could use should go to someone more in need. That does not make her any less disabled; it indicates her independent judgment on the issue.</p><p>For some disabled people, their car is their lifeline; it is not something that they use as a status symbol, as so many people do. Too often, public transport is not an effective option for disabled people. Leonard Cheshire Disability found that 70 per cent of disabled people state that they cannot rely on public transport. For them, the car is the only way that they can access what we take for granted. The Parliament must continue to address that issue, but, for now, we should support the only bill that promotes the rights of disabled drivers in Scotland.

That seems to me a fundamental human right. However, the unfortunate reality is that, for many conditions, especially non-cancer ones such as lymphoedema or Parkinson's disease, palliative care services are limited and do not reach many of the people who need them the most. My motion focuses on advanced heart failure, which fares particularly poorly in relation to palliative care services.</p><p>Premature mortality from heart disease has fallen significantly in the past 10 years. That is great news, which shows the impact that improved lifestyles, combined with new technological developments and well-organised national health service services, can have. However, one consequence of the decrease in premature mortality from heart disease and the fact that we have an ageing population is that more people than ever before are living with conditions such as heart failure. There are at least 5,500 to 6,000 new cases of heart failure each year in Scotland, but few of those patients receive adequate palliative care support.<place-holder colnum=\"11759\"/></p><p>There is a lot of misunderstanding about what heart failure is, so it is important to say a little about that. Advanced heart failure is a debilitating and life-threatening condition for which there is no cure. Just like any other muscle, the heart can be damaged by trauma such as that which is sustained during a heart attack. Heart failure is the term for when the heart is damaged to the extent that it cannot pump blood round the body properly. Heart failure patients often have distressing symptoms and a worse prognosis and quality of life than many cancer patients. Some patients say that the condition makes them feel as if they are drowning.</p><p>Studies have shown that heart failure is associated with worse long-term survival rates than bowel cancer in men and breast cancer in women. Half of patients with advanced heart failure die within a year of diagnosis and half of the remainder die within five years. In all settings, a significant issue is that many patients with advanced heart failure die suddenly and without having discussed their wishes and needs, as often they have not been advised that their condition is fatal.</p><p>Heart failure needs to be embedded in all initiatives for patients with chronic conditions. Advance care planning for all those with life-limiting illnesses is imperative in all care settings, and closer, collaborative approaches to planning a patient's journey result in care that is appropriate to the stages of their illness. Despite symptoms that are highly distressing for patients and carers, the vast majority of advanced heart failure patients do not get access to palliative care, partly because the likelihood of sudden death makes it difficult to predict individual prognosis.</p><p>Before the summer recess, the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on palliative care discussed the contents of the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care report \"Living and dying with advanced heart failure: a palliative care approach\", which was part-funded by the British Heart Foundation Scotland. One question that emerged was why the palliative care needs of patients with advanced heart failure were often neglected. One reason was health professionals' uncertainty about the condition, especially with regard to the point at which a patient enters the terminal phase. The fact that that point is much more difficult to predict for heart failure patients than it is for those with other conditions, especially cancer, can leave health professionals unwilling to enter into the discussions with patients that are needed at the end-of-life stage. As in many other areas of health care, good communication is absolutely critical.</p><p>Another reason why so few advanced heart failure patients get palliative care is that services have traditionally focused on cancer patients' <place-holder colnum=\"11760\"/> needs. However, that expertise can be used to develop appropriate services for end-of-life care for non-cancer conditions. There are some great examples of such work already, especially in the voluntary sector.</p><p>Indeed, as convener of the CPG on palliative care, I have been made aware of the fantastic proposal by the British Heart Foundation and Marie Curie Cancer Care to establish a centre of excellence in Glasgow that will provide a comprehensive palliative care service for advanced heart failure patients and their families. The organisations' combined expertise will not only create a gold standard in palliative care for advanced heart failure, but pioneer a model of care for patients in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom. With Marie Curie's expertise in palliative care working in tandem with the BHF's cardiovascular expertise, that comprehensive service will benefit not only heart failure patients at the end of life but their families, especially in the west of Scotland, where the problem is prevalent.</p><p>The Scottish Government has acknowledged that the palliative care needs of patients with conditions other than cancer are not being adequately met. The Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network guideline 95 on heart failure specifically recommended that a palliative approach be adopted at the early stage of the disease and the recent consultation that was published on the coronary heart disease and stroke strategy has stated that the palliative care needs of advanced heart failure patients still require attention. As a result, I warmly welcome the new palliative care strategy, especially the ring-fenced &#163;3 million of annual funding.</p><p>New approaches to palliative care will need to link up with established managed clinical networks, particularly those that work well for coronary heart disease and stroke services. Such an approach will permit continuity of care with, for example, the specialist heart failure nurses funded by the BHF, who are already working with many of these patients in every health board area. However, as the Royal College of Nursing has pointed out, that will pose a real challenge to the commitment of health boards and services in community, acute and care home settings to release staff for training. Although the University of the West of Scotland provides nurse education for most of the health board areas in the west of the country, shortages in the clinical area mean that nurses cannot be released for education and, as a result, many classes lie half empty.</p><p>I welcome the focus on non-cancer conditions, particularly organ failure, and the approach to care that is person centred and based on patient and carer needs rather than on diagnosis or prognosis. It is crucial that we maintain that focus, because <place-holder colnum=\"11761\"/> there is a danger that the new money could be diverted into cancer-specific services, where pathways are well established, when the most urgent and pressing need is a focus on non-cancer conditions such as advanced heart failure.</p><p>If ever there was an issue on which there should be a consensus across the political divide, it is this one. I hope that we all agree on one simple point: regardless of the diagnosis, everyone who needs palliative care should get it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138488", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Advanced Heart Failure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Few people would disagree with the view that all patients who are reaching the end of their lives and who require a palliative approach to treatment should be able to get it regardless of their condition.

It is worth acknowledging the fact that since May 2007 I have not had to deal with one piece of constituency work relating to the issue; in fact, I have received no local correspondence on electoral systems in the nine years for which I have been an MSP. However, the matter is important, even if the electorate do not get as animated about it as we do.</p><p>As members have pointed out, the democratic process is a vital component of an orderly society. Those who participate in the process must be assured that the system is just and will result in an outcome in which they can have confidence; whether people write to us in the aftermath of any problems that arise is not the issue.

Surely it is time for us to move on from what happened last May and to concentrate on introducing the recommendations that members of the Local Government and Communities Committee have made.</p><p>I agree with many of the committee's recommendations, but I am not entirely convinced by the view that there should be decoupling of Scottish Parliament and local government elections. I say to Mr McLetchie that if this were a show trial, I would be heading to the gulag. I accept that I have lost the argument on decoupling, but my concerns about the decision remain. Many colleagues in the chamber and in local authority chambers across Scotland agree with decoupling, because they believe that it will enable the public to distinguish clearly between the work that is done here in Holyrood and the work that local authorities do. I am not sure that the Scottish Government will always welcome decoupling as warmly as it does now, given the problems that it has created for local government through the partnership that it has established with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities&#8212;the famous hysterical concordat. Decoupling will allow us to give closer scrutiny to what local authorities have or have not done with the reduced funding that the Scottish Government has provided. I wonder whether the hysterical con will stand up to that scrutiny.</p><p>I add a note of caution on the recommendation. We should not forget that turnout at local elections was on a downward trend before 1999. Many people believed that the reason for the decline was that the first-past-the-post system discouraged voters from turning out; they tried to convince us that putting in place a proportional representation system would help to overcome the problem. However, we cannot trust that simplistic analysis. If having a PR system encourages voter turnout, turnout in the proportional elections to this Parliament should be higher than in the first-past-the-post elections to Westminster, but we all know that that has not been the case. There is a real danger of reduced turnout in local elections. I wonder whether the situation will change when local elections are again held separately, as that would be to the detriment of our local authorities.</p><p>For me, the most important recommendation in the committee's report and in the Gould report is that the administrative side of Scottish Parliament elections should be passed to the Parliament. I am in favour of such a move, but I do not believe that total control of those elections should be passed to the Parliament&#8212;I am pleased that the legislative part of the process will remain at Westminster.

The report is a wide-ranging and comprehensive analysis of the problems that foot-and-mouth disease can bring to urban communities as well as to rural communities.</p><p>My constituency of Hamilton North and Bellshill is home to only four small farms, which make up little of the local economy. More than 1,500 jobs rely on fish processing in my constituency, which puts the scale of farming in it into context. However, those jobs give me as a representative of a landlocked urban constituency more than a passing interest in rural affairs.</p><p>My area is synonymous with logistics and transportation; it is also home to one of the largest rendering plants in Scotland. Therefore, when a foot-and-mouth problem emerges, my constituency&#8212;particularly the community of Newarthill&#8212;becomes central to addressing one of its outcomes. I fully understand the importance of abattoirs and rendering plants because of that and commend their work in general terms. However, more attention must be paid to the impact of those businesses on the communities in which they are established, particularly during periods of crisis.</p><p>The extensive use of the Omoa works in my constituency when animal culls were necessary highlighted several issues. As the plant is some distance from where the animals involved are reared, the carcases are transported hundreds of miles to it. Many of us will find it hard to remember a hot summer in Scotland, but when a local plant exudes nauseating odours into the air around urban villages even in the dead of winter, members can imagine the level of the problem that a little heat can add to the already abhorrent smell that comes from the plant. I assure those who are not familiar with that smell that it is one of the most awful smells that anyone has the misfortune of experiencing. I grew up in Newarthill. Like others in the village, I had to live with the smell day in and day out.</p><p>I am in no way suggesting that rural communities should suffer the smell just because they produce its source. I am saying that the regulation of such plants must be stringent, so that, wherever an abattoir or rendering plant is located, it has no adverse impact on its surroundings. I am not suggesting that the plant in my constituency needs to be closed. I welcome the jobs that it provides, but I urge a drive to make abattoirs local. Positive aspects of that would be employment opportunities for local people and the obvious reduction in carbon emissions.</p><p>Had the previous owners of the Omoa works remained in place, I would have argued for the plant's closure&#8212;I argued for that in the past. At <place-holder colnum=\"11506\"/> the time of the foot-and-mouth crisis, the plant made great play of the fact that it was indispensable, so it was above the law. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency had a terrible problem in trying to make the company comply with odour emission regulations. The company had a strong bargaining position and knew it, so it felt under no obligation to respect the community. In that period, the emissions that affected local communities increased beyond the serious existing problem. However, the plant is now under new ownership and is operating in a manner that locals accept is greatly improved. That is clear evidence&#8212;if it were needed&#8212;that rendering facilities are not a problem in themselves.</p><p>For practical reasons, it makes more sense for dead animals to be transferred to a facility that is close to the area where they were killed. That would mean that the smell that is generated is not as strong as that which my constituents experience all too often when dead animals are transferred from places such as Aberdeenshire and beyond and are left to putrefy in lorries while waiting to be rendered, having decayed as they travelled hundreds of miles.</p><p>Abattoirs provide a useful service, but the sector should have more competition, so that communities are not blighted by selfish companies such as that which operated in my constituency. I urge the Scottish Government to develop more local abattoirs to help the farming industry first and foremost, and to give us a more effective and competitive system when disposing of animals during crises that diseases such as foot and mouth cause.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Some members may be surprised that I am taking part in this debate&#8212;some of our front-bench members certainly are&#8212;but I hope that my colleagues from rural parts of Scotland will not mind my intruding on their territory.

He will find there details of the new PPP projects that the Irish Government is taking forward, such as the Waterford bypass, the new criminal courts complex and five new secondary schools.

The \"Scottish Budget Spending Review 2007\", which contains the framework, presents us with buzz words, managementspeak and meaningless baloney, all aimed at telling us that the Government's economic strategy aims to do this or that. However, there is nothing in the <place-holder colnum=\"8470\"/> framework that even hints at how those aspirations are to be met.</p><p>We are to have \"high level Purpose targets\" and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Five Strategic Objectives support delivery of the Purpose\".</p><p>We are informed that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The whole of the public sector will, for the first time, be expected to contribute to one overarching Purpose\".</p><p>However, nowhere are we let in on the secret of how the Government intends this so-called purpose ever to be achieved. Based on the Government's record up to now, we can conclude only that, in short, it intends to pass the buck. The historic concordat comes to the rescue again. It is dragged out every time the Government is asked how something will be achieved&#8212;\"It's in the historic concordat,\" we are told. There is no need for any explanation of what exactly we are debating this afternoon, because it is not for this Government to explain anything.</p><p>The debate before us, therefore, amounts to a request for us to keep our fingers crossed, let the Government take the credit for what our public sector does right and blame the public sector for what might go wrong, even if it cannot admit, despite the growing evidence, that things are going wrong.</p><p>Quite simply, that is not good enough. Scotland's public services are crucial to the fabric of our country. Our people value services such as education, health care and public transport far too much to leave them to chance. Modern and efficient public services lie at the very heart of a productive and fair society, which is why Labour believes in our public services and the people who deliver them.</p><p>Yes, public services must improve their productivity, efficiency and performance. Service users and taxpayers have a right to expect that their hard-earned money is being spent on the right things and that public services are getting value for that money. Service users and taxpayers have to be confident that what is available is being used to best effect. What really counts is what people get for what is put in from the public purse. That is not a responsibility that this Government or any Government can abdicate, but, unfortunately, that is what this Government wants to do.</p><p>The Government needs to tell us how it will tackle the variations in performance across our public services and bring all services up to the standards that are presently achieved by the best. Differences in performance are too marked at present and could get worse if single outcome agreements are not tight enough.<place-holder colnum=\"8471\"/></p><p>No one should be against local flexibility, but wide variations and postcode lotteries are not acceptable either.</p><p>How will the Government address variations in the cost of services between authorities? What will the Government do to help us spread more effective and efficient practice throughout Government? The Government could have used this afternoon to answer those questions. Instead, we have had yet another insubstantial motion that tells us nothing and a debate that the Government hopes will allow it to skate around the issue. The motion confirms that the Government stands for spin over substance and perception over reality. It believes its own spin and has entered a delusional world if it thinks that the motion is good enough for the people of Scotland.</p><p>Unfortunately, if we look through the document for examples of what we could be debating this afternoon, we find, on biodiversity, that the Government is going to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"increase the index of abundance of terrestrial breeding birds\".</p><p>I do not know whether that means that it will try to count penguins or explore the possibility of breeding in midair. We have to know exactly what that means. That is no more meaningful than the objective to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Increase the proportion of adults making one or more visits to the outdoors per week\",</p><p>which leaves us with a vision of wardens going around our local communities, dragging people out into the street to ensure that that is what the Scotland of the future will be.</p><p>That is not efficient Government; it is baloney.

As others have noted, Enable's petition arose from its concern that an FAI is not mandatory when people die in hospital care and that the outcomes of FAIs are not legally binding. The other petition <place-holder colnum=\"7490\"/> arose from the family's desire for fatal accident inquiries to be mandatory in the case of road deaths caused by careless driving.</p><p>At the moment, a fatal accident inquiry following a road crash is held only at the discretion of the Lord Advocate and is mandatory only if the driver has died while driving in the course of his or her employment. The driver who caused the accident on the A725 Bellshill bypass in my constituency had travelled from Preston to the accident site in two hours and five minutes. For someone complying with the speed limits, a journey over that distance should take more than three hours and 10 minutes.</p><p>The outcome of the subsequent court case led the victim's family to question why it is possible for someone to be tried and convicted for driving with such speed and carelessness that their actions led to the ending of a life yet for that death not even to be acknowledged by the judicial system. How can lessons be learned from road accidents if no inquiry follows them? The family had to come to the Public Petitions Committee to put pressure on the Crown Office into granting an FAI to answer the family's questions because the current system had so obviously failed them.</p><p>As Margaret Smith pointed out, Enable lodged its petition primarily to address concerns about the implementation of the recommendations of fatal accident inquiries. It seems an almost incredible set of circumstances that an outcome of an FAI should have no legal force and that the sheriff's determinations and recommendations can be ignored. When such recommendations are made, should there not be some means by which they are monitored to ensure that they are acted on? Should they not be dealt with in an arena in which individuals or charities such as Enable are not required to pursue the implementation of the sheriff's recommendations? Those are fundamental questions, which I hope and am confident that Lord Cullen will address.</p><p>I believe that FAIs should be inquisitorial rather than adversarial. They should get at the answers rather than provoke conflict between those asking the questions and those responding, who may be defensive because of the type of questions that are asked. I think that the current arrangements lead to defensive responses. That does not help us to get to the truth of the matter, nor does it help to prevent the situation from happening again.</p><p>We certainly need a wide review of the purpose of fatal accident inquiries and the circumstances in which they are held, but there should also be a recognition that families and victims should be at the centre of such inquiries. There will be great merit in Lord Cullen's review if he can consider those issues. It would be worth considering having a presumption in favour of holding a fatal accident <place-holder colnum=\"7491\"/> inquiry for all road deaths because of the lessons that can be learned. If the Crown Office is concerned that families may not want an FAI, let the matter be judged on the basis of whether the family has asked for there not to be an FAI. The current presumption against holding an FAI forces families to come to the Public Petitions Committee to get the answers that they rightly seek and to which they are entitled. Would it not be preferable to assume that an FAI should be held unless the family would rather that the issues surrounding the loss of their loved one were not brought into the public domain?</p><p>When the committee took up the issues, the previous Lord Advocate stated that families' views are sought on whether there should be a fatal accident inquiry. However, I wonder how proactively that is done and, indeed, why such action is taken at all, given that families' views are not the decisive factor in determining whether an inquiry should take place.</p><p>The fundamental question that arose when we considered the petitions was who decides what is in the public interest. Should the Crown Office make that determination, or should those who are affected by the death of a loved one have more input and emphasis than those who seek to judge from their, dare I say it, detached position on the events that led to someone's death? If Lord Cullen's review provides an answer only to that fundamental question, it will have been a worthwhile exercise. From my experience of the demand for and the process of FAIs, and from the information that the committee received, the process has left far too many members of the public dissatisfied with a system that was created for the public and which is supposed to operate in the public interest.</p><p>We must put the public at the heart of the system. I am sure that no one in the Crown Office wants to be seen not to do that, but the experience of the committee when we considered the issue was that what happens seems to be the converse of what the system is supposed to achieve. Lord Cullen's review must address that. I am confident that, if he addresses that fundamental question, he will get to the root of the dissatisfaction that people feel with the system.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401894", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fatal Accident Inquiries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I had the privilege of being convener of the Public Petitions Committee, two of the most harrowing petitions that I encountered, from Enable and from the family of a fatal accident victim, sought amendments to the Fatal Accident and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976.

A sick person matters to the last moment of their life. Medical professionals can help someone to die peacefully, but also to live until they die.

Murdo Fraser was right to make that point.</p><p>The convention of ministerial responsibility predates the modern party system. As democracy and society have developed in Britain, so too has the requirement continually to enhance ministerial accountability. We believe that the convention of ministerial responsibility is a mechanism through which the Parliament can control ministers. Responsibility must focus on the minister, with a clear line of accountability to the Parliament. In today's debate, we seek to ensure that we in the Parliament adhere to that ideal. As Jackie Baillie said, if the SNP wants to be seen as a modern and progressive party&#8212;not that it is&#8212;that should be its perspective.</p><p>Counter to that ideal is another historical perspective that favours executive control. Its main proponent was Sir Robert Peel, who wanted ministers to be supported by a loyal party that tried to prevent Parliament from interfering in the workings of Government. In that context, the executive inverts ministerial responsibility and <place-holder colnum=\"6414\"/> seeks to diminish the role of the Parliament. Based on the arguments that we heard this morning, it could easily be said that that is the attitude that the SNP Government and its slavishly devoted back benchers have adopted. I give Joe FitzPatrick and Keith Brown as perfect examples. In particular, Joe FitzPatrick did his impersonation of a political lava lamp&#8212;he used an awful lot of energy but did not shed much light on anything.</p><p>We have to accept that, as society evolves, new challenges and responsibilities are placed at the doors of ministers. However, one thing remains constant. Parliament matters, and in the balance of power between the Executive and the Parliament, the Parliament must remain the primary institution.</p><p>Errors are inevitable in Government, and George Foulkes and Hugh Henry quite eloquently pointed out where errors have been made. The mark of a good Government is not simply to be found in how it overcomes the problems that errors create; the real test is whether it acknowledges and takes responsibility for them. Good government is certainly not to be found in refusing to recognise them, as the First Minister has done again and again.</p><p>The First Minister is the guardian of the Scottish ministerial code, by which ministerial responsibility is tested. We in the Labour Party believe that the record so far shows that Alex Salmond cannot be trusted to apply the code. As a result, we must re-establish the authority of Parliament over ministers. If, as we suspect, the Government regards itself as the primary institution in the political framework in Scotland, ministers are deluding themselves, and they must and will be held to account by the Parliament.</p><p>It is clear that the First Minister, in his actions, is not applying the code effectively. Surely he would prefer transparency over ambiguity and accountability over accusation. We merely ask him what he has to fear from giving us the results of the review that he told us he was going to have. Bruce Crawford said that the First Minister is bomb-proof. I conclude by asking him to come out of the bunker and face independent oversight.

A decade after Kennedy's speech in 1961, Greenpeace was founded as a result of concerns about the development of nuclear power generation. Thirty years on, its founder Patrick Moore is now telling the environmental movement that it needs to update its views as nuclear energy may just be the energy source that can save our planet. He is not saying that it is the answer but that it may be part of the solution.

The late Bishop Hugh Montefiore, founder and director of Friends of the Earth, was forced to resign from that group's board for writing a pro-nuclear article in a church newsletter after having looked at the scientific evidence. All the people whom I have mentioned have recognised that all options must be explored, for good economic and technological reasons.</p><p>Not all forms of new renewables technology have been shown to have anything beyond the potential to be economically feasible on a large scale. Equally, no current storage technology exists on the scale required.</p><p>Carbon capture has been mentioned repeatedly this morning, and the basis for looking at carbon capture and sequestration were outlined by my colleague Lewis Macdonald. However, carbon capture is no more than a prototype technology at best, and there are no guarantees that a gas pumped under the sea at several times ambient pressure will not leak. Will the minister tell us what environmental assessments the Government has done to quantify the possibility of such leaks happening and their impact?</p><p>We can all give good examples of where new technology is being used to take us forward in positive and commendable ways. In my constituency, Argent Energy established a biodiesel plant, which has rightly won awards for its innovative technology. However, the reality is that the plant draws its source from the abattoir and rendering plant next door, which lacks the capacity to deal with the demand for the by-products that allow the biodiesel to be produced. It has just had its licence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency withdrawn because of the odour emissions that it creates in the local community. There is a downside to almost every technology&#8212;there are pluses and minuses, and we should consider them all in the round.</p><p>President Kennedy was right: knowledge of renewables is increasing, but much remains for us to learn before we know for sure what will be required to meet Scotland's future energy needs. <place-holder colnum=\"5159\"/></p><p>Until we do, nuclear power has to be considered as a viable and reliable future technology.

The various parties that are represented in the Parliament may have different visions for the future of the country, but a Scotland in which each person is provided with the equality of opportunity to reach their potential and fulfil their aims must be common to them all. To aspire towards anything less will only ensure that history records us as having failed to dismantle the institutionalised discrimination that prevents marginalised communities from realising their potential for themselves and for Scotland.</p><p>To get consensus on that is the easy bit&#8212;the motherhood and apple pie of any equality debate.

VisitScotland, which has a major role to play in persuading the rest of the world to visit Glasgow for the Commonwealth games does not even have a race equality scheme, in spite of that being a legal requirement for all public bodies.</p><p>Equality impact assessments of all functions and policies of public bodies, which are required by law to meet race, disability and gender equality duties, are a powerful tool for identifying and removing barriers to a person's equality of access to, and experience of, public services, as well as for accessing work opportunities within those services. Unfortunately, however, such assessments are as scarce as the Government's equality commitments in its budget, as the evidence that was provided by the equality organisations that were represented at yesterday's meeting of the Equal Opportunities Committee clearly outlined.</p><p>The Government has published on its website the outcomes of just two equality impact assessments. Is that really the sum total of the policies and functions that are available to the Scottish Government, or is it another comment on just how poorly committed it is to using the tools that the major equality communities agree will significantly dismantle the barriers to equality?</p><p>As I have said, we must move on&#8212;and quickly&#8212;from merely working towards delivering equality to starting to deliver measurable, person-centred changes that will enable people from all the equality communities to reach their potential. Despite changing attitudes and improvements in some areas, Scotland has not moved far or fast enough in eliminating discrimination and building a model of equality that is meaningful to everyone in the country.</p><p>The minister spoke about the report by the Equal Opportunities Committee on the Gypsy Traveller community. I was proud to play a role in that in the first session of the Parliament. I was disappointed that previous Executives did not go as far as we would have liked in delivering on that report's recommendations. However, that was not because of a lack of effort&#8212;I know the former ministers who were involved in considering and developing those issues. The reality was that that could not simply be done by the Scottish Executive, and it could not be done by diktat. It required buy-in. It required targets. It required public bodies, such as the national health service, <place-holder colnum=\"3838\"/> social services and education authorities, to commit to achieving what was set out in the Equal Opportunities Committee's recommendations.</p><p>I am concerned that the Government's budget proposals do not contain targets.

I thank all members who have stayed behind to participate in, or listen to, what I consider a very important debate.</p><p>As I mention in my motion, the public-social partnership pilot in North Lanarkshire is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an innovative method of engaging communities in public service design and delivery\".</p><p>Public-social partnerships, which are based on an Italian planning approach, are a dynamic new mechanism for Scotland. PSPs bring together local authorities and social enterprises to create services that benefit the local community. Social enterprises are a diverse sector and include credit unions, housing associations, community development programmes and co-operatives, among others. Research by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2001 indicated that there were 1,100 social enterprises in Scotland, employing 30,000 people and adding &#163;1.25 billion to our economy.</p><p>PSPs are a new approach to public service delivery. They allow contracts to reflect the added benefits that community organisations can bring to the running of services by including community and environmental clauses. The public-social partnership pilot in North Lanarkshire took place this year and has been led by the Community Recycling Network for Scotland with support from Edinburgh-based social enterprise, Forth Sector.<place-holder colnum=\"2812\"/></p><p>The PSP in North Lanarkshire focused on three services that were provided by the housing department: furniture storage for people who became homeless; an emergency furniture loan service; and permanent furniture packs. Those three services were provided by the groups participating in the PSP, which were Beulah Scotland, St Patrick's furniture project and RECAP&#8212;the recycling emergency community action programme. To date, those partners in the PSP have delivered help to 62 families. They will continue to help families in a similar situation until the end of this month, when the pilot will end and the content of the contract will be confirmed.</p><p>The pilot has had many benefits, not just for North Lanarkshire Council but for all the tenants who use the services that it provides. Tenants now have a choice of furniture for their home and purchase their furniture with vouchers, rather than just being given furniture that will do. That helps to ensure that tenants are treated with dignity at all times.</p><p>I am proud that North Lanarkshire Council has led the field with this ground-breaking pilot, which has great potential, for which the council should be recognised. The success of the pilot, and the council's belief in its social and economic benefits, have resulted in other councils making inquiries about how they can follow North Lanarkshire's lead. Furthermore, other departments within North Lanarkshire Council&#8212;such as the environmental services and social work departments&#8212;are now exploring the possibility of entering into a PSP agreement. I very much welcome that.</p><p>Local authorities may wish to establish a PSP because it would give them an opportunity to look in detail at the service that they provide. They could pilot the PSP in advance of tender. Any cost-saving mechanisms would therefore be identified, and any problems fixed, at an early stage, before the contract was permanently granted.</p><p>PSPs allow the public sector to draw on their expertise and resources in order to share in the design of a more effective public service. They help to provide a service that is good value for money&#8212;something that North Lanarkshire Council recognised was not being provided by the existing service.</p><p>The PSP is a people-centred service that meets local needs and achieves many added benefits. One such benefit is the additional 12 local jobs that the pilot has brought to North Lanarkshire, benefiting the community both socially and economically.</p><p>However, for the PSP programme to be rolled out across Scotland, some lessons need to be learned from the North Lanarkshire model. The <place-holder colnum=\"2813\"/> main lesson is that PSP participants, in both the public and private sectors, must agree on a shared problem definition and a shared solution to the problem if PSPs are to be successful nationally. That was identified as a barrier in the pilot because the steering group and the service design group did not meet to share their ideas regularly.</p><p>In March of this year, the Scottish Government issued \"Better business&#8212;A strategy and action plan for social enterprise in Scotland\". The strategy was aimed at providing a better support service for social enterprises in winning public service contests. PSPs represent an opportunity to meet that aim. I hope that the Government considers them a viable option, given the success of the pilot in North Lanarkshire.</p><p>Social enterprises do an awful lot of good work in our local communities and they need our support, but at root they need support from local authorities. I was disappointed to hear recently that some local authorities have begun to e-tender for services in a way that treats the clients who are served by social enterprises simply as job lots. Such retendering processes happen in a way that is the antithesis of all that the PSP pilot has shown to be good in the way that we can deal with matters on behalf of our local communities. It is vital that the minister addresses that issue by speaking to those local authorities that believe that to be a better way than the one that has been rolled out in North Lanarkshire. I believe that they will find that the North Lanarkshire model is the way forward and that alternatives will be to the detriment of the development of our social enterprises.</p><p>I thank Antonia Swinson and others from the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition who brought the issue to my attention and encouraged me to lodge the motion that we are debating tonight. I welcome comments from colleagues on the types of social enterprises that exist in their areas and I look forward to hearing examples of the good work in our local communities that is supported by social enterprises. I commend to colleagues \"How social enterprises can deliver for Scotland\", which is hot off the press today. I also commend that new agenda to local authorities, so that they can work better with those who can serve our communities because they understand and come from those communities.</p><p>I thank members for taking the time to join in this evening's debate, and I look forward to the minister's comments.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390383", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public-Social Partnership Pilot (North Lanarkshire)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is with great pleasure that I bring this debate to the chamber this evening.

Indeed, the misuse of alcohol has probably become the major source of most of society's ills&#8212;literally, in respect of its health impacts.</p><p>Alcohol is a powerful drug, but it can be a source of enjoyment if it is used properly. That is the problem that we must face in debates on alcohol or alcoholism. Alcohol is too often a problem, but we can do more than hope that it will not be a problem for ever. As members have said, we must change attitudes so that alcohol use can be more of a social and health benefit&#8212;if that is possible&#8212;than a problem.</p><p>That was why I welcomed the enactment of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 in the previous parliamentary session. It was the first legislation for many years that not only attempted to tackle how the sale of alcohol was regulated but tried to educate those who mistreat drink into adopting more appropriate alcohol-related behaviour. I took slight issue with Hugh O'Donnell when he said that we had tinkered around with the issue for too long; in fairness, no one could say that the 2005 act tinkered around with the issue. It addressed the fact that its subject matter was not only a criminal justice issue but a health problem that cost our national health service more than &#163;1 billion a year. One in 10 accident and emergency admissions was attributed to alcohol. People who lived in the most deprived areas of Scotland were four times more likely to die an alcohol-related death than those in less deprived areas. We could no longer allow such things to happen, and we tried to ensure that they did not.</p><p>That the act aimed to tackle underage and binge drinking in particular was vital. The attitudes of far too many people towards drink were becoming alarmingly dangerous. That was why we focused on bringing into the licensing regulations many modern social trends that had overtaken the existing legislation, such as dial-a-drink services and party limousines. Members who were also members in the previous session will be sick of hearing me banging on about those two things, which I did as the Licensing (Scotland) Bill went through the Parliament. However, the police raised such issues with me because they had identified that no legislation existed to allow them to deal with the trends that had emerged. Such issues were having such an immediate impact on the attitudes of young people that addressing them <place-holder colnum=\"2774\"/> became important and the bill was the vehicle that allowed us to consider them.</p><p>It is right to blame underage drinkers for much of the havoc that alcohol can bring to society, but we must be careful not to single out a particular group, because the misuse of alcohol is a widespread problem that occurs across all age groups and social backgrounds. In fact, alcohol-related hospital discharges are most common in the 45-to-54 age group. That certainly surprised me and such statistics may surprise many other people.</p><p>Licensed premises that make money from the sale of alcohol must recognise that they are part of a community and that they provide a service that is unlike any service that other businesses provide. Given that such premises have an impact on wider society, we should ask them to pay a bit more if they do not provide their service responsibly. Therefore, I support the cabinet secretary in holding licensees to account for the social problems that they exacerbate as a result of their poor sales practice, just as I supported Paul Martin when he first raised that issue in 2005. I am sorry that other parties that were represented in the chamber failed to give their support, but it is a case of better late than never, I suppose.</p><p>I pay tribute to Kenny Gibson in particular for his speech. My parents were teetotallers, and I did not have to endure the types of experiences that he obviously had to. When I was thinking about what I would say, I wondered how I could bring some reality to the debate. The only story that I could think of was a light-hearted one that a friend told me recently. I do not want to tell it because I want to tell a joke; rather, I want to make a point.</p><p>The story is about a married couple who were sitting in a restaurant one evening. At an adjacent table, a woman was becoming uproariously drunk. Most people in the restaurant were being distracted by her, but the woman in the couple noticed that her husband was paying particular attention to the drunk woman and her behaviour, so she asked him why. He said, \"You don't know this, but I was formerly engaged to that lady. It was about 10 years ago, before we were married.\" He went on, \"I have had a happy life since that time. She has taken to drink in the manner that you see throughout all that time.\" His wife said, \"That's a long time to celebrate.\" The point is that people see the use of alcohol differently. We have to strike a balance on the issue. Some will use alcohol appropriately and others will not. Some licensees will take their responsible seriously while others will be more lax. Some people think that alcohol is evil and want it to be restricted; others see it as a good thing and want easier access. If the minister gets the <place-holder colnum=\"2775\"/> balance right, I will support his efforts to address one of Scotland's most serious problems.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390286", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, as the issue that is being discussed is important not only to parts of   Scotland, but to every neighbourhood and all individuals who make up our communities.

As people do when they get together at such times, members of the older generations shared reminiscences of times gone by, as they looked back on the life of the one who had departed. The names of people long since gone tripped off the tongues of the assembled mourners. \"Do you remember Such-and-such, the chemist?\" one asked. \"What about that Mr So-and-so, who had the corner shop?\" They even remembered my own great-grandfather, who owned the yard behind the Crown Bar in Holytown. Someone went on to say, \"What was the name of the moneylender who lived down the miners' rows? What a character he was. He saved many a wean from starving. Mind you, you didn't want to cross him.\" Today, we hear about the same moneylenders and we agree that they operate in a culture of fear. They think that they are above the law. They are the lowest form of social vulture, and they are involved in criminality that is among the worst forms of antisocial behaviour that affects our communities today, but their predecessors can be remembered almost with fondness by decent people who living in the communities in which they used to operate. I was staggered to hear that. I had to interject and point out that we also used to send children up chimneys and send girls down the pits. They were not the good old days. There I was, listening to people who were talking as though they thought that moneylenders today were different from the ones they knew in their youth. I asked them, and the consensus was that there was a difference&#8212;\"That was then; this is now.\" The moneylender of their day was a member of the community, a necessary evil. The ones who lend money now, however, are viewed as gangsters, thugs and the lowest forms of scum.</p><p>I was reminded that there were no credit unions then, which is a significant point to acknowledge. That brought home to me just how important the credit union movement is in our modern society. No longer are the people to whom I have referred prepared to accept the illegal moneylender, no matter how much they might have tolerated them previously. They do not see the need for people to go to illegal moneylenders because of that difference: the credit unions. They understand that communities need to work together to prevent people who are in need from putting themselves at the mercy of today's criminal element, and they look to their credit union for that.<place-holder colnum=\"32642\"/></p><p>Today, the provision of personal finance services, with access to low-cost flexible loans and secure savings facilities via credit unions makes absolute sense to us all. It seems that we now have to do more to ensure that that vital service becomes more widely available. We need to increase choice and access to a range of more appropriate financial products that are suitable for people on low incomes, as other members have said in the debate.</p><p>One thing is certain in this life: we will all go out in a box. Sometime hence, people will sit around, reminiscing about this period, as I heard people doing a few weeks ago. I doubt that they will remember with any affection our moneylenders of today&#8212;I hope that they do not. Moneylenders should be a thing of the past&#8212;a distant memory&#8212;if we get it right. Much work has been done to bring that about and, if we put further development of credit unions at the core of our efforts to bring financial assistance to the poorer sections of our society, we can build on the good start that has been made, which is helping bring about the much-needed change in our attitudes to illegal moneylenders. I commend the Executive for its work, particularly its work to support our credit unions, and I look forward with confidence to the results of the latest assistance that it has provided.</p><p>I remember joining the then Deputy Minister for Communities, Johann Lamont, a year or so ago, when she came to a credit union in Newarthill to launch one of the new innovative support mechanisms that the Scottish Executive had introduced to ensure that the credit unions that most of our communities now take for granted were given the support that they needed to continue the work that most people now recognise they do.</p><p>I also praise the Scottish ministers for working with ministers at Westminster in targeting resources directly at the criminals. As has already been said this morning, those are the people we are dealing with. We are not dealing with fly-by-nights who just happen to find themselves in a community where they can use their skills to make a quick buck; rather, we are talking about organised gangs of criminals who target poor people and communities. They must be dealt with as they are&#8212;as criminals. They prey on vulnerable families and they drag them further into financial and social problems, as other members have said. They have to be challenged&#8212;the minister is right to do so and to have secured this morning's debate. It has been a good debate, and I hope that, by the time we conclude it, we will have arrived at a consensus. Credit unions are fundamental to the attack on the problem, but much work still has to be done.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380267", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Illegal Moneylenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A few weeks ago, I attended the funeral of a family friend.

I first encountered such a situation more than four years ago, when I was contacted by a family whose twin sons required an extension to be built on to their home to provide the space that was required for wheelchairs and other equipment that the boys would need. The fact that the extension was not built until only a few months ago is nothing short of a scandal. I hope that by highlighting such problems in today's debate we may avoid similar situations in the future. To put it bluntly, no one should have to endure the prevarication and red tape that my constituents endured. It was totally unnecessary and completely unacceptable, but I regret that it appears to be all too frequent.</p><p>Members have highlighted many aspects of the problems that underline the need for the my life campaign. In doing so, they have made the picture very clear. In my brief speech, I will urge the minister to focus on ensuring that positive work that is being done in research into MD can be progressed.</p><p>Although there is no cure for muscular dystrophy, there are ways of managing the condition that can add greatly to a sufferer's quality of life. Treatments are additive, so they should be used together to look after all areas of a person's life. Recently I was in correspondence with Cecilia Keaveney TD, the member for Donegal in the Irish D&#225;il, who was seeking interparliamentary support for increased funding for neuromuscular disorders, especially MD. She recently attended a presentation by Professor Kate Bushby on advances in research into MD and heard the positive message that, given the right amount of resources and the required degree of political impetus, the idea that nothing can be done for people with muscular dystrophy could eventually be consigned to history.</p><p>There has been testing on animals of treatments such as&#8212;I must just stun this rather than kill it&#8212;antisense oligonucleotides. Apparently such testing has been very successful, even if my attempt to pronounce the term was not. We now need to move on to clinical trials, to ensure that potential treatments will work in people, as they have in animal models. The treatments that are <place-holder colnum=\"26614\"/> being tested are theoretically attractive, can be administered and would be available in the long term, as companies already make them for other conditions. They are ready for clinical trials and have been registered.</p><p>My request to the minister today is not just to help to end the delays in providing aids and adaptations, but to work with our colleagues in other Parliaments where support already exists for research that shows positive signs but needs the political will to advance it. In short, I urge the minister to give people with MD the wheels that they are seeking and not just to reinvent the wheels that already exist, in order to take issues forward on their behalf. This is a very positive campaign and much positive work is on-going.</p><p>I accept that there are practical problems that must be overcome&#8212;the my life campaign highlights them and they must be addressed. In securing the debate, Cathie Craigie has done Parliament a great service in that regard. However, we could do a greater service to those with MD if we could take forward not only the practical issues that have been raised but the research that will give people far greater hope for the future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Muscular Dystrophy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to those that have already been conveyed to Cathie Craigie for securing this evening's debate, and to the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign for the well co-ordinated way in which it has highlighted the practical problems that are experienced by people who have muscular dystrophy, and their carers.

It is worth pointing out that local elections are taking place today in England, without any other type of election, but the media are discussing only national issues. The idea that decoupling will somehow help to focus attention on local issues is stretching it a wee bit.<place-holder colnum=\"25328\"/></p><p>David Davidson gave the impression that the electoral system in Scotland is generally more like that in Harare than that in Hamilton. I wonder whether he will reflect on that. To suggest that the system in Scotland has to be corrected because of the issue that he brought to our attention was, again, more about filling in time than about addressing a genuine concern.</p><p>The fact that few areas of contention emerged during the committee's deliberations would suggest that the LEARS bill is a good one that has widespread support&#8212;not only among committee members but among those whom we consulted. That indeed was the case. The general principles of the bill are very sound. However, as others such as Bruce Crawford, David Davidson and Bristow Muldoon have said, that is not to say that nothing in the bill caused concern. Parts of it certainly did.</p><p>Clearly, it is good that we have been given the opportunity to make the electoral system much more accessible and convenient for voters and at the same time improve the security of the voting process. Bruce Crawford was right to raise concerns over the potential for fraud. The issue is vital and we would like to hear from the minister about the Electoral Commission's advice.</p><p>David Davidson spoke about the mechanism for counting electronically. Having seen the process last week, and having had the opportunity when considering previous bills to go to Ireland to see how the system there works, I would say that what we are doing is not being done in a vacuum. Such systems are operating daily. The system works in other countries and has been shown to work in pilots here. I do not think that we need have the concerns that David Davidson has over the mechanism. However, that is not to say that other concerns&#8212;as have been raised by other committee members&#8212;do not arise over issues such as personal identifiers, the potential for fraud, and the practicalities of postal voting.</p><p>Other committee members and I concluded that the bill contained much of merit, but we also felt that much more detail was needed to allow us to remain confident that the bill's intentions would result in the desired improvements. For example, introducing performance standards for returning officers in the administration of local government elections may be one of those issues that everyone sees value in, but it will be no more than motherhood-and-apple-pie rhetoric if the standards are not defined and monitored effectively.</p><p>I appreciate that the Executive believes that the introduction of performance standards for election officials&#8212;both returning officers and electoral registration officers&#8212;is important in order to secure more consistency in the way in which elections are administered and I understand that <place-holder colnum=\"25329\"/> the Electoral Administration Bill that is currently being considered in the United Kingdom Parliament contains a clause that proposes that the Electoral Commission be given the power to develop and set standards, but we in the Scottish Parliament have to be involved in that process and be convinced that what the Electoral Commission comes up with will do what it says on the tin when it is applied in Scotland. Others have mentioned that, especially in relation to e-counting, we need to see the detail of the proposals if we are to have confidence in the standard of the system that will be introduced.</p><p>As Charlie Gordon pointed out, allowing independent observers at a local government election seems to be a good thing in principle, but what will be their purpose and what will we do with their observations? How will we assess them and what status will their comments have? Information on those points from the minister would be welcome, especially in relation to the issues of logistics that were raised by Charlie Gordon.</p><p>Equally, who could argue against improving the process for disabled voters and those whose first language is not English? It is self-evidently beneficial to have explanatory electoral materials translated into alternative languages and to provide more assistance for postal voters. We are obliged under the Scotland Act 1998 to ensure equality of opportunity, so we are bound to address issues of the accessibility of the voting process. However, we need to be confident that disabled groups such as Capability Scotland will find that the new system meets their aspirations and delivers more than token gestures.</p><p>The issue is much too important for political will to fail. We must be sure that what is proposed will overcome the practical and resource difficulties that will surely be encountered when delivering the much-sought-after improvements in accessibility.</p><p>The Local Government and Transport Committee rightly called for more information to be provided to justify the charges for certificates of births, marriages and deaths. However, there was no difficulty in agreeing that the current 230 districts, which are based on traditional registration district boundaries, should be replaced and brought into line with council areas. That will do away with a lot of traditions, but this is one occasion on which the preservation of traditions cannot be defended.</p><p>As I have said, this is a good bill with much to commend it. I hope that the Scottish Executive will provide Parliament with the additional details that will enable us to be confident that it will deliver on all that it promises.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13360992", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Swinney was concerned about the fact that national issues impact on local elections if the two types of election take place on the same day.

SNP members spent little time attempting to outline tax reform and they have not suggested a single coherent proposal for spending reform.</p><p>No one in the debate has attempted to hide the fact that there are concerns about local government finance. However, it is not enough for SNP members to say that more money should be found without saying where it would come from; to say that efficiency savings are good things without offering an incentive to produce them; or to say that local income tax should replace the council tax without explaining why they would turn a loophole into a noose.</p><p>According to its own figures, the SNP proposals are to increase income tax by 4.3p in the pound. I doubt whether that would be the true level of increase because of the increased bureaucracy involved and I have no doubt that its proposals would hit ordinary working families the hardest. Will SNP members tell ordinary working people what the true cost would be? In the 18-minute speech that Mr Swinney made, he spent less than one minute speaking about that. If his party makes a proposal of such magnitude, that is not good enough.</p><p>Why does Mr Swinney not tell double-income families that they would be the biggest losers? Why does he not tell nurses in training and students who supplement their income that they would lose out if they went over the threshold? Why does he not tell single people living alone that they would lose their current discount?</p><p>The fact is that the proposed local income tax would be more complex and expensive to collect than the current council tax and it would be less stable than property-based tax because the yield from income tax is less predictable. Income tax is paid by only about 60 per cent of people, so almost one third of adults would make no direct payment towards the cost of local services.</p><p>The SNP and others do not want to axe the tax; they want to extend the tax and introduce punitive levels of local income tax. Far from offering tax cuts, the net effect of an income-related change is that those on average incomes would pay more. Two individuals who earn average incomes would be unaffected but, if they lived together, their combined income would be well above the threshold laid down by the SNP, and indeed that proposed by the Liberals. Therefore, it is true to <place-holder colnum=\"22288\"/> say that hard-working families would pay more under that scheme.</p><p>What about the SNP's proposed freeze on council tax? That would result in &#163;89 million of lost income for local authorities this year alone. Continuing that freeze would cost a further &#163;141 million and &#163;196 million respectively in the following two years, totalling &#163;426 million over the three years of the spending review period without any commitment from the SNP that it would deliver on services. Who would cover that shortfall, or does the SNP even realise that it is arguing for cuts in services elsewhere? We are left to assume that a freeze on council tax would shift the burden of funding local services from council tax payers to general taxpayers to cover that shortfall.

I have something else that I have to go to this evening, but the more I heard people talking about John Thomson, the more I felt I had to make a contribution.</p><p>At the weekend, as we watched the burial of a legend of football, George Best, I was thinking how appropriate it was that in the same week we would have a debate on the death of a genuine Scottish legend, John Thomson. As I was sitting with my children, talking about the images that we were seeing on the television, with tens of thousands of people lining the streets of Belfast to honour George Best, I, like Helen Eadie, recalled how, at a time when transport, the media and people's financial resources were not as they are now, 30,000 football supporters still made the journey to the graveside in Cardenden to pay tribute to a man whom they had watched in their day.</p><p>As a Celtic-minded person, I was raised in that tradition. I remember learning at my father's knee about John Thomson, and my father had had the story passed on to him by his father. I visited John Thomson's grave. I felt that, as a Celtic supporter, it was my honour and privilege to do so. Indeed, I encouraged my own children to do the same and they have done so. I hope that they will pass it on to their children.</p><p>We have to keep alive the memory of legends such as George Best and John Thomson, because they are what football is all about. We got the good and the bad with George Best; all I ever heard about was the good of John Thomson. As a Celtic-minded person, I find it easy to discuss with my friends and fellow supporters traditions, history and people such as John Thomson, but it is unfortunate that outside that Celtic family too few people know about John Thomson. That has to be rectified because he was a giant of the game just as George Best was.</p><p>For that reason, I had no hesitation in supporting Helen Eadie's motion. It is good that she has brought the matter to the Parliament's attention. If we can get more people to learn about John Thomson, all the baggage that comes with Scottish football might start to dissipate and we might start to make progress in tackling sectarianism and taking that aspect out of Scottish football. We should do that in his honour and in his memory, of which Celtic-minded people are proud.</p><p>In honouring John Thomson in the way that Helen Eadie has requested, the SFA would be doing a service not only to Scottish football but to wider Scottish society. We need more people to learn about that remarkable young man.</p><p>John Swinburne mentioned the song about the ghost of John Thomson standing in the goals. As a <place-holder colnum=\"21685\"/> Celtic supporter I often wonder whether that ghost is just too big for Celtic. Celtic is traditionally associated with attacking football&#8212;our number 7 is the greatest known to football fans anywhere. However, Celtic has not had a great tradition of goalkeepers. We have had Ronnie Simpson and Pat Bonner and we might have a great goalkeeper in Artur Boruc now. Celtic has not had the number of goalkeepers that it should have had. Perhaps in honouring John Thomson, we will lift the burden from the goalkeepers who have had to fill the gap that he left.</p><p>Before I sit down, it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to utter the words \"hail, hail\", because this might be the only time that we have a debate in which I can get away with it.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351949", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: John Thomson"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I should possibly declare an interest as a member of the Carfin (1948) Celtic supporters club.

I also thank the clerks of both committees, who helped to take the matter forward and arrived at such a good conclusion.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament's public petitions system is highly regarded, not only in Scotland but further afield. However, we cannot rest on our laurels, which is why the committee has consistently tried to improve practices and procedures and has been quick to embrace new technology and techniques, not least of which is the e-petitions system.</p><p>Things have moved on since 1999 and we now have six years' and 900 petitions' worth of experience under our belt. Although many changes and improvements have already been made to the process, it is time for us to consider a number of changes to the formal procedures to ensure that the public petitions system continues to develop.</p><p>I want to make it clear that, in welcoming the changes, the Public Petitions Committee does not seek to limit or hinder the opportunity for members <place-holder colnum=\"21005\"/> of the public to petition the Parliament. Rather, the rolling programme of committee events that the Public Petitions Committee is currently holding promotes awareness of the public petitions system and provides practical guidance on petitioning.</p><p>While I am on that subject, I take the opportunity to respond to Sandra White's concerns. It has always been the intention of the Public Petitions Committee to work with a petitioner. Only rarely is a petition submitted that meets the requirements of the petitions system with regard to wording. The clerks work closely with the petitioner to try to find a form of words that will enable that petition to become admissible and often they take legal advice in their attempt to find that form of words. Only when the petitioner insists on lodging a petition that does not conform to the advice of the clerks and the lawyers does a petition become inadmissible.</p><p>We had to clarify that. I hope that Sandra White understands that the committee has never tried to prevent people from lodging petitions. We always attempt to ensure that a form of words is found to allow the petition to be heard. However, when a petitioner insists on submitting their petition in their own way and the petition is inadmissible, the committee has to say why the petition cannot be taken forward. In such cases, the clerks always provide the committee with a briefing that explains why the petition has to be deemed inadmissible.</p><p>The new criterion of admissibility will prevent the resubmission of petitions that are the same as, or similar to, a petition that has previously been lodged. That will empower the committee to address potential abuses of the system. Under the existing rules, a petitioner who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Parliament's consideration of their petition can simply resubmit the same petition. Clearly, such abuse of the system has resource implications for the Public Petitions Committee and, indeed, for the wider Parliament. It can also falsely raise expectations and undermine the credibility of the system. The rule change will ensure that petitions that raise new issues or present fresh evidence will continue properly to be scrutinised by the committee, while those that are raised by so-called vexatious petitioners will be prevented from clogging up the system.</p><p>In responding to the consultation that the committee undertook when it considered the change to the rules, one petitioner commented that such a change might help the petitioner's case as it would provide time for reflection and time to gather new information.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee is pleased to support the amendments to rule 15.4.1, which will prevent MSPs from lodging petitions. Unlike members of the public, MSPs have at their <place-holder colnum=\"21006\"/> disposal many other mechanisms for raising issues of concern. The public petitions system should be the domain of members of the public. The rule change will ensure that members of the public, and not MSPs, set the agenda for the Public Petitions Committee.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee welcomes the procedural changes that are recommended in the Procedures Committee's report. We believe that the changes will further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the petitions system.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13350253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Procedures Committee&#8212;especially Iain Smith, the former convener, Donald Gorrie, the present convener, and Karen Gillon, the deputy convener&#8212;for dealing with the matters that we brought to the committee's attention.

My Labour colleagues and I have had to make some very tough decisions since coming to Parliament, and we will have do to so again in the future. More important, we must do so again today.</p><p>Despite what Fergus Ewing and Tommy Sheridan have said, this is not an academic exercise; this is an exercise in taking decisions in Government. It is easy for members to posture and to promise what they will never be asked to deliver, and it is sometimes tempting to take the line of least resistance. Most serious MSPs, however, know that there is nothing to be gained from doing that.</p><p>In December last year, I found myself making a tough decision not to back the Executive. That was, and remains, a unique experience, and there had to be very good reasons for that to happen. I still believe that I had no alternative last year but to withhold my support when I was asked to endorse the Executive's decision to put the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services out to tender. As a Labour MSP, I was not prepared to endorse a decision that, although it appeared to me at the time to be ultimately inevitable, left so many issues around protection of the workforce at CalMac unresolved and inadequately addressed by the Scottish Executive.</p><p>Although a number of legal questions and points about the tendering process were not properly dealt with last year&#8212;they remain in dispute&#8212;the main issue for me has always been to have the minister and his officials provide me with the assurance that I and, I believe, other Labour colleagues need that the tender documents will include the safeguards that the employees require over their employment rights. Having heard, like <place-holder colnum=\"19043\"/> members who have already spoken, a lot of evidence at the Local Government and Transport Committee, I have come to the conclusion over recent months that there is little that the Executive can now do to withstand the will of the EU commissioner. If that were to happen, there would now be consequences for the workforce that would be worse than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>The Scottish National Party amendment says that going out to tender could have complications. That is true, as the minister has acknowledged. However, the SNP fails to address the fact that there could be financial penalties if the Executive does not follow the instructions of Monsieur Barrot. Rather than recognise that reality, the SNP has as usual taken the easy route. If Government is difficult, it would appear that Opposition, as ever, is easy.</p><p>Having asked questions of the Executive and having had them answered at the Local Government and Transport Committee, I would now like to hear some answers from Opposition members. Are they really prepared to allow the decision on the tender process to be taken out of the hands of the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications and handed over to EU officials? Are they, as legislators, prepared to advocate defiance of the European Commission, whose responsibility it is to see legislation that is passed in Europe being applied here? Are they prepared to play fast and loose with the possibility that the Commission could order the cessation and recovery of subsidy to CalMac? Are they prepared to abdicate responsibility and place in jeopardy the lifeline services that the islands need and to take the easy option, which they would rather take? They might be, but I am not.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345133", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services (Clyde and Hebrides)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When our party entered into Government, we as Labour back benchers knew that we would have to face up to making some hard decisions in supporting that Government.

However, by the time the civil servants had lodged the amendments that the committee and outside bodies had dragged kicking and screaming out of them, I was convinced that at least one of them might be in the Edinburgh royal infirmary to have their head surgically removed from a certain orifice.</p><p>My first discovery was that the civil servants in the transport division need to take lessons before they draft any more bills and that they need to drop the obfuscation, prevarication and legislative gobbledegook so that members of the Local <place-holder colnum=\"18553\"/> Government and Transport Committee can have the trust in them that we need in order to work well together.</p><p>The main thing that I discovered, however, is that the bill's provisions are good and will, with the committee's amendments, promote better transport throughout Scotland. Who would not agree that new regional transport partnerships, as outlined by Kenny MacAskill and other members, should be established and that we should build on SPT's strengths and expand the system throughout Scotland? However, we discovered that the Conservatives are not happy with that proposal. They want a disjointed, weak and unresponsive batch of toothless RTPs. What we need are strong RTPs, but David Davidson has made it quite clear that he is after his own type of RTP: redundant Tory policies.</p><p>Part 2 also had to be amended to strengthen the road works provisions. That has largely been achieved and we are now closer to the level playing field that was sought at the outset. Most important, part 3, which gives powers to establish national concessionary travel schemes for pensioners and young people, was what, if nothing else, made introducing the bill really worth while.</p><p>Notwithstanding Fergus Ewing's comments and Kenny MacAskill's defence of the fact that the SNP has only latterly supported the bill, I was unprepared when, initially, the SNP said that it would not support the bill's general principles. It would not support the general principle of expanding SPT's strengths into the RTPs; of establishing a road works commissioner to allow better management of the roads network and the positive development of transport for all users; and of extending the principle of the concessionary travel scheme. At the next election, I will take great delight in going round my constituency and telling people that. Fergus Ewing said that we should take the politics out of this issue, but we should not forget that he played politics with it throughout the whole process.</p><p>Despite the fact that the nationalists have only latterly come round to the bill, I am glad that they have decided to support it.

In relation to some issues that is unacceptable because, quite simply, we cannot have it both ways. However, when it comes to alcohol, it is difficult not to address competing positions and to give something to every side in the debate.</p><p>It appears to me that there are two distinct views of alcohol. Some people see it as the devil's brew. They see it as something that robs people of their brains, takes food from the mouths of babies and shoes from the feet of children, and as a substance that kills hundreds on the highways and through the ill health that it causes. They are right&#8212;it does. For other people, alcohol is a mild tranquiliser; it calms jaded nerves and is no more than a social lubricant. It is&#8212;those people are right, too.</p><p>Throughout the time that the Local Government and Transport Committee has considered the bill, I have often found myself trying hard not to look at it from one or other of those perspectives. As Margaret Smith said, there had from the outset to be recognition that, in assessing the use of a legal drug, we would have to consider social costs in terms of ill health, crime, public disorder and antisocial behaviour. We also heard from the business community and from health experts that the bill could have social, economic and health benefits. What made it easy to focus on what the bill was about was recognition that, whatever side one takes in the debate, the system by which we have hitherto regulated supply and use of alcohol is too complex and outdated and must be changed.</p><p>The bill seeks to simplify and modernise the licensing system in Scotland, and it addresses the cultural changes that have taken place in our <place-holder colnum=\"18201\"/> country. As the minister said, Scotland has always had a problem with alcohol, but the manifestations of that problem are not what they were a generation ago, when licensing laws were last addressed. I remember clearly from my early days that my grandfather would bemoan how times had changed and recall the good old days when women did not go into pubs. Statistics have shown that one woman in four reported exceeding daily benchmarks; that one woman in seven drank alcohol hazardously; and that approximately one woman in every 21 in Scotland had a degree of alcohol dependence.</p><p>The situation has also changed for men and for young people, as Mary Mulligan said. As Pauline McNeill observed, things were never as good as my grandfather remembered them, but statistics show that the situation now is much worse than it was in his day. We have to deal with the modern reality of alcohol abuse and its social consequences, and I think that the bill gets the balance right between encouraging sensible alcohol consumption and addressing the effects of alcohol abuse.</p><p>A desire for more efficiency in the workings of licensing boards is a good idea, but we must be careful that, in moving towards that, we do not shortcut the assessment of licence applications. We must take time to use local knowledge and address local concerns, and I agree with David Davidson and Mary Mulligan, who highlighted that issue, although I do not agree with David about opening up alcohol sales in football grounds. To compare Newcastle with Glasgow does not work. Newcastle has one team; that team can meet its opponents at 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon with no problems, but the major rivals in Glasgow cannot do that. There is an added dimension in Scotland that makes the problem far more complex than David Davidson would have us believe, and I would be totally opposed to this or any other bill's being used to open up alcohol to sale in football grounds.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343069", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Politicians are often accused of trying to be all things to all people.

That concern was expressed by a number of members, <place-holder colnum=\"18202\"/> so it is absolutely legitimate that we consider such matters further. We also generally support the establishment of a national licensing forum to provide good guidance to ministers on the regulations that would be required to support the new licensing system. However, we are right to be concerned that we still know too little about the composition and precise role of that body. I look forward to hearing from the minister about that in the wake of his announcement, and I agree with what Margaret Smith said on that.</p><p>The bill contains many good proposals on licensing, such as single premises licences, occasional licences, the ending of permitted hours, and other administrative arrangements, such as those for appeals and objections. To change the culture of drinking, we need more than legislation, but the foundations on which to build a cultural change are clearly contained in the ambit of the bill.</p><p>I agree with Paul Martin and Donald Gorrie about the need to educate young people. Paul Martin's comments about his experiences in respect of the importance of having the right environment into which to take a young person reminds me of the reality that I have faced in dealing with the bill.

Because it has changed, he did not deliberate on the development of dial-a-drink services from our off-licences, a problem that has been raised with me by police. Such a service is not a bad thing, but it is evidently being used by young people to circumvent no-proof, no-sale initiatives.

The aim of the bill was to aid the resurgence of Scotland's transport industry for the future. Its policy objectives were to deliver a sustainable, effective and integrated transport system for Scotland, to empower local authorities to deliver local solutions to local problems and to promote partnership working. The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 includes provisions to give power to local authorities to address growing congestion and environmental problems in cities and larger towns.</p><p>As Bristow Muldoon outlined, four years on, the Local Government and Transport Committee decided to conduct an inquiry into the impact of the 2001 act, especially its provisions for bus quality partnerships and bus quality contracts. In effect, we were asking, \"Are we there yet?\" That may not be the question that Des McNulty wanted us to ask, but Bristow Muldoon explained why the scope of the inquiry was slightly limited. However, I think that it covered many of the issues that Des McNulty wanted us to address.</p><p>The 2001 act made legislative provision for a plethora of initiatives that transport groups, users and the industry in general had long sought. There were to be joint transport strategies that would involve improved joint planning by local authorities to address shared cross-boundary issues, such as how to manage travel in and out of Scotland's largest cities.</p><p>Bus quality partnerships were envisaged. Bus services would be improved by giving the force of law to partnerships between local authorities and bus companies. The fundamental aim of such partnerships was to provide quality services to passengers, but the evidence that we took suggested that that is not happening. The theory was that, if bus quality partnerships were tried and failed or were found to be inappropriate, the legislation would enable the Scottish Executive to approve bus quality contracts, which would allow an exclusive franchise to be awarded to a single operator through competitive tendering. There is a distinct lack of evidence that that is happening, because the private operators are not keen for their oligopolies to be tested in that way.</p><p>The most high-profile element of the bill was the concessionary fares scheme.

Indeed, we heard evidence that, in some cases, the Executive was the obstacle to their establishment.

The committee feels that the Executive sees quality partnerships as an option of last resort. Instead, it should consider whether it can support the further development of quality contracts.

I say that in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek way, not because it is entirely wrong but because I believe that it is our responsibility to interfere in crime wherever it occurs. What might be more accurate is my belief&#8212;which appears to be contrary to the view of the Minister for Justice, given what she said earlier&#8212;that we cannot consider the view that crime does not pay to be even remotely true. Crime is one of the biggest businesses in the world today and we must interfere with it. I am glad that the Scottish Executive recognises that and has set itself the task of confronting that reality. Organised crime is truly global and we must look beyond our borders if we are to tackle it effectively.</p><p>During the recent general election campaign there was a great deal of discussion on immigration. Had there been a reasoned debate on the matter there is much that could have been addressed, but this morning we have an opportunity to consider one dimension of the immigration debate. Migration from disadvantaged or troubled areas of the world to more stable and affluent countries is a multifaceted global phenomenon and it creates great opportunities for serious and organised criminal involvement. Organised immigration crime comprises both people smuggling and human trafficking; the distinction between the two is that in the case of human trafficking the intention behind the facilitation is to exploit the migrants when they reach their destination.</p><p>The indications are that human trafficking takes place on a much smaller scale than people smuggling, but the nature of human trafficking is such that it is harder to identify. It is clear that human trafficking relies on the frequent use of intimidation and violence, which arguably makes it the more acute threat and one that Scotland's criminal justice system must make a priority. Scotland is not immune to the problem, so it must be tackled by the strategic partnerships to which the motion refers. Criminals involved in serious and organised crime, whether they trade in people, drugs or other commodities, are adept at exploiting weaknesses in the system. Such criminals show flexibility and speed in responding <place-holder colnum=\"17016\"/> to the efforts of law enforcement officers to combat their crime and in countering improved detection capabilities.</p><p>I am particularly concerned that traffickers often recruit migrants specifically into the vice trade. That usually involves deception and the exploitation of the lack of opportunities that are open to women in the source countries. The use of violence to control both trafficked prostitutes and sweatshop labourers is widespread and must cause us great concern. In the case of women who are trafficked for prostitution there are extreme forms of coercion, which usually involve physical abuse and rape by the traffickers. Violence is likely to be present from the point at which the woman begins working as a prostitute and most victims are forced to become addicted to hard drugs such as heroin. They become dependent on both the drugs and the trafficker. Victims of trafficking are a particular concern because they continue to be exploited by serious and organised criminals once they are in Scotland. I hope that the minister will pay particular attention to the problem.</p><p>Many of the serious and organised criminals who are involved in immigration crime are also involved in other serious and organised criminal activities, such as class A drug trafficking. There is evidence of illegal immigrants being used by serious and organised criminals to facilitate other serious and organised crimes&#8212;for example, they are used as drugs couriers. Serious and organised criminals also use illegal immigrants to commit various types of organised low-level crime when they arrive in the destination country. When that happens in Scotland, it shows us how a global problem becomes a local issue. I am glad that the ministers gave a strong indication this morning that they intend to tackle the problem.</p><p>In any debate on crime, we must have a sense of perspective about what needs to be done and what can be done. From what we have heard this morning, the ministers have got that balance right and I wish them well with their efforts in tackling the problem.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340159", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been said that the law should not pretend to punish everything that is dishonest because that would seriously interfere with big business.

Indeed, despite what the Green party said, the UK has relinquished all air-launched weapons; Royal Navy surface ships are no longer able to carry or to deploy nuclear weapons; and the nuclear missile and artillery roles that were previously held with US nuclear weapons under dual-key arrangements have been resigned. That represents real progress towards nuclear disarmament.</p><p>Trident is the only nuclear system left and I hope that it will be the last. However, getting rid of it will require an ordered defence policy, not disarray, and gaining freedom from the threat of nuclear destruction will require orderly negotiation. In today's post-cold war nuclear politics, the issue is not as simple as the SNP would have us believe.</p><p>However, why should we be surprised that the SNP has a chaotic defence policy? It does not have an impressive record on issues relating to Scotland's defence; indeed, its approach to defence policy is careless and contradictory. For example, it advocates withdrawal from NATO and has repeatedly opposed NATO action, despite the fact that such action has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p>Moreover, the SNP advocates Scottish independence while arguing for the retention of Scottish regiments in the British Army. As I have said before, at least when the Indians and the Irish gained independence, they had the decency to tell Britain to take its army with it.

The money that is currently spent on Trident has been pledged variously by the SNP to the national health service, to increasing the number of nursery places, to improving the lot of pensioners and even to a Scottish Nobel prize.

As a member of the Labour Party, I think that government must do an awful lot more than that. However, if John Stuart Mill was correct in identifying the importance at least of transport in the role of government, he served a purpose.</p><p>Members of the Scottish Parliament acknowledge the priority that transport should be given. There must therefore be good transport legislation and the bill has the potential to become a good piece of transport legislation. I stress the word \"potential\", because of the concerns that members have expressed.</p><p>Most members and the minister identified that the creation of regional transport partnerships is a key element of the bill. It is unfortunate that the welcome for the establishment of RTPs was counterbalanced, if not negated, by the Opposition's negativity about the measure. There are three main elements in the bill and RTPs represent only one element. It is good that RTPs are linked to an overall national strategy, which has not been properly addressed in the debate. Members have forgotten that RTPs will have a bigger role than can be ascertained by considering the minutiae of what the partnerships can do. The second element in the bill is road works management, but we did not widen the debate to consider those provisions. However, we spent a lot of time on concessionary travel.</p><p>I was heartened by the minister's sympathetic response to the Local Government and Transport Committee's concerns about the voting arrangements for RTPs and boundary flexibility <place-holder colnum=\"14883\"/> and I am happy that he gave a clear indication that draft orders will be in place before we consider the bill at stage 2. I agree with David Mundell that the lack of detail caused the committee concern and prevented us from properly scrutinising the bill. Des McNulty's contribution exemplified the problem in relation to the lack of detail about finance, which meant that there was a question about how we could assure everyone that the RTPs would be properly resourced to deliver everything that we want them to deliver. It is right that the committee took the opportunity to raise such concerns in its stage 1 report.</p><p>Early in the debate reference was made to a \"store of happiness\", which should have set us off on the right track. However, it was Fergus Ewing who introduced the idea. He then forgot to identify any of the good aspects of the bill, at which point the debate started to go wrong. If we regard Fergus Ewing as an example of a hibernating Job's comforter, we might find out where his store of happiness is.</p><p>Many members expressed concern about the amount of power that RTPs will have. I will not go into that, because I want to focus on the powers of the Scottish road works commissioner, which Tommy Sheridan mentioned. I started my speech by talking about utilitarianism, but Tommy Sheridan took the opposite approach and gave us utopianism.</p><p>If we can do anything in this bill, we can deliver a strong piece of transport legislation. Very few bills coming to the Parliament at stage 1 are already complete. Tommy was right to say that the bill deserved a yellow card, but I do not think that it will get a red card. I think that we can deliver.</p><p>If the minister responds positively to the points that have been made, we will achieve a very good bill&#8212;and I will be more than happy to go round the doorsteps during the forthcoming election campaign to tell people that neither the Tories nor the SNP could bring themselves today to endorse concessionary travel.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334759", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Stuart Mill, the founder of utilitarianism, is not someone whom I would often quote in a debate, but it is worth noting that the father of minimalist government argued that even if government does nothing else, it must control education and transport.

Having also served on the Local Government Committee during the previous session, I remember vividly the situation that we inherited in the late 1990s. I recall COSLA representatives telling us that the gulf between central funding and their assessment of what local government actually needed was in excess of &#163;1 billion.</p><p>In my assessment of the current situation, it is clear just how different things are for local government now and how much has improved. On that basis, I welcome the minister's speech today. Brian Monteith asked whether the minister remembers from his time in local government where the bodies are buried. I am not sure about that, but I certainly know where Tom McCabe led to the burying of the Tories and the Scottish nationalists in local government.</p><p>I fully endorse the more open and collaborative approach to local government that the Executive has developed. I welcome the focus being turned much more towards accountability to the people whom local government serves and supports. To sustain robust local authorities, we require to share our priorities and to work together to attain and further the highest standards of public service provision. It is vital that we work in partnership to ensure practical results on antisocial behaviour, transport and crime in particular.<place-holder colnum=\"14302\"/></p><p>Local government will receive many more benefits from its new budget. I am reassured, in particular, that the Executive's commitment to tackling antisocial behaviour has led it to provide money to allow greater support to be given to initiatives in that area, for example the community safety partnerships that have been funded through local authorities, which will help effective warden schemes to operate throughout Scotland. Only through reform and modernisation can we secure best value for every penny that is spent.</p><p>Under this budget settlement, the Executive will provide Scotland's local authorities with more than &#163;30 billion in the next three years. That will enable local authorities to make significant progress across the board and will help local government to meet the public's aims. I am especially pleased that the Executive has identified more than &#163;1 billion of revenue grant outwith aggregate external finance for each of the three years of the spending review period. That will assist in such areas as the strategic waste fund, the community regeneration fund and the changing children's services fund. The revenue support for schools will allow for many more improvements in our school infrastructure, which we badly need.</p><p>It is always worth remembering that we would not have that support if the anti-private finance elements in this place had their way. The nats and the Scottish Socialist Party would deny our schools many of the positive results that will undoubtedly come from the spending proposals for schools. Those will include not only the provision of new or refurbished schools, but more teachers, smaller class sizes, greater opportunities and more protection for the most vulnerable, with grant-aided expenditure provision increasing in 2005-06 for that purpose.</p><p>The aim of spending under the local government heading is to plan public finances and manage them prudently to deliver excellence in public services and support in growing Scotland's economy, which will enable local democracy to flourish&#8212;and I have to say amen to that.</p><p>The regeneration of our neighbourhoods; the standards of and within our schools; closing the gap between the rich and the poor; making opportunities available to all; improving standards in transport, health, social care and social justice; and making our streets safe places in which to live&#8212;that is what local government is all about.</p><p>Having listened to my colleagues in local government, I know that some apprehension remains. I urge COSLA to remember where we were only five years ago. In partnership with local authorities and other service providers, and with the resources that we should approve today, we can deliver on all the aspirations that I have <place-holder colnum=\"14303\"/> mentioned.

David Mundell is now sitting on his own, so he must know who the lost boys are.</p><p>We should concentrate on the Sewel motion, which is a good one. After a marathon meeting of the Local Government and Transport Committee, we achieved consensus on the motion. Post privatisation, the British railway system was in a mess, but the Labour Government at Westminster is seeking to address that chaos. We in Scotland will be given enhanced powers over the rail network as a result of the Government's proposals. The Scottish Executive ministers will be given a role that is equivalent to that of the Secretary of State for Transport, which means that we will be in a win-win situation that will enable better planning of services and more accurate targeting of future investment in Scotland.</p><p>The most important beneficiaries of the new powers will be not the Scottish Executive ministers and their officials, nor the MSPs who can hold them to account over what they do with the new powers and resources, but Scotland's rail passengers, the number of whom will, I hope, grow in the future. They have the most to gain from the new arrangement. We need greater efficiency and more co-ordination between train operators and track providers. If that can be achieved, we will have a more reliable service for travellers. When we can ensure that decisions on service improvement are made by those who are best placed to determine local priorities, the Executive's welcome investment in the ScotRail franchise&#8212;which has already resulted in 29 new trains and the provision of several longer station platforms&#8212;will be developed further. We will also be better placed to reduce overcrowding, improve customer information and integrate ticket arrangements, which are much-needed improvements. The changes that will be brought about if we agree to the Sewel motion will result in better planning and a greater ability to meet our <place-holder colnum=\"13896\"/> and the country's aspirations on rail transport.</p><p>To return to Wonderland, it is worth noting that, if Tricia Marwick had achieved her proposed moratorium on Sewel motions, we would not have obtained the powers that we will receive as a result of the Railways Bill and the Gambling Bill. The Local Government and Transport Committee took a long time to consider the Sewel motion, which was appropriate.

We are reminded that such complaints are made because of those concerns alone; Opposition members are not opposed to Sewel motions in principle and say that they will consider each one in turn and on its merits. Therefore, I am baffled that the Opposition is opposing this particular Sewel motion on the Gambling Bill that is before the Westminster Parliament. If Opposition members are not opposing the Sewel motion merely for opposition's sake, they must come up with better reasons for opposing it than they have done so far.</p><p>No one can dispute the fact that the modernisation of the UK's gambling laws is badly needed or the fact that the legislation required to effect any such changes is largely reserved to Westminster. I find it peculiar that Opposition members are looking for Scotland to have its own legislation on the issue. I am not concerned about their espousing their desire to have such legislation, but I am baffled that anyone could see that as the best way to address concerns about gambling in Scotland.</p><p>Given that the Gambling Bill is already under way at Westminster, it would be impossible for the Scottish Executive to introduce its own legislation to parallel that being proposed for the UK. That being the case, the practical effect of our not supporting the Sewel motion would be to prevent Scottish ministers from being given the opportunity to consider proposals to establish a regional <place-holder colnum=\"13407\"/> casino in Scotland. The Sewel motion seeks to give Scottish ministers powers that they do not currently have. Without those powers, a regional casino could be established under UK legislation and we would not even have begun the process of legislating on gambling, even in those areas that are devolved to Scotland and over which the Scottish Executive has authority.</p><p>Like other members, I am concerned that little, if any, encouragement should be given to the extension of gambling in Scotland. The social problems associated with gambling addiction are well known and far too extensive in our country already. However, I do not think that we should overhype the problems that the creation of a regional casino would bring. For example, I doubt whether many bingo players would drift away from their couple of games of housie a week towards the poker and blackjack tables in a casino. I also doubt whether the punter who puts a few pounds on the greyhounds or the horses would be any more susceptible to gambling addiction. My concern is about the establishment of a culture of gambling that would suck people, especially younger generations, into the heavy gambling promoted by big business as a glamorous leisure pursuit.</p><p>I would like the Executive to obtain the powers that will allow it to have an input to the new gambling environment that the Government in London proposes. If people are worried about the potential expansion of gambling-related social ills, to oppose the Sewel motion would be perverse. Westminster is responsible for the bulk of the powers over gambling, but the Scottish Executive has been given the chance to expand its involvement, and we should seize that opportunity. I am not much of a gambler myself, but I am prepared to wager that the Sewel motion is being opposed for no reason other than the fact that it is a Sewel motion, and that if members examined what it would deliver, the Parliament would support it.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13330975", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gambling Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Sewel motions have been a contentious issue for some time in the Parliament, with the Opposition regularly complaining either about the frequency of their use, as David Mundell has just done, or about the perception that powers are being handed over unnecessarily to our Westminster colleagues&#8212;a complaint that has come from Opposition parties on all sides.

The Scottish National Party has a group at Westminster but does not want a British Army. The Scottish Socialist Party and the Greens have no one in London and therefore cannot debate the issue there, so, to an extent, I can understand why those parties concentrate their efforts here. However, I find it difficult to have any sympathy for the Tories. They are the main Opposition at Westminster and have ample opportunity to raise defence issues there. They have the shadow Scottish secretary to raise specific Scottish issues for them with the support of the rest of the Tory group at Westminster behind him. On second thoughts, if that is the extent of their party's ability in London, perhaps we can understand why the Tories would rather have Murdo Fraser front the subject for them here.</p><p>I have always taken great pleasure in representing Hamilton, where the regimental museum of the Cameronians is housed. That regiment was suspended, but not disbanded, in 1968&#8212;the museum assures me that the regiment awaits any renewed call to arms&#8212;and the Cameronians' recruiting area of Lanarkshire was thereafter taken over by the King's Own Scottish Borderers, which already recruited in the area. Indeed, my father spent his national service in the KOSB during the Malayan emergency in the mid-1950s.</p><p>Elaine Murray has already outlined the importance of the KOSB, so I will not dwell on it, except to note that it boasts proudly of being the only regiment that fought for the Government in all three decisive engagements in the Jacobite wars: at Killiekrankie, Sheriffmuir and Culloden. That is a good enough reason, some might say, for preserving the regiment in perpetuity. Unfortunately, it also spent much of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries suppressing the Irish, so it might <place-holder colnum=\"12998\"/> have fought against my ancestors at some stage, but I will forgive the regiment for that and take pleasure in defending its right to continue to exist.</p><p>I was also interested that the regiment notes on its web pages that, after all the battle honours that it achieved in the service of Britain over 300 years and following its operations in the first gulf war in 1991, it added to its list a vigorous campaign at home called operation Borderer. That was the fight against the Tory options for change proposals, which would have led to the regiment's amalgamation. The Tories were forced to reverse that decision, and the three centuries of history continued with an unbroken lineage.</p><p>I doubt that the Cameronians will be reformed to join the latest fight, but their successor in Lanarkshire, the KOSB, must be given a future. The Tories tried to destroy the KOSB themselves once. The nationalists might be scared in case the regiment comes back to haunt them, &#224; la Culloden.

I am delighted that the committee has managed to secure this debate on a petition that raises highly sensitive issues and I am sure that colleagues will agree that the petition is genuinely worthy of debate in the chamber. I am particularly delighted for the petitioner, Chris Daly, that his petition has resulted in a full parliamentary debate and a ministerial statement.</p><p>As colleagues are aware, one of the underpinning principles of our new Parliament is that we should be open and accessible and encourage a participative approach. The public petitions system has consistently provided one of the main avenues for public participation, and today's debate again emphasises that. This is the first time that the committee has secured such a debate and I thank the other members of the committee for their diligence and hard work in progressing PE535. In doing so, the committee is mindful of the need to balance the wishes of those victims of childhood abuse who believe that the process is cathartic with the wishes of those who might prefer not to reopen old wounds. On that basis, the committee has been careful not to refer to individual cases.</p><p>I point out that the committee has not taken a view on whether or not to recommend that the Parliament support the petition's aims. In seeking today's debate, our aim has been to facilitate a full consideration of the issues raised by the petition. The committee will consider the petition further, along with the <em>Official Report</em> of today's debate and any additional evidence, and agree what action to take when we meet on 22 December.</p><p>In opening today's debate, my role is simply to provide the background to the committee's <place-holder colnum=\"12396\"/> consideration of the petition and an overview of the main issues that have arisen during the process. On that basis, it would not be appropriate for me as committee convener to take a view on the aims of the petition.</p><p>Public petition PE535 was lodged by Chris Daly on 20 August 2002 and first considered by the Public Petitions Committee on 8 October 2002. The petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Executive to conduct an inquiry into past institutional child abuse, particularly for those children who were in the care of the state under the supervision of religious orders, to make an unreserved apology for said state bodies, and to urge the religious orders to apologise unconditionally. The petition is prompted by the petitioner's belief that the Executive should follow the Irish Government's lead in recognising the need to acknowledge and support victims of past childhood abuse. Colleagues might be aware that in May 1999 the Taoiseach announced the Irish</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Government's wish to apologise on behalf of the State and all citizens of the State ... to victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene\".</p><p>At the same time, the Irish Government established a commission to inquire into child abuse in Ireland, with the primary focus of determining the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and other places, and to make appropriate recommendations. The petitioner wrote to the Public Petitions Committee that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"counselling, compensation and pastoral services help Irish survivors with the process of healing and reconciliation. It's my view that Scottish victims and survivors should be given the same recognition.\"</p><p>The petitioner has also stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I'm sure I speak for other survivors in saying that we need support from the Scottish Parliament. It would be courageous of the Parliament to take this matter on board and deal with it in the sympathetic searching way it was dealt with in Ireland.\"</p><p>Furthermore, in a letter to the First Minister dated 15 June 2004, and copied to the committee, the petitioner suggested:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In my view, we have to move forward from here and the time has long since arrived when the adult survivors of institutional abuse have the opportunity to tell of our experiences to a sympathetic, experienced forum. That would be an inquiry set up by the Scottish Parliament/Scottish Executive as outlined in the petition terms of reference.\"</p><p>At its meeting on 8 October 2002, the committee agreed to write to the Scottish Executive and the cross-party group on survivors of childhood sexual abuse and see their comments in relation to the issues raised in the petition.</p><p>In a response dated 17 February 2003, the Executive stated that<place-holder colnum=\"12397\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"any case of child abuse is unacceptable\"</p><p>and said that it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"considering whether an inquiry of the sort that had been requested, or some other forum, should be established to look into cases of abuse in institutions in Scotland, having regard to cases that have come to light in recent years, and what other role the Executive might take in addressing these cases.\"</p><p>In a letter to the committee dated 6 March 2003, the cross-party group on survivors of childhood sexual abuse stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe it is right to expect an inquiry into past institutional child abuse, in particular for those children who were in the care of the state under the supervision of religious orders. We further agree that an unreserved apology to those survivors from the religious orders is appropriate.\"</p><p>The petitioner has also provided a letter of support from Children 1<sup>st</sup>, which has</p><p class=\"indent\">\"agreed to support the petition and further that: there should be a public statement acknowledging that child abuse has occurred, apologising for it and stating unequivocally that it should not have happened; that anyone who has suffered abuse should have access to services, which they need, regardless of their age and how long ago the abuse happened; that there needs to be an investigation into why the voices of children are not sufficiently heard when accusations are made and are being investigated. The inquiry should also ascertain why children are too often powerless when those investigations take place, and make substantial recommendations on how that will be changed.\"</p><p>The committee has received other letters of support for the petition from victims of institutional child abuse. For example, in response to the minister's decision not to hold an inquiry, one submission states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am appalled that the Scottish Parliament has refused to hold a public inquiry into the abuse of children in institutions in Scotland. This is a scandal of enormous proportions and in my view makes the legislators in Scotland part of the conspiracy of silence that surrounds the sexual abuse of children while in 'care' ... I add my voice to the many others calling on the Scottish Parliament to immediately open a full inquiry into the abuses committed against the children of that country ... The truth must be told. People robbed of their innocence as children must now be heard. That is the very least they deserve.\"</p><p>Another victim states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Until Scottish society acknowledges the awful nature of what happened to thousands of innocent children in care, the terrible pain and torment will remain strong for many victims.\"</p><p>Although the Parliament has not yet come to a view on whether it would be appropriate to hold an inquiry, that letter expresses the strength of feeling that exists on the issue and underpins the decision by the Public Petitions Committee to bring forward this afternoon's debate.</p><p>The committee again considered petition PE535 at its meeting on 25 March 2003 and expressed <place-holder colnum=\"12398\"/> concern that the Executive had not provided any timetable for progressing the matter. It requested that the Executive provide an update on progress early in the summer term&#8212;by mid-June 2003, if possible. However, in spite of a number of reminders, no response was received from Executive officials.</p><p>Having been advised by the clerk that the Executive had not responded, I placed petition PE535 on the agenda for the committee's meeting on 12 May 2004. At that meeting, the committee agreed to write to the Minister for Education and Young People to seek an urgent response on any progress that had been made on consideration of whether to conduct an inquiry and the timetable for such an inquiry. The committee also agreed to write to the First Minister to express disappointment that the Executive had failed to respond to it, in spite of its having sent a number of reminders since its initial request.</p><p>Having still not received a response, I placed petition PE535 on the agenda for the committee's meeting on 29 June 2004. At that meeting, the committee agreed to invite the Minister for Education and Young People to give evidence at its first meeting after the summer recess on the issues that had been raised by the petition. The committee subsequently received a reply from the minister in which he stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The First Minister and I apologise for what has clearly been an unacceptable delay in providing a substantive reply to your original request for information. I know you will appreciate this is a difficult and complex subject and we have been examining the way ahead very carefully.\"</p><p>He went on to say that, after very careful consideration of</p><p class=\"indent\">\"whether an Inquiry would prevent future abuse, help meet the needs of survivors, or be in the wider public interest ... we decided that it would not.\"</p><p>The minister provided four main reasons for deciding against an inquiry. First, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Following inquiries and reports into residential establishments, we have taken steps to improve the protection afforded to these vulnerable children.\"</p><p>Secondly, he spoke about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Providing high quality support for survivors of past abuse.\"</p><p>The third reason was about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Ensuring that individuals who have suffered abuse have access to legal rights and remedies.\"</p><p>The final consideration was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Whether an Inquiry would prevent future abuse, help to meet the needs of survivors, or be in the public interest.\"</p><p>The minister stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have given very careful consideration to this. We have concluded that, on balance, an inquiry would not achieve these purposes.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12399\"/></p><p>The petitioner also responded in writing to the committee regarding the minister's decision. He stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There was two years delay in a response to the petition. In those years no contact was made with the survivors during the decision making process. Also there was no apparent study of other countries progression on the issue.\"</p><p>The petitioner also asked to which survivors the minister had spoken who would be against a public inquiry, while recognising that although some survivors might welcome an inquiry, others might prefer that the issue was not raised in public because that would reopen old wounds. The petitioner suggests that we need to find a way of meeting the needs of both sets of survivors.</p><p>After receiving the minister's response, the committee took oral evidence from the Minister for Education and Young People at its meeting of 29 September 2004. In his opening remarks to the committee, the minister stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I make as clear as I possibly can that the decision not to proceed to an inquiry does not imply that the Executive does not acknowledge that, at times in the past, the treatment of some of our young people fell well short of what should be regarded as acceptable.\"</p><p>He continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Executive is very clear ... that some of the things that happened to young people in residential settings were gross and truly appalling.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Public Petitions Committee</em>, 29 September 2004; c 1046.]</p><p>Having heard from the minister, the committee agreed unanimously that the issues raised by the petition warranted a full debate in the Parliament. As I have stated, this is the first time that the committee has taken such action, which emphasises the seriousness of the issues that the chamber is being asked to debate today. The committee also agreed to invite further comments from the Minister for Education and Young People, the Catholic Church, Quarriers Homes, the In Care Abuse Survivors/In Care Abused Support group&#8212;INCAS&#8212;and the petitioner.</p><p>The minister subsequently responded to the committee. In a letter dated 5 November 2004, he stated that he had met the petitioner and INCAS on two occasions since giving evidence to the committee and that they had received a presentation on the actions that are being taken in the area of child protection. The committee has also received responses from INCAS, Quarriers and the petitioner. In its response to the committee, Quarriers states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Quarrier's position is that if any individual suffered abuse at Quarrier's then we apologise.\"</p><p>As of the deadline of 26 November, the Catholic Church had yet to respond to our request.</p><p>As I have stated, the committee will decide at its meeting of 22 December what further action to <place-holder colnum=\"12400\"/> take on PE535. It will be useful for the committee to hear the views of colleagues today on what I am sure we all agree are hugely important issues, not just for the victims, but for Scotland as a progressive and enlightened society. On behalf of the Public Petitions Committee, I again welcome this afternoon's debate. In calling for the debate, we have done a good thing.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes public petition PE535 calling for the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Executive to (a) conduct an inquiry into past institutional child abuse, in particular for those children who were in the care of the state under the supervision of religious orders and (b) make an unreserved apology for the said state bodies and to urge the religious orders to apologise unconditionally.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13328378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Institutional Child Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As convener of the Public Petitions Committee, I welcome the First Minister's statement and the contributions from Nicola Sturgeon, Annabel Goldie, Jim Wallace, Robin Harper, Rosie Kane and Margo MacDonald.

That is a positive view of life that is full of hope for a better society.</p><p>I have worked closely with doctors and nurses in the palliative care and hospice movement, so I have come to understand just how difficult it is for anyone to make a judgment about what constitutes a worthwhile or worthless life. I have met lots of doctors who have had patients who valued their lives and who fought to preserve their lives in circumstances that the doctors viewed as being insufferable. Every palliative care professional can tell of a patient who has said that they often wished for the end of their life to come. It is my view that that leads, more often than not, to a valuable discussion about the various issues and allows an opportunity to deepen doctor-patient trust.<place-holder colnum=\"11882\"/></p><p>It is universally acknowledged that patients are reassured when they are told that expressing such thoughts will not result in action to terminate their lives. Experience also shows that it has been extremely rare for patients to make determined and persistent requests for their lives to be terminated. The doctor-patient relationship would be seriously compromised if patients could not express their distress lest it lead to euthanasia.</p><p>There is good evidence that a desire for death in terminally ill patients is closely associated with clinical depression. The desire for death can also vary with time and depression is, potentially, treatable. Delirium or confusion is common in palliative care patients and is sometimes so subtle that it is difficult even for clinicians to recognise it. It is impossible to be absolutely confident that a request for a life to be ended does not arise from a disordered state of mind, whether treatable or not.</p><p>Most doctors believe that any obligation on them to consider carrying out euthanasia or, if they have a conscientious objection to it, to refer the patient to a willing colleague, would be fundamentally at variance with their duty as doctors to honour the sanctity of life. I also think that the effect of such action on doctors would be enormous. The taking of life would diminish them as individuals and it would lead to psychological problems for many doctors in the long term.</p><p>Palliative care doctors tell me that clinical care is effective in alleviating suffering. That would be undermined by the practice of euthanasia. Obviously, there will be times when a doctor cannot help a patient clinically; not all problems can be fixed. However, even if we could be sure that a doctor was dealing with a competent and mentally sound patient with intolerable and untreatable suffering, the overwhelming majority still believe that the taking of life is wrong because of the clinical principle of non-abandonment.</p><p>Sometimes, all that a doctor can do is accompany the patient as a caring and even loving clinician who does not give up on them, even when they cannot remove the problem. It is precisely because humans are never worthless that we should attempt to alleviate suffering or, where we cannot do any more, we should still care.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327136", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dying with Dignity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the second occasion this week on which we have discussed individual rights and freedoms.

The SNP's message this morning is that the party has accepted that it is led from London. It cannot bring Mr Salmond up from London, so it has to waste valuable debating time in this chamber massaging his ego, which can almost be seen from London. He is obviously so full of his own importance that he probably hopes to die in his own arms.</p><p>Everyone can see through the SNP's ploy. The debate shows that Mr Salmond pulls the strings from afar and has no difficulty in causing his party to hinder the business of Holyrood. In doing so, however, he exposes yet again the paucity of serious policy emanating from the SNP. As was evident from her speech, Nicola Sturgeon is clearly intent on condensing the most words into the least amount of thought. Mr Salmond was once seen in political circles as someone with genuine promise. Now he is just full of empty promises.

Of course Scotland has an aging population, but that section of society is currently benefiting from Labour policies.

In 2003-04, Scottish pensioner households were on average &#163;1,400 better off as a result of UK measures introduced since 1997. Unlike the SNP, with its short-term vision, Labour is committed to creating a better life for older people in Scotland&#8212;permanently. We will do that by enabling older people to live healthy, independent lives and by ensuring that a long-term strategy is applied for the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Since Labour came to power, there have been many advances that have enriched and improved the quality of life of our aging population, boosting the overall fundamental entitlements of older people in Scotland. The SNP, having nothing to offer pensioners, is attempting to con Scotland's pensioners into giving up many of the major benefits that they have received under Labour. Through the Labour-led Scottish Executive, the UK Department for Work and Pensions, local government and voluntary organisations, the partnership against poverty working group can encourage older people to claim what they are entitled to.</p><p>It is disappointing that, instead of encouraging pensioners to claim what they are entitled to, the Lib Dems are, typically and for political point-scoring purposes, joining the SNP in finding fault. They would rather cut the benefits that are <place-holder colnum=\"11530\"/> available and add the complication of a new benefit. By being part of the Scottish Executive, the Lib Dems have the benefit of the economic success of the Labour Government in London, but they want to pick away at the sensible economic basis for that success. There is no better example of people who, having been given a bar of gold, complain that there is no handle on it to help them to carry it to the bank. Robert Brown's amendment is characteristic of that attitude. The Lib Dems have no ideas about how to create the stable economy at the UK level from which pensioners in this country can gain, but they have any amount of ways to criticise the Labour Government that has delivered the success from which the Executive has benefited financially.</p><p>The SNP's proposed divorce from the rest of the UK could seriously put at risk the stability and security that has been created by Labour's economic progress to date. The Lib Dems' vacuous point scoring is little better. How can any of them help poorer pensioners in Scotland by undermining the economic benefits that are being harvested by Whitehall? If political idiocy reached the same levels as current oil prices, the SNP could pay for its spending plans by selling the drilling rights to the Lib Dems.

The progress made so far by the Scottish Executive is welcome. There has been significant improvement, but this morning we need to take the opportunity to urge further development.</p><p>As I have shared some sports fields with the minister, he will know that I engage in sport, despite my physique. There is no truth in the rumour that I believe that if God had wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them further up my body, nor do I hold to the opinion that the one advantage of exercise is that we will all die healthier.</p><p>I join the minister in recognising the contribution of the Scots paralympians. Their achievements in recent days have been important to us all in enabling us to recognise their value and what they can contribute to Scottish society. However, important though the recognition given by the minister and other members is, I urge the minister to go further and to ensure that the paralympians are recognised in the same way as our other Olympians were recognised, and that they also have a reception at Bute House and are given the opportunity to go through the streets of Edinburgh.</p><p>It is vital that sport is seen as a way of promoting inclusion in our society. We must use the examples of James Anderson, Andrew Lindsay and others who have done so well for us in recent times and add them to the Colin Montgomeries and Andrew Murrays who play sport at the top level. Our contribution to the disabled community must be to promote the accessibility of sports to them.</p><p>As John Swinburne and others said, there are certainly potential heroes and top sportspeople out there in Scotland. It is also true that there are potential heroes in the disabled community who cannot get access to sport because the facilities are not there. Disabled people are not taken into consideration when sports facilities are located too far away for people to be able to travel to them, are not accessible and offer a restricted range of sports.</p><p>What is true for the disabled community is true for the rest of society. Members have pointed out that the standard of available facilities is vital. For example, there is a sports club in my home village of Newarthill, in my constituency, which is primarily an amateur boxing club but is open to the wider community as a fitness centre. Unfortunately, the <place-holder colnum=\"10523\"/> facility that people use is a dilapidated old portakabin, which was donated by a former business. The club is the only such facility in the village and the community needs modern facilities. I have worked closely with the club to try to secure support and resources from sportscotland for a new facility, and we have tried to draw in people from the private sector who have a commitment to the local community. However, we are caught in a dilemma. The demand is there&#8212;local football clubs would participate in a new facility&#8212;but the resources are not there to provide the facilities that the football clubs would need. As the minister knows, football is primarily played during the winter months, when it gets dark early, so floodlights are needed if young boys and girls are to be able to participate. However, the resources are not there to provide floodlights. It is a catch-22 situation: there is an identified demand and a willingness to provide facilities, but the resources are not there to provide the facilities that would attract more resources. That vicious circle needs to be addressed in any future strategies that the minister might develop.</p><p>There is real frustration that young people who want to participate in sport cannot get access to sport. I am from Lanarkshire, so I can knock on the head the myth that young people do not want to take part in youth activities because they do not want to spill their Buckfast. Young people want to get involved in sport, but the facilities are not available in their communities to allow them to do so and to become the heroes that we have heard about.

I knew little of their country and even less of the system that they were evidently relieved to have escaped. At the end of our discussion, I was left with two abiding memories. One was of bewilderment, not only that such a barbaric Government could be allowed to get away with systematic brutality, but that it clearly had support from the west. The other memory that I have is of the heartfelt pleas of those students and their insistence that if Britain and other western countries did not desist from supporting Saddam Hussein, the people of Iraq were destined to suffer even greater terror at his hands. Soon after that encounter, we learned of the massacre at Halabjah. My anger at the complicity of my country's then Government in turning a blind eye to that barbarism remains as strong today as it was then.</p><p>As time marched on, I attended more and more events at which Saddam was condemned and action called for to deal with his tyrannical regime, but still the west did nothing until Saddam threatened the oil supplies by invading Kuwait. Only then was action taken. Alas, that action was only about oil. As history tells us, we were still not interested enough in the people of Iraq to bring down the Baathist regime. The truth was&#8212;and I know that this flies in the face of the clich&#233;s about <place-holder colnum=\"8772\"/> the war being for Iraqi oil&#8212;that we had no oil interest in Iraq and had no need therefore to cross into Iraq. Saddam was left in place and the west got on with ignoring the plight of the Iraqi people. UN resolution after UN resolution was passed and ignored and Iraqi after Iraqi died because, collectively, the UN did not care enough to do anything. Now we have done something and I believe that we did the right thing&#8212;better late than never.</p><p>I do not particularly care that we did not find weapons of mass destruction. We know that Saddam Hussein had them because he had used them previously and we knew that he would be capable of using them again. The only reason why he cannot do so now is not because he does not have them but because we now have him. I am confident that the four students that I met 20 years ago are glad about that.

We must accept that we are here because the electorate made Parliament the way it is; we must deal with that reality.</p><p>The bill is not big, but it encompasses a huge array of issues. We have heard various views on the case for change and the case against it. We have debated power&#8212;who has it, how they got it and how it is used. We have assessed the way in which those who serve in local government are rewarded and how we can widen access to under-<place-holder colnum=\"6983\"/> represented groups and increase eligibility for membership of councils. Trish Marwick and Mark Ballard made points about that.</p><p>I think that the bill achieves a good balance in many of those respects. To attempt to reform local government alone will be difficult, but to attempt to do it by dealing with electoral reform as well makes the attempt much more contentious. We will not achieve perfection through the bill, but we can aim for merit; I think that the bill has that.</p><p>The prospect of the introduction of STV elections does not sit comfortably with the Labour Party in particular. That that is no secret was exemplified by the speeches of Elaine Smith, John Home Robertson, Helen Eadie and others. However, I have always believed in electoral reform and in the pragmatism of the Labour Party. We have a programme for making the lives of Scotland's people better; our part in the partnership agreement with the Liberal Democrats is about furthering our programme in the political context in which we find ourselves in Parliament.</p><p>Scottish Labour stands for a number of things, each of which will have a different priority at any given time. One thing that holds true regardless of political circumstances is our desire that there be redistribution of power from the few to the many. As Aneurin Bevan said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The purpose of getting power is to be able to give it away.\"</p><p>Whatever else is debated in relation to the bill, the PR debate is not about a sell-out of any Labour principle.</p><p>In the context of the mass-industrialised society, which was polarised between two great ideologies and parties, first past the post was the logical system by which to distribute power. Labour was founded to break that system and we have won that battle. The universal franchise was achieved and it has been put to good use for the improvement of material welfare. Society has moved on and the Labour Party has made that happen. As a result, the construction of a working coalition in the Scottish Parliament has become both necessary and necessarily difficult. That said, it opens up more exciting prospects for representation, for engaging with the electorate and, especially, for fairness. The same could happen in local government.</p><p>In today's pluralist society, we require to reconcile the needs and desires of different sectors of society. The voting system, the way in which representatives are elected and the structures under which they work can enhance the process of managing those different needs and can aid the finding of a balance for those desires. We have to realise that what might be fairer for the electorate might not be in the interests of any one <place-holder colnum=\"6984\"/> party. For many years, the Labour Party has enjoyed a comfortable hegemony in Scotland, but we cannot afford to sit comfortably any longer. In this age of modernisation and institutional change, we cannot afford simply to hold tight to the status quo.</p><p>From the time of its foundation, Labour has been a party of democratic reform. It is a party that was built on the knowledge that social justice and democratic fairness go hand in hand. We are now in a position to return to our roots&#8212;to the commitments of James Keir Hardy, as Sarah Boyack said. As the MSP for the constituency in which James Keir Hardy was born, I am proud to share his conviction in and support for electoral reform. I am equally comfortable in subscribing to the words of the Independent Labour Party, which in 1913 stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no system of election can be satisfactory which does not give opportunity to all parties to obtain representation in proportion to their strength.\"</p><p>The proposals for electoral reform that are set out in the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill are a compromise. Although the aim of the compromise was to achieve stability in the Scottish Parliament, it is a good compromise. The proposal for three to four-member wards will allow us to maintain a strong ward-councillor link. It will allow, as McIntosh and Kerley demanded, geographical diversity and the potential for a close fit between council wards and natural communities.</p><p>David Mundell spoke about electoral reform being delivered as part of the new constitutional devolution settlement. A consequence of the settlement is that it must also come at local level&#8212;a reality with which I have no difficulty in engaging. It places Labour in a position to reclaim the mantle as the champion of our own ideals.</p><p>Robert Brown spoke about the bill giving us an opportunity to do what is best for Scotland. The bill will allow those who serve their local communities to be rewarded properly for their service. A by-product is that the electorate might be encouraged to turn out and vote, as Tommy Sheridan said. In the end, it is up to us: the challenge is before each and every political party.</p><p>Whether or not it transpires that the electorate are encouraged to turn out and vote, the bill will certainly give those who cast their vote a political system that facilitates fairer representation. That is worth achieving in itself and it is why Parliament should support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13314426", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Governance (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree entirely with that.

Indeed, it is difficult not to become blas&#233; about the record that the Scottish Executive has established in delivering much-needed funding to our local authorities&#8212;but we must try.</p><p>I take this opportunity, therefore, to welcome again the Executive's commitment to increasing funding for local government. I am pleased to see, <place-holder colnum=\"5632\"/> from the minister's announcement, that real increases have been found for local government, which will see it continue to benefit from the minister's sound handling of the country's finances. Three-year settlements, I believe, are an important aspect of the way that local government budgets are produced. Such settlements enable local authorities to plan budgets better, to manage them more effectively and to deliver the quality of services to which we in the Labour Party especially are committed.</p><p>I particularly welcome the increases in aggregate external finance to North Lanarkshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council, which amounts for North Lanarkshire to a 5.9 increase in the financial settlement for 2004-05 and a further 5 per cent increase in 2005-06, while South Lanarkshire will get increases amounting to 6.7 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. As for other local authorities, the settlement provides an above-inflation increase in revenue grant from 2004 to 2006. That has to be welcomed and will guarantee that the Lanarkshire councils can continue to work towards raising standards and responding to local needs, bringing lasting improvements to the quality of life of the community and continuing to build on investments and innovations that already benefit local citizens and economies through the work of the local authorities. That work goes from the large-scale physical improvements of roads and buildings to improvements in lifestyles, such as providing a piece of fresh fruit for schoolchildren. However large or small those things are, the variety of projects will make a meaningful difference.</p><p>In addition to the AEF support that was announced in the settlement, I am pleased to note the extension to current funding arrangements for the better neighbourhood services fund. The sums that have been announced will enable the councils and their partners to continue to provide more strategic services in North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire. However, the future of the BNSF and the social inclusion partnerships funding remains under debate, so I urge the Executive to safeguard council funding in those areas.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's commitment to funding the new services and policies that local councils are being asked to deliver. As the main providers of education, the councils are committed to the Executive's five national priorities to improve standards at every level. For example, South Lanarkshire Council is looking to achieve a 10 per cent reduction in the time that teachers must spend on administration, with a commitment to achieving the recommendations of the report \"Time for Teaching: Improving Administration in Schools\" by 2005. That must be welcomed.<place-holder colnum=\"5633\"/></p><p>I am also pleased to see that through the national priorities action fund&#8212;which is replacing the previous excellence fund within education&#8212;an additional &#163;1.66 million will be given in the settlement as a specific grant to North Lanarkshire Council. That is a welcome package, which is earmarked for the nutrition in schools initiative, with the dual purpose of providing fruit to primary 1 and primary 2 children as well as improving the overall nutritional value of school meals. It is vital that the Executive and local government continue to work towards the provision of healthy and nutritious food in schools and towards the promotion of health in general. The settlements this year will obviously help that.</p><p>In the light of the Executive's commitment to challenge antisocial behaviour and address youth crime within that, I welcome especially the increase to the Lanarkshire councils' funding allocation to tackle youth crime. The purpose of the increase is to build on progress that has already been made by reducing the number of persistent offenders and achieving the national standard for youth justice by 2006. Both Lanarkshire councils are committed to safer communities for everyone, with initiatives such as the antisocial task force in North Lanarkshire and the antisocial behaviour teams in South Lanarkshire. Those initiatives are at the heart of the councils' efforts.</p><p>Today's announcement is a good illustration that the Executive is confirming its commitment to communities and local government and to the policies and initiatives that are implemented by local authorities by yet again putting its money where its mouth is. Above-inflation increases will allow authorities to continue to improve the public services that they already deliver, to reduce class sizes and to support youth justice. It is a good settlement and I welcome it.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13310906", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/14)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Well, here we are again, debating local government and welcoming increases in the amounts that are going into local authority coffers.

Members' business debates are of vital importance to the work of MSPs in raising matters of a specific nature in respect of wider issues. Given that Hamilton park, which is one of the five racecourses in Scotland, is in my constituency, the debate gives me the opportunity to do that.</p><p>In general, Lanarkshire is historically synonymous with heavy industry, especially coal and steel. My constituency consists of communities that were built up around those two previously large sources of betting revenue. What is less well known is that my constituency also has <place-holder colnum=\"4733\"/> other historical significance and that it has some very beautiful areas of natural heritage.</p><p>The battle of Bothwell bridge was of great significance in respect of the involvement of the Covenanters. No doubt, the battle involved many horses. That battle is not to be confused with the battle of the Bothwell Bridge Hotel, which involved Barry Ferguson, some Celtic supporters and a kebab.</p><p>My constituency also contains Strathclyde country park and is an integral part of the Clyde valley tourist area. This is the picturesque setting that is home to Hamilton park racecourse. Hamilton park is independently owned and holds 18 race meetings a year. As Susan Deacon said, along with the other courses in Scotland, it has experienced a growth in popularity. Success in recent years has seen it outperform national averages. There has also been a pleasing increase in the number of senior jockeys attending race meetings at Hamilton park in recent years, including the champion jockey Kieron Fallon.</p><p>Since 2000, racegoers' attendance has increased by 26 per cent, with 58,866 visitors attracted to the course in 2003. Since 2000, prize money has increased by 50 per cent to over &#163;1 million in 2003. Over &#163;3 million of racecourse income has been invested since the year 2000.</p><p>Hamilton park has been proud to win two awards this year. The first was for ground staff of the year for flat racing. The second&#8212;no matter what John Scott says&#8212;was for the best racecourse in Scotland and the north-east. The course was recently described in <em>The Times</em> by Alan Lee as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a course heading for the heights\".</p><p>The OFT has concluded that the orders and rules of racing limit the capacity for the racing industry to comply with competition law. The conclusion might result in a fixture free-for-all. It could also result in a reduction in the value of racecourse betting income and in the picture and data rights that total more than half of racecourse annual income.</p><p>Like those who run Hamilton park, I welcome the opportunity for more freedom to run more races and to have more of a say on race dates. I am told that another three or four fixtures a year could be added at Hamilton. Currently, only one-day events are held there, eight of which are held in the evening. Although that is of benefit to local hotels, Hamilton park is looking for growth. It wants to appeal to corporate business, attract additional local racegoers and host other events.</p><p>As Susan Deacon said, a fixture free-for-all is envisaged as a result of the OFT decision. That could pose certain downsides for Hamilton park. <place-holder colnum=\"4734\"/></p><p>Like other courses in Scotland, the course is small, independent and at a geographical disadvantage in respect of accessibility. Although those factors do not undermine its achievements or its potential for further growth, there is the possibility that groups of racecourses in England could use their power to force smaller independent courses out of the good slots. Ultimately, that could reduce the attractiveness and viability of Scottish racing.</p><p>I urge the OFT to ensure that the racing industry can continue to operate within a structured framework that will allow successful independent racecourses to thrive. I am encouraged by the comments of the minister with responsibility for tourism and sport at Westminster that the Government wants to ensure that there are comprehensive arrangements for racing across the country.</p><p>Scotland's racecourses are looking for the support and backing of the Scottish Parliament for their continued growth. They also want an increase in the number of fixtures; the introduction of an all-weather racetrack; and the prospect of further economic development, investment and training. We need a self-sustaining Scottish racing industry that attracts breeders, owners and trainers. All of that would lead to an expansion of the industry, which, in turn, would lead to the industry making a greater contribution to the economy and to increased employment.</p><p>It is important that we have fair trading, but the OFT must not prevent good trading. There is justifiable concern that its efforts will do just that in respect of horse racing. The Scottish Executive should make every effort to ensure that the OFT addresses the industry's concerns.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308728", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Horse Racing Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join John Scott in congratulating Susan Deacon on securing this evening's debate.

One is the problem of antisocial behaviour and the other is transport. I am glad that the Scottish Executive has increased its efforts to tackle both issues.</p><p>The Executive's commitment to delivering an integrated transport system for Scotland is progressing through its increased investment and balanced thinking and planning. I particularly welcome the Executive's transport priorities in Lanarkshire, such as the construction of the Larkhall to Milngavie line, which will be of great benefit to my constituency as it will provide an enhanced link from Hamilton to other parts of the county, although I remain sceptical about the ability of current proposals to address the problems at either end of the Bellshill bypass at the Raith and Shawhead interchanges.</p><p>I welcome the initiatives to extend concessionary fare schemes for older people and people with disabilities and the scheme to introduce concessionary travel for young people on bus, rail and ferry links. Those measures reflect a Labour-led Executive committed to a mission of social justice and a sustainable development strategy for Scotland.</p><p>Because Labour recognises that a strong economy relies fundamentally on our transport <place-holder colnum=\"2890\"/> infrastructure, I take the opportunity to draw to the Executive's attention an impending problem, which could impact negatively on Scotland's economy if it is left unaddressed. From March 2005 mobile workers in the road transport sector will benefit from the 48-hour week contained in the provisions of the working time directive, which are to be extended to cover sectors that were previously excluded, such as road haulage.</p><p>However, the implementation of the road transport directive has massive implications for Scotland's economy. There will be an impact not only on the road haulage industry but on our manufacturing base. Scotland has 9.8 per cent of operators' licences for running heavy trucks in the UK but, as far as I am aware, there has not yet been any specific research to assess the impact of the new directive on Scotland's economy. There has been UK research, but an extra and separate factor must be considered for Scotland. Scotland's distance from its marketplace means that drivers must travel further and journeys to delivery destinations therefore take longer. Although I welcome measures that the European Commission has taken to improve road safety and to protect further the health, safety and welfare of workers in road transport, the directive may seriously undermine Scotland's ability to compete in the road haulage industry. It may have a negative knock-on effect on our manufacturing base if the Scottish Executive does not develop a strategy for assisting the industry.</p><p>Working time for mobile workers covers the time devoted to all road transport activities&#8212;including driving, loading and unloading, assisting passengers to board or to disembark, cleaning and technical maintenance. It also includes time during which workers must be at their work station, ready to take up normal work. That will include, for example, periods spent waiting for unloading when that duration is not known in advance. A great deal of planning, preparation and change will need to be managed. There will be huge costs and operational implications, which will have to be considered now. UK research estimates that at least 60,000 additional drivers will be required, because drivers' average working hours currently exceed the limit of 48 hours. That figure for additional drivers assumes that demand will not increase. The upside is that employers will have to employ more drivers to cover the hours that their existing drivers will no longer be permitted to work. The downside is that the UK and Scotland already have a severe shortage of drivers.</p><p>The introduction of night work restrictions means that a shift to day work is likely. That, in turn, may impact on road traffic congestion. That is likely to decrease average road speed by 5 per cent between 2002 and 2010, resulting in a fall in vehicle productivity. That, and other factors such <place-holder colnum=\"2891\"/> as the need to increase hourly pay for drivers to compensate for cuts in their working hours&#8212;let alone the need to recruit new drivers&#8212;will entail massive costs for the industry. As far as I am aware, the industry is more than happy to meet those costs because they will apply across the board&#8212;in other words, because there will be a level playing field.

The importance of today's debate rests on the Parliament's founding principles. The mace that was presented to the chamber in 1999 is inscribed with the pillars of \"Wisdom\", \"Justice\", \"Compassion\" and \"Integrity\". Of those principles, I believe that justice&#8212;for all our citizens regardless of race, religious belief, sexual orientation and so on, and in our parliamentary process&#8212;is of fundamental importance.</p><p>The principle of justice in equality is enshrined in the Scotland Act 1998, which led to the creation of our Parliament. The commitment to justice was sustained by the consultative steering group's commitment that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"equal opportunities should be mainstreamed into the work of the Parliament, and through the demands of and scrutinising of the Parliament, into the work of the Executive.\"</p><p>Having had the privilege of serving on the Equal Opportunities Committee in the first session, I was proud that, in taking forward its agenda, the committee recognised the requirement to provide guidance to ensure the mainstreaming of equality issues in the work of the parliamentary committees. Our work began on 24 October 2000, and our task was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to devise a means of ensuring that equality was 'built in' from the beginning, rather than 'bolted on' at the end\",</p><p>as had arguably been the case in the past.</p><p>That recognition of a requirement for process improvements is a good example of how our young Parliament has grown and matured. Having served on the Equal Opportunities Committee in the first session, I am happy to reiterate Margaret Curran's recognition of the particular role that was played by Kate Maclean, and of her leadership in taking forward an inclusive consultation process. I know that Cathy Peattie will build on that work.</p><p>I welcome the encouragement and guidance that has come from a variety of civic bodies, such as the CRE, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the governance of Scotland forum. I particularly welcome the opportunity that we had <place-holder colnum=\"2224\"/> to engage with stakeholders from the north-east during our visit to Aberdeen in April 2002. During a civic participation event that the committee held on the subject, the committee noted representations from more than 55 individuals from organisations operating throughout the north-east.</p><p>The committee report made nine recommendations for action, many of which will be familiar to members. They include the provision of equality guidelines for committees and a need to equality proof Scottish Executive legislation. The committee noted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The greatest hurdle to starting the ... mainstreaming process can be the absence of political will\".</p><p>I am pleased that, in the committee's judgment, the Parliament had an</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unwavering commitment of political will towards mainstreaming equality.\"</p><p>I welcome the conclusion of researchers at Sheffield Hallam University, which were highlighted by Elaine Smith. The researchers said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish parliament is at the leading edge in mainstreaming equality\".</p><p>With mainstreaming commitments in place, it is important that we examine where specific process improvements can be made, and that is what the report does. In particular, education is key to delivering a mainstreaming strategy in our committee processes. The need for members and staff of the Parliament to be fully aware of equality issues was recognised under recommendation 3, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee recommends that the SPCB agree to the provision of training on mainstreaming equality which will complement existing training on equal opportunities within the Parliament.\"</p><p>Such a desire was raised by a number of consultees, including Fair Play and the Disabled Persons Housing Service.</p><p>The introduction of two training courses in the Parliament has been a welcome outcome. However, the education process must go beyond that. Ensuring that all members, their support staff and those who participate in the policy process are aware of our commitments in that regard is key to mainstreaming. With that in mind, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should consider how it can broaden the availability and awareness of such courses to all members and to their constituency staff, who are essential in aiding members deliver for their constituents. Training must go beyond SPCB staff, and consideration should be given to the production of material highlighting the importance of mainstreaming equality in the policy process. Those resources must be made available via the Parliament's website.<place-holder colnum=\"2225\"/></p><p>It is important for members to recall that a mainstreaming strategy is not, in itself, a guarantee of equality; rather, it guarantees that equality issues will be considered. The principle of delivering the mainstreaming of equality in the policy process should be a priority for all those who believe in the importance of equality of opportunity in the Parliament. Education and training, both for internal use and for external audiences, are key to targeting delivery.</p><p>Mary Scanlon and Christine May mentioned changing attitudes and challenging prejudices, and I was recently reminded of how important that is. The west of Scotland forensic steering group has attempted to consult on the siting of a medium-secure unit in my constituency for people with mental disorders. I understand the prejudices and fears that people have in that respect, but I cannot understand why four MSPs&#8212;four people who should know better&#8212;would join together to issue a press release supporting a campaign that builds on those prejudices. In that press release, people with mental health problems were called \"unsavoury characters\". It was argued that the secure unit should not be sited at the proposed location because it would be too near schools. The press release suggested that we should be saving the health service money, as the people concerned should be locked up in Dungavel. That came from an MSP. What an absolute disgrace! The press release goes on to suggest that to locate the secure unit in my constituency would \"create stigma\" for people with mental health problems.</p><p>I hope that those four MSPs are ashamed of themselves for pandering to prejudice, rather than confronting and challenging it. Perhaps the secure unit should not come to my constituency, because it may not be the right location&#8212;that is what the consultation is about. It is not about targeting people with mental health problems and allowing campaigns to be run against them. The four MSPs concerned should take the first opportunity to come to the Parliament to apologise for what they have done. Only then can we genuinely believe that we are challenging prejudice and only then will this debate mean something.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mainstreaming Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to speak in this important debate, which allows us to focus on two key issues that are of real importance: equal opportunities for all Scots; and the primacy of the parliamentary process in our democracy.

Scottish health care should be no different. With the changing pattern of health care services, decisions need to be taken in an open, honest and informed way, to ensure that patients are able to have their say on health care strategies that affect them, and to deliver high-quality services that address inequalities and inefficiencies in the right way. Working together is the key, as that will empower patients, communities and professionals, involve them in the decision-making process, and assist in addressing what individuals need and want.</p><p>Throughout Scottish health care services, new duties and roles have been adapted to address the ever-transforming nature of health care. By emphasising the patient, individuals are given a voice and are respected and involved in their own care.</p><p>Transparency with a flexible approach is crucial, but we need radical thinking now for a radical change tomorrow. We must combat the conservatism that is often exhibited by professionals in the NHS. No longer must we assume that the doctor always knows best. If power is to be devolved into the hands of the people, we must challenge the position of the British Medical Association and those within it who oppose change. For public requirements to be met, doctors and health care professionals should remember that they are, first and foremost, public servants who meet the requirements of the people whom they serve.</p><p>Patients should have an active role in their own care, by contributing to things that affect them and their families and by being involved more widely in developing and improving communication and partnerships throughout the population, developing new partnerships and strengthening existing ones.</p><p>Reform of the current system will ensure participation by patients, families, stakeholder groups and communities.

Cancer Research UK has shown that breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women and, with the exception of melanoma skin cancer, is the fastest growing cancer for Scottish women. As the research shows, one in nine women are at risk of breast cancer. We must never lessen our commitment to address that.<place-holder colnum=\"16924\"/></p><p>While we must not diminish in any way the serious impact that the disease has on women, we cannot ignore the much neglected fact that around one in every 2,400 men are at risk from breast cancer. My father-in-law died from breast cancer. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing and recognising the disease in men, by the time male breast cancer is diagnosed it has usually progressed to an advanced stage. It should be recognised that the treatment for men and women given such a diagnosis would be the same.</p><p>Male breast cancer is uncommon. It is equally true that the disease is less common in younger women. My wife was diagnosed when she was only 33. Most women are diagnosed after the menopause, but a staggering 17 per cent are aged below 50 when they are diagnosed. My point is that in addressing the overall effect of breast cancer, we must not lose sight of the minority groups among those statistics that are affected by the onset of the disease.</p><p>The good news is that, in general, mortality rates have decreased by 22 per cent in the last 10 years, and five-year survival rates in Scotland are at 75 per cent. That is due to earlier detection and improved treatment, which is the result of good research such as that carried out by essential organisations such as Cancer Research UK.</p><p>It is essential that funding is available for research into the importance of genetics, hormones and lifestyle, all of which control the development of the disease, with a view to developing better treatments, increasing the effectiveness of present facilities and finding new ways of detecting the cancer earlier. Investigating issues such as risk factors, prevention, treatment and drug therapy, earlier detection and screening are paramount. We must do everything in our power to ensure that those developments continue.</p><p>I cannot commend highly enough the medical and ancillary staff on their dedication, hard work, and relentless commitment to supporting patients and their families, which I have seen at first hand. Organisations such as Glasgow's Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Research UK, CancerBACUP, Macmillan Cancer Relief, Marie Curie Cancer Care and more organisations besides are committed to research into diagnosis, treatment, clinical trials, alternative therapies and the psychological impact of the disease, to name but a few of the processes that are involved in breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and support.</p><p>I know from personal experience that those organisations, both voluntary and professional, are at the core of the treatment. I have met a plethora of organisations that provide treatment, support and guidance to patients and families of breast cancer sufferers, I know the high level of <place-holder colnum=\"16925\"/> commitment and dedication of the staff involved and I wish to pass on my full support and thanks, and that of all members, to them.</p><p>It is with those thoughts in mind that I have no hesitation in supporting Keith Harding's motion. I thank him for bringing breast cancer to the awareness of Parliament again. We need to know more. We need to know the how, the why and the when.

As the minister pointed out, in no other part of the United Kingdom do local authorities have the certainty of knowing three years in advance what their central Government funding allocations will be. That is welcome, as it gives local authorities a certain security, allied to the flexibility that will allow them to make significant progress across the board.</p><p>Partnership is key in identifying shared priorities, which allows local authorities to plan for the long term and work together to remove any barriers to improvement. From what I have heard, I think that we now have much more open dialogue about the priority issues for both levels of government. That has to be a good thing.</p><p>Perhaps because of that, the increase in local authority capital investment allocations has already borne results, not only in additional local services and infrastructure, but in improved planning, and has paved the way for continued and sustained improvements for the future.</p><p>We are now in year two of the three-year local government settlement. The additional &#163;350 million in grant support is welcome and will build on the real-terms increases announced last year. Local authorities will receive an increase of almost 11 per cent this year, which will bring the increase in total revenue grant support that local authorities receive next year to more than four times the projected rate of inflation. The situation is almost unparalleled and demonstrates the Executive's commitment to providing better public services for Scotland's citizens and to continuing the vital role that local government plays in delivering those services. Every local authority is set to receive an above-inflation increase in revenue grant. When the move from ring fencing to local outcome agreements develops further, we will, I hope, see further progress on optimising service provision.</p><p>It is important that we realise the difference that an efficient, fairer system of funding will make for local authorities and service users, working for the communities and the people of Scotland.

Seeking to extend the choice of venue for those who want to have a civil marriage in Scotland is a very worthwhile aim and one that deserves the support of the Parliament. It is high time that the present anomaly was addressed. I congratulate Euan Robson on doing so in the bill. Proposing legislation that will allow couples to get married in the venue of their choice, rather than being restricted to one of Scotland's 247 registration offices, makes perfect sense. People should not be penalised, as they are at the moment, purely because they opt for a non-religious ceremony, so I welcome the modernisation of this aspect of the marriage ceremony in Scotland.</p><p>However, there is always a but. By and large, I agree with the bulk of the proposals in the bill, but there are a number of issues that need more clarification. I am pleased that Euan Robson has accepted that to be the case in making many changes to the bill in line with the concerns that were raised during consideration of the bill in committee.</p><p>I am disappointed, however, that Euan Robson will not accept the changes that were proposed by the Equal Opportunities Committee, which centre on a local authority's requirement to pass judgment on what is \"seemly and dignified\" and \"morally disreputable\". How can it be reasonable to ask a local authority to judge on the suitability of a venue by having to interpret such highly subjective and vague terminology? Those terms are almost impossible to define in a meaningful way that would be acceptable and inoffensive to all. I urge the Executive to reconsider the requirement for that apparently unnecessary, restrictive and downright impractical definitive description. Is it not enough that the ceremony should be conducted in a safe, practical and trouble-free setting?</p><p>Furthermore, the requirement that the local authority should be satisfied that the venue has</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no recent or continuing connection with any religion or religious practice\"</p><p>is also too restrictive. I cannot conceive of a current religious building being used, but I have to question why a former religious building or connected establishment could not be suitable for a civil ceremony. As such buildings would no longer be consecrated, the restriction appears ludicrous.</p><p>Trish Godman and Iain Smith mentioned the former church building across the road from this chamber&#8212;the Hub, which is a case in point. If it, a former church, can be home to a cafe, bar and <place-holder colnum=\"5563\"/> internet facilities, and be a venue for meetings of parliamentary committees, why should it not be a place where civil marriages can take place? Indeed, it could be argued that any parliamentary meetings that took place there would be more immoral. They are certainly likely to be more unseemly and undignified. If we can meet in a building such as the Hub, why cannot a civil marriage take place in a similar circumstance?</p><p>The bill should not burden local authorities with omnipotent decisions on what is dignified for a marriage service. A wedding ceremony is an individual and personal event and has different meanings for different people. To provide equality and impartiality, we must embrace cultural diversity rather than endorse the rules that restrict it. The aim of asking local authorities to assess the appropriateness of a venue's moral suitability is worrying and may lead intentionally or unintentionally to discriminatory practices and blinkered decisions.</p><p>If considerations are to be objective and avoid bias, the prerequisites in the bill must be revised. The subjectivity of the restrictions defeats the purpose of the bill's aims. Although I agree with the principles of the bill, I hope that the above points will be considered in future scrutiny of it.</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13264796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the general principles of the Marriage (Scotland) Bill.

Those reasons stem from a belief that an electoral system should be about good governance rather than the vested interests of parties. For me, electoral reform is a matter of principle. My principles may be different from those that Helen Eadie espouses, but they are my principles. Electoral reform is about encouraging the type of consensus that will allow us to develop good policies at whatever level those policies have to be delivered.</p><p>If we in Scotland truly want a society that operates on the basis of inclusion and co-operation, we have to begin by having debates on electoral reform that will at least take the matter forward. What we cannot have is the type of tawdry mudslinging that we have heard from the nationalists this morning, especially and unfortunately from Tricia Marwick, Stewart Stevenson and Kay Ullrich, whose comments about Motherwell and Monklands border on the slanderous.</p><p>Have we heard much today about principle from the SNP? Was there much in the SNP contributions that developed the issue of electoral reform? I believe that we have heard quite the contrary. The Scottish nationalists have said little about the opportunity for change. The creation of the Scottish Parliament has given us all a tremendous opportunity to provide a modern electoral system in local government that is fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century and that aims to play a part in achieving progressive reform of local government.</p><p>What the SNP has done in this debate runs counter to that. Apart from a limited attempt by Kenny Gibson, SNP members, rather than outlining how we can reduce distortion in electoral results, have tried to paint a picture of sleaze. Instead of addressing the cause of disillusion with the current system, they have concentrated on their recent hobby-horse of cronyism. Not for them a coherent argument about the need to tackle disfranchisement. What they have said is an assault on local democracy itself. They have sought to portray Labour-run local authorities as places of corruption and maladministration, while ignoring the mass of good work that goes on and the talent that brings it about.</p><p>We have heard an attempt to place in the minds of the electorate the image of a Labour party that abuses the position given to it in local authorities by that same voting public. Through some weird type of reasoning, the SNP has attempted to argue Labour bad, SNP good. If this had been a proper debate about good governance, we would at least have heard an attempt to explain why we need local government reform for the sake of effective government. Instead, what we got was an <place-holder colnum=\"4338\"/> argument about why we need electoral reform to reduce the power of the Labour party.</p><p>We could have discussed the type of electoral system that would best achieve the good governance that we all aspire to and that we want from local authorities run by any political party. Instead, the SNP has sought to disguise the true intention behind holding this debate. SNP members want to portray themselves as the moral guardians of local government in Scotland, but the real reason for their stance is all about power, who has it and how it is shared. Labour has it and the SNP wants it.

What we got was mudslinging and innuendo. What about a comparison of electoral systems? Why STV and not AMS? The McIntosh report highlighted the different systems that could be used, but it did not recommend any. Kerley recommended STV, but could not get unanimity behind his report. Different voting systems provide different answers to the questions raised by them. Have we sought any of those answers here this morning? I suggest not.</p><p>All that has happened is that the Parliament has broken down into fixed party lines. The Lib Dems have always supported the principle of electoral reform.

Many areas of Scottish legislation are known to require remedial action, but finding the time to deal with them was previously a problem. The Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill comes into that category. It is simple enough to amend the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 and the Fire Services Act 1947 to allow working balances to be carried forward. The clear value inherent in such short bills leaves one wondering why they could not have been dealt with earlier.<place-holder colnum=\"2983\"/></p><p>This good bill has the sensible intention of bringing into force the suggestions that were made in the joint report of HM inspectorate of constabulary and the Accounts Commission for Scotland, \"Credit to the Force\". Fulfilling the bill's intention will allow police and fire boards to take greater value from their resources and to have greater stability in funding and enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in future financial planning. It is hardly surprising that the intentions of the bill found support from everyone who took part in the consultation process.</p><p>Another strength of the Parliament is that we are able quickly to pick up problems that have been identified by those who are affected by a bill. The progress of the Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill through the scrutiny process, via the Local Government Committee, raised a number of issues that the committee was required to cover in its report.</p><p>As previous speakers noted, three main issues arose during the consultation process. Colleagues on the committee have addressed those points already. I will focus on the issue that gave me the most cause for concern: the impact of the proposal to allow constituent authorities to withhold consent for the carry-forward of unspent moneys. Both ACPOS and CACFOA raised that issue and both provided the committee with disturbing scenarios of the potential consequences if an authority withheld its consent.</p><p>Chief Constable Rae of Strathclyde police said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"once one of the partners takes away its share of the cake, it is difficult for me to say that I will not send as many police officers to an incident because that authority has withheld a proportion of the budget.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Local Government Committee, </em>4 September 2001; c 2152.]</p><p>Those words were echoed by the CACFOA representatives. Their concerns were so strong that it would have been wrong if the committee had not taken cognisance of them. I am glad that the minister, like the committee, also recognised those concerns.</p><p>Once the committee had recognised the concerns that had been raised, members had no alternative but to conclude that the proposal on opt-outs in the bill was unacceptable. I am in no doubt that an authority's decision to withhold moneys could have led to a reduction in the level of provision within that authority at any given time. Therefore, I am pleased that the minister reconsidered that proposal and will lodge amendments. Surely it is right that the total underspend is either carried forward or withheld in its entirety. That is the only way in which the dangerous possibilities that were outlined by the police and fire officers could be averted. My committee colleagues and I felt so strongly about that matter that we would have found it <place-holder colnum=\"2984\"/> inconceivable for the bill to remain in its present form after stage 2.</p><p>I repeat: this is a good bill, with good motives. I was concerned that, as drafted, it could have unwittingly introduced inequalities in the provision of the emergency services. That would not have been the bill's intention, but the potential consequences would have been unacceptable. The minister is to be congratulated on his intention to lodge amendments to the bill at stage 2 to prevent those potential consequences.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258219", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Fire Services (Finance) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "One of the Parliament's strengths can be found in the fact that we are able to find time to introduce short bills that tidy up some of the issues that seem to interested parties to have been hanging about to be dealt with for a long time.

However, it is difficult to speak without repeating what was said earlier, or to generate sufficient interest among the public in what is being debated.

So I will participate in the debate without any belief that I am adding substantial enlightenment to the subject, and <place-holder colnum=\"868\"/> without believing that I can engender any more public interest than any previous or subsequent speaker. In fact, as an enthusiast for the wit of Oscar Wilde, I could say that I am following his advice, that the best possible form of exercise is to talk, not walk. I have only a few minutes and, although I need the exercise, I do not expect to lose much weight.</p><p>I find the Conservative amendment strange. Although I can understand Keith Harding's dissenting from the Local Government Committee's report on the bill&#8212;because he had not participated in the consultation debates&#8212;I cannot comprehend why, if he had read the final committee report and studied the information that had been discussed in committee during the consultation, he and the Conservatives would find it necessary to propose any opposition to the general principles of the bill.</p><p>In spite of what Bill Aitken said, I, like others, can only assume that that derives from an ideological hankering for a return to CCT. The evidence provided to the Local Government Committee made clear a strong desire on the part of all concerned to continue the development of the best-value regime. There was also substantial opposition to the re-implementation or continuation of CCT, even on the part of those representing the private sector.</p><p>Most representations conveyed the message that CCT had been remarkably unpopular in Scotland, and was opposed by local authorities and the private sector. The feeling was that continuous improvement was shunned in favour of emphasis on rigid contracts. Innovation was inhibited and the ability to respond to changing requirements constrained. The result was often poor standards, service inefficiency and constricted flexibility. That perpetuated cuts in wages and subsequent objectionable conditions of employment.</p><p>The evidence that we took highlighted the imposition of excessive central Government control, diminishing local accountability and neglecting the needs of service users in the local community. The CCT straitjacket, as it was known, limited the way in which local authorities could provide their services, reduced flexibility and jeopardised best practices.</p><p>Not everything about the bill is universally welcomed. Although I have encountered favourable responses to the bill's proposals, a number of concerns were voiced about the extension of the moratorium. It is clear that there is overwhelming support for the transition to a best-value regime, but it should be delivered as quickly as possible within a definitive time scale in order to assist in the development of partnership, avoiding competition between local authorities and private <place-holder colnum=\"869\"/> companies.</p><p>There can be no doubt that local authorities have expressed enthusiasm for fully embracing the best-value principles, but they remain concerned about the fact that they have been forced to maintain the provisions of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 and the Local Government Act 1988, because they form part of the moratorium regulations. As DLOs and DSOs are required to run both CCT regimes and the early days of a best-value regime in parallel, we must recognise the fact that those two types of regime are totally incompatible, and that that places a significant burden on service providers.</p><p>Modernising local government is essential to the progress of our communities. I am sure that the Executive is listening and responding to the voice of local government. On that point, I was pleased to hear Peter Peacock say to the Local Government Committee that the Executive firmly intended to publish its legislative proposals in the autumn. Therefore, there is all the more reason to question the motive behind Keith Harding's amendment. The Executive's proposals should be presented as soon as possible, but they should be progressed with a degree of caution. A new statutory framework is required to replace CCT, but I hope that the Executive will ensure that it is done right rather than quickly, so that we avoid problems in the future. I am sure that the Parliament will acknowledge that such an important change cannot be introduced overnight. Nevertheless, a majority of members of the committee and of the organisations that it met welcome and commend the general principles of the bill.

Plainly we must look towards an efficient integrated transport system that does not threaten our environment and that is <place-holder colnum=\"1397\"/> accessible and commercially feasible. Such a system must be geared towards not only local communities but wider society.</p><p>I am sure that we all value the importance of the future of railways in such a strategy, because if we are serious about encouraging people to use public transport and the railway network, we must provide a safe, reliable and effective service. A new link between the east and west of Scotland is crucial for the manufacturers, producers and consumers involved in Scotland's industrial diversity. As a result, I commend the work that the local authorities in North Lanarkshire and West Lothian are undertaking, as it highlights the benefits of reopening the Airdrie to Bathgate line and the commercial sense that that would make.</p><p>The present stalemate of congested and overburdened roads such as the M8 through Lanarkshire and beyond not only affects Karen Whitefield's Airdrie and Shotts constituency but leads to the disruption of business and means sluggish mobility for commuters from many areas in the central belt. As a result, we must aim to develop a modern, fast and efficient transport infrastructure instead of restricting it.</p><p>Furthermore, we must encourage the use of public transport to help reduce congestion in major corridors such as the M8 in my Hamilton North and Bellshill constituency. Not only is that area at a standstill for much of the day, it is also a location of dangerous traffic situations and accidents.</p><p>It has been suggested that congestion increases carbon dioxide emissions by 10 per cent on urban roads, which is obviously a matter of great concern to major towns and surrounding areas such as my constituency. As a result, any effort to reduce road traffic growth and congestion, especially in urban areas such as mine, can make an important contribution to the improvement of air quality and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>As colleagues will be aware, projects such as the reopening of this line have considerable benefits for labour market accessibility and potentially advantageous effects on employment levels and economic growth. A more effective transport infrastructure between the east and west of the country would benefit people who wish to find employment further afield or who need such a transport system for employment purposes.</p><p>We must show our commitment to a coherent transport strategy for our nation and to reducing the impact of traffic congestion on our roads and its harmful environmental effects while providing attractive affordable alternatives. The reopening of the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link would adhere to the Executive's commitment to a strategy founded on integrated transport and the multimodal ethos. It <place-holder colnum=\"1398\"/> would also expand on the existing user network and would help the local authorities, employers and enterprise networks to promote inclusion for the people of Airdrie, Bathgate, Lanarkshire, West Lothian and Scotland in general.</p><p>Although this debate has greatly helped to raise the transport problems in the constituencies of Karen Whitefield and Mary Mulligan, their campaign will help to alleviate problems in my area and many others. I wish the campaign well and fully support the initiative. I hope the minister will do so as well.</p>", "hdate": "2001-04-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13250202", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Railways (Airdrie to Bathgate Line)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Karen Whitefield on securing this debate.

Having visited a number of hospices, including Rachel House, I am aware of the high level of commitment and dedication among staff, and I take this opportunity to pass on my full support and thanks to them for that. The dedication of the carers, volunteers and fundraisers is remarkable and must have the Parliament's support.</p><p>As independent voluntary organisations with charitable status, hospices receive an average of 39 per cent of their running costs from the NHS. They are highly dependent on funding from their local communities and I commend all the fundraisers who give their time, effort and money for this important cause. I am aware of the high quality of service offered by the hospices and of the expertise that has been built up over the years by skilled multi-specialist professionals, carers and volunteers, who not only care for the sick, but attend to the social and psychological needs of the families who are affected by having individuals with illness.</p><p>The range of services that is offered by hospices is tremendous and includes not only terminal care and pain control but palliative respite care, combination therapies and post-acute and respite care for social, emotional, psychological and spiritual needs.</p><p>The hospice movement has come a long way, but much more still has to be done to meet the ever increasing complexity of palliative care needs. I join Mary Scanlon and other members in calling for the minister to provide details on the Executive's intentions to ensure that health boards meet their target for the provision of 50 per cent of the running costs of hospices. Will the Executive give a commitment to address the funding shortfall for Scotland's only children's hospice, at Rachel House?<place-holder colnum=\"1430\"/></p><p>In my discussion with the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care, I understand that it is the minister's intention for hospices to be regulated by the proposed Scottish commission for the regulation of care, the setting-up of which is of course welcomed by the hospices. At present, hospices are regulated in the same way as nursing homes. The hospices feel that that is totally inappropriate for the care and service that they provide. Can the minister confirm what the Executive's intentions are in this regard?</p><p>It is important that the terms of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill make it clear where hospices fit into the new regulatory system and that hospices' future regulation by the Scottish commission for the regulation of care be undertaken against standards that are developed specifically for hospice care. Ideally, that would be done by a commission team with particular knowledge and understanding of palliative care. Hospices should have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the standards against which they are to be regulated.</p><p>I understand that hospices, like other charities, currently enjoy relief from water charges. The Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture announced last Friday that that relief was to end. I ask the Executive to note that hospices provide their services free of charge and would find it difficult to pass on such costs to the patients and families for whom they are trying to provide. I request that the Executive reconsider that recent measure.</p><p>I again congratulate Trish Godman on securing the debate, which has allowed me to raise those points, which the hospice movement hopes will meet with a positive response from the minister.</p>", "hdate": "2001-02-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13246229", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hospices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Trish Godman on prompting today's debate.

The strategy is a huge step forward, but its implementation will undoubtedly encounter problems.

In attempting to ensure that extensive consultation takes place and to ensure maximum effectiveness, our first principle must be to get the scheme right, rather than to <place-holder colnum=\"1313\"/> introduce it quickly. Therefore, I am pleased that the Executive is attempting to obtain appropriate and independent evidence before jumping feet first into such an important and consequential decision and that, in the meantime, it has set out guidelines to provide stability and predictability for businesses in the future.</p><p>The SNP outlined its key policies in its manifesto, which included</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a package of measures to promote small businesses\"</p><p>and an input of &#163;90 million to address the burden of business rates on small firms.

There is no disagreement on that.

It has also been suggested that the relief proposals would interact with other relief schemes, such as the relief scheme for village shops.</p><p>After careful deliberation, the Local Government Committee came to a number of conclusions. First, it is essential that the relief scheme should avoid small changes in rateable values that produce large increases in rates bills. Also, an objective should be to reduce the incentive for businesses to appeal against their rateable value simply because they hope to obtain benefits from the relief scheme, while encouraging them to grow without the risk of step increases in their bills. That points to the need for a tapered multi-banded scheme. The scheme should also be self-financing, possibly through an increase in the Scottish poundage system, so that only genuinely small businesses would benefit from the scheme. Those points should be considered while considering regional variations.</p><p>The committee recommended that the issue of a relief scheme be kept under review. I say to Kenny Gibson that that is the point that I was trying to make. The Local Government Committee would welcome further suggestions on the Executive's thinking on the matter.

It was only when a family member faced suffering from cancer that I took an interest. My activity grew from there. I was pleased, shortly after being elected last May, to be introduced to Margaret Stevenson, director of the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care, who discussed with me the possibility of establishing a cross-party group to raise palliative care's profile in Parliament.</p><p>It is vital that we do that. A society, it is argued, can be judged on the way in which it cares for the dying as well as the way in which it cares for the living. The chamber has echoed with many important debates on health care in the past year and no doubt will continue to do so, but I am pleased that we have the opportunity to examine today our record on palliative care.</p><p>Sufferers from many illnesses require palliative care, but I want to consider one predominant illness to highlight the need for such care. We recognise that the incidence of cancer in Scotland is rising despite advances in treatment. The majority of people who have cancer will not be <place-holder colnum=\"629\"/> cured. As the Imperial Cancer Research Fund recently publicised, one in three people in Scotland will develop cancer in their lifetime and 60 to 70 per cent of them will require palliative care. Sadly, one in four will die from the disease. In 1999, 14,688 Scots died from cancer.</p><p>Palliative care aims to control pain and other distressing symptoms, to help patients and families with emotional upset and the practical problems that they face and to help people deal with the spiritual questions that might arise from their illness. It also seeks to help people to live as actively as possible despite their illness and to support families and friends following the loss of a loved one.</p><p>We know that people who have cancer report in the last year of life a high incidence of problems including physical symptoms&#8212;such as pain and breathlessness&#8212;and psychological symptoms, such as depression. Unfortunately, studies show that such symptoms are often not well managed and, as a result, people suffer unnecessarily in the advanced stages of their illness. Knowledge of how to manage the symptoms effectively exists&#8212;it has been developed by health professionals who specialise in palliative care, but it is not yet universal practice.</p><p>Most of us would prefer to pass on at home among family members. However, the latest figures show that in 1999, only a quarter of people who died with cancer did so at home. Scotland needs effective palliative care provision to enable more people to die in their place of choice and to be as comfortable as possible in their last days.</p><p>As we know, palliative care in Scotland is provided mainly by voluntary services, with a small number of national health service hospices also supporting that vital work. Of the 15 hospices in Scotland, 13 care mainly for adult cancer patients. There is one specialist AIDS hospice&#8212;Milestone House, the work of which David McLetchie highlighted recently&#8212;and one children's hospice, Rachel House, which is an exceptional national resource that is based in Kinross. Such hospices provide specialist palliative care through in-patient support and day and home care services. They are increasingly integrated with the national health service and provide outreach facilities to hospitals and primary care teams.</p><p>Specialist palliative care nurses in hospitals, Macmillan and Marie Curie nurses, general practitioners and district nurses also provide palliative care as part of their normal duties. It is important to acknowledge the significant and vital work of the many thousands of health professionals throughout Scotland who provide support to those in need and their families during difficult times. However, although I recognise the commitment of the Executive and local health <place-holder colnum=\"630\"/> boards&#8212;including Lanarkshire Health Board&#8212;we must seek constantly to examine how provision can be improved.</p><p>The top priority is to make sure that health boards and NHS trusts ensure that palliative care is available to all those in need, including those who have conditions other than cancer. Let us remember that more palliative care does not always mean more hospices&#8212;it can mean better support from the NHS for existing hospices and a greater spread of palliative care principles and practice in other care settings. The Executive must seek to increase the level of palliative care knowledge and awareness among all health professionals who care for people with progressive, life-threatening conditions, whether in hospital, at home or in nursing or residential care.</p><p>The Executive must also continue to examine funding arrangements to support the work of voluntary hospices. Health boards have been asked by the Executive to fund about 50 per cent of the agreed costs of adult voluntary sector hospices, so it is a matter for regret that the average contribution last year was 40 per cent. The contribution for some hospices, however, was as low as 31 per cent.</p><p>There must also be greater co-ordination between health boards and voluntary sector bodies such as Macmillan Cancer Relief and Marie Curie Cancer Care, so that expertise is shared in developing local strategies for palliative care.</p><p>Moreover, the Executive must examine the level of palliative care support in hospitals. I note that it is not yet commonplace for hospitals to have fully staffed specialist palliative care teams, despite the very welcome increase in staffing levels in recent years. Increased services to enable people to be cared for at home, if they wish to remain there, should be a goal of the Executive and Parliament. Speedy provision of equipment, 24-hour community nursing services, access to specialist palliative care services and respite and support for carers and families must be achieved.</p><p>Palliative care is a vital support, which should be open to every Scot who suffers from an incurable progressive illness. Although we recognise the significant advances in recent years in both cancer care treatment and palliative care provision, as my motion states, it is important that palliative care remains a priority for the Executive and that further development of palliative care is undertaken. My colleagues in the cross-party group and I will pursue the issue. I look forward to the rest of the debate and the minister's response.</p>", "hdate": "2000-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13235626", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to start this all too short debate by taking time to thank members from all sides of the chamber for supporting the motion in my name, which was lodged some months ago when the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on palliative care was established.

Although David and I disagree on many of the great issues of the day, issues such as the one under debate today rightly cut across party divides.</p><p>I also want to thank David McLetchie for his recent letter to me on this issue, which contained a briefing from David Johnston of Waverley Care Trust. That briefing was very useful indeed, and I am pleased to say that I will have a chance to discuss with staff the issues outlined in the document when I visit Milestone House on Wednesday morning.</p><p>As convener of the newly formed cross-party group on palliative care, I want to add to David McLetchie's comments by stressing the importance of hospices to such care. We recognise that palliative care aims to maintain as far as possible and improve quality of life for patients and their families. We also recognise that palliative care is not only for people who suffer from cancer, but for people with advanced heart failure, motor neurone disease and AIDS.</p><p>Like many others involved in the cross-party group, I know from experience the importance of hospices to people in their care, their families and their friends. Having visited a number of hospices such as St Andrew's Hospice in Karen Whitefield's constituency of Airdrie and Shotts and familiarised myself with the impressive Maggie's Centre in Edinburgh, I know the high level of commitment and dedication of the staff involved and wish to pass on my full support and thanks to them on <place-holder colnum=\"697\"/> behalf of all members in the chamber.</p><p>It is with that in mind that I have no hesitation in supporting David McLetchie's motion on Milestone House. Through talking to others with connections to the hospice, I am well aware of the valuable work carried out there, offering care and hospital support services to people with HIV and AIDS, affected carers and children.</p><p>I am also aware of the high quality of service offered by the hospice and of the expertise that has been built up there over the years. Indeed, on browsing the internet&#8212;something that politicians are all encouraged to do&#8212;I came across the Waverley Care Trust website. As its web address is quite long, instead of reading it out, I will pass it on later to any member who wants it. I was pleased to see that it had a 1999 profile.</p><p>In discussing the matter today, we must recognise that the needs of people with HIV and AIDS have changed since Milestone House was first opened, with fewer people needing terminal care for AIDS, principally due to the success of combination therapies. We must not forget, however, that there is more to Milestone House than terminal care. Palliative respite care, combination therapies, post-acute care and respite care for social, emotional, psychological and spiritual problems are also provided.</p><p>While the Parliament must recognise that it is appropriate that health decisions be taken at a local level, we must recognise that 20 per cent of Milestone's registered users are from outwith Lothian and that the wait for a decision since 1997 has not been good for the hospice, the staff, the service users and their families and friends. It would be inappropriate for this Parliament to dictate to those involved in the review. That said, however, I am sure that I speak for all members in calling for a speedy conclusion to the review while ensuring that full consultation with those involved with the hospice takes place.</p><p>It is important to maintain the critical mass of specialist multi-professional expertise that has built up at Milestone House. I urge Lothian Health, City of Edinburgh Council and Waverley Care Trust to work together to meet the changing needs of those diagnosed with HIV and AIDS and to fulfil the ambitions behind David McLetchie's motion.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13231762", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Milestone House Hospice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David McLetchie on securing today's debate and Margo MacDonald on bringing the matter to the Parliament's attention.

I note that a football <place-holder colnum=\"387\"/> partnership has been established to take forward proposals for football academies, which will be in place over the next three years.</p><p>As a member with two social inclusion partnerships operating in my constituency, I am glad that the key role of SIPS in developing the link between sport and social inclusion has been highlighted by the minister.</p><p>While discussing the role of sport in social inclusion, I would like to raise the issue of the Scottish Football League's recent decision to fine Hamilton Academical football club 15 points for failing to fulfil a fixture in April of this year.</p><p>I recently had the pleasure of meeting Ally Dawson, the club's manager. I was heartened to hear his plans for taking the players around south Lanarkshire schools and public parks for training sessions in an effort to encourage young people to become active in sport and to raise the profile of the club, which has been away from the town for six years. He did not pontificate about social inclusion or theorise about the importance of sport for education, but he could see the practical support that he, the players and the club could give to the local community from the privileged position that they have.</p><p>As members may be aware, the decision by the SFL, which was described as \"savage\" by one football commentator, Brian Scott, will relegate the Accies to division 3 for next season. It penalises the players, the fans and the town. Equally important, it threatens the future finances of the club when, today, it has just been announced that it has been given the go-ahead for the planned new stadium project to return to the town.</p><p>The decision is about more than the Accies club. The decision by the SFL directly threatens the livelihood of players, who were forced to take industrial action against their employer because payment of their salaries had been delayed, not for the first time, because of the club's already precarious financial situation. Those are the same players who are willing to take part in community outreach projects, which are so valuable to the Executive's sports strategy.</p><p>Regardless of the internal politics of Hamilton Accies, the league's decision will force the club, which is already hard up, to make further savings from the pay bill. The livelihoods of the club's support staff as well as its players will be threatened by the ruling&#8212;not much social inclusion there. I think that it is the league's responsibility to assist its member clubs to get away from the breadline rather than to put them on it or, as in the case of Hamilton Accies, to take the bread from their mouths.</p><p>An appeal on the decision will be taken tomorrow. I hope that the Executive and the <place-holder colnum=\"388\"/> Parliament will send the message to the Scottish Football League that it must reconsider the punishment, take into account the club's circumstances on the day on which it did not play Stenhousemuir, and not make its situation worse.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13227130", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am disappointed that someone could be annoyed that \u00a3700,000 is being spent.

This Parliament has made excellent progress in ensuring that high standards in public life are at the core of its work. We have a strict code of conduct for MSPs, an open register of interests and a powerful Standards Committee. I am pleased that we are considering the extension of those same high standards to our staff, who support us in our work.</p><p>However, our job as parliamentarians is not only to ensure the highest standards in this chamber. We must distil public confidence in all areas of public life, from our local authorities to health boards, local enterprise companies and beyond.</p><p>I am pleased at the introduction of the bill and at the establishment of a fully independent standards commission for Scotland, headed by a chief investigating officer. I am pleased at the introduction of a national code of conduct for local authorities and a statutory code for other public bodies, and at the provision under which local authorities and public bodies are to establish and maintain a register of members' interests, which will be open to public inspection.</p><p>We recognise that there are genuine concerns that the current ethical framework does not allow for open and transparent investigation of allegations of misconduct. The measures included in the bill will go some significant way towards tackling the lack of trust in and cynicism about politicians and public officials that is felt by many of our people.</p><p>It is important that, in introducing this bill, we take with us the good will of local councillors and other public figures. The bill must not be seen as an attack on local government; rather, it should be seen as an enhancement to it. Local government is central to the good governance of Scotland, and the bill will assist local government in the process of modernisation, thereby enhancing public confidence in its operations. The bill will provide a consistent framework of standards, which will allow for the protection as well as the investigation of public representatives. That move will be welcomed by many of the decent, hard-working councillors with whom I work day in day out, particularly those from South Lanarkshire Council and North Lanarkshire Council, which are in my constituency.</p><p>The bill will also help to ensure high standards in other areas of public life, as a new, statutory code of conduct will be introduced and adapted to suit the circumstances of each body. As a member of the Local Government Committee, I was pleased when Frank McAveety, the Deputy Minister for <place-holder colnum=\"113\"/> Local Government, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Councillors are elected and members of public bodies are appointed; but both serve the public. It is right that they should be seen to be governed by the same standards.\"</p><p>The Local Government Committee welcomes the general principles of the bill. We are pleased that, in light of responses to the consultation process, the Executive has made several changes to the draft bill, including the extension of the powers of the standards commission to cover members of relevant public bodies as well as councillors. We are also pleased that the commission will have the power to impose sanctions on those individuals who are found to have breached the code.</p><p>However, I join the committee in expressing reservations that a number of advisory bodies, such as local enterprise companies, further education colleges, housing associations and tourist boards, will be excluded from the proposals. As we know, individuals in those organisations are responsible for the management of considerable public funds and, like councillors, make policy decisions. The public must have confidence in the integrity of those officials.</p><p>I noted with interest the minister's comment that the operational framework of some LECs, boards of further education colleges and the like is autonomous from the Executive, but I would welcome Executive amendments to the bill to make appropriate arrangements for appointments to such bodies. It must also be noted that the three public bodies appointed by the Crown&#8212;the Mental Health Commission, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission&#8212;are excluded from the bill's provisions. In the spirit of accountability for all public bodies, it is important that representations are made to the Crown to allow those organisations to be brought within the remit of the bill, by whatever arrangements can be found.</p><p>Public confidence in standards in public life is an important issue and one that is central to public bodies, local authorities and this Parliament.

Although we recognise the wealth of talent and experience already employed in those organisations, we must deliver a system of public appointments that reflects the diversity of Scottish society. I welcome the Executive's agenda on that matter.</p><p>The Parliament welcomed the establishment of the Equal Opportunities Committee as a sign of our commitment to equality in Scotland. I am pleased that the Executive is expanding the values on which the committee was founded by promoting and enshrining those values in our public bodies to make them truly representative of the public.</p><p>Without disparaging any individual or group of professionals, I often wonder whether my area of Lanarkshire is mainly populated by middle-class professionals. Even a cursory look at the background of the people who serve on public bodies would indicate that the personnel are drawn from too narrow a section of society. Where are the women, the ethnic minorities, the disabled and the ordinary working people? At the moment, those groups are under-represented, if they are represented at all. That issue must be addressed, which is why the Executive's initiative is so welcome.</p><p>The issue is not only about proportionality or social exclusion, or about whether 75 per cent of appointees are of one gender or another; it is about fiscal competence. As such bodies account for approximately &#163;6.5 billion of public money, there is a good case for a scrutinising role for the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p><p>Having the right people to make the correct decisions about such large sums, along with other prerequisites, will lead to potentially greater fiscal competence, by better matching needs to available resources.</p><p>It is my earnest hope that through the introduction of those initiatives, the profile of public service will be raised in the eyes of the general public, which in itself could encourage more people than ever before to consider offering their talents for the country's benefit.</p><p>I believe that the Executive is determined to fulfil its commitment to the equality agenda and that we will continue to strive for greater diversity of <place-holder colnum=\"1251\"/> representation on public bodies.

The term \"listening government\" may be scoffed at by cynics and opponents, but I am grateful for that example of what a listening Executive can bring to this chamber and to the legislation that we will develop on behalf of the people of Scotland.</p><p>I believe that it is the wish of the majority of MSPs to include in the census additional questions on religion and ethnic group, which I am <place-holder colnum=\"1104\"/> pleased have been accepted. Today, given the time constraints, it is not possible to make detailed, individual arguments for all the additional questions that were, I believe, dealt with adequately by the Equal Opportunities Committee during its recent meeting with the Deputy First Minister.</p><p>It is clear to me and, indeed, a large number of leading academics, that information gained from the questions on religion and ethnic background could provide the basis for accurate research into religious bigotry and racism in Scottish society. On the labour market, for example, the public could be reassured that we are indeed a tolerant society, depending on the census findings. However, if it is shown that discrimination does exist, policies can be targeted specifically at the areas identified.</p><p>I make no apologies for asking that those questions be included in the draft order, as I believe that we must confront the truth, whether good or bad, and provide each of our citizens with confidence, in the knowledge that we will tackle the difficult issues, that we care and that we listen to them.</p><p>I welcome the decision of the minister and the Executive. More particularly, I welcome the creation of a more dynamic census, in which the information gathered will be of greater benefit than ever before. I remain committed to having all the additional questions that we have heard discussed today included in the census at some point in the future, although I am pragmatic enough to recognise that the concessions that the Executive has made represent real progress for all concerned.

The offering of drugs to children is not acceptable in any decent society.</p><p>We know that drugs misuse does not stand alone, but is often linked with problem drinking. Other reports have shown that 83 per cent of respondents in Lanarkshire use drugs and alcohol simultaneously.

We know all too well that the battle against drugs is about more than statistics. Unfortunately, behind every statistic there is a person, who also has family and friends.

As a member of the Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee, I welcome the Executive's commitment to create a fair and just society in which all individuals, whatever their background, have equal rights and opportunities. Those values, which I know are shared throughout the chamber, are primarily Labour values and will take us and our country into the new century.</p><p>I want to draw members' attention to inclusion in education. Many young people with difficulties have a restricted choice of educational establishment. They are often deemed not suitable for mainstream education and are placed in more <place-holder colnum=\"1222\"/> specialist settings instead. The culture of diverting so many young people to specialist educational establishments is not consistent with the Executive's strategy of inclusion. In many areas of Scotland, there is the presumption that special schools are better&#8212;but better for whom? Surely not for the children.</p><p>Segregated education brands children with disabilities as second class and is not an equal, but a different, education. Although children can be offered specialist support, they are denied the opportunity to grow with their able-bodied peers. That proves a missed opportunity to educate children in mainstream schools, who must also be given the opportunity to learn with those with disabilities and, by doing so, learn to see the ability in those people.</p><p>Mainstream inclusive education must be the way forward for children with disabilities. Such children must not be branded as different; they are different only in that they have a disability. If a child needs an auxiliary, a speech therapist or specialist equipment, that should be provided for the child in a mainstream setting. I know from experience the difference that such help can make to young people. Instead of excluding them and tearing them from their friends and communities, the Executive should ensure that resources are available to provide our children with choice.</p><p>Let me make myself clear. I am talking not about dumping special needs children in mainstream schools without support, but about supporting their needs in schools within communities by transferring resources from specialist units to those schools.</p><p>I urge the Executive to take positive steps to transfer resources from the costly two-tier system to equip professional teachers with the skills to support our future generations. Rather than perpetuate prejudice&#8212;as the Equity Group says&#8212;we must move to a system such as Sweden's which is the opposite of the current system in Scotland. In Sweden, special needs children are automatically supported in mainstream schools and placing children in specialist learning centres is the exception rather than the rule. That should be the way forward for our country.</p><p>I do not advocate the abolition of specialist centres&#8212;they do valuable work&#8212;but we must give parents a clear choice, which they do not often have at present. We must provide Scottish parents and children with information to make such choices, which is why I welcome the work of Enquire, the information service run by Children in Scotland. We must transfer the resources allocated to specialist centres to enable integration to occur.</p><p>I believe passionately in equality of opportunity; I <place-holder colnum=\"1223\"/> have supported it all my life. I recognise the commitment of ministers&#8212;Jackie Baillie and Wendy Alexander&#8212;in the Scottish Executive and the commitment that exists throughout the chamber, regardless of party, to equality of opportunity. I hope, therefore, that the Parliament will support the Executive today.</p><p>The framework for an equality strategy is rooted in the traditions of tolerance and understanding, which is welcome. I urge the Executive to move forward in partnership with all interested parties, including the Equity Group, which campaign for real inclusion and equality in our education system.

Scotland's manufacturing base has declined from employing 611,000 in 1978 to employing 303,000 today. The sector now accounts for only a sixth of all jobs in Scotland.</p><p>Manufacturing jobs are still essential to the success of our diverse international economy, however. In many areas, manufacturing is still the base for economic activity. Indeed, it is linked with many other sectors.</p><p>The growth of service sector jobs in particular is most welcome and its importance cannot be underestimated. Scottish Enterprise statistics show that 60 per cent of all service sector jobs in Scotland depend on manufacturing. As the sector's main market remains the rest of the UK, I am determined to ensure that those jobs will not be put at risk by the isolationist policies pursued by the Scottish National party. However, I recognise that the downward trend experienced by <place-holder colnum=\"836\"/> the manufacturing industry is worrying. That is why I am in favour of a comprehensive strategy to support manufacturing industry.</p><p>In my native Lanarkshire, 38 per cent of all industrial output is manufacturing based, with engineering accounting for 23 per cent of that figure. We have seen the arrival of a large number of electronics firms, such as Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Orange and Cellnet. However, it is predicted that manufacturing growth will weaken as growth in the electronics sector slows&#8212;we need look no further than the example of Lite-On to illustrate that point.</p><p>Service sector growth is anticipated to be headed by a growth in hotels and the catering and distribution sectors, which are expected to experience high growth in the Lanarkshire economy in the next few years. We can also expect growth in the transport and communications sector, with the proliferation of call centres bringing firms such as Kwik-Fit Insurance Services and Cable and Wireless Communications to Lanarkshire. Sixty per cent of all production in the North Lanarkshire economy is non-manufacturing based. Employment overall is expected to rise on the back of non-manufacturing jobs, while manufacturing employment is expected to decline. That is not only my view; it is the view of Lanarkshire Development Agency, as expressed in a constituency audit for Hamilton North and Bellshill earlier this year.</p><p>With that in mind, I urge the Scottish Executive to advance manufacturing strategy in two ways. First, it should seek to defend and expand the existing manufacturing base. Secondly, it should continue to promote the growth of new industries. It is important that incentives are available to our existing manufacturing industries to encourage them to invest in new technologies and new methods of production. Our industries must be able to accommodate the challenges ahead in what are ever-changing markets.</p><p>I envisage that the new industries of the future will result from organic growth. It is essential that erstwhile entrepreneurs are not stifled at the idea stage because of a lack of funds or good advice. I commend Lanarkshire Development Agency for its work in that area but I encourage additional focus on it. Allied to the creation of an investment bank to provide funds for new&#8212;primarily manufacturing-based&#8212;business projects, that will provide a strong platform for growth and replacements for industries that are in natural decline.</p><p>The extension of enterprise zone status or its equivalent for manufacturing industries could go a long way to easing Lanarkshire's fears about 2003, when enterprise zone status is phased out. The world's strongest and most durable economies are those with a good history of <place-holder colnum=\"837\"/> sustained growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The best guarantee for improving employment prospects in Lanarkshire&#8212;and in Scotland&#8212;is to strengthen our manufacturing base. If that can be achieved at a time when industrial growth is expected, I would have great confidence in the enduring stability of the Scottish economy.</p>", "hdate": "1999-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13211702", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Manufacturing and Industrial Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member who represents a constituency whose electorate has seen dramatic changes in the industrial landscape over the past few decades&#8212;and as a former welder&#8212;I am all too aware of the impact of those changes on the individual, the families and the communities that I serve.

A transport bill; improvements in education; national parks, which will create jobs; land reform to deal with feudalism; affordable housing, which is a priority for the creation of stable communities; improvements in the health service; the Government's approach to working with local authorities, public agencies and the private and voluntary sectors-those things are a start. </p><p>It is only right that the first aim of this Parliament is the creation of prosperity for this country. However, if we do not work to ensure that nobody is in any way excluded from access to that prosperity, we will undoubtedly fail the people. We should accept that we will not achieve change <place-holder colnum=\"439\"/> overnight, but we can at least lay down the foundations of the means by which everyone can feel included, regardless of which community they come from. This legislative programme can be the foundation of what we can achieve in the long term as well as delivering much immediately. </p><p>The causes of social exclusion are many: poverty and deprivation; unemployment; low incomes; poor housing; broken homes; and bad health-the list is, unfortunately, too long. My main concern is with social exclusion as a result of discrimination. In particular, I want the practices of institutions and individuals that prevent disabled people and people from ethnic minorities from playing their full part in society to be eradicated. That will not be easy; it involves changing society's attitude to the way in which we treat each other as citizens. </p><p>We must make everyone realise that we have a duty to be tolerant and respectful of one another's differences. Intolerance is rife in Scotland. We have to challenge that, and I am confident that in its proposals the Executive has given the Parliament enough scope to allow us to make a good start in tackling the problem. It is the responsibility of each of us in the chamber to monitor the progress that is made towards social inclusion. We have to identify and implement effective anti-discrimination strategies in all areas of legislation, where appropriate. Disabled people and ethnic minorities in Scotland deserve no less. </p><p>I will give an illustration of the difficult task that we face. On Sunday night, I was at a gathering of a group within the Asian community. The guest speaker was Mr Salmond and I hope that he will concur with what I am about to say. While social exclusion is often seen as a euphemism for poverty, the number of Mercedes-Benz, BMWs and Daimlers in the hotel's car park gave no outward sign that this was a gathering of the socially excluded, if poverty were to be used as the criterion. However, as one speaker after another talked of their fears and concerns about their community in the wake of a series of racially motivated attacks, especially in the west of Scotland and including the death of Imran Khan, the sense of exclusion felt by the Asians in the room became tangible to the rest of us. </p><p>Regardless of their financial status, the members of the Asian community who were present on Sunday night clearly believed themselves to be shut out from the rest of society. Parliament must focus on the needs of vulnerable groups that feel ostracised. We must always promote social inclusion and work to prevent social exclusion from happening in the first place. I am confident that this legislative programme will allow us to do that.</p>", "hdate": "1999-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13207537", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although SNP members are keen on debating skills, their listening skills are obviously not as good.
