I remember the witnesses&#8217; harrowing accounts of the agonising procedures, often performed without anaesthetic and using dirty, makeshift and shared instruments, that are endured by the victims of FGM. As Kenneth Gibson said, those girls and young women can suffer from serious immediate health consequences, such as severe shock, pain and bleeding, which may be fatal, and they often get urine retention and localised infection. Long-term obstetric and gynaecological problems, urinary tract infections and incontinence can cause severe suffering, and the psychological consequences of FGM can ruin the lives of many victims.</p><p>Sadly, FGM is a deep-seated cultural practice in several African countries and in the middle east and Asia. Its increasing appearance in the western world is usually in immigrant and refugee populations. In that respect, as we have heard, 3,000 women and girls are at risk in Scotland today, and that number is likely to rise.</p><p>FGM is not a requirement of any religion but rather is seen as a rite of passage to womanhood and a requirement for marriageability. Hard though it is for us to believe, it is often done at the hands of the older women in a community who have themselves undergone FGM. To them, it is a necessary ritual; an act of love to ensure the best future for their daughters and granddaughters. It is difficult to run it to ground, because the practice is kept very private within communities and, because relatives are often involved, statistics are hard to come by.</p><p>As I said in 2005 at stage 3 of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill, it will probably take generations to eradicate the practice and it will require education reinforced by law to overcome such an entrenched custom. I felt at the time that, although the new law was unlikely to lead to many prosecutions, it should serve to raise awareness within the communities affected and that, if coupled with education within those communities and the work of health, education and social work professionals, it would become more widely recognised.</p><p>To hear that nine years later we are no further on is really quite depressing, so I am pleased to learn that the Scottish Government is now committed, with the Scottish Refugee Council, to trying to assess the actual scale of FGM across Scotland. The violation of a significant, if small, section of our society should not be tolerated. Urgent action needs to be taken to protect those vulnerable people from the barbaric customs, endemic in their communities, that are a serious abuse of their human rights. Indeed, FGM should not be tolerated anywhere in the world in the 21st century and its eradication must be tackled on an international scale.</p><p>A country like Scotland must not simply pay lip service to the international day of zero tolerance for FGM. We must make serious efforts to find the perpetrators of this brutal practice and to enforce the 2005 act so that the relatively small number of very vulnerable people in some of Scotland&#8217;s ethnic communities who are at risk of female genital mutilation can receive the legal protection that they deserve as our fellow citizens.</p><p>I thank Jenny Marra for alerting us to the lack of progress to date on eliminating this awful practice and for her sustained efforts to help its victims and those who are currently at risk of being made to endure the severe personal traumas of FGM.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882339", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Female Genital Mutilation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, commend Jenny Marra for securing this debate to mark the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation.

I am sorry that I was unable to get to the meeting in Australia, but I am delighted that the declaration secured support from parliamentarians from a wide and diverse range of nations.</p><p>I also congratulate my good friend Sir Michael Hirst&#8212;Micky, to those who know him well&#8212;on his efforts to tackle the growing scourge of diabetes through his work with Diabetes UK over many years, and with the International Diabetes Federation, of which he is current president. Micky has taken a very active part in efforts to secure early diagnosis of diabetes and to ensure that those who have it receive effective glycaemic control in order to avoid the awful complications that can result from the condition, if blood sugar is not kept within the normal stable range. He has also been actively involved in studies of the emotional and psychological problems that are associated with type 1 diabetes&#8212;in particular, during the transitional adolescent years between childhood and adulthood, which is a time when it is all too easy to let the condition get out of control.</p><p>I will digress a little. I am very pleased that the Health and Sport Committee has taken on board my concerns about transitional care for not just diabetes, but several other long-term conditions, and that it is, in a few weeks, having a round-table discussion with experts to find out how the transitional years are being dealt with and to discuss how the situation could be improved for the young patients involved.</p><p>As we know, diabetes of both types, but especially type 2, is on the increase around the globe. In Scotland, the number of people with diabetes is growing at an annual rate of 4 per cent to 5 per cent, which means that if trends continue there will by 2030 be 350,000 people in Scotland with the condition. Just think of the effect that that&#8212;never mind the other pressures that will result from the increasing ageing population&#8212;will have on the NHS. We know that more than 600,000 people in Scotland are at risk of developing diabetes, so it is crucial that we have an action plan that aims to reduce its prevalence&#8212;in particular of type 2, for which the increase is explosive.</p><p>Closely aligned with the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes is the increasing obesity of our population, with 64.3 per cent of adults in 2012 being classed as overweight and getting on for half of them being classed as obese. In 2012, 16.8 per cent of children were overweight and 13.8 per cent were at risk of being obese. All credit is due to those who are behind the Melbourne declaration, and who want to see more preventative work, with early diagnosis and access to adequate care, treatment and medicines for all those who are living with the condition.</p><p>We are a bit ahead of the game in Scotland compared with some other countries, thanks to the strategic approach that has been taken by successive Governments&#8212;from the publication of the first &#8220;Scottish Diabetes Framework&#8221; in 2002 to the &#8220;Diabetes Action Plan 2010&#8221;&#8212;although there are disparities across the country. Clearly, more needs to be done to bring down the rate of increase of diabetes by an effectively targeted screening programme for diabetes and support activities that raise awareness of the condition. Malcolm Chisholm mentioned the Diabetes UK road shows as a case in point.</p><p>Our successes so far lie in the greater availability of insulin pumps, particularly for the under-18s&#8212;that was fought for very hard by the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on diabetes&#8212;which can achieve better glycaemic control in the people for whom they are suitable; in better staffing levels of specialists in diabetes, both nursing and consultant; and in the national retinopathy screening campaign, which is highly rated. However, the diabetes action plan needs to be updated and to build on the improvements of the past 12 years. I understand that we may&#8212;the minister will tell me whether I am right&#8212;hear more of that fairly soon, which will be welcome.</p><p>The Melbourne declaration gives us the ideal opportunity to reinforce our commitment to improving diabetes diagnosis and care, and to support the global parliamentary alliance that is now in place and focused on dealing with what has been described as a modern pandemic.

However, for far too long people have shied away from discussing suicide. It has been seen as something not to be talked about because of a sense of awkwardness or difficulty in accepting how an individual&#8217;s life has ended.</p><p>It is also probably right to say that the situation was even starker in previous years, when families in particular felt acute embarrassment, indeed shame, if a family member took their own life. No support networks, such as that of the excellent Cruse Bereavement Care Scotland, were in place to help families to cope with their loss, and the stigma of suicide was prevalent in society. Even a survivor of suicide&#8212;someone whose attempt had failed&#8212;was not given the necessary help that is available today.</p><p>In July 1958, Lionel Henry Churchill from Cheltenham was found in bed with a bullet wound in his forehead, having tried to take his life following the death from natural causes of his beloved wife. He lived, but instead of the medical treatment and care that he needed, he was sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment. It is remarkable to consider that, until just over 50 years ago, suicide, or &#8220;self-murder&#8221; as it was called, was a criminal act in Britain.</p><p>Thankfully, we have moved on from those times but we still have a long way to go. That is why I very much welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s suicide prevention strategy. As we have heard, the strategy was developed after many discussions with a large number of stakeholders. It was launched last month and puts in place measures for the next three years, focusing on five areas of importance.</p><p>I return to my opening remarks and stress the value of talking about suicide, not only to deal with the after-effects of the death of a loved one but as a first step to stop someone seeing suicide as the only option. I am encouraged to see that, in a prominent suicide spot in the centre of my city, Aberdeen, a phone number for the Samaritans is available so that anyone contemplating the act can speak to someone about their intention before it is too late.</p><p>The theme of discussion is at the core of the strategy and I believe that it is central to breaking the taboo of suicide. By discussing suicide in a responsible manner, we can save lives. I pay tribute to NHS Scotland and its choose life action plan for developing the &#8220;Suicide. Don&#8217;t hide it. Talk about it&#8221; campaign some years ago. The campaign directed people to listening charities such as the Samaritans, and to breathing space, which is now in its 10th year as a national phoneline service. Next week marks breathing space day 2014, whose message is &#8220;Stay connected&#8221;. I was interested to learn that the campaign is aimed not only at those who are vulnerable or at risk of suicide but at everyone, by asking us to keep in touch with friends or family by picking up the phone or, for those more adept at it, sending a text message. I encourage everyone to take that advice by taking time out on 1 February to talk to a loved one.</p><p>The strategy highlights the benefit of communication through social media and the wider internet in promoting the key message of suicide prevention. However, it also refers to the possible negative impact of such media, especially on those who are most susceptible to and likely to have suicidal tendencies. In that respect, I am sure that I speak for many who have concerns about web-based chat rooms and webcams, Facebook, Twitter and all the other online outlets that are available, particularly to teenagers and young adults, who use them the most.</p><p>The relatively new problem of cyberbullying can have tragic and devastating consequences. Figures obtained under freedom of information legislation by my colleague Ruth Davidson just before Christmas showed that in the past three years more than 500 pupils throughout Scotland had been victims of cyberbullying; the actual figure may be higher. Anonymous comments, threats, lies and hurtful insults online can lead to low self-esteem and, very sadly, in extreme cases, to suicide. We will all be aware of the tragic case last summer of the Fife teenager who took his own life after internet bullying and blackmail. I wonder what measures could be put in place to ensure that a terrible event like that does not happen again. Although I accept that the strategy cannot cover all areas, I ask the minister whether he can provide more detail about how he thinks the strategy&#8217;s preventative approach to suicide fits in with tackling the specific problem of cyberbullying.</p><p>Elsewhere in the strategy document, theme D looks at how we can develop an evidence base to give the NHS and all the other agencies a better understanding of why certain people are inclined towards suicide. I very much welcome that approach, as preventing and thereby reducing incidents of suicide requires on-going analysis, research and the evaluation of information from ScotSID and the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide. I particularly welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to examine the effectiveness of treatment for patients who experience mental distress and to investigate further the effects of drug and alcohol abuse as potential precursors of susceptibility to suicide.</p><p>The document draws attention to the fact that in Scotland almost three quarters of suicides were men, of whom 48 per cent were in the age range 35 to 54. For theme D to succeed, analysis needs to be undertaken that identifies other areas that have a causal link to suicide in addition to depression and mental ill health issues as factors. Financial or job worries, relationship breakdown, stress, bereavement and so on can all contribute to suicidal feelings in men in that age range. I would like to see more focused scrutiny of specific groups in which there is a preponderance of suicide.</p><p>To give just one example, the minister will be aware that in the past 30 years there has been a higher than average rate of suicide in male farmers and farm workers in Scotland, with 86 deaths between 1981 and 1999, in comparison with 60 in fishing and its associated industries over the same period. Various factors can be cited for those statistics, such as changing farming practices, economic difficulties and geographical isolation. Farmers&#8217; specific needs and, often, their remoteness from support networks and medical treatment hinder early diagnosis of depression and mental illness. Measures to prevent suicide must be examined.</p><p>In his introduction to the strategy document, the minister rightly pays tribute to all those who have worked in suicide prevention, which has resulted in a downward trend in suicides over the past 10 years in Scotland. However, he ends on a note of caution&#8212;that we cannot be complacent&#8212;and says that &#8220;commitment and energy&#8221; are still required if we are to continue to make progress. I most definitely agree with that, and I commend the minister and his team for their work so far.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22854657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Suicide Prevention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is customary in most debates to begin by welcoming the issue that has been brought to the chamber for discussion.

It is clear that the board has faced serious workforce challenges, which it has been tackling since October last year, with some positive outcomes.</p><p>During the second half of 2013, Grampian was affected&#8212;as were other health boards in the north of Scotland, including NHS Highland and NHS Tayside&#8212;by a national shortage of suitably qualified oncologists, especially specialists in neuro-oncology and head and neck cancers. That was compounded by a number of short-term vacancies due to maternity leave, for example.</p><p>To overcome that, the board has been actively trying to find new staff, such as by recruiting a new full-time consultant clinical oncologist, who is now in post, as Dennis Robertson said; advertising for a part-time consultant medical oncologist post, which is currently attracting experienced applicants; getting locum cover for maternity leave; appointing a nurse specialist in genitourinary oncology; and opening up bed space capacity with healthcare worker support in the new emergency care centre, among other specific actions to try to overcome workforce problems.</p><p>All that comes at a significant estimated extra cost for 2014-15 of more than &#163;1.3 million, which is largely to be funded from NHS Grampian&#8217;s own resources&#8212;which, as Lewis Macdonald said, are currently underfunded compared to other health boards&#8212;with a small contribution from the Scottish Government via its detect cancer early initiative.</p><p>The situation is therefore now better than it was three months ago, but in the meantime patients have had to go elsewhere for specialist treatment, hence this debate.</p><p>Clearly the first priority has to be to ensure that patients with cancer or any other serious condition are given the most effective and safest treatment for their condition. If that means that they have to travel some distance for it, so be it, but I have a great deal of sympathy for Tavish Scott&#8217;s constituents from Shetland, and patients from Orkney, for whom Aberdeen is the nearest specialist centre.</p><p>Those islanders have, over many years, accepted the journey to Aberdeen and the need to stay there during treatment, and they have become familiar with the excellent facilities provided by CLAN, particularly its new CLAN Haven residential wing, which I visited recently and which is indeed very impressive. For those patients to be told that they will have to go even further for their treatment, to hospitals in the central belt, must put significant added stress on them and their families, who are already traumatised by a devastating diagnosis.</p><p>Treatment for cancer, be it chemotherapy or radiotherapy, can be very unpleasant and very tiring for patients, and the psychological stress can be even worse. That is only compounded by their being far from home in unfamiliar surroundings and away from family and friends, which in itself can hinder recovery.</p><p>It is extremely important to give patients every possible support, both physical and psychological. That is where CLAN Haven is so effective. Great appreciation for its facilities has been expressed to me by friends in Aberdeenshire who have stayed there while having treatment at Aberdeen royal infirmary.</p><p>The recent situation at the infirmary is a worrying indicator of the workforce pressures on the NHS in Scotland, which are undoubtedly going to increase as the population ages and the incidence of cancer and degenerative diseases grows as predicted. NHS Grampian has clearly been trying very hard to resolve the situation, but I fear that we can expect to hear of similar experiences throughout Scotland as time goes on.</p><p>Again, I thank Tavish Scott for highlighting the very serious issue of oncology provision in Aberdeen on behalf of his constituents, and I wish them well for the future, with treatment hopefully available at least a little closer to home.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22847197", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oncology (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Tavish Scott on gaining the cross-party support to allow this important and topical issue to be discussed here today.

My commitment to a national health service that is freely available to patients at the point of need has been unwavering throughout those 50 years, and it will not change.</p><p>I became part of a profession that was paternalistic towards its patients, who were passive recipients of the care that was meted out to them. On the whole, GPs worked on their own, with their surgery often in their own home, and without the back-up of the team of professionals that is essential in today&#8217;s primary care setting.</p><p>The hospital was run by the medical superintendent and matron, and in the wards sister ruled supreme, while the consultant was often seen as a god-like figure on his daily ward round, talking over his patient&#8217;s head to his retinue of junior staff and medical students in language that was unintelligible to the average patient whose diagnosis and treatment was being discussed.</p><p>Today&#8217;s NHS would have seemed like science fiction to my generation of medical graduates, thanks to the enormous advances in technology and pharmacology that allow more and more of us to live well into old age and that can either cure diseases that were once fatal or turn them into long-term conditions, as is now the case with many forms of cancer. In my own family alone, my son has lived with a transplanted liver for more than 20 years, my daughter has had IVF and I have a new hip, all of which were unimaginable when I left medical school.</p><p>It is therefore hardly surprising that the NHS today is struggling to cope with the enormous demands that are being placed on it, with staff under severe pressure as they deal with an increasing number of patients who are living far into old age with multiple health problems, and who require significant social care as well as healthcare if their needs are to be properly met. Like most people, I have nothing but praise for the army of health and other professionals, and non-professionals, who run the NHS, which is indeed, as the Labour motion states, our</p><p>&#8220;most valued and loved public service&#8221;.</p><p>There is no doubt that, with rising demands on the service and increasing pressure on resources, both human and financial, those resources need to be carefully managed at both Government and local level. One of the great tensions in today&#8217;s NHS is between management on the one hand and clinicians on the other, as they try to meet the needs of the patients for whose wellbeing the service exists. The British Medical Association calls for better engagement with the medical profession to resolve some of the challenges, and Dr Keighley, its Scottish chairman, has stated that it is not the case that</p><p>&#8220;managerial and process change holds the solution to sustaining high quality care&#8221;</p><p>but rather that</p><p>&#8220;it is only by working with doctors and other healthcare professionals that a solution will be found.&#8221;</p><p>For some time, the RCN has been highlighting a critical shortage of nurses and midwives and emphasising the struggle of those in post to deal with increasing workloads. The Royal College of General Practitioners has made it plain that GPs are buckling under the strain of the demands that are being placed on them, and allied health professionals have indicated that they are too few in number to cope with the increasing demand for their services.</p><p>To be fair, the Scottish Government has responded to a number of the pleas for help, and the measures that are outlined in its amendment should begin to point the way to improving quality in Scotland&#8217;s health and care services. Yesterday&#8217;s announcement of an increased intake of student nurses this autumn is a welcome sign that the Government is listening and responding to the RCN&#8217;s concerns, although there will of course be a significant time lag before the current shortage of nurses in the workforce is overcome.</p><p>The recent modification of the GP contract in Scotland to take out some of the bureaucracy will help to free up GPs to focus more on their patients rather than tick boxes on their computer. If the integration of health and social care goes as planned, a new culture of co-operation between health and social care workers and between community and hospital health professionals and with the voluntary and independent sectors should eventually lead to a seamless continuum of care for the growing number of people who depend on it. Of course, time will tell. The Government&#8217;s plans to refocus the role of public health nurses and to reintroduce the titles of health visitor and school nurse will undoubtedly benefit young families in the crucial very early years of development and beyond.</p><p>There is therefore real optimism for the future, but there is still a long way to go to achieve the 24/7 service, fit for the 21st century, to which we all aspire. My colleague Jackson Carlaw in his opening speech clearly signposted the way in which we should approach the future. We should seek to develop our unique Scottish health service to meet the undoubted challenges that lie ahead, whether or not Scotland continues to be part of the United Kingdom, as I hope it will.</p><p>I worry about the difficulty with recruiting and retaining consultants in certain specialities, as we have seen recently in Grampian in oncology. I have spoken to consultants in specialties such as orthopaedics, ophthalmology and mental health who feel that their clinical managers are not heeding the expert clinical advice, and I see a crying need for more nurses, not least for specialist nurses in lung cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, asthma and a number of other conditions. Their expertise is invaluable&#8212;it helps to keep patients in the community and frees up GP and consultant time, which benefits patients and provides a more efficient use of scarce NHS resources.</p><p>I also worry about the increasing number of justifiable complaints from patients, such as the one that I heard about this week from a constituent who, following her husband&#8217;s discharge from hospital at 2.30 pm, waited until 7 o&#8217;clock for his medication only to be told that the pharmacy was closed and she would have to return the next day to get his prescription. That is surely no way to treat a couple in their late 80s.</p><p>I welcome this Scottish Labour debate, because it is good that we discuss what is going well in the NHS and what requires improvement. It also gives us the opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of all those who are involved in the NHS and to thank them for their unfailing dedication to the patients whom they serve.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22843652", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although it frightens me to think about it, next year will be the 50th anniversary of my graduation from medical school.

The prescribed treatment may simply be the required strength of lens to correct their vision, either within spectacles or as contact lenses.</p><p>However, optometrists also check eye health by measuring intraocular pressure to pick up on glaucoma, which can soon cause blindness if it goes untreated, and by carrying out examination of the retina, which can disclose complications of high blood pressure and diabetes and, again, the possibility of glaucoma. All those conditions can lead to impaired vision, or to macular degeneration, which is a common cause of blindness in elderly people. Macular degeneration may or may not be treatable, depending on its type, but it can be treated only if it is diagnosed early in its development. As the first port of call for eye problems, optometrists are therefore at the front line of that area of medical care. We are all well advised to attend regular eye checks so that problems can be picked up early and treated before our vision is permanently impaired.</p><p>I, too, pay tribute to the work of Optometry Scotland, which provides an invaluable service in promoting the work of optometrists north of the border and expressing the views and concerns of its members. &#8220;Lobbying&#8221; is often seen as a dirty word these days, but I have to say that Optometry Scotland is very successful at engaging with MSPs, the Scottish Government and other key stakeholders. On its aims and ambitions, it is commendable that at its heart is the raising of awareness of the importance of regular eye examinations, and encouragement of optometrists to train continually to reach the highest standards of their profession. Considering that Optometry Scotland was set up less than a decade ago, its achievements have been very impressive.</p><p>I have no doubt, for example, that Optometry Scotland played a significant role in the introduction of legislation, under the Scottish Government&#8217;s health and social care integration directorate, that permits independent prescribing rights to optometrists. That initiative means that, following rigorous training, optometrists can prescribe licensed eye-related medicines to patients under the NHS without the patient&#8217;s having to visit their general practitioner or an ophthalmologist.</p><p>Although concerns have been raised with me by hospital specialists in Grampian, following closure of the eye emergency clinic in Aberdeen, that optometrists do not have sufficient training to deal appropriately with a number of problems that present for emergency care, the new system generally appears to work well and will create efficiency savings in the NHS, which I am sure all members will welcome.</p><p>The motion refers to the Scottish vision strategy, which is an offshoot of the UK vision strategy. That strategy complements vision 2020, which is the global initiative to eradicate avoidable blindness by 2020. The refreshed Scottish vision strategy aims to maintain good eye health and ensure that people who suffer sight loss receive the appropriate services. That builds on other recent advances in Scotland. Although I was not convinced of how practical it would be to introduce free eye tests for all when they were legislated for nearly a decade ago, I have to admit that my concerns were misplaced. Before anyone else takes the credit, I add that those free eye tests were introduced in 2006 by the previous Administration.</p><p>Fiona McLeod&#8217;s motion refers to the worrying statistic that in the next 20 years, the number of people in Scotland with sight loss could double, most likely the result of an ageing population and the increasing incidence of long-term conditions, including diabetes. I would be interested to hear the minister&#8217;s thoughts on that in his summing up.</p><p>I end by, once again, thanking Fiona McLeod for leading the debate, and by paying tribute to Optometry Scotland for its efforts to promote and develop community optometry throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22827757", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Optometry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Fiona McLeod on bringing the debate before us to highlight the sometimes unsung heroes of the health profession&#8212;community optometrists.

Despite my medical background, I am not particularly familiar with this field of expertise. Indeed, as a result of modern technology, it is achieving outcomes that would have been unbelievable when I first came across the specialty as a medical student and young doctor.</p><p>We have all read in newspapers of individuals who have sustained horrendous facial injuries in, for example, car accidents, and the previous assumption would have been that the individual involved would simply have had to accept their fate and, to put it bluntly, get on with life. However, advances in the field of maxillofacial surgery and the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of experts mean that a person is no longer forced to endure the rest of his or her existence with life-changing facial scars or other disfigurements as the result of an accident, congenital defect, or cancer surgery. There has been an increase in the number of stories of individuals who have lost features such as their nose or an eye undergoing skilled and painstaking surgery to give them realistic fabricated replacements, allowing them to re-enter society more confidently and helping them to overcome the psychological traumas of their experiences.</p><p>This area of medical science and technology has been one of the great success stories of our time. Although the history of prosthesis stretches back to ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman civilisations, it was not until the last century when prosthetics as a recognised medical field came of age. The first world war saw a huge increase in the demand for prosthetics. It was no longer the preserve of the wealthy but necessitated by the introduction of industrialised weaponry such as machine guns, which left many men horrifically scarred.</p><p>Maxillofacial prosthetics is part of that growing branch of surgery that deals with the disfigurement of the head and neck region and that, although not life-saving, can totally transform the lives of those so afflicted, giving them the confidence to mix with other people and get back to a more normal life. One person who always comes to my mind when I think about transformation after a maxillofacial trauma is army veteran Simon Weston, who was so badly burned and disfigured in the Falklands war, and who now does so much through his charitable efforts to help other people who have experienced similar traumatic events.</p><p>In reading for this debate, I was particularly struck by the moving story of a 16-year-old American girl who was accidentally blasted in the face by drunk friends playing with a stolen shotgun. Although she miraculously survived, she was left blind and horrifically disfigured. That brave young lady went on to marry and have a baby boy 11 years after the accident, but fear of her appearance frightening her child led her to wear a face mask at all times to cover the gaping hole where her eyes and nose once were.</p><p>Her life changed after she underwent pioneering maxillofacial surgery, which prepared her remaining bone structure to allow a prosthetic face that was designed on photographs which were taken before the accident, with features that were aged to reflect the passage of time, to be snapped on and off. Although she will never again be able to see and she has lost for ever any sense of smell, the maxillofacial surgeon gave her the confidence to show her son her new face.</p><p>The example that I have given is an extreme case, but the key word that I want to highlight is &#8220;confidence&#8221;. The gaining of confidence extends to all people who feel renewed by maxillofacial surgery, such as those who were born with a cleft palate, those who need a jaw realignment, and those who are deformed by cancer surgery or trauma.</p><p>The motion rightly pays tribute to the many prosthetists and technologists who work in the field, and particularly to Michael O&#8217;Neil from East Kilbride, who, as we have heard, pioneered a technique to enhance the surgical results for patients who undergo jaw surgery.

On Tuesday, we discussed a bill at stage 1 that will set the scene to enable integration of adult health and social care across Scotland. It is aimed at improving the wellbeing of many people who are at the upper end of the age spectrum.</p><p>Today, we are discussing the other extreme of life. There are many fewer patients at that extreme, but first-class care can set tiny babies on the path to a normal, healthy childhood and the lifestyle and lifespan to which most of us aspire.</p><p>My first encounter with prematurity was when a colleague anaesthetist with a special interest in neonatal and paediatric care became the father of a baby who weighed about 1.5 pounds. I remember seeing that tiny scrap of humanity in an incubator and wondering how on earth she could possibly survive. Mercifully, she became one of the tiniest babies to make it in those days, and I am delighted to say that she grew into and through childhood and is now a very successful and healthy adult. She must be in her mid-40s by now.</p><p>My memories of that tiny baby were rekindled yesterday when I received an email from a North East Scotland constituent, who asked me to take part in this debate. He told me of his experience, which he is happy for me to share with members. I will quote from his email, because it highlights the importance of what the debate seeks to achieve. He said:</p><p>&#8220;In September 2007 my daughter was born 3 months early and weighed 1lb, which is the same as a baby of 22 weeks gestation. My wife and I were fortunate to stay in a city which has an excellent neonatal care unit. Without this, the care and attention provided by the doctors and nurses there, and the support provided by BLISS, ... there is a very real chance that my daughter would not have survived. Happily she did, and in August this year she commenced primary school with the rest of her friends. Please continue to support neonatal care, as the service provided saves lives each and every day.&#8221;</p><p>That uplifting story is about just one of the 8,000 babies who are admitted to neonatal care every year in Scotland either because they are born prematurely or because they are seriously ill. However, not everyone in Scotland has such a good experience as my constituent had. A report by Bliss Scotland in 2011 revealed a significant shortage of neonatal nurses in special high-dependency or intensive care units, and the need in 2009 to close more than half of Scotland&#8217;s neonatal units to new admissions at some point during the year.</p><p>The report also revealed a lack of support for parents, including a shortage of overnight accommodation for parents who have to travel far from home to receive appropriate care for their babies. Having had the experience of staying for five weeks with a son who had to go to Birmingham for transplant surgery, I know how important it is to have accommodation close to the hospital, with other people around who are undergoing and understand the fears and strong emotions that close relatives experience at such stressful times.</p><p>I therefore commend the activity of Bliss Scotland, which works hard to get the best possible care and support for all premature and sick babies and their families, and I welcome its contribution to the new standards for neonatal care in &#8220;Neonatal Care in Scotland: A Quality Framework&#8221;, which was published in March this year. Those standards deal with areas such as the nurse-to-baby ratio and the appropriate training levels that are needed to deliver safe, effective and patient-centred care; the co-ordination of care between units; and the facilities and support that should be available for all families.

That in itself is some achievement in comparison with the 10 members&#8217; business debates that I have secured in 10 years&#8212;perhaps the whips in his party look more favourably on him than those in mine do on me.</p><p>To be serious, James Dornan has again secured recognition of St Andrew&#8217;s first aid week. We marked the event last year and we are doing so again this evening. I make no criticism of that&#8212;indeed, I believe that such an important issue as first aid should be championed each year&#8212;but I apologise if I reiterate some of the points that I made in a previous debate.</p><p>This year&#8217;s debate focuses on the count me in campaign, which is a great initiative to raise the profile of first aid by recruiting 34,000 signatories to match the 34,000 people who are admitted to hospital each year as a result of household injuries or accidents who would not have required hospital treatment had others been around who had basic first aid training.</p><p>The point that is made in the motion is acutely relevant when we consider the pressure on our emergency services and the fact that the NHS constantly has to examine ways of making financial savings. If more individuals undertook training in first aid, that would alleviate some of the strains that are put on our front-line services.</p><p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body offers first aid training and has an impressive record of providing first aid supplies on every floor and in every department in the Parliament building, as well as trained staff.</p><p>Last year, I spoke about an episode that happened when my son was a small boy&#8212;he almost choked on a golf tee. Fortunately, through my medical background as an anaesthetist, I recognised the symptoms of a blocked airway and knew exactly how to dislodge the object. I think that all people&#8212;particularly parents&#8212;should be aware of how to deal with situations such as the one that I have described. A knowledge of basic first aid procedures, such as how to stop bleeding, how to maintain an airway and how to position someone who is unconscious to ensure that they do not inhale vomit, can be life saving.</p><p>First aid is a vital skill. People can save lives by performing simple procedures, following certain guidelines and giving basic treatment until professional medical help arrives. Time and again we read and hear about people who have survived cardiac arrest because someone with the appropriate knowledge was present and able to maintain circulation and a clear airway until professional help arrived.</p><p>There is also an argument for extending basic first aid training to include conditions such as epilepsy so that people can deal with seizures, and simple advice such as not to restrain the person who is having the seizure, to remain calm and to encourage everyone around to do the same should be taught to many more people than it is at present. Although we should never be prescriptive, more widespread teaching of first aid in our schools would benefit all and act as a positive influence on young people throughout Scotland.</p><p>As we know, the culmination of St Andrew&#8217;s first aid week is the now annual Scottish first aid awards. Last year I said that one of my constituents, Phil Glennie from Braemar mountain rescue team, had been shortlisted for the private sector business award for his enthusiastic delivery of quality first aid instruction to a number of groups including the scouts and the girl guides and young people in the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. In case members did not know, I am pleased to report that Phil Glennie won the award.</p><p>I wish all those who have been nominated for this year&#8217;s award the very best of luck and hope that, whether they win or not, they enjoy the awards event at the Sheraton hotel. I commend them and all first aiders for their tremendous work across Scotland and hope that the recognition of their achievements will encourage many more people to follow in their footsteps.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22765656", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;First Aid?

However, I am disappointed that we are holding the stage 1 debate on this particular day, because although the bill will be hugely important to the delivery of health and social care to a large and growing number of people in Scotland, sadly it has been totally eclipsed by the launch of the referendum white paper.</p><p>I am also disappointed that the bill&#8217;s title does not include its main purpose, which is to integrate adult health and social care so as to improve the wellbeing of recipients of that care. The title focuses instead on the public bodies that organise the care, which I think gets things the wrong way round. I know that there were compelling reasons for having that title, but I do not think that it sends out the right message to patients, service users, their families or their carers. Those issues aside, I am happy with the bill&#8217;s general purport, and the Conservative group will support the motion on the bill&#8217;s general principles at decision time.</p><p>In recent years, there have been many initiatives intent on achieving greater integration of health and social care, and excellent results have been achieved in some parts of Scotland. However, concerns remain that joint work between partners to bridge the gap between primary and secondary healthcare, and between health and social care, has not been as effective as it could be and is, at best, patchy across the country. Because the integration agenda has not been compulsory and barriers still exist in terms of structures, professional territories, governance and financial management, the Scottish Government has concluded&#8212;rightly, I think&#8212;that legislation is required if the balance of care is to be pushed from institutional care to community provision of services, with resources following people&#8217;s needs.</p><p>The proposed legislation should set the framework for change, but it will be successful only if cultures and attitudes change as well, which will depend on strong leadership at the local level that is committed to improving outcomes for individuals and to true integration that is capable of not only delivering those outcomes, but doing so with more efficient use of the available resources.</p><p>As we know, the bill requires each health board and local authority to develop an integration plan setting out proposals for establishing an integration authority that can be set up under either the body corporate model, with a joint board and its own chief officer, or the lead agency model, in which local authority and health board partners can delegate to each other agreed functions, with a joint monitoring committee accountable to both bodies that will scrutinise the effectiveness of the integrated arrangements. Concerns were raised with the committee about governance arrangements, particularly under the body corporate model, so I hope that the on-going work of the Scottish Government and its partners in the national health service and local government will lead to greater clarity around that important issue.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to visit both NHS Highland and NHS West Lothian to hear about their experiences of working as integrated adult health and social care services under the different models. Although both would accept that there is still much work to be done on the road to full integration, I was really struck by the enthusiasm of the staff in both areas and their commitment to deliver person-centred care by developing a service with a clear focus on securing the best possible outcomes for people.</p><p>My party is generally not in favour of a centralising agenda, but I agree with Carers Scotland&#8217;s statement in its evidence that the provision that councils and health boards will be jointly accountable for the local delivery of national outcomes set by ministers after consultation has</p><p>&#8220;the potential to achieve consistency across Scotland in the delivery of holistic health and social care services.&#8221;</p><p>The provision should also help to reinforce the message that health, wellbeing and care are not the sole responsibilities of any single agency.</p><p>The potential to extend integration beyond adult health and social care was raised as an issue, with COSLA wanting to restrict the proposed integration arrangements and others arguing that it was essential that they include housing services, for instance. I look forward to seeing the Government&#8217;s promised amendments at stage 2, but I welcome its clarification that the bill should permit local flexibility beyond adult health and social care.</p><p>Clearly, in a six-minute speech I cannot cover all aspects of the bill; I will just note that there are significant concerns over the fact that human rights, quality standards and the need to involve rather than just consult patients, users and carers are not expressed in the bill. I have no doubt that there will be some interesting discussions on those matters when amendments are lodged at stage 2. The lack of involvement of non-statutory partners&#8212;those in the third sector, for example&#8212;with the statutory local authority and NHS partners at the strategic planning stage is another controversial issue that was raised with the committee.</p><p>There are concerns about other issues, such as the potential for cost creep, which Duncan McNeil mentioned, the need for partners to be able to share information electronically, and the reallocation of budgets between acute and primary care. Those are all important issues on which there needs to be further discussion.</p><p>In the final moments of my speech, I will focus on locality planning and GP involvement. Both are essential elements if services are to be redesigned in a way that engages individuals and local communities in delivering the best possible outcomes for patients and other service users. I saw at first hand the success of local healthcare co-operatives, which were located in a few general practices, and the failure of community health partnerships, which were far too big and toothless as health board sub-committees.</p><p>Now we have the opportunity to truly engage again with GPs, who are pivotal in the delivery of care in the community. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s statement that GPs will be embedded in the process as key stakeholders in shaping the redesign of services. I appreciate that current discussions on GP engagement in the planning and development of integrated health and social care arrangements are confidential within contract negotiations, but I am pleased that they are happening and I look forward hopefully to a positive outcome in due course.</p><p>I have had time just to scratch the surface of the bill, but I am happy to support its general principles while accepting that a number of amendments will be lodged as it progresses through the next stages of the parliamentary process.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22763087", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the cabinet secretary for giving us the Government&#8217;s response to the stage 1 report last Friday, in good time for today&#8217;s debate.

The background to the debate is well known, and we all know Dennis Robertson&#8217;s personal reasons for taking such a keen interest in the subject.</p><p>Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa are often exacerbated by the presence in culture, on the television and in the printed media of fashion models who are incredibly tall and thin. Sadly, many young girls feel the need to aspire to this level of so-called beauty and go to extreme lengths to look like Kate Moss or, indeed, the current top supermodel Cara Delavingne.</p><p>Body confidence is a very challenging aspect of modern living that has to be taken seriously, so I pay tribute to the Westminster Government for its campaign to raise awareness of the issue. Launched three years ago, the campaign&#8217;s primary theme is to tackle the causes of negative body image and to give people the tools to challenge the images that they see that can contribute to low personal self-esteem.</p><p>The progress report that was published in May this year is a very constructive document&#8212;if members have not read it, I encourage them to do so. As a starting point, the report contains some startling statistics, such as that one quarter of children aged 10 to 15 are unhappy about their appearance and 50 per cent of women feel under pressure to look good at all times. The Government has been working in a number of areas to address those issues through an advisory group, with members drawn from across industry and the third sector, to promote positive and diverse representations of appearance in the media.</p><p>The Government has also been working with All Walks Beyond the Catwalk, which is a fantastic campaign group that challenges the fashion industry&#8217;s dependence on one body ideal. Constructive work between that group and Edinburgh college of art has led to the diversity network, which promotes positive attitudes to body diversity within fashion education and aims to inspire the next generation of graduates and designers to create fashion for a wider range of body shapes and sizes.</p><p>The current concept in the fashion world that tall and slim equals beautiful certainly needs to be challenged, and I am glad that that is now beginning to happen. Just as we are all individuals with the right to respect and choice in how we live our lives, so, too, we are all different in size, shape, character and colour. No one should portray us as requiring to fit into certain measurements in order to be considered attractive.</p><p>Indeed, if we look at how size and shape have changed through history, it is evident that tall and thin was not always regarded as beautiful. Successive generations tend to be bigger than their predecessors. For example, I am much taller and broader than my mother was, age for age, whereas I am already shorter than my 13-year-old grandson. I do not think that the fashion world has really acknowledged that change, as it continues to design clothes that look good on tall, thin people but not on those who are smaller or more curvaceous. Personally, I find it increasingly difficult to shop on the high street, because much fashion suits only those who are young, slim and trendy, whereas in the real world we have an increasing population of still active older people who want to look smartly and attractively dressed.</p><p>I live in hope that by using models and mannequins that are representative of modern-day society, while accepting nonetheless that there are too many people in the western world who are significantly overweight, we might get a fashion world that caters for all shapes and sizes and which allows people to feel comfortable in their own skin and makes them less likely to copy the images that we currently see on the catwalks of high fashion.</p><p>The recent press coverage of the Debenhams mannequins has contributed considerably to the debate, and I note that Debenhams is not the only outlet that is moving away from what could be described as the body perfect mannequin; Marks and Spencer and TK Maxx have followed suit. Even from a purely commercial point of view, recent evidence has found that women are more likely to purchase clothing if they see it on a shop model the same size as them.</p><p>I am also pleased to see that, in its advertising, Debenhams has also used models who reflect the reality of society, including women over 40, an amputee and a size 18 model. However, there is still scope for mannequins to be more representative of what the human form actually looks like, and I look forward to that happening.</p><p>Once again, I thank Dennis Robertson for bringing this serious issue before us this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740400", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Size 10 Models and Mannequins"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Dennis Robertson for lodging the motion for this evening&#8217;s debate.

None of us can deny the importance of person-centred healthcare in achieving the best possible health outcomes for people who are using the NHS.</p><p>I hope that the days are long gone when patients were told what was best for them and when hospital consultants stood at their beds and discussed their condition with a retinue of staff and medical students&#8212;as I am sure my colleague Richard Simpson will remember; it is very good to see him back in the chamber&#8212;with scant reference to the patients themselves and in language that was almost impossible for a lay person to understand.</p><p>In the days of yore, when I was a practising anaesthetist, I used to see my patients after the ward round, and I usually had to explain to them in simple language what lay ahead because they had completely failed to pick that up from the preceding discussion around their bed. There was little&#8212;if any&#8212;patient participation in discussing possible treatment options, and patients just assumed that the doctors knew best and that they were passive recipients of their care.</p><p>It is obviously right that those days are behind us and that patients themselves are involved in making decisions about their health. However, that means that they must become active partners in their own care by, for example, self-managing their long-term conditions and adjusting their lifestyle to avoid the complications of obesity, high blood pressure and other common features of the modern Western world.</p><p>To achieve that, and to maintain a good quality of life for as long as possible&#8212;nowadays, often into extreme old age&#8212;people require support from a health and social care system that is focused on their needs rather than on those of the care providers, whether they are in the community or in hospital. That requires a well-trained, well-resourced workforce at all levels and in all parts of Scotland, which is difficult to achieve when the needs of an ageing population are growing year by year and enormous pressure is being put on restricted financial budgets.</p><p>Much has been done and is being done to improve the patient experience and to put people at the heart of healthcare planning. There is a plethora of patient-centred programmes in the NHS: Scotland&#8217;s patient experience programme, better together; living and dying well; the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland; the supporting self-management practice toolkit; and several others. The Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013 and the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill that is going through Parliament have a clear focus on patient wellbeing, aiming to improve person-centred care and to remove the barriers to accessing services by the better integration of health and social care.</p><p>The thrust of all those policies is indisputably right, but there is still a long way to go to achieve their aims, principally in changing attitudes and cultures. Only last weekend, I encountered two anecdotal instances of unhappiness with the way in which older people are being dealt with. A 90-year-old man&#8217;s care at home fell short of expectation because his carers were very young and inexperienced and because they were working against pressures of time. The other case is of an elderly lady whose family had to be very assertive with staff to prevent her from being moved from ward to ward during a short hospital stay, and then being discharged before proper home care was in place. They were even told that she could not have a Zimmer frame at home until she had been formally assessed by social work.</p><p>Such anecdotal stories abound in the NHS and, although overall our NHS staff do a fantastic job, pressures on the system and inadequate staff numbers can result in a failure to achieve the best outcomes for the people who are on the receiving end of care.</p><p>For those who are at the end of their lives, I support the efforts of Marie Curie Cancer Care to have NHS Scotland carry out a national survey of the bereaved, as has been done in England, to examine all aspects of end-of-life care, including the quality of care, place of death, respect and dignity, and personal preferences. If that was done and the results were acted on, it would help to ensure that care focuses on what people really want, which is truly person-centred end-of-life care.</p><p>I am very pleased to hear that the cabinet secretary is taking primary care and the accessibility of GP services very seriously and that he is looking at what can be done to improve accessibility by working with the profession to see how bureaucracy can be reduced for GPs, giving them more time to focus on their patients.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite certain parts of the previous two speeches, I think&#8212;and hope&#8212;that the debate is likely to be another fairly consensual one on health.

I was happy to support the new GP contract when it was introduced in 2004 as it removed the responsibility for out-of-hours care from GPs because it was becoming difficult to recruit new entrants into primary care because they were not prepared to do the on-call work that had been done by their predecessors without extra payment.

I learned that milling flour removes folic acid, and that to replace it by fortifying flour in bread might be a very sensible idea.</p><p>I was also delighted to meet my North East Scotland constituents Wendy Hulse and her son Jay from Aberdeen, who are enthusiastic supporters of the SSBA campaign. I have apologies to offer them from their constituency member Mark McDonald, who is unable to attend this debate because of other parliamentary commitments.</p><p>Spina bifida is one of the most common birth defects, with a worldwide incidence of about one in every 1,000 births. In Scotland alone, more than 3,500 people, from children to adults, live with the condition every day. In the United Kingdom, it is a startling statistic that every day, two babies are conceived with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida, which demonstrates just how prevalent the conditions are.</p><p>Although there is neither a single cause nor any known way to prevent it entirely, there is&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;evidence to suggest that dietary supplements that contain folic acid can help to reduce the incidence of spina bifida.</p><p>The message that needs to be put across is that women in Scotland who are sexually active and who are at an age when pregnancy is possible need to be aware that they can go some way towards reducing the possibility of having a child with a neural tube defect if they take folic acid. Common sense dictates that every woman would want her child to be safe and healthy, and anything that can contribute to making that a reality should be part of any form of family planning. If using folic acid for three months prior to conception can reduce the occurrence of neural tube defects by a staggering 72 per cent, that fact needs to be communicated effectively and forcefully.</p><p>As Malcolm Chisholm says in his motion, 52 per cent of women in Scotland are unaware that folic acid can be a part of preventative measures, so that lack of knowledge has to be addressed. That is why I welcome the SSBA&#8217;s latest campaign, &#8220;Are you getting enough?&#8221; The campaign is accompanied by a glossy leaflet showing a bare-chested Scotsman in a kilt, which certainly helps to grab one&#8217;s attention. If placing such a leaflet in surgeries, health centres and maternity clinics succeeds in getting women to pick it up and read it, the first step in the campaign has been achieved.</p><p>The leaflet contains easy-to-read material in which the facts are put across in a lively yet informative manner, giving clear guidance on the effectiveness of folic acid. Further information is given on the recommended dosage of folic acid tablets, which should be higher for women who have diabetes, who have coeliac disease, or who are taking anti-epilepsy medications&#8212;as we heard from Malcolm Chisholm. I therefore commend the SSBA for what I hope will prove to be a very effective campaign.</p><p>We could also learn something from the United States, where folate fortification of grain-based products including breakfast cereals has been mandatory since 1998. I would welcome hearing the minister&#8217;s views on such action when he sums up.</p><p>The motion also mentions the great work that is undertaken by the families and carers of individuals who have spina bifida, and in that context I pay tribute to the family group in my home city of Aberdeen, which meets monthly and which has been offering support since the 1960s, and to institutions such as the Persley Castle nursing home in Bucksburn, which specialises in the care of people with spina bifida.</p><p>Finally, I am sure that colleagues will join me in congratulating the organisers of world spina bifida day, now in its second year, and in wishing them well for the future as they work to raise awareness of the condition and of how its incidence can be reduced.

However, those new drugs tend to be expensive and might not be approved for use by the NHS because the appraisal process does not find them to be cost-effective. Patients who might benefit from them either have to pay for them themselves or appeal to their health board to consider their case for treatment.</p><p>I first became aware of the difficulties that are encountered by such patients in 2008, when the late Mike Gray, who was a victim of advanced bowel cancer, brought his experiences of what was then the exceptional circumstances prescribing procedure to the notice of the Public Petitions Committee because he wanted to spare future patients from what he had gone through in his efforts to be prescribed cetuximab by NHS Grampian. Sadly, Mike Gray died while his petition was still being considered, but his widow, Tina McGeever, continued his work, which resulted in new Scottish Government guidelines and the introduction of the IPTR process.</p><p>The new system still relied, of course, on proving exceptionality from the general population of sufferers of a disease or condition. So, further petitions were brought to Parliament by representatives of patients with rare and orphan diseases who were still unable to access appropriate treatment. Moreover, the IPTR, as we have heard, was not resulting in easier access to new medicines for terminal cancer patients; hence the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s inquiry. All the committee&#8217;s members, including me, felt strongly that a better way had to be found for patients to access medicines that are clinically justified, even if they are not recommended for NHS use because they have not been assessed by the Scottish Medicines Consortium as being cost effective.</p><p>Until a better value-based system can be devised, my party&#8212;in particular, my colleague Jackson Carlaw&#8212;continues to campaign for a cancer drugs fund in Scotland to replicate what was set up in England three years ago. Although some patients are now benefiting from the rare diseases fund that the cabinet secretary initiated, it is a matter of regret to us that more than 3,000 cancer patients in Scotland have already missed out on accessing the drugs that would have been available to them had such a fund been in place here.</p><p>Concerns have been raised with us by clinical academics that there is a real risk that we will lose our place at the cutting edge of research because new-generation drugs are assessed against current state-of-the-art products&#8212;the knock-on effect for Scottish patients being that they may not receive still newer drugs that are being trialled against those that are not currently recommended to the NHS in Scotland, and the effect for clinical research being a significant negative impact. I hope that the creation of a dynamic Scottish clinical trials register will allow Scotland&#8217;s involvement in such research to be accurately monitored in the future, because it is crucial not only to patients but to our economy, which is heavily dependent on our good reputation in life sciences.</p><p>However, we are now moving on, and the Government&#8217;s response to the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s recommendations gives us hope that cancer patients in Scotland will soon have access to new drugs, when they are justified on clinical grounds, via what I hope will be a robust and sustainable procedure for both the appraisal of new drugs and their prescription to NHS patients, based on expert clinical judgment.</p><p>It became clear to the committee that two main issues had to be tackled&#8212;the appraisal process by the SMC, and the need to reform the IPTR process. The Routledge and Swainson reviews were therefore welcome. As others have said this afternoon, the SMC has gained international respect for its work over the past 12 years in evaluating relative to other available drugs the clinical and cost effectiveness of all new licensed medicines that the pharma industry presents to it, and then deciding whether they should be recommended for use in the NHS in Scotland.</p><p>When the SMC considers a drug&#8217;s cost effectiveness, its yardstick is the cost per quality-adjusted life year, or QALY, but when that is relatively high it may use modifiers to allow flexibility in its decision making. Although that generally works well, the committee considered that existing assessments are not always appropriate for medicines for use at the end of life or to treat rare diseases. The Government&#8217;s determination to take action on that by instructing the SMC to review its procedures to allow greater flexibility in evaluation of such drugs is good news, and I have no doubt that the SMC will welcome the opportunity to do that. There is a degree of urgency about it, of course, and I am pleased that we will hear the SMC&#8217;s proposals by the end of the year.</p><p>The committee also agreed with the Routledge review that the system of SMC appraisal could be more transparent and publicly available, and I also welcome the allocation of &#163;1&#160;million a year to support the SMC in achieving that.</p><p>The proposed replacement of the increasingly discredited IPTR system with a peer-approved clinical system has been widely welcomed by the groups who gave evidence to the committee, because it should enable patients to access such drugs when they are recommended on clinical grounds by experts, who will be called on to give their judgment. However, I would like an assurance from the cabinet secretary that he anticipates that increasing numbers of patients will at last be able to access new medicines, and that he will ensure that the funding of NHS boards in Scotland will not be a barrier to achieving that.</p><p>There is a limit to what I can comment on in six minutes, but the Scottish Government has responded positively to most of the recommendations in the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s report. Scottish Conservatives appreciated the opportunities to contribute to the Routledge and Swainson reviews and to present our views to the cabinet secretary, and we welcome his consensual approach to such an important and sensitive issue.</p><p>We still have to learn more of the all-important detail, but I think that, at last, we are seeing progress on widening access to new medicines as a result of painstaking work by both the committee and the Scottish Government.

The Teenage Cancer Trust&#8217;s education programme falls into that category, and I would like to thank Aileen McLeod for bringing it to our attention this evening.</p><p>We are all familiar with the high incidence of cancer in the general population, but I admit that I was surprised to learn that, across the UK, as many as seven people between the ages of 13 and 24 are diagnosed with cancer every day, which equates to an average of 203 teenagers and young adults being diagnosed in Scotland every year. Yet, when I stop to think about it, I know or have known several people in their teens and early 20s who have developed leukaemia, sarcoma, melanoma, liver cancer or some other malignancy.</p><p>However, cancer is not a condition that we generally associate with young people, so as well as it being particularly frightening for someone in their teens to be faced with such a diagnosis, the symptoms are not always recognised for what they are, even by the medical profession, as we have heard. The result is that diagnosis is often delayed, which, of course, is not good for the patient, physically, psychologically or emotionally.</p><p>The work of the Teenage Cancer Trust in educating young people about the symptoms and signs that might indicate the presence of cancer is extremely important, as it gives them the knowledge that will help to empower them to take responsibility for their health, and to dispel some of the fears and misconceptions that they might have around cancer.</p><p>The signs of cancer in young people can easily be missed, because they often resemble those of other, less harmful conditions, but it is alarming that the trust&#8217;s research has found that as many as 40 per cent of young Scots with cancer see their GP four times or more before their symptoms are taken seriously or they are referred to a specialist. Amy Quinn&#8217;s experience, which was so clearly expressed to us ahead of the debate, illustrates that graphically. Young people need to be educated about the signs of cancer, and they certainly should not have to worry about talking to their GP.</p><p>The Teenage Cancer Trust&#8217;s education programme gives free information, education and advice about cancer and its prevention, and about healthy living, to around 130,000 students and teachers across the UK every year and, last year, it visited 95 schools in Scotland, through which it reached more than 11,000 students. As a result, increasing numbers of young people are looking to take control of their own health and are feeling able to speak up if they are worried about some physical change and to discuss cancer openly with others such as family and friends.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I came across some very appreciative words about the education programme from pupils and teachers who had found it very informative and felt that it was presented in an interesting and thought-provoking way and pitched at the right level of giving information without being overly dramatic. In one very moving testimonial, a young boy who had attended an education event felt able to tell his mum about a testicular lump that had been worrying him for two years. Fortunately, the lump turned out not to be cancerous, but the knowledge that he gained gave him the courage to discuss his problem, which, of course, could have been much more serious.</p><p>The recently launched partnership between the Teenage Cancer Trust and the Scottish Government&#8217;s detect cancer early initiative is exciting and I hope that, if it proves to be successful in Glasgow schools over the next year or so, it will be rolled out to other parts of Scotland including, as Mark McDonald has suggested, my area, Aberdeen.</p><p>We need to publicise the Teenage Cancer Trust&#8217;s work, not least the specialist teenage units that it has provided in NHS hospitals right across the UK, including the Beatson centre in Glasgow. Of course, the debate is specifically about the trust&#8217;s education programme, which I am very happy to endorse, and I once again commend Aileen McLeod for bringing the issue to our notice this evening and for sponsoring the trust&#8217;s parliamentary event on 6 November, which I look forward to attending.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698316", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Teenage Cancer Trust"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Over the past 10 years, I have participated in many members&#8217; business debates on health-related topics that have highlighted excellent work in Scotland that is not widely known, but which should be.

I found the easy-to-read version very helpful. I do not know why such a report could not be couched in simple language for everyone. I say that with feeling after another committee evidence-taking session on the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill&#8212;a title that I find quite difficult to reconcile with its integration of adult health and social care intention.</p><p>The strategy is an important document, and this has been an important and interesting debate. It is fair to say that we have come a long way since the publication of &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; 13 years ago, but we must not become complacent and we should recognise that there is always more to be done. That said, there is no doubt that the appropriate care of people with learning difficulties is taken much more seriously now than it once was. It is heartening to learn that more than 1,000 adults with learning disabilities have moved out of special hospitals and into homes within the community.</p><p>I can well remember the very real concerns of parents in Aberdeen when plans were being made to move their children, some of them severely disabled and approaching adulthood, from long-stay hospital into the community. By and large, they settled in well. It is now taken for granted that such people will live in supported homes in the community. I recall the happiness of a 70-year-old lady as she showed me her sheltered flat&#8212;her first real home after a lifetime in institutional care.</p><p>If further progress is to be made, people with learning difficulties must be given a say about the services that they receive and greater control over their lives. That is why I was happy to support the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013. That act will enable more people to lead a normal life of their choosing in their community, despite their disability. It will extend freedom, enable choice and empower individuals to direct the terms of their care.</p><p>Recommendation 5 in &#8220;The keys to life&#8221; recognises that fact and wisely suggests that local authorities and their NHS partners work creatively to ensure that people with learning disabilities have access to a wide range of providers. I agree with Malcolm Chisholm about the need to involve the third sector in the provision of care.</p><p>The report has important things to say about independent living, human rights and the delivery of public services. It rightly recognises the health inequalities and difficulties that many people with learning disabilities face, and it signposts the way to overcoming such issues. I recognise the significance of joined-up thinking for people with learning disabilities, particularly in the context of health, and I would like more to be done to ensure that such people receive effective healthcare on equal terms. I welcome the minister&#8217;s initiatives in that regard and particularly his decision to look at the GP contract, because primary care is key to supporting the health of people with learning disabilities.</p><p>The report is heavy on recommendations and awash with potential reviews to improve healthcare for people with learning disabilities, but it says little about a life plan for such people as they move from childhood into the adult world. There is little on employment, although there is a great need to move people into meaningful paid work when it is appropriate to do so.</p><p>According to Capability Scotland, the gap between the unemployment rates among disabled and non-disabled people has grown during the past nine years, and recent statistics show that last year 653 fewer adults with learning disabilities in Scotland were known to be working than in the previous year. That is a big problem, which deserves to be treated as such.</p><p>Peter Scott, chairman of the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, said:</p><p>&#8220;The trend ... towards more independent living is welcome, but there&#8217;s also an underlying concern that whether in relation to education, employment or day services, opportunities for people may be diminishing.&#8221;</p><p>He is absolutely right. According to &#8220;The keys to life&#8221;, only a quarter of people with learning disabilities were in employment or training for employment when the issue was last surveyed, and only a fifth of those people worked for more than 16 hours a week.</p><p>Of course, there are success stories. The Bread Maker is a pioneering social firm in Aberdeen, which provides a range of meaningful employment, training and education opportunities for up to 20 adults with learning disabilities. However, such businesses are few and far between, and it is clear that a lot more could be done to help people with learning difficulties to enter the world of work.</p><p>The Doran review and the curriculum for excellence said that every child has the right to become</p><p>&#8220;a successful learner, a confident individual, a responsible citizen and an effective contributor&#8221;,</p><p>wherever their learning takes place. That has been shown to hold when a child or young person is in primary or secondary education, but we have made less progress in the period after school. We must do better, as the Conservative amendment suggests. We owe nothing less to the nearly 16,000 pupils with learning disabilities who are currently in Scottish schools.</p><p>For that reason, we must boost the number of such people who take up a modern apprenticeship. Only 0.3 per cent of placements are filled by someone with a learning disability, which is shocking. If we are serious about improving quality of life, we must do more to ensure that people with learning disabilities acquire the right skills to enable them to grasp the right opportunities.</p><p>I welcome the report. Its recommendations point towards a more cohesive environment of support and care. However, words go only so far. If we are really to improve the quality of life for people with learning disabilities, we must focus hard on implementation.</p><p>I congratulate the people who were involved in producing &#8220;The keys to life&#8221;, and I hope that in time the challenges that have been outlined in today&#8217;s debate will be fully addressed.

Last week, the BBC&#8217;s breakfast news covered this subject, and I was struck when it pointed to one individual who had been admitted to hospital more than 230 times in less than two years with injuries that they had sustained as a result of alcohol misuse.</p><p>However, this evening&#8217;s debate rightly focuses on the effect that alcohol has on those around problem drinkers, which is a subject that perhaps does not receive the attention that it deserves. I therefore thank Gordon MacDonald for lodging the motion that is before us.</p><p>We would be hard pressed to find any adult in Scotland, the UK or indeed the wider world who has not heard of Alcoholics Anonymous. However, if the same people were asked whether they had heard of Al-Anon Family Groups, we would probably receive a different answer. Set up more than 60 years ago in New York by the wife of the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, the support network&#8217;s aim is to offer strength and hope to friends and relatives of problem drinkers by sharing experiences and offering mutual help.</p><p>Never is the expression, &#8220;No one knows what goes on behind closed doors&#8221; more relevant than when it is applied to families who live with an alcoholic. Wives and husbands often endure years of domestic abuse brought on by drink-fuelled violence, with almost half of all incidents being caused by people who are under the influence of alcohol or who are dependent on alcohol. Sadly, such cases are frequently unreported, with family members of the alcoholic either feeling embarrassed to report such incidents or, too often, feeling that they themselves are the problem.</p><p>Of course, domestic abuse that is brought on by a problem drinker is not restricted to physical violence. There is also the financial burden that is placed on families or friends who find themselves in debt or acting as cash machines to fund an individual&#8217;s alcohol addiction. Although AI-Anon cannot provide financial help, and&#8212;as the motion states&#8212;it is a charity that is not funded externally, it provides an environment in which those who are closest to an alcohol-dependent individual are able to share their difficulties with others in similar situations.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest endurance for families and friends of an alcoholic is the emotional strain that is placed on people. There can be the feeling of helplessness about seeing someone whom they care about becoming unrecognisable as the person he or she once was. Sadly, there is the tendency for love for that person to turn to hate, along with the guilt and despair that are associated with such emotions. That is why grass-roots groups such as AI-Anon are so important in facilitating meetings to show those affected that the range of emotions experienced are understandable and that they themselves are not responsible for the alcohol dependency of a family member or friend.</p><p>Scotland is particularly supportive of the aims and work of AI-Anon, with more than 120 groups meeting regularly&#8212;there are six in my region of North East Scotland, including three in my home town of Aberdeen.</p><p>I want to touch on the equally important role that is played by Alateen, a support group that was founded in 1957 by a Californian teenager whose father was a recovering alcoholic and whose mother was a member of AI-Anon. Alateen, which was established in Britain in the 1960s, is there for 12 to 17-year-olds who are growing up in an environment where a family member is alcohol dependent. That period is a crucial stage in the life of a teenager, when all sorts of emotions&#8212;as well as physical and mental changes&#8212;are occurring. The addition of the presence of alcoholism in others in a teenager&#8217;s life can have a devastating effect when someone is so vulnerable. Alateen shows young people that, quite simply, they are not alone.</p><p>The debate is timely when alcohol abuse is affecting so many lives, young and old, in Scotland, and I commend Gordon MacDonald for bringing it to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697382", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Al-Anon Family Groups"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the parliamentary chamber, we frequently discuss the dangers of alcohol and what it does to an individual&#8217;s health, whether that be liver damage, premature death by poisoning, long-term brain disorders or many of the other effects that overconsumption can have.

I thank all the MSPs who have supported my motion since it was lodged last week. The report is the result of a collaborative study by Marie Curie Cancer Care, the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian, led by Professor Scott Murray and Dr Lilin Zheng of the university. I flag up a north-east connection, as Professor Murray began his career in primary care as a trainee in the Elmbank practice in Aberdeen, where my husband was a partner.</p><p>The study is the first in the UK to examine the point at which patients are formally identified for palliative care. It obtained its information from the experience of 684 patients across nine Scottish general practices. It found that, whereas 75 per cent of cancer patients were identified for palliative care before dying, only 20 per cent of patients with organ failure as a result of chronic heart, lung, liver or kidney disease, or who had dementia, either asked for or were identified for palliative care. Most patients received it too late to gain full benefit from it. On average, care was initiated just eight weeks before death.</p><p>The study also found that few patients openly admitted that they might die, as they were put off by the negative connotations and lack of understanding of terms such as &#8220;palliative&#8221; and &#8220;hospice&#8221;. It also found that, sadly, general practitioners found it difficult to discuss death and dying with their patients, in particular patients who had a non-cancer diagnosis, even though they recognised that open discussion is helpful for patients, their relatives and the people who take care of them.</p><p>The task of identifying patients who would benefit from palliative care was found to be easier for GPs if patients and/or family members asked them for information and extra support, and specific tools such as multidisciplinary meetings and national guidance were found to be of help to them in making decisions to formally identify such patients.</p><p>The World Health Organization has stated that all patients with a life-threatening condition can benefit from palliative care, which it recommends be phased in from the point of diagnosis. However, many such patients are not being identified in hospital or in primary care, and the resultant late access to palliative care limits the opportunities to improve the quality of life of patients in their last year of life.</p><p>The study concludes with four recommendations. It recommends that patients who are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses should be encouraged to discuss and plan their future care so that their wishes can be accommodated, and that doctors and nurses should offer supportive and palliative care to more people with such conditions.</p><p>The Scottish taboo around talking about death should be tackled, and the report considers that the Scottish Government should lead a public discussion on issues surrounding death and promote more widely its national plan for palliative care, which is called good life, good death, good grief. The report&#8217;s final recommendation is that all doctors and nurses be trained in how to identify when patients need palliative care support in addition to the normal treatment for their condition, and that such training include the provision of support to health professionals to have conversations about death and dying.</p><p>None of this is rocket science, and if the recommendations were taken on board, many more patients and their families would be helped towards a positive end-of-life experience through the prevention and relief of suffering and the early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and the associated physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems, and by being enabled to choose where they want to be cared for and where they wish to die.</p><p>I ask the minister to say, when he responds to the debate, what plans there are, in conjunction with the Royal College of General Practitioners, to review the training of GPs and primary care staff to help them to have better communication with their terminally ill patients, and to ensure that more non-cancer patients access palliative care in the last year of their lives. I also ask the Government, particularly at a time when we will soon be hearing the arguments for and against Margo MacDonald&#8217;s proposals for patient autonomy in deciding when to end life, how and when it will initiate a public debate on death and dying in an attempt to overcome the taboo that currently surrounds the issue in Scotland.</p><p>I thank Richard Meade of Marie Curie Cancer Care for his help in preparing for the debate and I pay tribute to Marie Curie Cancer Care for the huge amount of work that it does in Scotland and across the United Kingdom for patients with terminal illness. We have all heard of Marie Curie nurses, but the breadth and extent of the charity&#8217;s work is less well known. Its 740 employees in Scotland, its 300-plus volunteers and the 3,000-plus people who collected for this year&#8217;s great daffodil appeal mean that nearly 4,500 patients in 31 out of 32 Scottish local authority areas are supported by nearly 400 Marie Curie nurses, who give them excellent end-of-life care and the choice to die at home, if that is what they wish. Research shows that although the vast majority of people wish to die at home or in a hospice, nearly 60 per cent of deaths in Scotland occur in a hospital. I firmly believe that, without the support of Marie Curie nurses, that proportion would be significantly higher.</p><p>Well over 900 patients have been cared for in the Marie Curie hospices in Edinburgh and Glasgow in the past year, and nearly 5,000 have been supported in the community in those two cities alone. Marie Curie also provides emotional support and companionship for many patients with terminal illness, and through its bereavement support services supports their families and carers after the patient has died.</p><p>Moreover, as well as doing its own research, the charity funds one of the UK&#8217;s largest palliative care research programmes. Much of that research, including the study that we are discussing, is collaborative and aimed at finding practical ways of improving the care of patients who&#8212;from whatever cause&#8212;are terminally ill, and of their families.</p><p>Although I could say much more about Marie Curie Cancer Care, I will leave it to others to fill in the gaps that I have left. I look forward to the debate and congratulate all those who have contributed to this very important study on access to palliative care on publishing such a comprehensive report. I commend it to the minister and to Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Palliative Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to lead a parliamentary debate on the report &#8220;How good is primary care at identifying patients who need palliative care?&#8221; just nine days after its publication in the European Journal of Palliative Care.

I also believe that such a scheme would enhance the intern&#8217;s confidence and could help to encourage the individual actively to pursue an ambition to put his or her name forward as a candidate.</p><p>The other area in which we lag behind Westminster is in not having a Scottish equivalent of the access to elected office for disabled people fund. The fund gives financial assistance to disabled candidates, whose expenses are often higher than those of an able-bodied candidate&#8212;for example, to pay for a sign language interpreter. Making such a scheme viable and successful again relies on communicating its availability. Perhaps the minister will touch on that in her closing remarks.</p><p>I slightly disagree with the report&#8217;s suggestion that Scottish politics lacks disabled representatives who could act as role models for other disabled people. In this Parliament, we have seen current and former MSPs with disabilities of one kind or another who have never shied away from being open about their disability. There is also the example of my Aberdeen MP colleague, Dame Anne Begg, whose work in championing disabled people&#8217;s rights and greater participation in politics is highlighted in the report. In Scotland certainly, I do not believe that a &#8220;coming out as disabled&#8221; campaign is necessary or desirable.</p><p>I do not want to end on a negative note, so let me once again congratulate James Dornan on securing this evening&#8217;s debate.

The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association reports eight dog attacks a month. Recently a family pet was subjected to a horrific mauling by a Staffordshire bull terrier on an Aberdeen street, and an Inverness man nearly lost an eye after being attacked by a dog as he sat on a bench beside the River Ness. Such attacks demonstrate the need for action to promote responsible dog ownership and address illegal breeding. Microchipping will not solve the problem, but it can help to identify culprits, as well as make it easier to reunite stray dogs with their owners.</p><p>The public mood appears to be increasingly in favour of compulsory microchipping. As we heard, elsewhere in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland introduced the measure in April last year, the Westminster Government has announced that it will be introduced in England by April 2016 and Wales plans to have it in law by March 2015.</p><p>Over the past year, with the help of the Dogs Trust, I have been pressing the Scottish Government to introduce compulsory microchipping in Scotland. In May I was pleased when the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment agreed to meet me and representatives from the trust to discuss the issue. We had a very constructive meeting and I very much welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s agreement to undertake to proceed with a national consultation on the compulsory microchipping of dogs and the control of dogs in Scotland, which should answer some of Christine Grahame&#8217;s questions. I would be grateful if the minister could give us an idea of the timetable for that consultation in his closing speech.</p><p>There are specific issues relating to puppy farms and to the cross-border movement of dogs, in particular from the Irish Republic and from eastern Europe. However, the most pressing issue that has been raised with me as an MSP is the indiscriminate breeding of dogs in social rented properties. I recently visited Angus Dog Rescue near Arbroath and saw at first hand the consequences of that. Dog rescue centres across Scotland such as the one in Angus are seeing a significant increase in the number of dogs that are being abandoned and are experiencing a particular problem regarding the breeding of certain types of dogs such as bulldogs and Staffordshire bull terriers.</p><p>I am in no doubt that when properly cared for and raised in a responsible environment, such dogs make wonderful family pets, but sadly more and more indiscriminate breeding of those dogs has resulted in many dangerous feral animals and concern has been expressed to me that in time there will be a serious or fatal accident because of that.</p><p>It is my understanding that current legislation allows for tenants in social rented housing to own dogs only after notifying the landlord and that the breeding of dogs is not permitted. However, I am told that that legislation is not always being enforced and it has been suggested to me that a small number of properties already known to the authorities are often at the heart of the problem. Will the minister look at that problem? Will he liaise with the Minister for Housing and Welfare to review current guidance on the keeping of dogs in the social rented sector? Perhaps he will agree to meet representatives of organisations such as Angus Dog Rescue to learn more about the indiscriminate breeding of dogs and how that serious issue may be addressed.</p><p>I pay tribute to the work of all Scotland&#8217;s dog charities and the many individual volunteers who strive to secure for so many abandoned and neglected dogs the loving homes that they deserve, with responsible owners who know how to control and bring out the best in these wonderful animals.</p><p>I hope that the Government will listen to public opinion, pay heed to the excellent work of the Dogs Trust, and bring Scotland into line with our neighbouring countries by introducing compulsory microchipping of dogs in Scotland as soon as possible and ideally prior to the change in the English law in 2016.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696364", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dogs (Compulsory Microchipping)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Claire Baker on securing the debate.

All that has been achieved in the very year that Scotland was awarded Fairtrade status, making it the second nation in the United Kingdom to gain that accolade and one of the first worldwide.</p><p>With all Scottish cities and 62 towns across the country holding similar recognition, I think that we can all be proud of what Scots have worked towards in a relatively short time. As a regional MSP for North East Scotland, I was pleased that the motion refers to Angus. It is commendable that for more than a decade the council there, of whatever political persuasion, has promoted the idea of fair trade across the county.</p><p>Montrose became the first Fairtrade town in 2008, followed by Montrose academy becoming the first Fairtrade school in the area. The range of shops, restaurants, cafes, hotels and supermarkets supporting the fair trade initiative in Angus stretches, as we have heard, from Kirriemuir to Carnoustie and from Forfar to Arbroath. The range of products on offer is diverse, ranging from coffee and rice to cotton and sports balls, sold in order to benefit projects in places such as Pakistan, Kenya and Malawi&#8212;the latter, as we know, being a country that Scotland has had ties with for centuries.</p><p>My home city of Aberdeen was the first city in Scotland to achieve Fairtrade status back in 2004 and it is interesting to note that that award was made to the &#8220;people of Aberdeen&#8221; in recognition of the businesses, schools, faith groups and individuals who worked so hard to gain the prestigious rating.</p><p>On the commitment of groups and organisations to gaining Fairtrade status, the process is not automatic or by any means easy. Renewal for towns and cities takes place every two years and, in the case of Aberdeen, the next date when the fair trade steering group will have to list its achievements is next year&#8212;2014. I wish it well, but given the fact that schools in my area such as Dyce academy and Airyhall primary have already successfully achieved Fairtrade school status, with other bodies working towards similar goals, I think that I can be assured that Aberdeen will go from strength to strength.</p><p>My local church in Aberdeen, which is Cults parish church, has for a number of years had a Traidcraft stall situated in the hall after the service every Sunday. The stall offers a wide range of fairly traded products, such as food items, cards and gifts.</p><p>The commitment shown by supermarkets, which sometimes come in for perhaps undue criticism, should also be acknowledged. As a customer, I find the fair trade bananas sold at Asda to be of exceptional quality, as is some of the fair trade ground coffee. In my local Co-op, where I often buy wine at weekends, the fair trade Pinot Grigio is as good as any one might get anywhere.</p><p>I was also interested to learn of Sainsbury&#8217;s work to promote fair trade through its ambassador programme, whereby some 500 individuals within the UK spread awareness of fair trade initiatives throughout local communities. Sainsbury&#8217;s ambitious 20 by 20 strategy aims to increase sales of fairly traded produce by &#163;1 billion by 2020. That will mean an expansion in the range of fair trade goods that are available to customers.</p><p>Such targets mean that organisations are, we hope, not simply relying on what they have already achieved. We must not be complacent; we must aim to work even harder to gain a better deal for developing countries around the globe. A simple thing, such as choosing to buy a fair trade bar of chocolate instead of a regular bar, should be easy and can make a big difference to families and communities in other parts of the world.</p><p>In conclusion, we need to encourage still more people to think of where their shopping comes from and to consider buying, where possible, goods that are fairly traded.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Graeme Dey for lodging the motion and achieving a members&#8217; business debate on what is a very important subject.

Funding there is an on-going and worrying issue. Following a service break from 2007 to 2009, the service was reinstated through British Heart Foundation funding from 2009 to 2011, but now has funding guaranteed only until next year, both in the city and Aberdeenshire. Work is on-going through the managed clinical network to secure an NHS Grampian-wide service with permanent funding, but as yet the details of that are unknown and nurses in Aberdeenshire could face redeployment from this autumn.

With a voice that is a little bit like Graeme Pearson&#8217;s, I must apologise for my late arrival in the chamber this afternoon, the reasons for which I have explained in writing.</p><p>I am pleased to speak at stage 1 of the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill. Praise is certainly due to the Government for bringing before Parliament a bill that is dedicated to the rights of victims and witnesses. That reflects the growing consensus that victims are not given sufficient thought in the criminal justice system. Of course, what a victim wants more than anything else is not to be a victim at all, but if a crime is committed, the justice system must at all stages deliver for them. It has become clear that that is not always the case.</p><p>The victim must not become a side thought, a prosecution witness or a name on a police file who drops off the radar screen unless, or until, a trial commences. The bill goes some way to redress that imbalance in our criminal justice system, which too often places the rights of the accused above those of victims. However, there is room for improvement, as others have said.</p><p>The bill will significantly extend the entitlement to special measures that are available to victims and will automatically grant them to witnesses under the age of 18 and to victims of sexual offences, domestic abuse, human trafficking and stalking. It will also allow any witness to be considered to be vulnerable, following assessment. Murdo MacLeod QC told the Justice Committee that he expects that about 18,000 additional witnesses will be deemed to be vulnerable, under the proposals, which will mean that giving evidence will be made easier for a significant number of victims of crime.</p><p>The bill will place a duty on courts to consider a compensation order in relevant cases, including where a person has been caused personal injury, loss, damage, alarm or distress as a result of an offender&#8217;s actions. Clearly, some victims do not want anything to do with an offender, but many would consider justice to be done if those who caused them harm or loss were forced to compensate directly. I hope that the bill will increase use of compensation orders, but more must be done to ensure that the Scottish Court Service is more effective at collecting fines.</p><p>The bill also establishes a victim surcharge, which will require offenders to pay into a fund that will be used to provide practical assistance to victims who have immediate unmet needs. That will go some way towards helping victims in the aftermath of a crime. Again, that policy is welcome, but it is hardly ambitious because&#8212;as far as I understand it&#8212;the victim surcharge will apply, at least initially, only to those who are given court fines. That means that an offender who is found guilty of a road traffic offence will contribute to the fund, but a violent offender will not. That seems to be far from ideal.</p><p>As a member of the Health and Sport Committee, the only part of the bill that I have studied in detail is that which concerns the establishment of a national confidential forum, which was generally welcomed by those who gave evidence to the committee. There were some caveats, however. For example, although the Aberlour Child Care Trust and Children 1st welcomed proposals to create a safe confidential space in which people can discuss their experiences, they pointed out that although some survivors of childhood abuse might find that to be a cathartic experience that helps them to move on, others might find it to be re-traumatising, or might discover that it raises thoughts and feelings that they need to explore outwith the forum.</p><p>Some witnesses felt that acknowledgement alone is not enough and that, without remedies, the process could impact negatively on the health and wellbeing of some survivors. There was consensus&#8212;as was recognised by the Scottish Government&#8212;that access to counselling, therapeutic support, mental health services and advocacy will be essential if the health and wellbeing of survivors are to benefit from participation in the forum. It was agreed that appropriate services must be available for all who take part in the confidential forum, whether they are older people or young adults, whether they have disabilities or mental health issues and whether they live in or outside Scotland, whatever their life circumstances.</p><p>A person-centred approach was held to be crucial, with a choice of support being available for up to two years, and there being a one-stop approach to counselling and advocacy. So strong was the stated need for support that the committee wishes the Scottish Government to ensure availability of services for participants in the confidential forum to support them before, during and after taking part&#8212;as Duncan McNeil said in his speech&#8212;and, more widely, for all adult survivors who may require psychological or counselling support.</p><p>The NCF must have operational autonomy if it is to perform its role effectively and with credibility, and some concerns were expressed about the proposal to position it within the Mental Welfare Commission, as a result of fears that the stigma that is associated with mental ill health might transmit to adult survivors of childhood abuse.</p><p>However, the committee was reassured that it would be clear to survivors who come forward that they would be taking part in the NCF as a separate entity from the Mental Welfare Commission, and that the forum would benefit from the infrastructure, governance and expertise of the commission.</p><p>A number witnesses felt that there is a need to broaden the range of those who are entitled to participate in the forum to include people who experienced abuse in foster care and kinship care. Children 1st and Aberlour want those who have experienced abuse in natural families to be included as well, and there were suggestions that the qualifying age should be lowered.</p><p>A number of other issues were raised at committee, which will no doubt be aired at stage 2. Suffice it to say that expectations for the NCF are high. The Health and Sport Committee welcomes what is envisaged, but sees the need for more detail to be provided on how it can work in practice.</p><p>Although the bill is largely to be welcomed, it can undoubtedly be improved and built on. It will help to put the rights of victims and witnesses near the front of the minds of the police, the Crown and the Scottish Court Service. It is just a shame, as my colleague said, that victims and witnesses were ignored by the Scottish Government when it took the decision to close a fifth of Scotland&#8217;s sheriff courts, which has added to the on-going slap in the face for victims of crime that is the continuation of automatic early release of prisoners. However, that is another debate, and I will leave it for another time.</p><p>As John Lamont said, my party is supporting the bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

During the ceremony, six honorary degrees were awarded, one of which was an honorary doctorate for the great cycling athlete, Neil Fachie.</p><p>Members may be aware that Neil, a science graduate of the University of Aberdeen, came to prominence at the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, when he competed in athletics before turning to cycling. Neil has the congenital eye condition retinitis pigmentosa, but despite that disability he has gone from strength to strength, his success culminating in the four gold medals that he won for Britain, breaking two world records and becoming the first Scot in the Paralympics GB team to win a gold medal at London 2012. Since then, he has become a regular ambassador for sport in schools across the country and is a proud representative of Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK. As others have said, when we discuss sport, we must not confine the discussion only to the able-bodied or ignore the influence that role models such as Neil Fachie can have on young people. Like Patricia Ferguson, I hope that sports for people with disabilities will feature in the forthcoming youth sport strategy.</p><p>Like all of us in the chamber, I watched with great enthusiasm last year&#8217;s Olympics and Paralympics and was overwhelmed by the sense of occasion and the unifying impact that it had on our nation as a whole. Similarly, I look forward to next year&#8217;s Commonwealth games, and I very much support the part of the minister&#8217;s motion that backs Glasgow&#8217;s bid for the youth Olympics in 2018.</p><p>As members will be aware, the Health and Sport Committee recently carried out an inquiry into support for community sport. I urge any member who has not done so already to read our comprehensive report, which was published earlier in the year. A clear finding of the inquiry was that we require a genuine and lasting sporting legacy from the forthcoming Commonwealth games, which will be watched by an estimated worldwide audience of more than 1 billion people. Ideally, such a legacy will result in a nation whose young people are physically active and regularly participate in sport.</p><p>People of all abilities, ages and backgrounds must be encouraged to participate and volunteer in community sport, and they should begin as young as possible. Witness after witness in our inquiry stressed the importance of volunteers for every sport, referring to them again and again as the lifeblood of sporting activity without which many sports clubs would not survive. As we know, many volunteers are parents. From making the tea, washing strips after the game and raising necessary funds to coaching team members, the activities of volunteers are legion. They are essential and we need more of them, so it is vital that the Commonwealth games are not confined to two weeks of entertainment. I was encouraged when, last week, we heard from the minister some of the detail about how the Government intends to encourage more volunteers into sport beyond 2014, as it is clear that barriers to volunteering still remain.</p><p>From our inquiry, we know that many people feel that they do not have the skills or the time to become involved in sports, whereas it was suggested that others would volunteer if asked but would need to be assured that they would have an enjoyable experience. People need to be given the right training. I agree with Judy Murray&#8217;s evidence about an inexperienced coach learning from an expert, which is akin to an apprentice learning from a master. I urge the minister to consider that when formulating the youth sport strategy.</p><p>As someone with a health background, I naturally hope that the most important legacy that will come from Glasgow 2014 will be the improved physical health of our people&#8212;and that must start with our young people. I fully endorse the Scottish Sports Association&#8217;s vision that all children should have the right to be physically literate and that their early education should help them to become regular participants in sport and physical activity. It is of great concern that a 2012 growing up in Scotland report noted that 22 per cent of six-year-olds are classed as overweight or obese, which often leads to other problems such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and various forms of cancer. We need to get young people moving, and participation needs to continue throughout life right into extreme old age.</p><p>In his amendment, my colleague Alex Johnstone rightly expressed his concern, which many of us in the chamber share, that despite the pledge made more than five years ago, the Government has yet to deliver access for schoolchildren to two hours of quality PE each week.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment recognises the need for quality sporting facilities so that people are encouraged into sport and their interest is maintained. That was brought home to me when the Health and Sport Committee visited the splendid sports village in Aberdeen, which is very well used by those who access it. It was pointed out to us that there are several communities in the city who cannot access it for various reasons and that those communities also need good sporting facilities if they are to be encouraged to take up sports. I am therefore very supportive of the community sports hubs concept, which can make education facilities available to local people outwith school hours. It is encouraging that the school estate across Scotland is gradually opening up for community use, although there is still a way to go.</p><p>The Conservatives welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to publishing a youth sport strategy if that goes some way towards addressing the concerns that have been raised in the chamber. The strategy ought to set out where we progress from here, and I look forward to seeing the meat on the bones when it comes out in September. I have no doubt that this is an important area to which we will return in due course.</p><p>We will support Shona Robison&#8217;s motion and all three amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693450", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I told him that I was going to say that.

I extend my thanks to my fellow North East colleague, Alison McInnes, for bringing the matter to the chamber.</p><p>Governments&#8212;of whatever political composition&#8212;would be unwise to ignore the elderly lobby, given that we are all living longer. Indeed, the average life expectancy for Scottish males born today is around 78.4 years, which is only a few years shy of Japan, which tops the international table at 82.7 years. In comparison, in 1900 male Scots were likely to live to 45, and the projection is that, by 2035, men in Scotland will live to nearly 81 years of age.</p><p>For those reasons, the role of charities such as Age Scotland is increasingly more relevant, and the various campaigns that they have conducted over the years have highlighted the needs and demands of our ageing population.</p><p>The motion focuses on the still waiting campaign, which seeks to end isolation of the elderly by extending the national concessionary travel scheme to include all demand-responsive community transport. Doing that would mean that the older people who depend on community transport rather than commercial transport, especially in rural areas such as Aberdeenshire, would not have to pay any fares for their bus services.</p><p>The key benefit of including community transport in the NCT scheme relates directly to the aim of helping older and disabled people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible but, at the same time, providing the means to allow individuals to get out and about to do their shopping, attend medical appointments and socialise with friends.</p><p>We have heard of the research results that show that loneliness and social isolation can be more dangerous than a lifetime of smoking, with isolation leading to depression. A lack of interpersonal interaction is also a factor in the onset of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s. Community transport might have a role in delaying the onset of such conditions by enabling older and disabled people to continue to play a full role in their communities. Age Scotland is of the view</p><p>&#8220;that the resulting improvements in health and social care outcomes of investment in community transport are wholly commensurate with the preventative spending agenda, and would deliver substantial savings to the state.&#8221;</p><p>The motion draws attention to the astonishing statistic that more than two thirds of those aged 60 and over in remote rural areas do not have, or cannot use, a free travel pass. Various reasons have been suggested for that, but the most obvious is that commercial bus operators are withdrawing from routes on the grounds of cost, which means that more and more elderly people are cut off from others. Community transport services, which are often run by local charities, are crucial in filling that void. However, as they cannot register with the traffic commissioner, they are ineligible for reimbursements under the NCT scheme.</p><p>Age Scotland estimates that to extend the NCT scheme as proposed would cost in the region of &#163;11.2&#160;million, and it suggests that that cost</p><p>&#8220;should be met by adjusting the eligibility criteria for the existing scheme.&#8221;</p><p>Clearly, what Governments fund is a matter of political choice, but I hope that the minister will give serious consideration to the still waiting campaign, which, if successful, could bring significant benefit to many older and disabled people in Scotland.</p><p>I commend Age Scotland&#8217;s work on behalf of Scotland&#8217;s older population and I look forward to welcoming representatives from the charity at the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Stirling next week.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

As verified in the briefing from the cross-party group on chronic pain, and confirmed by the cabinet secretary, this is the first Government-led debate on chronic pain in the Parliament, although there have been two previous member&#8217;s debates, the last of which was led by my colleague Mary Scanlon two years ago, as she reminded me this afternoon.</p><p>As we have heard, chronic pain is not uncommon: it affects nearly one in five adults and 8 per cent of children in Scotland. Whatever its cause&#8212;and there are many conditions that give rise to it&#8212;long-standing pain is a blight on the lives of those afflicted by it. A third of those affected are never free of it.</p><p>I have experienced the pain of an arthritic hip prior to replacement, with the other one following suit. Believe me, that was not funny, but at least I knew that in time the pain would be relieved&#8212;as do the increasing numbers of people who nowadays undergo hip replacement. I do not know how I would have coped 15 years ago, before such surgery was available. I can only imagine the agonies that my husband&#8217;s grandmother must have gone through before the inflammatory process was spent, leaving her crippled and deformed.</p><p>Many people affected by a wide range of conditions that give rise to chronic pain cannot look forward to a cure. They ought to be able to access symptomatic relief and help to cope with the pain wherever in Scotland they live. Sadly, that is not yet the case.</p><p>Of course the ideal would be to prevent pain from becoming chronic. That is often achievable with back pain, in which early intervention by a physiotherapist may quickly allow patients to get back to a normal life.</p><p>My husband was a fundholding GP in the 1990s, and physiotherapy was one of the first services that he recruited with his budget. That allowed immediate referral for his patients with back pain, prevented chronicity from developing and usually got them back to work quickly. It was a winner all round with happy, pain-free patients and significant savings in sickness benefit. Sadly, fundholding became ideologically unacceptable and was stopped.</p><p>When pain cannot be dealt with in the three months before it becomes chronic, a proper pathway really should be in place for the effective and equitable management of such a serious long-term condition. Therefore, there must be an all-round welcome for the Government&#8217;s plans to implement the well-designed Scottish service model for chronic pain to ensure the best possible outcomes for the care and support of those who live with pain.</p><p>To be fair and effective throughout Scotland, that model must be backed by a service delivery plan prepared with patient input and implemented by all of the territorial health boards. I agree with Labour&#8217;s amendment that that is urgent and that each delivery plan&#8217;s implementation should be monitored&#8212;although, unless I am being somewhat naive, I imagine that that is the Government&#8217;s intention.</p><p>Although the management of patients with chronic pain has been on the radar since the mid-1990s, it is fair to say that progress really only began following the GRIPS report of 2007-08 and the Government&#8217;s appointment of a lead clinician for chronic pain to co-ordinate and champion the development of pain management services.</p><p>Now, with further funding in place to drive forward the implementation of the Scottish service model, we will surely begin to see results, including the better understanding, prevention and management of chronic pain and better services giving patients the earliest and most appropriate treatment locally but with ready access to specialist services when needed.</p><p>The availability of proper advice, support and help at community and primary care level should allow many people to manage their pain effectively with appropriate medication. For people with more complex pain, the model should ensure the ready availability of specialist pain management programmes within secondary care delivered by allied health professionals and pharmacists skilled and knowledgeable in pain management.</p><p>I fully understand the demands for a residential centre in Scotland to cater for the needs of the small number of people with severe chronic pain who currently have to travel hundreds of miles to access the specialist services that they need. It would undoubtedly be better for patients if such care were available as near to home as possible, with friends and family reasonably close.</p><p>I still remember how isolated I felt as a relative when my son was seriously ill in Birmingham even though I was there with him. That sense of separation was all the worse for him&#8212;and that was without a travel ordeal, because he was totally unaware of his journey there.</p><p>I am glad that the Government is giving the possibility of an in-patient facility serious consideration during the continuing assessment of what is required within a Scottish intensive pain management service. A positive outcome, as called for in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s amendment, would certainly be welcomed by the patients who cannot get appropriate specialist treatment in Scotland. I hope that, if the experts considering it recommend such a residential facility, it will be established without delay.</p><p>The debate has been, on the whole, consensual and constructive. It has also been important for the many people in Scotland who live with chronic pain. It has taken far too long for chronic pain to be recognised as a serious long-term condition and for the equitable development of pain management services throughout Scotland to take place. However, the Government deserves credit for moving things forward in the past few years.</p><p>I welcome the progress that has been made so far, but there is still a long way to go to ensure the availability of good pain management for all the thousands of people in Scotland who suffer from long-term pain now and those who will have chronic pain in the future. I hope that the next debate that we have on the subject will be soon and will celebrate the achievement of a first-class system for all who need it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been worth while, although long overdue.

Most of those victims are very fit young people and often skilled athletes.</p><p>Cardiac arrest can of course occur in all age groups or as the result of an accident. It is important that as many people as possible know how to deal appropriately with such a serious emergency. In the old days when I was a young doctor, defibrillators were scary pieces of equipment and quite difficult to use safely and effectively. Now, however, the modern automatic external defibrillators are very user-friendly and quite easy for members of the public to operate.</p><p>Sudden death in young people from cardiac arrhythmia was brought to my attention very soon after I became an MSP 10 years ago by the redoubtable Wilma Gunn from Selkirk, who lost her son from that cause. She asked me and several other MSPs to be a patron of her charity, Scottish Heart at Risk Testing, for which she campaigned tirelessly. Scottish HART had the twin purposes of seeking cardiac screening for all young people taking part in strenuous sport and of raising funds to put defibrillators in strategic places such as football grounds and sports stadia. I do not know how many such machines Scottish HART funded, but there were many, not least in the Dons home ground of Pittodrie, in Aberdeen.</p><p>I remember facilitating a meeting in St Andrew&#8217;s house with Malcolm Chisholm, when he was a health minister, civil servants, Wilma Gunn and Professor Hillis from Glasgow, an expert in sudden cardiac arrest, to discuss the feasibility of screening young people who might be at risk. The perceived wisdom at the time was that large-scale screening was not appropriate, but things moved on. I believe that such screening is now available for young athletes, but the minister might be able to correct me if I am wrong on that.</p><p>It is important to raise awareness of the possibility of sudden cardiac arrest and what can be done to save the lives of those who fall victim to it. Widespread distribution of AEDs is needed, together with, as has been pointed out, educating people from an early age in how to recognise cardiac arrest, how to do CPR and how to use an AED.</p><p>Samantha Clinton is to be congratulated on her efforts to have a defibrillator placed in every school in her local authority area and on designing colouring sheets for local primary school pupils that are aimed at teaching parents about sudden cardiac arrest.

Apart from raising the profile of the Aberdeen Donside by-election, I am not sure what the debate is expected to achieve.</p><p>No one denies that the continuing congestion at the Haudagain roundabout is a serious problem for drivers in Aberdeen and that it is detrimental to the local economy. The current argument is whether improvements at the roundabout should be put in place before or after the completion of the Aberdeen western peripheral route. There is a clear difference of opinion between Labour politicians and the Scottish Government, which this debate is not going to resolve.</p><p>I understand why Labour keeps hammering away at the issue. I, too, am disappointed that more immediate work is not being undertaken to solve the problems at the A90/A96 junction. To continue with Alex Johnstone&#8217;s plea, I urge Keith Brown and his officials to reconsider the feasibility of bringing forward the timescale so that the Haudagain improvements can be completed very soon after the north leg of the AWPR is in place. I see that as the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>The Government has confirmed its intention to pay for the improvements, which is welcome and reassuring. Welcome, too, is the recent commitment of the Labour-Conservative coalition in Aberdeen City Council to the completion of the link road between the A96 and Dyce Drive by 2015, as is mentioned in the Labour motion.</p><p>Notably omitted from the motion, however, is the delivery of a third Don crossing, which was finally agreed this year after many fruitless years of Labour opposition to it. I was a city councillor in Aberdeen for 11 years between 1988 and 1999, and, if my memory is correct, during that time I and my Conservative colleagues voted three times for such a crossing but the proposal was always defeated by Labour. The arguments were always the same from the local councillor, backed by his group. He said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not putting a crossing through my Tillydrone&#8221;, as if that part of the city was Labour&#8217;s by right. Never mind the greater good of the rest of the city, notably the improvements that such a crossing would make to the lives of the residents of Bridge of Don and the many commuters who enter the city from the north.</p><p>Until the Conservatives on the council made the third Don crossing a non-negotiable part of their coalition agreement with Labour, the arguments continued. Thankfully, there is now a commitment to the structure, although the Labour group in the Parliament is clearly reluctant to acknowledge that. I just wish that there had been the same resolve on the proposals to continue with the city garden project&#8212;an issue that is still infuriating local residents, as I have found when campaigning in the current by-election.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Haudagain Roundabout"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Christian Allard on a very good speech.

I know Professor Mallard very well, but I was not aware that that was how the MRI scanner started off.</p><p>The zoology department at Aberdeen has been open to youngsters for many years, allowing them hands-on experience of biological science. Just over a week ago, the University of Aberdeen hosted its first&#8212;and very successful&#8212;May festival, a multidisciplinary event, including science, which had the aim of stimulating the interest of people in all age groups, including children. The university also has an initiative called science and spokes&#8212;realising rural research, which consists of a series of science discussions and debates linking the public with scientists who are involved in research of particular relevance to a rural audience. That initiative aims to reach more than 6,500 in Aberdeenshire and Inverness-shire.</p><p>My home city and alma mater have built up a wealth of experience in promoting science to the local population, and I am very proud to celebrate their efforts today. However, despite all that, there are seriously worrying shortages of appropriate skills in North Sea industries. Many of the jobs are science based, but people outside the north-east are unaware of the many openings that are available. We must enthuse children throughout Scotland about science at an early age and let them see the opportunities that it can offer.</p><p>Science-based work in the oil industry does not have to mean working in a dangerous, dirty environment, but the perception that it does is often a turn-off for girls in particular. The industry is desperate to attract more women into its workforce&#8212;as engineers, for example, although many other science-based careers are also available.</p><p>The industry works closely with schools in the local area to encourage pupils&#8217; interest, but there are many excellent employment opportunities for young people from other parts of Scotland who do not even know about them. We should encourage people in some of the more deprived areas to take much more of an interest in the science subjects.</p><p>When they visit schools, every MSP should encourage children to develop an interest in science and look at the many opportunities that it offers, not least in the oil and gas industry. Sadly, however, I find that most MSPs from outwith the north-east perceive oil to be an Aberdeen issue and therefore of no interest to them.</p><p>Just yesterday afternoon I visited Portlethen primary school in my region for the usual question-and-answer session, this time with around 50 pupils from primaries 6 and 7. I asked how many of them liked science, and to my surprise very nearly 50 hands, male and female, shot enthusiastically into the air. The teacher explained that those pupils benefit from regular teaching visits from a science specialist, and they love them.</p><p>My grandson was similarly encouraged in primary school, and, now that he is in his first year of secondary school, he enthuses about his science subjects and dreams of an engineering career. To cheer up Nigel Don, I can tell him that my grandson&#8217;s subjects include practical technical subjects. Such early enthusiasm must be kept alive and career opportunities brought within reach by teachers at both primary and secondary level who are qualified to stimulate interest in the sciences.</p><p>The day after the UK Government&#8217;s announcement of financial support for a British astronaut, I urge the Scottish Government to resist any moves to drop science subjects from the higher curriculum. The world revolves around science and scientific discovery, and we must allow as many young people as possible to become familiar with it in whatever scientific discipline appeals to them by giving their teachers the training and support that are necessary to generate and nurture the scientific skills that Scotland requires now and in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electrical Safety in the Private Rented Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept that&#8212;it is an interesting point.

Therefore, I will concentrate on the infrastructure and workforce matters that Labour has raised, while my colleague Jackson Carlaw will deal with the introduction of minimum alcohol unit pricing as a public health measure&#8212;to sum up what the cabinet secretary said in support of his amendment.</p><p>For many years, we have talked about the increasing challenges that the NHS faces, which are a result principally of an ageing population, but also of the many health problems that result from lifestyle issues. Last October, the Health and Sport Committee received evidence that</p><p>&#8220;ageing of the population alone, with no alteration in the prevalence of diseases or the age-specific rates of becoming disabled ... will result in a 67 per cent increase in the numbers with disability over the next 20 years. Numbers of the oldest old (those aged 85 years and over) with disability will have doubled&#8221;.</p><p>In addition, the proportion of the older population with arthritis, coronary heart disease, stroke and dementia will have increased by 40 per cent by 2025&#8212;just 12 years from now&#8212;and many of those people will have several long-term conditions affecting their health and wellbeing.</p><p>Although those figures are from south of the border, there is no reason to suspect that Scotland is greatly different. The increasing numbers of people who require care have been described as a huge train coming towards our health service system and it is not clear whether the system is in a fit state to cope. The BMA itself has said that</p><p>&#8220;There is an urgent and growing need to improve decision-making on what&#8221;</p><p>healthcare and care</p><p>&#8220;services are needed locally and how they can best be delivered&#8221;,</p><p>and that there needs to be</p><p>&#8220;an open and honest debate ... about what the NHS can and cannot deliver&#8221;</p><p>in the longer term. I do not always agree with the BMA, but I think that it is right to say that services will need to be improved and reorganised to meet changing demands and that that can be done effectively only with the engagement of those who deliver services locally, including doctors and nurses.</p><p>I am pleased to note the Government's stated</p><p>&#8220;commitment to at least maintaining the level of quality and provision in NHS Scotland in the face of&#8221;</p><p>increasing challenges, although the cabinet secretary&#8217;s quoted comments to the recent Unison conference were perhaps something of a hostage to fortune in the context of health boards&#8217; attempts to rationalise their services and estate as demand increases.</p><p>It is worth looking at the Lothian strategic clinical framework for the next seven years to put the apparently threatened Edinburgh hospitals in context. It states:</p><p>&#8220;We will look at the physical space and land that we own and make decisions, based on clinical need, on opportunities to safely move off sites, reducing land and property running costs&#8221;</p><p>thus releasing funding to be invested in other services. It continues:</p><p>&#8220;We will continue a programme of primary care premises development providing accessible community-based healthcare facilities.</p><p>Less hospital in-patient care may mean we need fewer hospital beds, with those that we do need provided in appropriate and fit for purpose accommodation.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, the document states:</p><p>&#8220;We will review some of our smaller sites&#8221;</p><p>such as the Astley Ainslie, Corstorphine and Liberton hospitals</p><p>&#8220;which provide a less than optimal setting for patient care in terms of privacy, dignity and safety ... as we modernise the facilities and locations in which the care of older people is provided.&#8221;</p><p>I do not profess to be familiar with the Lothian hospitals, but we have similar on-going issues with the Grampian hospital estate, where provision is gradually being realigned to cope with a changing population and changing demands. I think that that approach is sometimes necessary.</p><p>Change is never popular, but to cope in the future we will need proper integration of healthcare and social care. People will also have to be a little bit more self-reliant and will be assisted by steadily improving technology such as telecare, which can now be successfully used by elderly people who have, for example, no knowledge of computing.</p><p>However, although the balance of care is continuing to shift towards more community-based health and social care and more service provision by the third sector, there will still be high demand for acute services, partly because of ever-advancing medical and surgical technology but also because of the greater numbers of older people.</p><p>That brings me, finally, to the nursing workforce, which according to the RCN is facing unprecedented pressures. I have seen that at first hand at night in a busy orthopaedic ward, when I was looked after by only one charge nurse and one auxiliary who were dealing with six intravenous infusions and a number of very frail elderly patients. It would take just one emergency in such a ward for the system to fall apart&#8212;and the management are well aware of it.</p><p>The planning tools for nursing, which ensure that the right number of nurses and healthcare assistants are in the right place at the right time in all hospital settings&#8212;use of which are, indeed, now mandatory for all health boards&#8212;can help if they are used regularly and in every ward and health team. Unfortunately, however, some health boards are continuing to cut the nursing workforce, which is causing yet another postcode lottery of patient care, and putting immense strain on overworked nurses and healthcare assistants.</p><p>I conclude by quoting the RCN once again:</p><p>&#8220;We ... urge all health boards ... to work with us stop the cuts to staffing levels right across Scotland and ... the Scottish Government to plan for the long term and face up to the ... pressures on our NHS, for the people who work in it and the patients who rely on it.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The very serious issues that are highlighted in Labour&#8217;s motion and the Scottish Government&#8217;s amendment could fill a whole day&#8217;s debate and can only be touched on in the time that is available to us.

A disease of unproven aetiology and with, as yet, no known cure, MS is a complex condition that can be difficult to diagnose. That is why the work of the MS Society Scotland, through events such as national MS week, is so important in raising awareness.</p><p>I turn to the motion and the MS Society&#8217;s report. It is clear that there needs to be far more emphasis on providing information for people with MS on the treatments that are available to them, and on the planning and provision of appropriate support services. In the time that is available to me, I would like to highlight a few factors that are specific to Scotland.</p><p>One of the striking findings of the survey that the MS Society carried out is that as many as 29 per cent of people in Scotland do not have enough information about medicines that can alter the course of MS, and that only 36 per cent of those who are eligible for such treatment are getting it. Moreover, given that treatment is advancing all the time, it is concerning to learn that in the Highlands and Islands and my area, North East Scotland, only 9 per cent of those people who wish to participate in clinical trials of new and evolving medicines can do so.</p><p>The situation with regard to other issues, such as access to care and support services, reinforces the existence of the oft-mentioned postcode lottery. The report highlights regional differences: 80 to 100 per cent of people in Edinburgh and the Lothians who needed to see a neurologist have done so, whereas in Scotland at large around 25 per cent of people said that they could not access a neurologist when they needed to. That is despite the conclusion in last year&#8217;s NHS Scotland final report on neurological health services that all but four health boards were meeting the peer-reviewed criterion for access to an MS multidisciplinary team.</p><p>I think that the MS Society Scotland&#8217;s suggestion that every person in Scotland with MS should have two comprehensive reviews a year to assess their needs, and the level of care and support that they require, should be heeded. Perhaps the minister will comment on progress in that area in his speech.</p><p>The report provides a more positive response in the field of mood and emotional support for people with MS in Scotland, where we perform better than the rest of the UK, with 58 per cent of need being met, compared with a UK average of 51 per cent. However, as with all things, the fly in the ointment again lies with regional differences. People in the Highlands and Islands do not feel that they have the same access to emotional support as people elsewhere in the country. Let us remember that, for an individual with MS, emotional support is every bit as important as any other form of treatment and help.</p><p>There is a clear need for people with MS to be helped to self-manage their condition, which requires education and the provision of appropriate information. When we debated the issue at around the same time last year, members, including me, spoke about the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill, which is now an act of Parliament. The key aim of the bill was to ensure that people with disabilities could be supported to lead a normal life and to participate fully in society by having a greater say in planning for their care and a greater choice in the support that is available to them, so that care could be tailored to meet their individual needs.</p><p>To achieve that, the Government and the statutory sector need to work together with the third sector to provide the tools and support that people with MS and other long-term conditions&#8212;and, importantly, their carers&#8212;require to manage their lives. I would be interested to find out about how self-directed support is working so far and the benefits that it is bringing to individuals who live with MS.</p><p>Once again, I thank George Adam for leading this important debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690004", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis Week 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank George Adam for initiating what has become an annual debate during MS week, and I congratulate the Multiple Sclerosis Society on its excellent report on MS services across Scotland and the UK, which resulted from the &#8220;My MS, My Needs&#8221; survey that it carried out last year.

Granny was fondly described as a bit &#8220;dottled&#8221;.

That included making copious amounts of tea and snacks for the many visits from her large family, most of whom were quite content to sit and chat and leave mum to do all the work.</p><p>All of that was against a background of very little sleep, because granny regularly got up at night to collect her young laddies from school.

I do not remember where dad slept, but probably on a sofa in the living room&#8212;all that for two whole years.</p><p>In those days, there was no recognition of carers and no organisation to give support or advice, just the occasional chastisement of some family members by the general practitioner, who recognised that my mother&#8217;s own health was suffering from hard work, sleeplessness and lack of practical support.</p><p>Thankfully, things are improving for carers, but there are still many people in Scotland who look after loved ones with dementia without recognition or proper support. That is why projects such as dementia carers&#8217; voices are so important because they raise awareness of the impact of dementia on the families affected by it and of the difficult but vital role played by the carers of the 86,000 people currently living with dementia. That figure is already up from 72,000 two years ago, and it is set to double over the next 25 years as the population gets older.</p><p>The unremitting commitment by Alzheimer Scotland and the cross-party group led by Irene Oldfather when she was an MSP to help people with dementia and their carers led to the development of a charter of rights for those people, which was followed by the dementia strategy published by the Scottish Government in 2010. That recognised the need for quality support and information to be made available immediately after diagnosis, for better understanding of dementia by health and social care professionals in both hospital and community settings, and for better planning for discharge back into the community aimed at delaying the need for residential care through improved home care and support.</p><p>As we all know from our work locally, three years on there are still many people who do not receive the community support that they need and are entitled to, with delayed assessments and unreliable provision of home care. We all hope that the developing integration of adult health and social care will improve the situation for those not adequately provided for.</p><p>The efforts of Tommy Whitelaw, following the death of his mother from dementia, have built up a large body of evidence from people who have cared for relatives with dementia, illustrating the problems that they have faced&#8212;from isolation and the emotional rollercoaster of the caring experience, to health, housing and financial worries. His work has led to a recognition of the importance of the voice of the carer to inform future service provision and to empower carers. Like Jackie Baillie, I sincerely congratulate him.</p><p>If the project leads to a better understanding of dementia and its related issues among health and social care professionals, an increased awareness of carer rights, better support and information on sources of help, and less isolation of carers, it will have been very worth while indeed.

Across the chamber, we have become positive&#8212;perhaps even optimistic&#8212;about the potential of autistic people to live independent lives, based on respect for their different outlook, and on recognition of the support that they require. It is worth taking a little time to reflect on that cultural shift, because taken beyond autism it shows a belief in the centrality of the individual. The same approach has inspired work in Parliament on self-directed support and&#8212;even more broadly&#8212;in personalisation of public services.</p><p>We now also clearly acknowledge the enormous variation in the symptoms of autism among individuals, which is an important basis for greater understanding of the condition. We are no longer trying to shoehorn autistic people into our own standards of normality or&#8212;which was even worse&#8212;carrying out the invidious practices of mass institutionalisation or segregation of autistic people from society. However, we should not forget that it was not always so, and that in many countries around the world&#8212;even developed ones&#8212;approaches that we in Scotland have relegated to the past are still accepted.</p><p>Living an independent life will not always be possible for every person with autism, but there is little doubt that improvements can be made. Independent living will certainly be one of the barometers against which Government policy in this area is measured.</p><p>The number of people with autistic spectrum disorder who are currently in employment is one part of the mix that can be looked at, and I am attracted by the proposals for an autism employment ambassador. The barriers to employment that are mentioned in the report are particularly striking. Given that more than a third of participants clearly identified inequitable treatment in the workplace, in addition to the other challenges that they face, it is not difficult to see how a person&#8217;s self-esteem can drop or their feelings of isolation increase, driving them away from employment.</p><p>I am pleased that the National Autistic Society encourages us to believe that there can be real policy-driven change in this area. We can take heart from how much difference national approaches have made in education for people with autism in a relatively short time.</p><p>A modern and recognisable understanding of the needs of young people with autism crystallised only in the 1970s. Countries such as Sweden that have adapted their approaches accordingly have seen high numbers of autistic children educated in the school environment. In others, however, autistic children still do not have the support to meet their school and education needs. Although in Scotland there has been significant progress in early diagnosis and support for children with autism, we heard this morning that many adults on the spectrum remain undiagnosed and without the help and support that they need.</p><p>A successful outcome for people with autism&#8212;whether they are children or adults&#8212;will be underpinned by how effectively support is provided. What we stand to gain will be measured in improvements to quality of life, but it can also be analysed in economic terms by what has been called the invest-to-save agenda.</p><p>Much has been written about the possible advantages of microsegmentation of the autistic population, which involves recognising and adapting to the different categories, abilities and challenges that are part of this very individual condition. There is a great deal of promise in that method of tailoring services and in the possibility of driving forward the personalisation agenda in that way. There is still much to do to demonstrate the practicalities of wider implementation of the approach. It is welcome that the autism spectrum disorder reference group has taken forward the research seriously.</p><p>We must work towards bringing together changed attitudes and improved and better-directed support across all levels of public service, in order to identify the particular needs that arise from the individual challenges that autism presents.

It is another milestone along the journey towards achieving better integration of adult health and social care, and I look forward to seeing the Government&#8217;s legislative proposals to assist in the process when its bill is introduced in Parliament in the near future.</p><p>From the evidence that was taken by the Health and Sport Committee ahead of the Government&#8217;s consultation, the responses to the consultation and the Government&#8217;s response to them, the unanimous view is that the focus must be on achieving better outcomes for people who require health and social care services by improving the quality and consistency of the care that they receive to support them in their daily lives and enabling them to live as full a life as possible within their capabilities, whatever their age.</p><p>Although the legislation will be restricted to the integration of health and social care for adults, those who responded to the consultation demanded that the legislation be extended to children&#8217;s services, and to a broader range of services, such as housing provision.</p><p>The Government justifies its stance by stating the view that health boards and councils are best placed to make decisions on service integration for children. We have seen that in Highland, where the NHS is providing services for adults, and the council is looking after children&#8217;s services. With regard to other services, the Government&#8217;s view is that, because many joint and collaborative services work well and can be left to local partners to work out, it sees no need to legislate for the integration of services such as housing, whereas there is an immediate need to address the health and social care needs of people with multiple support needs. I agree. It is often the case that people do not get the joined-up care that they need to keep them safe and well in their homes for as long as possible.</p><p>As was pointed out in one of the briefing papers for members, by proactively embracing the role of housing in developing integrated housing and care services, both central Government and local authorities could make substantial savings in the long run without compromising on quality. That is a fair point, given the demographics of an increasing number of elderly people with multiple physical problems and increasingly complex care needs because that will inevitably lead to growing demand during the next decade for very sheltered housing and extra-care housing.</p><p>There is broad support for the Government&#8217;s proposals to base its reforms on nationally agreed outcomes, with locally determined priorities. Local circumstances vary widely and must be considered in the planning of integrated local services. Circumstances also change over time and, to be meaningful, there must be scope for both nationally agreed outcomes and local priorities to evolve, while assuming that the focus will be on the wellbeing and independence of service users, giving them control over their lives.</p><p>A barrier to integration&#8212;it has been hinted at this afternoon&#8212;has been the cultural differences between health professionals and social workers, illustrated by segregated training, rivalries between the two groups and a perception of medical dominance. If integration is to proceed successfully, ingrained organisational cultures must be overcome. The Government&#8217;s view is that by placing a statutory duty on health boards and local authorities to work together, and in collaboration with key stakeholders, it will ensure that competing rivalries and difficulties can be overcome. I hope that that will be the case, because I do not see how health and social care integration will work without such cultural change. The consultees feel, nonetheless, that there should be a mechanism in place to resolve disputes, should they arise.</p><p>On the composition of the health and social care partnerships and the Government&#8217;s proposal to legislate for HSCPs to include a single health board and one local authority, there was some demand for partnerships to include more than one council, where appropriate. For example, the British Medical Association&#8217;s view is that that facility must be in place if integration is to be successful.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

There is no doubt that, during that time, waiting times have improved significantly so that now, following adoption of the 18-week referral to treatment standard at the end of 2011, patients rightly expect that they should have hospital treatment within 18 weeks of referral from their GP.</p><p>Waiting time reductions are of course welcome, because no one wants to wait any longer than is necessary for treatment. However, waiting times are not the only indicators of good healthcare. Patient outcomes, readmission rates and healthcare associated infection rates are equally, if not more, important in assessing NHS performance. In recent years, the key focus on waiting times has meant that increasingly demanding targets set by Government have been met only because of very hard work by a dedicated and conscientious NHS workforce, who are under constant pressure from management who in turn answer to their political masters.</p><p>There has undoubtedly been a loss of morale among hard-pressed hospital staff, and anecdotes abound&#8212;from staff and patients&#8212;about the manipulation of waiting lists. The BMA&#8217;s briefing for today&#8217;s debate quotes the general surgical staff who, when interviewed in November 2010 for the independent report on NHS Lothian, said:</p><p>&#8220;If we are about to breach we have to cancel in patient scans in favour of outpatients in patients are usually more urgent but the target gets priority every time&#8221;.</p><p>I have heard more than once of management dropping a major case from an operating list that has been drawn up by a surgeon and replacing it with several more minor procedures to assist in meeting a target.</p><p>Staff and patients have previously raised concerns about such behaviour, but until now health boards did not have effective whistleblowing policies that allowed people to raise their concerns safely and in the knowledge that they would be acted on. I know that I am not alone in welcoming this year&#8217;s pilot of a national confidential phoneline. It is a pity that that was not in place sooner.</p><p>What happened in Lothian is of course scandalous, and NHS Tayside&#8217;s inappropriate use of unavailability codes is unacceptable. Although it is reassuring that Audit Scotland&#8217;s recent report did not find any widespread manipulation of waiting times across Scotland, it is nonetheless concerning that social unavailability codes were used by many NHS boards with inadequate controls and audit trails and limited information in patient records. It is therefore impossible to determine whether the inappropriate use of the codes was due to human error, inconsistent interpretation of guidance or deliberate manipulation of waiting lists.</p><p>Due to inadequate scrutiny of the mounting number of patients recorded as unavailable for treatment because of that focus on meeting targets, the attempts to improve capacity in areas where parents were waiting longer resulted&#8212;to paraphrase Audit Scotland&#8217;s report&#8212;in a failure by both Government and health boards to see the broader picture of the pressures that were building up in the system around the capacity of NHS boards to meet the waiting times targets. I hope that lessons will be learned from recent sorry events. Audit Scotland&#8217;s recommendations to the Government, to NHS boards and their non-executive directors and to the Information Services Division must be carried out, in the interests of patients and NHS staff.</p><p>With regard to A and E services, since 2009 the number of patients assessed and admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours of arrival has dropped from the then target of 98 per cent to 90.3 per cent last December. That is not acceptable, but I am not convinced that the solution should be to lower that target to 95 per cent, as the Government has done without telling Parliament. However, I welcome the increase in the number of A and E consultants and the proposed &#163;50 million unscheduled care action plan, which I hope will go some way towards giving A and E patients the prompt diagnosis and care that they deserve in a 21st century NHS.</p><p>Recent history has borne out what the BMA and the clinicians that it represents&#8212;and, to be fair, my party&#8212;have been saying for years to the previous coalition Governments and the current SNP Administration: that clinical priorities can be skewed by pressure to achieve centrally driven targets.

The irreversible collapse of a relationship can sometimes lead to great bitterness in one or both of the partners. Children can become pawns in custody battles; access rights can be denied; and children suffer because they do not get to see one or other of their parents. Sadly, it is the father who all too often loses out.</p><p>Few of us in the chamber could have failed to be moved by the briefing paper from Families Need Fathers Scotland, which was set up to help, support and provide advice to parents of either sex.

Those are just a few examples, but I am sure that many in the chamber will have similar stories, some from personal experience.</p><p>The motion refers to the national parenting strategy, the aim of which is to champion the importance of parenting</p><p>&#8220;by strengthening the support on offer to parents and by making it easier to access that support&#8221;.</p><p>The emphasis on the father&#8217;s role in nurturing children is significant because too often it is perceived as being less than that of the mother. I pay tribute to the Scottish Government for its pledged financial support to improve access to information.</p><p>As the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s inquiry into teenage pregnancy has progressed, I have become aware of how easy it is to focus on a young mum and her baby and to forget the important contribution that a young father can make to his child&#8217;s early wellbeing, whether or not his relationship with the mother continues. I am therefore encouraged by the evidence that we have received on projects for teenage mums that also seek to involve the fathers and by the commitment of those dads who wish to actively participate in their child&#8217;s development and progress.</p><p>Grandparents can make an enormous contribution to a child&#8217;s healthy development but, sadly, when partnerships split up they are often sidelined and kept away from their grandchildren. I have a lot of sympathy for groups such as Grandparent Rights that campaign for greater access and which remind us of the devastating impact that family breakdowns can have on children.</p><p>A very serious issue has been given the much-needed oxygen of publicity in this debate and I once again pay tribute to John Mason and Families Need Fathers Scotland for all their work in this field.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families Need Fathers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the debate and am grateful to John Mason for bringing it to the chamber this evening.

He had found the procedure obscure and difficult to navigate, and in his state of health that was extremely stressful and upsetting. He brought the petition to Parliament to try to ensure that a better process would be put in place for future patients, so that they would not have to undergo the traumas that he experienced.</p><p>In the end, Mr Gray was allowed his cetuximab under the NHS, and, indeed, he was reimbursed for the significant costs that he had previously faced up to. Sadly he did not live to see the results of his petition, but his wife, Tina McGeever, worked tirelessly alongside the committee to secure the new IPTR procedure, which was put in place by the then health secretary to make it easier for patients to access modern non-formulary cancer drugs that had been recommended by their clinicians as being likely to extend and to benefit their quality of life.</p><p>Everyone was hopeful that future cancer patients would experience a simplified, transparent procedure across Scotland that would allow fair access to modern cancer medicines when their clinicians felt that they were justified.

I know that Tina McGeever and many of us here were very concerned to learn that Christine Grahame&#8217;s constituent, Ian Morrison, is currently having a very similar experience to Mike Gray and is having to fund cetuximab treatment himself.

However, that is a fact of life that we should not ignore. I, for one, am grateful to my colleague Mary Scanlon, who consistently keeps mental health issues in her consciousness during her daily work as an MSP. She has done a great deal to raise awareness of the difficulties that are faced by those who are trying to cope with depression and other mental health problems by bringing such matters to the attention of Parliament on many occasions since 1999. I look forward to hearing her comments on the mental health strategy later in the debate.</p><p>Organisations that deal with mental health issues, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists and SAMH&#8212;the Scottish charity that does such a lot to promote the interests of sufferers and to raise the profile of mental health issues&#8212;have also worked tirelessly to encourage Government to improve psychiatric services and to move mental health into the mainstream of health planning. The publication of the Scottish Government&#8217;s mental health strategy for the period between 2012 and 2015, which builds on the strategies in &#8220;Delivering for Mental Health&#8221; and &#8220;Towards a Mentally Flourishing Scotland&#8221;, has been widely welcomed, and its implementation is eagerly awaited.</p><p>The strategy&#8217;s seven themes, 36 commitments and four key change areas make very interesting reading and are to be commended but, as SAMH said in its helpful briefing for the debate and as Richard Simpson emphasised, the strategy runs only until 2015. An action plan for its completion is therefore clearly needed and a timetable needs to be in place for achieving its commitments. There is no doubt that significant progress has been made in recent years in improving mental health services and in reducing suicide, although every day two people in Scotland still die from suicide, which emphasises the urgent need for effective and properly resourced crisis services within communities across the country.</p><p>Clearly, in a six-minute speech it is not possible to deal in detail with what is a comprehensive strategy document, but I will touch on the four key changes identified in the strategy, starting with child and adolescent mental health.</p><p>It is now recognised that experience in the very early years of life has an enormous influence on later behaviour and that poor parenting at this time can result in major problems throughout life, so the priority that is given in the strategy to the early years and the focus on early intervention are welcome, along with the commitments to make infant mental health training more widely available to children&#8217;s services professionals and to increase the number of child psychotherapist trainees from this year. That should help to address the problems for children where aggression, non-compliance and emotional issues are likely to persist to cause school disruption, family stress and dysfunction and mental health problems, which we know can result in social isolation, drug and alcohol abuse and failure to gain employment, as well as, eventually, crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682576", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For those of us who lead busy lives and who have little direct contact with mental health services or with people who are dealing with mental health problems, it is sometimes easy to forget that one in four of us will experience mental illness at some point in our lives.

As the chief medical officer told the Health and Sport Committee just this week, most of the serious behavioural and mental health problems that affect young adults can be traced back to the first few years of life. The problems are complex, and solving them will require the co-ordinated efforts of the NHS, local authorities and charities and other third sector providers. Access to child and adolescent mental health services has taken far too long in many parts of Scotland. Although the waiting times target is still too long at 26 weeks, it is welcome, as is the plan to reduce it to 14 weeks from next year.</p><p>The second proposed change is to rethink how we respond to common mental health problems such as the impact of excessive alcohol consumption, debt, trauma and distress. There is a commitment to identify the challenges and opportunities that are linked to the mental health of older people, notably in relation to depression, which looks set to become a serious and increasing problem in the next few years of rapid increase in the elderly population. Allied to that, of course, is dementia, and we look forward to the updated dementia strategy that was promised for later this year.</p><p>There is to be more focus on personal involvement in improving mental health and a drive to encourage more people to become physically active, because research has shown a clear benefit to all health, including mental health, from regular and sustained physical activity. Other areas for action include the continuing movement from in-patient to community-based services, which is proven to reduce admissions and readmissions, and the commitment to carry out an audit of those who use in-patient services and the reasons why they do so, which will, I hope, result in further progress in that area.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s work on armed forces veterans is increasingly important as more of them return to the community from arenas such as Afghanistan and face the difficulties of integrating into civilian life after the ordered life of the forces.

Similarly, people still often associate leprosy with the leper colonies that emerged in the middle ages, when the prevailing thinking was that the condition&#8212;which actually covered a multitude of ailments&#8212;was highly contagious so it was better to ship people off to remote locations in the mountains or on islands than to risk infection.</p><p>Of course, we in Scotland do not talk about leper colonies these days, but it may interest members to know that, as a young medical student nearly 50 years ago, on a public health scholarship to Yugoslavia I visited what was then called the leper hospital in Sarajevo. Thankfully, that was the only time that I have seen patients suffering from the effects of leprosy.</p><p>Obviously, what we might term biblical or medieval leprosy is far removed from the modern condition, but leprosy is not yet a disease of the past, as we have heard this evening. What is now known as Hansen&#8217;s disease still affects the lives of at least 3 million people worldwide. That is probably a very conservative estimate if we consider how difficult it is to obtain accurate and reliable data from some of the less well developed countries. The stark fact is that, should this debate last 40 minutes, in that time 20 people will have been diagnosed as suffering from leprosy.</p><p>The motion rightly points to the work of the Leprosy Mission Scotland&#8212;an organisation with strong Celtic roots stretching back over a century&#8212;in tackling the stigma associated with people suffering from leprosy. These days, the term &#8220;leper&#8221; is rarely used for obvious reasons, given its connotations with outcasts. People suffering from leprosy should never be considered as outcasts. I note that the mission&#8217;s delete the L word campaign has gone some way towards persuading broadcasters that &#8220;leper&#8221; is now regarded as an offensive term.</p><p>Breaking the mindset, often fuelled by fear and ignorance, that leprosy sufferers somehow pose a danger to society is at the forefront of the mission&#8217;s aims and objectives. The sad fact is that in certain countries obstacles still remain for people diagnosed with the condition: sufferers are unable to use public transport; children are denied their education; splits occur in families if a wife is diagnosed or a child with leprosy is rejected; and employment is hard to find because of a misplaced fear of infection.</p><p>The Leprosy Mission Scotland is an organisation dedicated to eradicating the condition in many countries across Africa, south Asia and south-east Asia through various programmes, including treatment and general healthcare, prevention of disability by teaching people self-care and hospital treatment in clean environments where ulcers are treated, surgeries are undertaken and intensive physiotherapy sessions take place. Community rehabilitation is an important aspect, too.</p><p>The work of the Leprosy Mission Scotland is driven by Gospel teaching, compassion and prayer. The 4,000 individuals in 350 churches and groups in Scotland who give up their time for efforts to eradicate leprosy are an example to us all of the true meaning of voluntary service.</p><p>Although the Leprosy Mission Scotland is based in Stirling, its work is carried out across the country. As a North East Scotland MSP, I was interested to learn of the work of the mission&#8217;s Aberdeen area committee. Through coffee mornings and events in local churches, the Aberdeen area has raised more than &#163;60,000 since the late 1990s for leprosy projects across the world, with the most recent work being in Angola.</p><p>For this Sunday&#8217;s world leprosy day, perhaps the message that we should keep at the forefront of our minds is that leprosy is and remains a 21st century problem.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682419", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Leprosy Mission Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the debate and congratulate Bruce Crawford on bringing the issue to the chamber this evening.

However, as the chairman of Glasgow 2014 said in response to the CGF report, we can be confident but not complacent at this stage, as there is still a great deal of work to be done.</p><p>No venture as big as the Commonwealth games or the Olympic games can be accomplished without some difficulties or mistakes along the way, so I am pleased that the motion notes that relevant lessons from this year&#8217;s Olympic and Paralympic games will be incorporated into the planning for Glasgow 2014. The minister&#8217;s statement this afternoon about the need for enhanced security arrangements and the Government&#8217;s response show that lessons have indeed been learned from the experience gained at London 2012.</p><p>I am grateful to the minister for giving notice to Opposition spokesmen that she would make a significant statement regarding plans for security arrangements for the games. I am reassured that they are being put in place early, because we certainly would not want to be faced with the last-minute worries regarding security that the organisers of the Olympic games in London had to deal with.</p><p>I know that there have been concerns about the adequacy of the proposed budget for security, but I think that the minister&#8217;s statement on that and the revised governance arrangements, with oversight of security being in the hands of the chief constable for the police service of Scotland, will give significant comfort to those who were previously concerned. However, I agree with Patricia Ferguson that parliamentary scrutiny, too, will be increasingly important in the months ahead as we approach the games, particularly given the increased costs announced this afternoon.</p><p>As we near the end of this spectacularly successful year for British sport and as we remember the outstanding achievements of the many Scots who won medals in the Olympic games, Andy Murray&#8217;s first grand slam victory for the UK in 76 years and Paul Lawrie&#8217;s highest winning margin in the Ryder cup at Medinah, we now have to look to and beyond 2014 as the opportunity to achieve a sustainable sporting legacy for Scotland that will transform the culture of sport in this country.</p><p>As members will know, the Health and Sport Committee has recently completed an inquiry into support for community sport, the report of which will be published early next year. A key part of that inquiry focused on how to involve more people in physical and sporting activity, starting with the young and continuing throughout life, in an effort to improve the health and physical and mental wellbeing of a nation that has a great deal to overcome with regard to obesity, long-term health conditions and significant health inequalities across the country.</p><p>As part of our inquiry, the committee visited a number of exciting new sports venues in different parts of Scotland. Just before they opened to the public, we saw the fantastic Emirates sports arena, including the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome, in the absolutely transformed east end of Glasgow, and we visited the games village, which we heard will be adapted into a mix of affordable and social housing, with some more expensive private residential areas, together with a care home in the midst of the community.</p><p>At Commonwealth house we heard about the Tollcross international swimming centre and the Glasgow Green national hockey centre, which are both on target to be opened next year, and the plans for Commonwealth house itself to become state-of-the-art offices, right in the heart of the city.</p><p>Some members of our committee visited facilities at Cumbernauld, and I was one who went to the Aberdeen Sports Village. We saw how well used that magnificent facility is by people of all ages, and we heard about the progress of the new Olympic-sized swimming pool, which is on schedule to be opened early in 2014 and which, it is hoped, Commonwealth athletes will use for training.</p><p>Those facilities are of enormous importance to Scotland and in reality they are long overdue. However, as local people in Aberdeen pointed out to us, although those venues are fantastic for those who can access them, for the majority who cannot&#8212;for whatever reason&#8212;there is still a serious lack of good locally accessible facilities to encourage people into physical activity and sport. As Liz McColgan said in evidence to the committee, the facilities she trained on when she was an aspiring Olympic athlete without proper running shoes are still the same now, all these years later.</p><p>That is why plans to open up the school estate to local communities and to utilise other public and community owned facilities as community sports hubs are so important. One witness said that he would like to see a community sports hub in every secondary school. That is why we should listen to the Scottish Sports Association, whose vision is for better use to be made of existing sports facilities, including our natural environment.</p><p>I do not propose to deal with the cultural programme that is being organised alongside the games, except to say that it will be of enormous importance in presenting our magnificent cultural assets and heritage to the many British and foreign people who will be visiting Scotland and Glasgow for the first, and hopefully not the last, time.</p><p>Another key focus of the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s inquiry was on volunteering, which has been described as the lifeblood of sport in this country, and the need to attract more volunteers into sport, particularly from the more deprived communities, and to give them better training so that they can gain confidence in their role.</p><p>I would like to say more about volunteering in sport as a legacy of Glasgow 2014, but I will leave that to my closing speech.

I acknowledge the open and enthusiastic way in which David Grevemberg and his team have responded to our questions and our desire to keep abreast of their activities. The &#8220;Elected Members Newsletter&#8221; produced by Glasgow 2014 is particularly useful in updating us on progress, and I look forward to receiving regular updates as we head closer to the games.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government has heeded warnings about possible security issues surrounding the games and has taken early and appropriate action to deal with them. I hope that there will be no other serious concerns of that kind in the run-up to the games. However, I also hope that we will have the opportunity to consider the evolving plans for 2014 fairly regularly in the Parliament, with full discussion of the relevant issues as they arise.</p><p>We all hope, of course, that Glasgow 2014 will be the best-ever Commonwealth games. From what I have seen and heard so far, I think that there is the determination and expertise to follow the example of, and learn lessons from, this year&#8217;s spectacularly successful Olympic games&#8212;on a smaller scale of course, but with the same potential for success. However, as many speakers have said, even more important than the event itself will be the long-term legacy from the 2014 games, on which aspect many such events have failed in the past. The physical legacy is already taking shape in the regeneration of the east end of Glasgow and the development of major new or refurbished facilities, many of which are already used by the public and which I dealt with in my opening speech.</p><p>To my mind, however, the most important legacy that we must aspire to is to transform the culture of sport and physical activity in Scotland. I fully endorse the vision of the Scottish Sports Association that all children have the right to be physically literate and that their early education should help them to become regular participants in sport and physical activity by teaching them how to run, jump, throw, catch and swim, building up in early life the skills and confidence that will help them to reap the health and other benefits of being physically active throughout life. Regular high-quality PE for children of all abilities is key to achieving that skills standard and a culture of regular participation in sport and physical activity. In that regard, although progress is being made towards the provision of two hours or two periods of PE per week for children, more still needs to be done.</p><p>Many speakers have emphasised the importance of volunteering to sport, and I will say a bit more about that in terms of achieving a worthy legacy from Glasgow 2014. During the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s recent inquiry into community sport provision, witness after witness stressed the importance of volunteers to every sport, referring to them again and again as the lifeblood of sporting activity, without whom many sports clubs simply would not survive. From making the tea, washing strips after games, raising funds, keeping the books, arranging the fixtures and otherwise helping to organise club activities and social events, to coaching club members in the skills that they require to improve their performance in their chosen sport, volunteers are essential and there are not enough of them.</p><p>There are barriers faced by people who might think about volunteering. Many people think that they do not have the skills or time to become involved. Others would do so if they were asked, but they need to be assured of an enjoyable experience and they need to be assisted with the form filling around disclosure if they are to work with children, because many will fight shy of bureaucracy.</p><p>People need to be given training if they are to develop in their role as volunteers. In her evidence to the committee, Judy Murray spoke of the attraction of an inexperienced coach learning from an expert, as an apprentice, and developing skills that they might not otherwise aspire to and an enthusiasm that could be lasting and catching.</p><p>Employers could help greatly, for example by giving employees the flexibility to have regular time off at the end of a day&#8212;say once a week&#8212;that they could make up on another day, and I have no doubt that there are other imaginative ways of encouraging and retaining volunteers.</p><p>The London Olympics could not have been successful without its army of volunteers, and the 15,000 volunteers currently being sought for the Commonwealth games in Glasgow will be equally important. If those many willing people can be kept interested after the games are over and welcomed as volunteers in their own communities, that will be to the lasting benefit of Scottish sport and a very fitting legacy of a successful Commonwealth games. I am pleased that thought is being given to that by the games organisers.</p><p>There have been some excellent speeches in the debate, but I was particularly impressed by the many pertinent points that Alison Johnstone made about involvement in sport, particularly by women, support for athletes and the availability and use of facilities.</p><p>I will conclude by quoting from the SSA&#8217;s summary at the end of its excellent briefing for this debate:</p><p>&#8220;With the excitement of 2014 almost on our doorstep, the time to recognise the unique role and contribution of sport is now. It is time ... to support sport as Scotland&#8217;s greatest social movement, and to commit to prioritising those actions which will leave a lasting legacy for Scottish sport. These legacy opportunities are crucial to the infrastructure and delivery of sport in Scotland, and would result in a true legacy from the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, not just for sport in Scotland, but for an improved Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>I hope and think that we are on track to achieve the ambition of the Commonwealth games partners to deliver a safe, secure and successful event in 2014, and I look forward to further progress reports as we get closer to that date.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate, which has brought us up to speed with the progress being made in preparing for what we all hope will be a highly successful Commonwealth games in 2014.

There can be nothing worse than learning before term or very soon afterwards that a baby is suffering from a disorder that will result in either stillbirth or death within weeks of birth. Fortunately, such situations are relatively rare, but for the one in 6,000 foetuses with trisomy 18&#8212;or Edwards syndrome&#8212;and their parents, that is the very bleak outlook.</p><p>I admit that I did not know about Edwards syndrome until I researched it prior to the debate, although it is the second most common such genetic disorder after Down&#8217;s syndrome, with which we are all much more familiar. Edwards syndrome has devastating consequences, with up to 95 per cent of affected foetuses dying before birth. The few&#8212;mainly female&#8212;who survive to be born show low birth weight and fairly typical abnormalities of head and face, and other skeletal abnormalities as well as congenital heart defects and a multiplicity of other serious physical problems.</p><p>To learn that one is carrying such a baby must be devastating news, and we can only begin to imagine how parents can face up to it. It is clear that there is a need for support&#8212;not just in coming to terms with the awful prognosis, but to be able to look after the baby if it is born alive, and at the same time to prepare for losing it just a few weeks after bonding with the new arrival. A third of the babies who are born alive will die within a month because of medical problems. Indeed, only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of babies with full Edwards syndrome will survive beyond a year, and they will live with severe disabilities.</p><p>The few people who have lesser forms&#8212;which are known as the mosaic and partial forms&#8212;of trisomy 18 may well survive into adult life, but they are few in number. For most, sadly, the outlook is very bleak, and support is needed in providing palliative care for the baby and in sustaining the family physically and emotionally.</p><p>I pay tribute, as other members have, to Caoimhe&#8217;s parents, who have set up a trust for Edwards syndrome in her name. I do not think that anyone could read Caoimhe&#8217;s story, as presented on the trust&#8217;s website, with a dry eye. It talks about the heartbreak of learning the diagnosis pre-birth, together with the depressing prognosis for the condition; getting to know and love a little baby girl while facing the certainty of her premature death and the uncertainty of when that would be; the ups and downs and serious illnesses of her short life; and the early celebration of a Christmas that she would never see. All those things are heart-rending.</p><p>Many parents in such a situation would withdraw from the world and grieve in private, but Caoimhe&#8217;s parents, as we have heard, decided to share their experience with others and set up a trust with the aim of helping future parents in the same situation to get the support that they need. In my opinion, that was an extremely brave thing to do. I wish them well in their efforts, and if they succeed in helping&#8212;even a little&#8212;to ease the burden for families who are affected by Edwards syndrome in the future, they will have established a very fitting legacy for their little daughter.</p><p>I am not aware of what care and support is currently available in Scotland for people who are affected not only by Edwards syndrome but by stillbirth or early bereavement for any reason. However, it is obvious that there is a need for bereavement services for such families, and for a care plan for delivering care and support to affected children and their families all the way from diagnosis through to the end of life and bereavement.</p><p>I am encouraged to hear from Richard Baker that there are plans for a pathway of support to be developed. I look forward to hearing from the minister about the services that are available, and whether there are plans to improve such services in the future.

It sounds like a worthwhile initiative.</p><p>It is estimated that about 50,000 people in Scotland&#8212;one in every 100&#8212;have autism. Incidence is quite high in the north-east, where around 6,000 people are affected. The number is rising in Scotland as more people are recognised as having the disorder. Early diagnosis and therapeutic and educational interventions are needed to help people and their families and carers, so it is sad that there is still a lack of awareness among professionals and that services remain patchy.</p><p>As Mark McDonald just highlighted, a number of recent innovations have helped people with autism. The new transitions project, which was launched in the north-east in autumn, has the aim of supporting and preparing secondary 3 and S4 pupils with autism for moving on from secondary education. I am sure that we all acknowledge that leaving school can be difficult and traumatic for any youngster; the situation is exacerbated for a young person with autism.</p><p>The project is a joint venture between National Autistic Society Scotland and Inspire (Partnership Through Life), a local charity that works with people who have learning disabilities. It offers to young people with autism in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire specially designed modules, which focus on strategies for coping with anxiety and anger, employment options, behavioural problems and, perhaps most significant, the development of social skills, which is a challenge for a young individual with autism.</p><p>I have no doubt that the autism alert card will also help people as they move beyond school and into adult situations. I very much welcome the initiative in Grampian, which potentially will increase the safety of people with autism. The pioneering approach, which NAS Scotland described as a breakthrough for Grampian, strengthens the links between people with the condition and Grampian Police and other stakeholders. The card gives details of a personal contact in case the person encounters difficulty, for example if they become anxious on public transport or in a shop, or during sporting activities such as swimming. More important, it provides a massive degree of support for the individual with autism in that it helps the police to understand that the reason for what could be perceived as erratic behaviour is that the person has autism. That is a great step towards achieving a better understanding and awareness of the condition.</p><p>As I have done in previous debates, I pay enormous tribute to NAS Scotland as not only a leading charity in its field but one of the most vocal and active charities in Scotland.

From its centre in Glasgow, Bobath Scotland has helped young people with cerebral palsy to develop the skills that they need to live a full life. It has done so by involving the whole family and the extended support network and by bringing together specialists in occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy with community therapy teams to support on-going work with young people at home and in the community. As a result of that co-ordinated approach, there is a can-do attitude, which helps parents to focus on what their children can achieve rather than the negative side of what they cannot do. That is of enormous help to those who are faced with the day-to-day problems of attaining achievable goals for their loved ones.</p><p>I confess that I had never heard of Bobath Scotland before it came to Parliament, but Stephanie Fraser and her colleagues ensured that we knew about it whenever we went near their stall in the members&#8217; lobby. At the garden lobby reception on the Thursday evening, it was a privilege to meet and speak to families who have benefited from Bobath&#8217;s work for their children.</p><p>Bringing together the various allied health professionals who can help those affected to develop their skills and reach their maximum potential seems such a simple concept, but it is not always easy to treat people holistically within the NHS. Specialists operate within their own silos; each does excellent work, but they sometimes achieve less for their patients than they could achieve by working together.</p><p>When Bobath Scotland was first set up&#8212;the centre was then and is now the only one of its kind in Scotland&#8212;north-east children would travel to Glasgow for therapy. Clearly, that was not ideal and satellite outreach clinics were planned for the north-east&#8212;which, of course, I represent&#8212;but unfortunately, those clinics did not come about, and communication with the Glasgow centre gradually broke down over the years. Therefore, I was very pleased to learn from Stephanie Fraser that efforts are now under way again to strengthen links with therapists in the north-east and explore potential ways of working together.</p><p>The meetings between Bobath and therapists in Aberdeen and Elgin this summer were very productive. An introductory Bobath course took place in the north-east. It started with a study day in Aberdeen on &#8220;The Therapeutic Use of Play When Treating Children with Cerebral Palsy&#8221; and was followed by master classes in Aberdeen and Elgin that included the theory of eating and drinking, hand use and postural control. Demonstration treatments of children were identified by the local therapists.</p><p>That outreach work was supported financially by the R S Macdonald Charitable Trust and the MacRobert Trust. It was viewed a bit sceptically at first, but in fact it generated very positive feedback. The local Bobath-trained AHPs said that they thought that working together during the study days and master classes to solve problems and having the time to think and talk through clinical issues were very valuable and relevant to all their disciplines of occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech and language therapy. Unfortunately, time is limited for such multidisciplinary clinical management of cases, but with Bobath support and the possibility of involving classroom assistants in future outreach sessions, such collaborative management could be undertaken more widely. There was real enthusiasm for further outreach visits to both Aberdeen and Elgin next spring.</p><p>Bobath Scotland hopes that the success of that approach in the north-east could be used as a blueprint for other areas, allowing Bobath to give local therapists support and training to work together to help people with cerebral palsy throughout Scotland.</p><p>Clearly, in these straitened times, funding is a problem but, given the determination and enthusiasm of Stephanie Fraser and her colleagues, I believe that Bobath Scotland will ultimately achieve its goals with, I hope, help from the Scottish Government.

I acknowledge the valuable input from the city council carers and users of social care services in Glasgow, whom we met during our informal visit to the city in the early stages of our information gathering, and I thank all the many witnesses who gave written and/or oral evidence to the committee.</p><p>I pay tribute to the various organisations and individuals who suggested at stages 2 and 3 amendments that they believed would strengthen and improve the bill, some of which will be included in the final version of the bill that we will vote on at 5.30.</p><p>The bill is popular and its general principles have been widely accepted throughout Scotland. It will introduce legislation that, if it is properly implemented, will embody the principles of independent living for everyone, giving all citizens the same freedom, choice, dignity and control in their lives at home, at work or in the community, and empowering those who use self-directed support to participate in society and live a full and ordinary life.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s essence is the intention that people should achieve true independent living, and the focus must be on what the system enables the individual to achieve, not on the system of support. There are high expectations that the bill will allow individuals who require social care to maintain a good quality of life and to fulfil their potential.</p><p>Today we have set out the framework, which will have to be fleshed out by guidance and regulation. The key to success will be how the bill&#8217;s provisions are implemented across local authority areas by councils and by independent and voluntary sector providers.</p><p>We heard as a committee that the changes that are required to ensure the policy&#8217;s success will be seismic. Some local authorities will be well prepared in areas such as creating individual budgets around packages, decommissioning group services and embedding the concept of self-directed support in their procedures. However, a culture change will be required, which some councils will find more difficult than others.</p><p>It will therefore be important to oversee the implementation of the policy and to impose sanctions on any councils that are deemed to be failing. There will be tensions, as a public sector that is used to providing services for users must accept that council-run facilities may not be what the user wants, and that, as an alternative marketing service develops, it must give more choice to service users. The commonly cited example is that facilities such as council-run day centres might wither on the vine if they are not what service users want and they therefore become financially unviable.</p><p>Undoubtedly, there are still concerns about the funding of social care packages. For example, where direct payments are made, they may attract less money, while those who opt for local authority provision of social care receive more. At a conference on taking the next steps in delivering self-directed support, which I attended last week, the local authority representatives were in no doubt that that happens in a number of council areas. They felt that the bill does not go far enough to put a stop to that, and I know that they will be disappointed that Richard Simpson&#8217;s amendments on that were not accepted by the Parliament today.</p><p>There are also concerns about the failure to include in the bill a right to independent advocacy, and I am not sure that the Government has that one right. Children&#8217;s welfare organisations, such as Barnardo&#8217;s and Children 1st, are concerned that the bill focuses much more on adults than on children, even though it will have a significant impact on the type and kind of services available to many children and their families. The children&#8217;s welfare organisations were particularly keen to ensure child protection and safeguarding by seeking a system of registration and regulation of those who might be working either directly with children or with adults who live with children under 16 in the home. That was one reason why I supported Jackie Baillie&#8217;s amendment on personal assistants, even though the amendment was not popular with a number of the disability groups.</p><p>I do not think that the bill is perfect&#8212;legislation never is&#8212;but I think that, overall, it will be of significant benefit to those who are assessed as requiring social care. Provided that self-directed support is perceived by councils not as a cost-cutting opportunity but as a chance to provide greater independence and a better quality of life to service users, I think that the bill will be warmly welcomed across Scotland. However, its implementation will need to be carefully monitored. With that, I can say that the Conservative group will vote for the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I place on record my thanks to the Health and Sport Committee clerks, the bill team and the Scottish Parliament information centre for their advice and support to committee members throughout the bill&#8217;s progress.

Not all those amendments were accepted, but they were given a fair hearing, and the Scottish Government appears confident that their aims can be satisfied within guidance and regulation.</p><p>There are high expectations that the bill will bring greater freedom, choice, dignity and control to individuals who require social care to maintain a good quality of life and to fulfil their potential. The system of direct payments that has been in force in recent years has not had in Scotland the success that was hoped for when it was introduced, with some local authorities preferring to continue with their traditional role of provision, rather than to free up users to purchase the care services that they feel would be best suited to their needs.</p><p>I remember when I was a councillor in Aberdeen that there was a degree of reluctance in the social work department to encourage the use of direct payments, and a slightly paternalistic attitude that the professionals knew best what was in the best interests of their clients. However, time moves on, and there is now a recognition that recipients of care know best what suits their lifestyle needs and that, with appropriate assistance, they can live a pretty normal life, earn a living, contribute to their local community and have a social life like other people. Whether that assistance is blow-drying their hair, which Pam Duncan of the independent living in Scotland project finds very useful, filling in job application forms or helping with bus travel, which Omar Haq&#8217;s personal assistant does for him, or even being an escort and companion at a football match, which was a commonly cited example, the freedom to purchase care that suits personal needs is supremely liberating for many people with assessed social care needs.</p><p>Achieving the goals of the bill will undoubtedly require a change in culture in our local authorities, and that will be difficult and will take some time. It will take more time for some councils than it will for those that have already set out on the road to freeing up their clients, but in the interests of the many people who would benefit from the provisions of the bill, it is important that those local authorities that are lagging behind catch up, and that the implementation of the legislation is carefully monitored.</p><p>As we have heard, there is an enthusiasm to make the bill achieve its goals&#8212;within councils and within the voluntary, private and third sectors&#8212;to try to secure genuine choice of provision for those who are assessed as requiring social care, as well as their carers and families.</p><p>Like other members of the Health and Sport Committee, I have enjoyed engaging with the many people who have shown an interest in the bill and I am full of admiration for how they have communicated freely and openly with committee members&#8212;particularly the service users and carers I mentioned previously who took the time to speak to us in Glasgow.</p><p>I am sure that there will be issues along the way as the legislation beds in but the will is there to make it work and I hope that we have strengthened the bill, to some extent at least, as it has gone through Parliament. I have felt from the outset that it will not reach its full potential until we have integration of health and social care in Scotland and I look forward to seeing the details of the proposed legislation on that.</p><p>I look forward to the bill being approved this evening, to its implementation in the months and years to come, and to the freedom of choice that it should make possible for all those who require social care.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a well-informed debate on a bill that has commanded widespread support across the country.

It teaches life-saving techniques to more than 20,000 people a year and it aids the public at thousands of events across the country. However, as the motion states, although some 20,000 people a year take part in first aid courses, there is still much more to be done to give people the knowledge and confidence that are required to administer effective emergency assistance when it is needed. In an emergency situation, it is critical that basic first aid is delivered with confidence.</p><p>As a parent and grandparent, I know that everyone dreads a serious injury to their child or grandchild, and basic first aid training can make a life-saving difference. I, too, had a frightening experience as a parent when one of my children, as a toddler, unbeknown to me, had put a golf tee into his mouth just before I laid him down to change a nappy. During the procedure, I became aware that his colour had gone off slightly, then I noticed that his chest was being pulled in instead of expanding with each breath. I looked into his mouth and I could see that, as he breathed, the golf tee was being sucked between his vocal chords and the wide end was neatly plugging his airway.</p><p>With heart pounding and legs shaking, I immediately had him up by the heels and was able to dislodge the obstruction. I was a trained anaesthetist and I was used to observing patients&#8217; airways. I dread to think what might have happened had I not had the appropriate knowledge. Needless to say, after that, golf tees were banned from our household for a number of years.</p><p>That is just one small example of the simple accidents that happen in homes every day. A knowledge of basic first aid procedures, such as how to stop bleeding, maintain an airway and position someone who is unconscious for whatever reason to ensure that they do not inhale vomit, can be life saving. First aid is an important skill. People can save lives by performing simple procedures, following certain guidelines and giving basic treatment until professional medical help arrives. I know of people who survived cardiac arrest because someone who had the appropriate knowledge was around at the time and was able to maintain circulation and a clear airway until professional help arrived.</p><p>I am a great fan of the first responder system, which has rescued many people in our more remote communities, where it takes time for an ambulance to reach a casualty. As a former medical practitioner, I know the strain that is placed on our tremendous emergency services throughout the country when common household accidents result in hospital attendance, which could have been avoided had a trained first-aider been on hand. As many people as possible should have basic first aid training. Our ambulance services do a sterling job in providing training in schools and communities.</p><p>Drew Smith made an important point about the need for every child to learn to swim.</p><p>I am a north-east MSP, so I am delighted that a member of Braemar Mountain Rescue has been nominated for a prestigious Scottish first aid award.

The awards recognise individuals or organisations who champion first aid training for their staff, customers and the public. Phil Glennie regularly assists voluntary groups from Girlguiding UK, the Scout Association and the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s Award, by teaching first aid. Over the years he has spoken to thousands of people about first aid. I am glad to take this opportunity to wish Mr Glennie well in the awards on Thursday.</p><p>I congratulate St Andrew&#8217;s First Aid on its Scottish first aid week, which is an excellent way to raise public awareness of the importance of first aid training in saving lives.

Chronic neuromuscular conditions often feature as a subject matter for members&#8217; business debates, but this evening&#8217;s debate is one of the few to highlight a condition that strikes in childhood and which predominantly affects young boys.</p><p>All such conditions have a common thread&#8212;they are all relatively rare in population terms, and they tend to be the Cinderellas of the NHS, whose focus is inevitably on the more common diseases that affect the bulk of the population.</p><p>The needs of the groups of people who suffer from such diseases are similar. Many of the diseases are progressive, most are currently incurable, and top-class research is vital if the underlying causes are to be found and treatments and potential cures developed. It is very exciting that such research is now producing results.</p><p>The motion sends out a message of hope of a very real health improvement to people who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with current research likely to result in the development in the next few years of a series of genetic medicines that have the potential to benefit a proportion of patients and, I hope, with the possibility of more to come in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>Such genetic medicines were undreamt of until fairly recently, and they are a significant step forward in the search for an effective cure for such a debilitating condition. I fully support Jim Eadie&#8217;s plea for Scotland to be part of collaborative clinical trials.</p><p>In the meantime, DMD sufferers deserve the best possible care and support and state-of-the-art equipment to help them cope with their disabilities. Advice from specialist nurses and physiotherapists, adaptations to housing on the recommendation of occupational therapists and, in the case of DMD sufferers who also have learning difficulties, the support of specialist teaching staff can all make a tremendous difference to quality of life and can enhance life expectancy.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I read once again the muscular dystrophy campaign&#8217;s daily living factsheet, produced a few years ago, which made it clear that boys with DMD do best when they are educated in school and that, with careful planning, it is possible to ensure that a child&#8217;s time at school can enhance his range of experiences and quality of life, and can provide opportunities to enjoy a wide variety of activities and develop friendships. Without that, life for those children would be restricted and isolated.</p><p>Many boys with DMD have done very well at school, passing exams and attaining university degrees. Some move on to jobs and many gain enormous pleasure from swimming, reading, painting, playing musical instruments or operating computers. Such achievements are possible only if their talents and abilities are recognised and supported from an early age but, unfortunately, Scotland has been some way behind other countries in that respect. As a result, the choice of school&#8212;mainstream or special needs, day or boarding school&#8212;is important. The fact that pupils with DMD have different needs should be taken into account when their education is being planned, although it is reckoned that, with the right planning, most boys can be educated in a local mainstream school.</p><p>Planning is also essential to ensure that, as a condition progresses, the necessary facilities, equipment and support are readily available. Regular reviews and assessments are therefore required and, as the children grow, there should be early planning for transition between school and college or university. Moreover, children should not just become the passive recipients of care; they must be allowed to develop independence of thought and given the freedom to make choices.</p><p>Social integration is another essential ingredient of a happy, fulfilled life, and ensuring that that takes place will prove to be easier the earlier a child can be integrated into school. They certainly deserve no less.</p><p>I recall a debate that was initiated into this matter a few years ago by a former colleague, Sylvia Jackson MSP. At the time, I raised the issue that, by the age of 12, most boys with DMD need to use a powered wheelchair at least some of the time. I ask the minister what progress has been made on wheelchair supply in Scotland and, in particular, in our rural areas, such as Aberdeenshire, which I represent. I hope that the minister will give a commitment in the interests not only of the DMD sufferers for whom I am principally speaking but of the many people with chronic neuromuscular conditions who might need appropriate modern wheelchairs to achieve mobility.</p><p>This debate must give real hope for the many people afflicted with DMD, and I look forward to hearing about the future developments in the care and treatment of men and boys who are diagnosed with the condition. Once again, I thank Jim Eadie for sponsoring the debate.

Every child needs to know its limitations, as well as what is right and wrong.</p><p>Our children grew up in the knowledge that they were adopted. Both had two or three classmates who were in the same position because, at that time, there were more than 2,000 adoptions in Scotland every year. That contrasts with the position two years ago, when more than 15,000 young people were in care and there were fewer than 500 adoptions&#8212;an adoption rate of only 2.9 per cent.</p><p>The change in society between the 1970s and today happened quickly and dramatically as it became the norm for single mums to keep their babies, as more and more marriages ended in divorce and as a much freer lifestyle led to substance and alcohol abuse among young people, many of whom found themselves unemployed and unable to give their offspring the safe, secure and stable environment that they needed to thrive.</p><p>I was a medical adviser to Voluntary Services Aberdeen in the early 1980s. By then, the few children whom we were placing for adoption were older. Some were physically damaged by their early life experience and most were psychologically damaged by it. The situation has grown worse. The numbers of looked-after children now overwhelm the resources of many of the councils that are responsible for them. Only a small number of those children are adopted. Last year, only 273 of them were living with prospective adopters&#8212;a figure that has changed little over 10 years.</p><p>Since 2005, permanence orders have been available as an alternative to adoption, enabling stable long-term placements by giving the local authority the right to determine where a child will live until the age of 16, while the parents retain other parental rights and responsibilities, which they share with the local authority. However, as Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland says in its briefing for the debate,</p><p>&#8220;far too many children are waiting too long for a decision on their future, and endure multiple short term placements, developing complex needs as a result&#8221;.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s has a wish list of developments that it considers would improve decision making on permanence and adoption. To me, they seem worthy aspirations and worthy of repetition, even though Neil Bibby and Liam McArthur have already mentioned them. They include a national risk assessment framework for decision making, to be used by local authorities that are considering removing a child from home, which would ensure consistency throughout Scotland. Decisions to remove a child should be evidence based, which is not always the case at present.</p><p>Barnardo&#8217;s also stresses the need to collect more robust data on the decision-making process. That should include the time that it has taken to place a child and the reasons for delay when any occurs. It seems strange that such data is not routinely collected when it could be used to identify good and bad practice.</p><p>Most worryingly, Barnardo&#8217;s believes that resources&#8212;rather than the best interests of the child&#8212;too often influence council decisions. Children may be left in chaotic and damaging home conditions because removing them, particularly into residential care, is seen as too expensive even though, in the long run, not removing them will cost the public purse more and is likely to leave the children irrevocably damaged.</p><p>None of us would disagree that the focus must be on the child&#8217;s wellbeing and what he or she needs to thrive and reach adulthood having achieved maximum potential in physical, educational and emotional ability. Early intervention and planning, with clearly stated timescales for moving towards permanence, are crucial to the child&#8217;s likelihood of reaching that maximum potential. It has been shown time and again that, the younger the child when removed from an unsatisfactory home environment, the greater the chance that they will do well in later life. I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to multi-agency planning in pursuit of that aim.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are not enough foster carers to cope with the number of children who would benefit from living with a foster family, nor are there yet enough potential adopters to give those children the permanence that they need and deserve. I hope that the national adoption register will move that forward, given the promising initial results.</p><p>If the decision is made not to remove a child from the family setting, or if a child is returned home after a temporary removal, there is currently not enough family support available at the times when it is most needed, such as at weekends or during out-of-office hours. Social workers do their best, but they are overworked with case loads that make it difficult for them to give proper support to families and children who are entrusted to their care.</p><p>Local and central Government need to ensure that there is adequate resourcing of social work services for young people, because proper care at that time is likely to pay huge dividends as those children grow up in terms of their wellbeing and future contribution to society.</p><p>Unfortunately, the number of children who become looked after has risen dramatically in the past two decades, and far too small a proportion of those children go on to become adopted. A culture shift towards giving more permanence to looked-after children and towards encouraging adoption is now beginning to happen, and I hope that the Scottish Government&#8217;s recently launched parenting strategy, together with the forthcoming rights of children and young people bill, will result in many more children being able to grow up in the safe, secure, loving and stable environment that they deserve and to which they are entitled.</p><p>This debate is likely to be fairly consensual, and in that spirit Scottish Conservatives will be happy to support the Government&#8217;s motion and the Labour and Liberal Democrat amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is a good point, with which I agree.

At that time, as Nigel Don pointed out, there was less traffic on the roads than there is today, and people did not drive so fast. Even so, that attitude should not have been acceptable then, and it certainly is not acceptable now.</p><p>Many of us will be aware of the work of the Campaign Against Drinking and Driving, which was founded in 1985 by John Knight and Graham Buxton&#8212;two fathers who lost children in road crashes that were caused by drunken drivers. All of us will have been affected by the hard-hitting advertisements on television, especially at Christmas, which reinforce the message that it is simply not worth it to drive having drunk alcohol. However, people still do drink and drive.</p><p>The key message is, simply, do not drink and drive, and it is a message that I and many other people adhere to. I have some sympathy with the argument that that approach should be mandatory, given the fact that people cannot accurately estimate a safe level of alcohol consumption. I also recognise that each person's metabolism and tolerance level are different. However, those are debates for another day, although they were touched on by Mark McDonald in his speech.</p><p>Clearly, a case can be made to lower the drink-driving limit, but our amendment seeks to highlight other measures that might achieve an even more effective response to the serious crime of drink-driving. I very much welcome the consultation that was launched by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice. I fully acknowledge the fact that the drink-driving limit has remained unchanged since the 1960s and that, at 80mg per 100ml of blood, the current level is among the highest in the world. In comparison with other European countries, where the level is 50mg per 100ml, the limit here seems excessively high, especially when we consider that our near neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, lowered its limit last year from 80mg to 50mg, and to 20mg for learner, newly qualified and professional drivers.</p><p>The Scottish Government obviously believes that lowering the limit will have a positive effect on reducing the number of incidents of drink-driving, and I hope that a lowering of the limit will result in fewer accidents caused by drink-driving. However, given the number of drivers who continue to ignore the existing limits and who drive when they are significantly over the limit, I am not yet wholly convinced that that will prove to be the case.</p><p>I feel strongly that scarce resources should be focused on those who blatantly flout the existing law, getting behind the wheel with levels three or four times the limit, and on the unknown number of people who drive under the influence of drugs.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s consultation document suggests that lowering the limit will result in between three and 17 fewer deaths a year. However, although the number of deaths caused by drink-driving is still far too high, it has been on a downward trend and has halved from 40 in 2000 to 20 in 2010. That is testament to the unremitting efforts of Scotland&#8217;s police forces and their many high-profile campaigns, particularly at festive times, to highlight the dangerous consequences of drink-driving.</p><p>Richard Simpson made some interesting points, and I agree with him that any reduction in the limit will have to be very widely advertised. His example of what is done in France has given us serious food for thought.</p><p>I commend another Grampian campaign&#8212;the safe drive, stay alive campaign&#8212;which is run regularly by the fire and rescue service and the police. Secondary school pupils are given a graphic presentation of the aftermath of a serious road accident and then meet the survivors of the accident. The relatives of victims who did not survive are also present. The campaign does not focus particularly on alcohol, but it deals with drink-driving as a significant issue. The event is held in the beach ballroom in Aberdeen, with a spanking new sports car on display outside the ballroom as the pupils enter. They go through that very emotional presentation&#8212;I have seen teenagers reduced to tears during the presentation&#8212;and when they come out the spanking new car has been replaced by a seriously damaged wreck. Believe me, that has an impact on the kids. It is a fantastic campaign.</p><p>Many young drivers, such as Dennis Robertson&#8217;s daughter, are responsible but others are not. I fully agree with him that drivers in the 17-to-35 age group need to be educated about their responsibilities when they get behind the wheel of a car. I also agree with Stewart Stevenson&#8217;s comments about the drivers who refuse to acknowledge the risks of drink-driving.</p><p>I liked John Mason&#8217;s comments about carrots and sticks and the merits of readily available, cheap public transport to encourage people to leave their cars at home when going out for a social evening involving alcohol.</p><p>David Stewart made some excellent points about young drivers. I commend his commitment and his on-going efforts to educate young drivers as they set out on their driving careers.</p><p>The concerns that my colleague Alex Johnstone expressed relate to the question whether resources will be diverted if the existing limit is reduced and if the police target those who are just over a newly reduced limit rather than those who are well over the current limit. People who are three or four times over the current limit would become five or six times over a newly reduced limit, and we should be targeting those drivers. I reiterate that any form of drink-driving is a serious offence. However, with budgetary constraints, we need to examine the best use of police resources. As Alex Johnstone has postulated, that may not be to pursue those who are marginally over a reduced limit at the expense of pursuing those who are significantly over the current limit.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink-driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There was a one-for-the-road culture, even when we went out for meals in people&#8217;s houses.

I also commend her for her tireless work with the cross-party group on dyslexia, which I have found stimulating on the few occasions that I have been able to attend it. Through that group, much has been done to raise awareness of dyslexia, which as we know is a common condition that was little understood and rarely diagnosed just a few years ago.</p><p>Dyslexia Scotland has done an excellent job on launching the toolkit, which is a really good source of help and guidance on dyslexia for parents, carers and teachers. It increases their understanding of the disability and shows them how to help children in their care overcome it.</p><p>Dyslexia is a condition that can be very upsetting for a child who is struggling with reading and writing when their peers are coping easily. Early recognition of and appropriate help with dyslexia can not only enable children to catch up but help to prevent the loss of self-esteem that they may experience as a result of their difficulties. Once they realise that every individual is different, that we all have our own problems, and that having dyslexia does not mean that they are less bright than their peers, they can begin to cope. In fact, the diagnosis can bring relief to the affected child and his or her parents or carers.</p><p>I well recall the frustrations of watching a young relative struggle with spelling, driving his mother to distraction as he spelled the same simple words in three or four different ways on the same page of homework. The lad himself became more and more frustrated and angry until, eventually, his mum went to his school and said that she was convinced that he was brighter than he appeared to be on paper. On investigation, at the age of nine he was found to have a reading age of 11 while his spelling was like that of an eight-year-old.</p><p>In those days, the lad was labelled not as having dyslexia but as having hand-eye co-ordination problems. With help from his teachers, the use of a computer&#8212;which was quite an innovation at the time&#8212;and a tutor for English, he got through his higher exams without a scribe, achieved a university degree and now runs his own small information technology business. As an adult, he diagnosed himself as being dyslexic and learned exercises to help with spelling. His co-ordination has also improved enormously. From being a young lad who could not kick a football, he has gone to being an accomplished skier, teaching his own and other children the skills of the sport.</p><p>Dyslexia is now recognised as being quite prevalent in the community, with one in 10 adults thought to have some form of it, and a number of celebrities are now coming forward and admitting that they suffer from it. Probably the most notable of those in Scotland is Sir Jackie Stewart, who has done a great deal to raise awareness and remove any stigma from it.</p><p>Today in the public gallery we have our own celebrity. We are all delighted to join in welcoming Ellie to the Parliament and to wear the blue ribbon that she has presented to the minister and MSPs, which will be distributed to schools and libraries all over Scotland. Ellie and young people like her are real ambassadors who are helping to pave the way for dyslexic people throughout the country. I say well done to Ellie for her efforts in raising awareness of dyslexia and the impact that it can have on people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>I welcome the success of the dyslexia toolkit in letting people know what dyslexia is and in giving advice to teachers and parents on how to help children who suffer from it. I congratulate Dyslexia Scotland and those who developed the toolkit, which has already helped many young people throughout Scotland and which will help many more in years to come as it evolves to take account of best practice. I hope that, as the motion suggests, similar toolkits will be developed in the future to assist employers and providers in giving appropriate support to people with dyslexia in the workplace and in the community.

I would also like to endorse Jackie Baillie&#8217;s recently lodged motion on the same subject, because I think that it is important that we all unite in support of Breakthrough Breast Cancer and other cancer charities, which are working to get home to women the importance of looking out for any physical changes that might indicate cancer at an early stage, when it is likely to be easily and successfully treated. We have heard of many personal successes this evening.</p><p>It is important, too, to acknowledge the Government&#8217;s detect cancer early initiative, which has rightly selected breast cancer as the first cancer type to be targeted.</p><p>Given that breast cancer affects one in eight of the female population, I have no doubt that we have all been in contact with someone who has developed breast cancer. I had my first close contact with the condition more than 30 years ago, when I and three close friends from my medical school class all developed breast lumps. Mine was a cyst, and I still remember the palpable relief all around when the surgeon&#8217;s probe found fluid rather than solid tissue. One of my friends had a benign fibroadenoma, while the other two had cancer. Sadly, one of them died fairly soon after diagnosis from liver secondaries. If anyone has noticed the well-worn and very shabby purse that I always carry with me, the reason I will not replace it is because it was a 21st birthday present from that friend. The fourth member of our group lived with her cancer for around 15 years, until she eventually succumbed to very slow-growing lung secondaries. Therefore, I have been very much aware of breast cancer for many years. I would never miss a screening appointment, and I intend to submit to regular mammography after the age when screening is routinely on offer.</p><p>I was interested to hear Linda Fabiani mention older women, because the need to be aware of breast cancer into old age was brought home to me recently when a friend, who is also a constituent, contacted me to ask for breast cancer statistics in women over the age of 70. While she was in hospital for a lumpectomy, she had met two other patients in the same ward whose cancer had been diagnosed when they were in their 70s. That set me thinking about how many women, once they have reached the age when routine screening stops, might assume that their risk of developing breast cancer has fallen when, in fact, the risk increases with age.</p><p>With an ageing population, an increasing number of women will be at risk. I know that Breakthrough Breast Cancer and other organisations point out that the risk continues, but I wonder whether more emphasis should be put on that. I raised that point with the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing during health questions last week.</p><p>Clearly, the importance of early diagnosis applies to all age groups. I hope that the publicity of breast cancer awareness month will remind all women of not only regular screening but regular self-examination and encourage them to pay attention to the touch, look, check message that is being promoted by Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Many people nowadays survive diagnosis of breast cancer for many years, and many more could do so if that diagnosis was made early.</p><p>I congratulate Linda Fabiani on doing her bit in Parliament to highlight the need to be aware of breast cancer, and I give all credit to those who work year in, year out to educate the general public on the importance of regular vigilance and self-examination, so that the condition can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674173", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Breast Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this debate at the start of breast cancer awareness month and I congratulate Linda Fabiani on her motion, which highlights the importance of early diagnosis of breast cancer.

It is right for us to acknowledge that it is, in many respects, an illness that is often ignored.</p><p>As John Mason said, the social side effects of gambling are often to be seen in our poorest areas and communities, where families sometimes go without basic food and clothing because an individual has an addiction to gambling. His motion draws attention to the comments that were made last month by Labour&#8217;s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, who admitted that the previous Government at Westminster had made a mistake in relaxing the gambling laws. That view is also shared by the former Home Secretary, David Blunkett.</p><p>That is why I was pleased to read press reports that the coalition Government intends to impose restrictions on the high-stakes gambling machines that allow people to bet more than &#163;15,000 an hour. Those casino-style machines, which are found in hundreds of betting shops throughout the country, have been described as the crack cocaine of gambling, because they are so addictive.</p><p>Although I acknowledge that gambling is a reserved matter, I look to the minister to tell us what discussions she has had with her counterparts down south regarding those fixed-odds betting terminals, which often allow users to accrue huge debts because they can stake as much as &#163;100&#8212;Graeme Dey said &#163;500&#8212;a time on roulette, blackjack or poker.</p><p>We would all accept that gambling in small measures is not, in itself, necessarily harmful. Indeed, I am an occasional national lottery player and freely admit that it is a form of gambling. I look back with great fondness to my late aunt, whose devotion to one-armed bandits was said to keep the local golf club afloat&#8212;although she would turn in her grave if she were classed as a gambler.</p><p>Mr Mason&#8217;s considered motion is summed up by its title&#8212;&#8220;Gambling Proliferation&#8221;. He is perhaps right to say that the east end of Glasgow is saturated with bookmakers shops. The fact that there are more than 30 of them in his constituency of Shettleston should be seen in the context of its being, I believe, only 6 miles in length.</p><p>If it is true that, as has been suggested, gambling companies are targeting vulnerable people by siting betting shops next to pubs, bank machines and post offices in some of our poorest areas, that would obviously be of concern. However, as with most matters, a measured response to a difficult situation is required. We must remember that the gambling industry employs 40,000 people throughout the UK, including 7,000 in Scotland, and contributes around &#163;350&#160;million to the Scottish economy.</p><p>I do not think that anyone would want us to return to the old days, when illegal gambling was underground and, therefore, impossible to police. By and large, the industry is responsible. It is regulated locally through the need to have licenses, which can be revoked at any time.</p><p>I fully understand the concerns that are being expressed by individuals such as John Mason, many of whom are opposed to gambling for moral, religious or ethical reasons. However, it is a legal activity, although I would not be inclined to argue, as one of my colleagues did, that that it falls within the sport element of my brief.</p><p>I believe that the industry is working hard to combat problem gambling through initiatives such as staff training, whereby workers behind the counter are taught how to recognise potential problem gambling behaviour. I also believe that the trade organisation, the Association of British Bookmakers, takes its role seriously.</p><p>The debate will continue, but I reiterate that although I understand the concerns that have been expressed by John Mason and the need to keep a very close eye on the situation, co-operation and compromise with the industry represent the best way forward.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gambling Proliferation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, commend John Mason for bringing this important issue to the chamber.

We have a serious and increasing obesity problem, even among children and young people, and far too few of us achieve even the recommended minimum level of activity each week, despite knowing that a lack of physical activity is the greatest contributor to coronary artery disease.</p><p>Despite that background, we have just enjoyed a summer of fantastic sporting success in the United Kingdom, in which Scottish athletes featured highly on the Olympic medals table and which culminated in Andy Murray&#8217;s enormous achievement of winning the 2012 US open.</p><p>We saw the excitement last week in London as the Olympians and Paralympians toured the capital city. On Sunday, large crowds of people were out in Edinburgh to applaud Sir Chris Hoy and other Scottish athletes. In Dunblane, the excitement of youngsters as they queued to meet Andy Murray was palpable. However, that buzz will fade. It might not happen until after the Commonwealth games, but fade it will, unless we take steps to involve many more people in sporting activity.</p><p>Many of the people who have given evidence to the committee have stressed that activity must start in childhood and must be fun for participants. As Kim Atkinson of the Scottish Sports Association said:</p><p>&#8220;Primary schools provide the opportunity for ... every young person to be physically literate&#8212;to run, jump, throw, catch and swim ... if being regularly active is a cultural norm for children ... if it is fun and they develop confidence, that is a great start. If they decide in later life that they want to take part in sport A or activity B, they will have the skills and confidence ... and they will think that taking part will be fun.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 4 September 2012; c 2509.]</p><p>However, there are at present not enough qualified PE teachers in Scotland to help our youngsters to achieve physical literacy. There are only 1,500 full-time qualified PE staff in post, which is a drop of 7 per cent since 2007. That must be a concern for a Government that aims to ensure that all primary school pupils receive two hours per week of formal PE, and which has preventative spend as a key commitment.</p><p>It has been estimated that increasing physical activity by 1 per cent per year for five years would save nearly 160 lives per year, so increasing levels of participation in sport and physical recreational activity must be the cornerstone of discussions on a strategy for sport, and must link in with other policy areas such as health, education and the local environment.</p><p>Much of the evidence that the Health and Sport Committee has received so far has focused on two issues: volunteering and the development of community sport hubs. Volunteers are the lifeblood of the 13,000 sports clubs in Scotland, and they provide coaching, competition and development opportunities for young people at community level. Many do not even view themselves as volunteers, but merely as friends or relatives of club members who are just helping out. Skills of all kinds are required, including coaching, fundraising, secretarial work, training and participation in governance.</p><p>There are barriers to volunteering that could easily be overcome, such as a perceived lack of time, a lack of knowledge of how to get involved and a lack of confidence or support to start volunteering. The Scottish Sports Association is calling for more businesses to become involved by allowing employees time off for volunteering through a programme of employer-supported volunteering. That could be particularly useful in more deprived areas where it is harder to recruit volunteers.</p><p>Interest is growing in community sport hubs, which bring together in one place local sports clubs, volunteers and other local groups such as schools and youth organisations to share facilities and information on becoming involved, and to provide access to local people. There are already a number of very successful ventures, which have inspired more and more local people to become involved in increasing numbers of activities. Those ventures should be used as role models to improve access and facilities throughout Scotland.</p><p>I like the suggestion from the Paths For All Partnership, that consideration be given to renaming community sport hubs as active community hubs in order to maximise accessibility, on the assumption that physical activity will stimulate further interest in sporting activity for people of all ages who might otherwise never become involved.</p><p>We live in potentially exciting times for our nation&#8217;s health and wellbeing. I hope that the committee&#8217;s inquiry will help to inspire communities to build on the excellent examples that already exist and to achieve a legacy of a fitter, happier, active and more community-spirited nation as an appropriate tribute to the recent successes of our magnificent sporting heroes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Sport Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Now that we are halfway through the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s inquiry into community sport, and now that governing bodies, clubs and participants in sport have made us aware of many of the issues that affect the success of community sport, I am pleased that we are having the debate, which gives members who are not on the committee the opportunity to present their thoughts on how we...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80522", "house": "4", "member_id": "80522", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "22673083", "hpos": "217", "gid": "2012-09-20.20.20", "epobject_id": "22673103", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2012-09-20.20.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g20.20", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80522"}, {"body": "<p>I, too, congratulate the cabinet secretary on his new role and wish him well as he comes to grips with a health service that is unremittingly and increasingly under pressure as it tries to cope with the ever-rising demands of an ageing population at one extreme of life and a higher birth rate at the other.</p><p>I do not know whether the cabinet secretary expected his baptism of fire to be closing for the Government in a debate led by Jackie Baillie for Labour, but I look forward to his no doubt robust response to criticism of his Government&#8217;s management of the NHS when he gets to his feet in a few minutes&#8217; time. However, notwithstanding the cut and thrust of political debate, I hope that none of us ever forgets that we are dealing with people&#8217;s wellbeing and lives when we discuss the NHS. It is not enough, as the First Minister and others always do when put under pressure, to deflect the criticism either on to the Westminster Government, which has continued to protect the health budget, whatever they say, or on to the health boards, which are struggling to make ends meet&#8212;it is all part, no doubt, of the SNP&#8217;s obsession with the separation agenda.</p><p>As the RCN has said to us, greater transparency and more publicly available information are needed on how the health budget is spent, so that we can properly scrutinise the impact on healthcare of decisions that are made by the Government centrally and by health boards locally.

Various issues were raised across the chamber.</p><p>The fall in nursing numbers particularly concerns me. I saw the pressures myself in the acute sector when I was in hospital last year for hip replacement surgery. Although that is a common procedure, it is major surgery and things can easily go wrong in the early days of recovery when skilled nursing is essential. I could not fault the care that I received from a dedicated and skilled team of nurses, but they were working under pressure and their morale was quite low. They knew who I was and came to me to ask me to raise the issue in Parliament because they were seriously worried about the pressure that they were under because of staff shortages.</p><p>There were adequate numbers of nurses during the day but, like Margo MacDonald, I found the situation at night to be quite concerning. During my stay in the ward, it was staffed at night by one charge nurse, who was a superb nurse, and one young auxiliary. The charge nurse told me that he was looking after six intravenous drips on the ward, there were several frail elderly patients who required help with toiletting, and, of course, there were the usual drugs and breakfasts to be dispensed. Fortunately, no serious problems arose, but it would have taken just one emergency for that to change rapidly, and I know that the staffing shortage is a concern for nurses on the ground and for senior management.</p><p>My experience is just one small example, but it is not fair to put our nursing staff under such severe pressure. The Government needs to look at how that situation can be improved. As we have heard from members across the chamber today, all is not as rosy on the ground as the Government would appear to believe.</p><p>On spending on the NHS, after the interesting session that the Health and Sport Committee had this week on the vexed issue of access to drugs in the NHS, perhaps the Government should instigate a societal debate on the issue, and consider scrutinising other healthcare interventions as rigorously as the availability of drugs. In other words, should we have an equivalent of the Scottish Medicines Consortium to assess the range of procedures that are available to patients?</p><p>As pressures on resources increase, those are the sorts of difficult issues that we will have to face up to, but we should not start with cutting front-line services such as nursing. If we continue to do so, we will have to deal with the consequences. We are not criticising for criticism&#8217;s sake; there is no doubt that the demographic time bomb is already here, and that services are finding it difficult to cope with the extra demands that are being made of them. I am part of that demographic time bomb, and I have a serious personal interest in the effective functioning of the NHS. It has never been perfect, but it is currently under greater pressure than it has ever been under before, so serious thought must be given urgently to dealing with its problems or staff will become more disillusioned and simply leave its employment.</p><p>The debate has been lively. I hope that the cabinet secretary will reflect on the issues that have been raised and give his support to NHS staff who are doing their best in difficult circumstances to maintain high standards of patient care. He is not the only one with a clear commitment to the NHS; mine goes back more than 50 years.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Patient Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate the cabinet secretary on his new role and wish him well as he comes to grips with a health service that is unremittingly and increasingly under pressure as it tries to cope with the ever-rising demands of an ageing population at one extreme of life and a higher birth rate at the other.

The bill will become legislation that, if properly implemented, will embody the principles of independent living for everyone, giving to all citizens the same freedom, choice, dignity and control in their lives, whether they are at home, at work or in the community. The bill will give everyone the right to secure practical assistance and support to participate in society and to live an ordinary life&#8212;something that, to date, has not been achieved. That point is emphasised in the briefing that was sent to members by Independent Living in Scotland, Inclusion Scotland and others, for whom it is crucial that the bill is viewed as a mechanism to support disabled people and those who live with long-term conditions to realise the reality of independent living.</p><p>The current system of direct payments to those who wish to select and pay for some of or all their social care entitlement was first introduced in the late 1990s. That system has not worked as intended, with uptake being less in Scotland than south of the border and patchy across the country. It is widely felt that legislation is now required to enable everyone to choose how they wish to receive the social care that they require. The only dissenting voice has been COSLA, which does not see the need for legislation at the present time.</p><p>We have heard about the four options, which are on a sliding scale, that will be available under the legislation to those assessed as requiring a package of social care, so I will not repeat that information. Of course, SDS options are currently available to service users, but the bill would place a duty on councils both to offer them and to act on the service user&#8217;s choice, and should result in greater consistency of provision across local authorities.</p><p>Although they are implicit in the bill, I agree with organisations such as Independent Living in Scotland that the principles of independent living should be made more explicit&#8212;there should be a direct reference to them in the bill. I am pleased that the minister is exploring the possibility of an amendment to that effect. I am also attracted to the suggestion of including a statement of intent in the bill, to further strengthen the link between SDS and its role in supporting independent living.</p><p>If the legislation is to be effective, there must be a clear focus on the requirements of the service user rather than those of the provider. A market will emerge for service users as SDS develops. It may be that, in the fullness of time, facilities such as council-run day centres will cease to be required if they are generally not what service users want. There are bound to be tensions, and a change of culture will be required in how the public sector meets individual needs, which will no doubt throw up problems along the way. However, the general thrust is that the end result of real independent living is what should be available in a fair 21st century Scotland.</p><p>The Royal College of Nursing voiced concern about users opting opt to use social care resources to pay for health-related provision, such as physiotherapy&#8212;or vice versa. However, such provision is precisely what should be happening if that is what would give the user most benefit and if provision is not readily available in the national health service. I hope that that issue will be dealt with as the integration of health and social care develops, on which I personally eagerly await the details of the Government&#8217;s proposed legislation. Indeed, I feel that the benefits of SDS will only be fully realised once the promised integration is complete.</p><p>There are legitimate concerns about the lack of an appeals process in the bill or the failure to include the right to independent advocacy as a statutory provision. There are issues about support for adult carers, which the minister has spoken about&#8212;carers organisations want to see a duty on rather than a discretionary power for local authorities. There are also concerns surrounding the management of transition planning from children&#8217;s services to adult services, particularly from school to further education.</p><p>Also worrying a number of people is the Government&#8217;s decision not to regulate personal assistants but instead to rely on the protecting vulnerable groups scheme to mitigate some of the risks for those wishing to employ a PA, and I am not sure that the response given by the minister will completely reassure those who have raised such concerns. I note that there are plans to launch a consultation exercise on the employment of relatives by service users, once the bill is passed&#8212;I look forward to that.</p><p>As we have heard, there have been disagreements between COSLA and the Government about the cost estimates for implementation of the bill&#8217;s provisions and whether promised Government resources will be sufficient to facilitate the process of change required. I am pleased that those discussions will continue.</p><p>Although there are a number of important details and concerns to be dealt with as the bill goes through the parliamentary process, and no doubt there will be amendments from those who think that changes need to be made, I think that, overall, there is consensus that the legislation will be of significant benefit to those who are assessed as requiring social care. Provided that it is perceived not as a cost-cutting opportunity, but rather as the chance to give greater independence and a better quality of life to service users, the bill, particularly when it is seen in conjunction with the forthcoming legislation on the integration of health and social care, will be widely welcomed across Scotland.</p><p>I agree with Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland that there will need to be robust oversight of the implementation of self-directed support, with sanctions imposed on local authorities that are deemed to be failing. However, Scottish Conservatives will be happy to support the general principles of the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672514", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In my nine years plus as a member of the Parliament, I have not been closely involved with a bill that has had such widespread support for its general principles.

It has therefore been very interesting to listen to the debate and to learn about the group&#8217;s innovative and imaginative work.</p><p>We all agree that there is a greater recognition these days of the importance of local produce to people&#8217;s diets and to their wellbeing. In June, I was invited to be the opening speaker at the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society conference in Dunblane, where one of the discussions focused on the health benefits of home-grown food. It became apparent that there was a general consensus that locally produced food not only contributes to healthy eating&#8212;helping to combat the risks of obesity and the sedentary lifestyles of so many people today&#8212;but simply tastes better. I have fond memories of the delicious produce from my father&#8217;s allotment when I was a young girl.</p><p>At the conference, it emerged that the other key benefit that is derived from growing your own is that it helps to reduce people&#8217;s carbon footprint and so contributes in a small way to the battle against climate change. In that respect, I am aware that Fife diet sees that as one of the pillars of the organisation through its work with Holyrood 350, a group of people from across Scotland who are actively striving to reduce their communities&#8217; carbon footprint.</p><p>I acknowledge the significant role that is played by the increasing presence in Scotland of farmers markets in promoting local produce&#8212;an initiative, I believe, of my colleague John Scott. In Edinburgh, we saw the establishment recently of a farmers market in Stockbridge and an application for a market on the Meadows. There are at least six or seven monthly farmers markets in communities throughout my area of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire&#8212;no doubt there are many others across the country.</p><p>Turning to the essence of the motion, namely the Fife diet&#8217;s food manifesto, there are certainly some ideas contained in the manifesto with which I agree&#8212;I will focus on a few in the short time available.</p><p>Earlier this year, as a member of the Public Petitions Committee, I listened to a very strong case that was put forward by John Hancox of the Commonwealth orchard&#8212;he asked for help to make it easier for people to grow food on underused ground that is owned by public bodies and private businesses. Although we would need to look closely at the legality of such moves and avoid accusations of land grabs, as well as taking into account the views of organisations such as RSPB Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage, there is a very powerful and growing argument in favour of greater community use of unused land.</p><p>As has been mentioned already, back in June the Scottish Government launched a consultation on its proposed community empowerment and renewal bill, which was debated at its preliminary stage yesterday. The bill aims, among other measures, to allow communities acting responsibly to take advantage of unused land for community benefit. Like Fife diet, we await the final outcome of the consultation with interest.</p><p>Another area of interest in the manifesto is the emphasis on eating what is termed a &#8220;seasonal 5 a day&#8221;. Although I do not believe that there should be any barriers that stifle choice, I believe that the concept of eating, for example, rhubarb in the spring, raspberries and strawberries in the summer, and apples and pears in the autumn and winter has merit. I reiterate that that should not be prescriptive, but I am sure that people would agree that fruit in season not only tastes better, but it is of greater nutritional value. Recently, I have to a large extent adopted that pattern myself.</p><p>Although I do not support all the measures that are identified in Mike Small&#8217;s manifesto, I certainly pay tribute to his contribution to the debate on how Scotland can be a healthier nation through how we produce our food. Mr Small&#8217;s organisation may be called Fife diet, but his Aberdeen-born passion for food shows throughout the document.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Diet Food Manifesto"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As well as publicly acknowledging Paul Wheelhouse&#8217;s elevation, I would like to thank Claire Baker for bringing this motion before Parliament.

On top of that, members of the public and&#8212;most important&#8212;members of addicts&#8217; families are widely and directly affected by our country&#8217;s drug problem. They may be faced with trying to rescue sons, daughters or grandchildren from the chaotic lifestyle of the addict&#8212;indeed, many kinship carers are in that role because of family drug addiction&#8212;or they may have to cope with bereavement as a result of overdose. Sadly, that is not uncommon and is proof of the tragic consequences of Scotland&#8217;s drugs epidemic. As Annabel Goldie has stated:</p><p>&#8220;Each death represents not just a life needlessly lost, but a family devastated and a community scarred.&#8221;</p><p>People may try to support a relative along the long and hard road to recovery, as family support is a hugely important aspect of an addict&#8217;s recovery. Sadly, those who give such support often suffer considerable distress and face stigma and discrimination, which put barriers in the way of recovery. When Sheila McKay of the Grampian Family Support Forum addressed the Parliament at time for reflection on 7 March, she said:</p><p>&#8220;Knowing that a family member has a drug problem is a painful and lonely experience.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 7 March 2012; c 6921.]</p><p>It is therefore only right that family members who give their unconditional support to their loved ones are given support themselves. That is where family support groups, which are formed to help families that are affected by drug misuse and addiction, play a vital role. They enable families to communicate with others in similar situations, to learn from one another&#8217;s experiences and to build relationships that are imperative to their wellbeing in an environment of mutual understanding.</p><p>The Scottish Families Affected by Drugs national forum started as a grass-roots organisation in 2003 that involved families who expressed their desire to become a united force in raising awareness of the difficulties that they faced. It is a membership organisation, and family members account for two thirds of the membership. It is governed by a voluntary board of directors, describes itself as</p><p>&#8220;the hub of a network of family support groups across Scotland&#8221;</p><p>and has the vision of a Scotland that recognises and supports the needs of families that are affected by the drug misuse of a loved one and the crucial role that is played by families. Its mission is to support families in Scotland that are affected by drug misuse and to raise awareness of the issues that affect them. To achieve that, it facilitates a network of family support groups, runs a national helpline and lobbies for the recognition of families in both national and local drug treatment policies. Importantly, families are at the heart of the organisation, providing information on local networks and access to funding, and supporting around 40 local groups, with just over 200 individual members.</p><p>I have no doubt that other members will tell us about support groups in their own parts of Scotland, but I want to focus on the Grampian Family Support Forum in my region, which was set up as recently as 2010 by family members and Scottish Families Affected by Drugs, and is funded by the Aberdeenshire alcohol and drug partnership. It is part of the achieving community empowerment programme, and has already made great progress towards facilitating a network of local support groups. It acts as an umbrella organisation within which local family support groups throughout Grampian can effectively communicate with one other, and was a successful participant in the third phase of the Parliament&#8217;s community partnership project. It reported back to Parliament on its work over the past year at the outcome ceremony that was held in the chamber at the end of March.</p><p>Under the leadership of its tireless chairman, Sheila McKay, the Grampian Family Support Forum is an excellent example of what can be achieved. It could lead the way for peer support right across Scotland. The Grampian model has shown that, given the right forum, families are more than willing to use their own experiences to help other families in the same position, but families need to be made aware of the existence of such fora. Perhaps general practitioners have a role in signposting them to a local support group.</p><p>I first met Sheila McKay when I sponsored an event for her, entitled &#8220;recovery happens&#8221;. It was a highly successful event, which was well attended by north-east MSPs from all parties and helped to increase our awareness that recovery from addiction can and does happen and that family members have an important role during recovery. Members of the Grampian forum were present, as were other groups that play a significant and essential role in recovery, such as Scottish Families Affected by Drugs and the Scottish Recovery Consortium. Local groups of affected families and people who were recovering from drug addiction were also present.</p><p>We heard the remarkable and inspiring story of Jane and her journey from addiction to alcohol and heroin to recovery, such that she now works for a voluntary organisation and counsels victims of similar addictions. We heard Betty&#8217;s story&#8212;the story of an amazing mother and grandmother who has held her family together despite several tragic events and who continues to help a loved one who is recovering from drug addiction. We heard from Daniel, who is converting his grief at losing his brother to addiction into films that are aimed at raising awareness of the issues that he and others have faced. The personal stories were extremely moving and the stresses that the people who told them had experienced were clear to see.</p><p>The contribution from families is continuous, arduous and critically important. Groups such as the Grampian forum try to highlight that families can and do learn from one another, that there needs to be a focus on recovery for families as well as for addicts, that families want to use and draw on their experience to help other families, and that families want to secure better services for people who are trying to recover from addiction and regain their lives.</p><p>Like us, the forum thinks that the ultimate goal for recovering addicts is total abstinence from addictive drugs, and that peer support is vital if recovering addicts are to achieve that. The forum thinks that we need more resources in place, such as easier and speedier access to residential rehabilitation, coupled with better follow-up support. It thinks that there needs to be an exit strategy for people who take methadone or other such harm-reduction treatment, which should not be for the long term.</p><p>The Grampian Family Support Forum has strong views on what is necessary to aid recovery, which my party shares. First, simply returning addicts to the community without support is ineffective; proper aftercare is required if any model of rehabilitation is to be effective. Secondly, it should be acknowledged that relapse is part of recovery. That should be taken account of in recovery programmes, and support should be available when relapse occurs. Thirdly, even after recovery from addiction it takes time to rebuild a life, and support for recovering addicts and families is vital at that stage. There is a gap in provision in that regard.</p><p>The United Kingdom Drug Policy Commission said in a report in 2009 that at that time 134,000 adults in Scotland were significantly affected by problematic drug use in their families. Family members reported feeling isolated, stressed, stigmatised and guilty. Stigma is a particular problem that must be tackled because it not only affects the people who are using drugs but spreads to family members. The media&#8217;s use of words such as &#8220;junkies&#8221; only adds to the stigma. Organisations such as the Grampian forum are fighting an on-going battle to get the media to be more careful about what they say.</p><p>We are still far from eradicating drug addiction in Scotland, and many people who want to be free of addiction still have to wait far too long for appropriate rehabilitation. There is much that we could say about that. However, today&#8217;s debate is about support for families. I acknowledge the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to investing in national organisations such as Scottish Families Affected by Drugs and the Scottish Recovery Consortium, which help families and communities to support &#8220;sustained recovery across Scotland&#8221;, as the amendment in Roseanna Cunningham&#8217;s name says.</p><p>I can do no better than conclude by quoting again from Sheila McKay&#8217;s time for reflection speech:</p><p>&#8220;Our core aim is to encourage the formation of new peer-support groups and increase the membership of those that already exist ... Since the project started, our numbers have increased from three to 21 throughout the north-east of Scotland. Our profile has been raised, our opinions have been valued and our voice has been heard ... we are making an impact and planting the seeds of change.</p><p>We want to use our lived expedience to make positive changes within our communities. Why? Because, when you are qualified to speak, people listen ... Built into every trial that we go through in life&#8212;every trial that forces us to grow&#8212;are the answers that other people need.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 7 March 2012; c 6921-2.]</p><p>Those are wise words from the heart, from a mother who has successfully travelled along the road of family addiction.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the importance of family members recovering in their own right from the effects that their loved-ones&#8217; drug misuse has on them; notes that family support groups provide a vital resource for families to get support for their own needs and to build relationships with others in similar circumstances; recognises the continuing challenges that small peer-led family support groups across Scotland face to sustain themselves; congratulates the Grampian Family Support Forum on its successful participation in the third phase of the Parliament&#8217;s Community Partnership Project and notes the success of the forum&#8217;s Recovery Happens event held in the Parliament on 1 March 2012 enabling the forum to further its support base on its campaign; further recognises the importance of these groups in breaking down barriers around stigma and discrimination related to substance misuse and addiction; understands that substance misuse and addiction do not discriminate in relation to who they affect and are important and destructive issues for families and Scottish society as a whole, and encourages that the forum&#8217;s vision is rolled out throughout Scotland so that communities across the country can learn from its example.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by indicating that we are happy to accept both amendments.

As the UK expert group concluded, there is no clear evidence of a materially greater risk to health being presented by PIP implants. Both Governments have accepted that there is no justification for routine replacement of implants on the NHS, and that conclusion is backed up by scientific and medical evidence.</p><p>That is not to say that we have heard the last word on the issue&#8212;of course not. The matter is still being extensively reviewed by Sir Bruce Keogh. Meanwhile, Earl Howe&#8217;s review, which was conducted through the UK Department of Health, made a number of recommendations to ensure that our processes are as strong as they can be. No system of regulation can guarantee absolute safety of medical products, but there are lessons to be learned and we await Sir Bruce&#8217;s conclusions, which will add to the body of information that we have on how best to move forward.</p><p>I accept Earl Howe&#8217;s conclusion that the MHRA&#8217;s communication to the German regulatory body that certified the implants for use was entirely reasonable and that the agency&#8217;s actions were based on a proper examination of the data available to it&#8212;data that have continued to be analysed.</p><p>I am aware of and understand the strength of opinion of campaigners in Scotland on the issue, particularly those who have been personally affected and whose health has been placed at risk by the actions of PIP and, potentially, a number of individuals in that organisation.

I am confident that the cabinet secretary will do all that she can to work with NHS Scotland in bringing forward any modification of its internal practices, which may need to be examined in light of changes brought about by the UK reviews.</p><p>In all that, the role of the Scottish Government will be to ensure that there is a robust framework of reporting and of implementing guidance between clinicians and the regulatory bodies. Primarily, however, we must note that if blame is to be attributed, it lies entirely and unequivocally with the manufacturer, which failed to show any regard whatsoever for the victims of its actions. It was an appalling, but thankfully rare, act.</p><p>That is fundamentally why we on the Scottish Conservative benches believe that a public inquiry in Scotland is not the correct way forward. Although we should review our practices, the most important investigation to be carried out will properly be a criminal one. To operate effectively, a regulatory regime must at some stage rely on a degree of good faith, and will sometimes need to operate on the assumption that that exists. That is reinforced by the threat of criminal prosecution and the penalties that exist when fraudulent practices are evident.</p><p>In the meantime, we can do little better than to repeat the clear advice that has come from the NHS, the MHRA and the Government&#8212;people who received PIP implants and who have any clinical questions or problems should contact their implanting surgeon.</p><p>The clear statement from the First Minister that NHS Scotland will step in and provide appropriate care if private provision fails&#8212;either by refusing care or by no longer being in existence&#8212;is of course welcome.

The two that I will stress are the importance of maintaining and enhancing the voluntary nature of mountain rescue teams while recognising the need for strategic planning involving all sectors of the emergency services as they face up to public sector reform, and the need to ensure that people who venture on to Scotland's hills and mountains know the importance of being properly equipped and prepared for the conditions that they may meet due to our rapidly changing weather patterns.</p><p>The Braemar mountain rescue team is the one that I know best, so I will pay tribute to its members. It was formed in 1965 and continued a long tradition of local people giving aid and working closely with the local police mountain rescue teams&#8212;a tradition that persists today. Over the years, it has included many unsung heroes&#8212;local men and women who, out of love of the hills and concern for their fellow human beings, venture out into our hills and mountains in all weathers and conditions, with most of their activity going unnoticed, and seldom talked about by the team members themselves.</p><p>Currently, there are 39 members in the Braemar team and, since the beginning of last September, they have completed 32 rescues, from finding missing skiers to helping fallen walkers. In addition to its rescue work, the team has an annual programme of lectures and visits to raise public awareness, and it provides emergency telephones at Derry Lodge and the Spittal of Glenshee, which help to maintain mountain safety and rescue services throughout the north-east of Scotland.</p><p>Mountain rescue teams are heavily reliant on voluntary fundraising to maintain their essential and expensive equipment, and there are undoubtedly significant challenges for them at the present time. However, their very essence is their voluntary nature, and public sector reform, especially the creation of a single police force, must take that into account and support that volunteer base, by helping it to develop alongside appropriate public sector financial support.</p><p>I once co-ordinated a group of young Conservatives on a sponsored climb of Lochnagar in aid of Braemar mountain rescue. Team members came with us and led our younger members up the more challenging routes, while the rest of us went up the standard path to the top. We had a great day, the young guys learned a lot and we handed the team well over &#163;800&#8212;at that time that was a significant sum&#8212;which they greatly appreciated. Many groups regularly undertake similar fundraising activities for charity. I encourage more of them to donate at least some of the proceeds to mountain rescue teams, which would put those funds to excellent use.</p><p>I will finish, if I may, with an anecdote about an encounter some years ago that left an indelible impression on my memory. On our way back to the Linn of Dee after climbing Ben Macdui with my family on a fairly dismal summer day, on which we encountered some unpleasant misty conditions at the top, where we had to rely on my husband&#8217;s skills with a compass to ensure that we got down again safely, we met a family of three&#8212;a grandfather with his son and grandson&#8212;who were heading where we had just come from but were convinced that they were going towards Braemar. We managed to persuade them to turn round and come with us, and we saw them safely back to Braemar. They were already tired when we met them, they had little food left&#8212;having spent the previous night in the Corrour bothy, because of bad weather&#8212;and they had no transport from the Linn of Dee to Braemar.

Epilepsy genetics is leading the way, and that is very good news for patients and families who live with epilepsy.</p><p>The Glasgow service also offers genetic counselling to help families cope with epilepsy once the diagnosis is made, which gives sufferers a better understanding of the importance of taking their medications and helps them to adapt their lifestyle to reach their maximum potential physically, mentally and emotionally. That is where the epilepsy specialist nurse comes in, and I think that the nurse&#8217;s role is crucial to the wellbeing of all epilepsy patients, new and existing.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are not enough ESNs in Scotland to ensure that all patients receive the recommended level of care, and I worry when I am told that, in these straitened times, many specialist nurses&#8212;and not just epilepsy nurses&#8212;are being returned to general nursing duties to assist health boards keep within their budgets. Surely that is a false economy if ever there was one.</p><p>I also find disturbing the evidence that health boards submitted to NHS Healthcare Improvement Scotland as part of a peer review of their performance against 16 of the 104 clinical standards for neurological services in Scotland. That evidence showed that only seven of the 14 health boards are meeting the selected standard for people with epilepsy, and that half the boards cannot show that healthcare professionals who carry out primary care annual reviews for patients have completed appropriate epilepsy training.</p><p>Surely patients deserve better than that, and I hope that the Scottish Government will endeavour to ensure that the recommendations that were made following the review are implemented. It was recommended that people with epilepsy should have access to a specialist service that is appropriate to their needs, which should include an epilepsy specialist nurse; that they should have access to up-to-date, appropriate information about their condition; and that primary care clinicians should undergo adequate training in epilepsy.</p><p>I very much welcome the debate, which gives us the opportunity to put on the parliamentary record the excellent pioneering work that is being undertaken in Glasgow on the genetics of epilepsy, which has the potential to bring lasting benefit to many people who are diagnosed with the condition, not only in Scotland, but throughout the world.</p><p>However, while we rejoice in Scotland&#8217;s place at the forefront of research on epilepsy, we must not forget that although improvements have undoubtedly been made in neurological services in Scotland&#8212;including services for epilepsy&#8212;in recent years, there is still a long way to go before all our health boards meet all the clinical standards that have been set for neurological services.

I agree absolutely with the member. I, too, was an overfed young baby. As I get older, I struggle to keep my weight in the right place.</p><p>There is no doubt that physical wellbeing and maintaining a healthy weight depend largely on the combination of a well-balanced healthy diet and a physically active lifestyle and that the problem of obesity must be tackled on both those fronts. In yesterday afternoon&#8217;s debate on the development of a national parenting strategy, it was emphasised that parenting starts pre-conception and continues through to adult life. I am in no doubt that encouragement and support for an active and healthy lifestyle should be an integral part of parenting. Being overweight is often a family problem, and finding a solution to overweight children often starts with a family making changes together for a healthy family lifestyle.</p><p>I welcome today&#8217;s debate and the Government&#8217;s commitment to promoting and encouraging initiatives to increase physical activity in all Scottish communities. There are many examples of good practice across the country, but we have a very long way to go. The Government&#8217;s obesity route map and the actions that are being taken in line with its principles are a good template for where we should go, but I agree with the Ramblers Association that</p><p>&#8220;action at a population level is required to support wholesale behaviour change country wide to enable the nation to live healthier lifestyles as a default choice, and this preventative action needs appropriate levels of investment.&#8221;</p><p>That investment must start with our children. If they are encouraged from an early age to be physically active, they are likely to maintain that pattern throughout life and to pass on that lifestyle to future generations once they become adults.</p><p>We should seek to remove the barriers to physical activity that many children face nowadays. Our risk-averse, health-and-safety-conscious and litigious society results in many young children being kept indoors, glued to television and computer screens, because of our natural fear of traffic hazards, predatory adults or the discarded equipment of those who depend on injected drugs.</p><p>Children are driven to playgroup, nursery and school, and they might well be prevented from taking part in the rough-and-tumble playground games that taught previous generations of children how to protect themselves as they grew up to face life&#8217;s hazards. Near home, children face signs that say, &#8220;No Ball Games&#8221;, &#8220;No Golf Practice&#8221; and suchlike, because they have not been taught how to behave responsibly outdoors or how to respect their neighbours.</p><p>I realise that I sound old-fashioned, but I feel strongly that children should be given freedom&#8212;within reasonable limits&#8212;to experience informal outdoor activity and interaction with their peers. It is not natural for a young animal to sit still&#8212;most want to be active&#8212;so it is concerning that the most recent Scottish health survey showed that as many as 28 per cent of children do not undertake the recommended amount of physical activity each day.</p><p>That brings me to my amendment, which is on physical education provision for schoolchildren. I note the cross-party consensus on that, about which I am delighted. The Government&#8217;s election pledge five years ago to provide two hours of physical education per week for Scottish pupils was welcome and we are all extremely disappointed that so far it has not been achieved. It might be the case that, as the motion says,</p><p>&#8220;levels of participation in physical activity are increasing, defying the international trend&#8221;,</p><p>but we need to remind the Government that there is no room for complacency and that it should be looking to implement its manifesto commitment.</p><p>Action is being taken in many communities to improve levels of physical activity. Members were given examples ahead of the debate by Ramblers Association Scotland, which I know will be delighted by the commitment that the minister gave to the development of a national walking strategy. We have been given evidence by Paths for All Partnership and the Scottish Sports Association. Yesterday evening, there was an excellent presentation from the inclusive design for getting outdoors consortium, on how older people can be encouraged to undertake regular activity.</p><p>In my area, I immediately think of the parents who are organising a walking bus to school, of groups such as the Grampian Cardiac Rehabilitation Association, and of Aberdeen Sports Village, which runs a hugely popular aerobics class for retired people&#8212;the class is fully subscribed every week and there is a waiting list to join it. The sports village is one of the best-ever developments in Aberdeen and is busy every day of the week with people of all ages undertaking various kinds of exercise.</p><p>My party has committed to a charitable trust fund to give all pupils in Scotland the opportunity to receive at least one full week of residential outdoor education between the ages of 11 and 15, and to opportunities for greater participation in grass-roots sports.</p><p>Everyone can take exercise, whether they are children playing hide-and-seek or other active games or adults walking to work, walking instead of using the lift to go upstairs&#8212;and downstairs, as I see some of the young researchers in the Parliament building doing&#8212;cycling or participating in organised sport. The imminence of the Olympic games and Commonwealth games presents an ideal opportunity to promote physical activity as the best possible legacy of the events.</p><p>The minister announced interesting initiatives, which I hope will be successful. I look forward to hearing how they progress.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-02904.2, to insert, after &#8220;trend&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;notes, however, that the Scottish Government has not succeeded in delivering on its 2007 pledge to provide two hours of physical education per week for all school children in Scotland, but&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am coming to that matter.

It is of as yet unknown etiology, although it appears that environmental factors of various kinds can trigger the disease if there is a genetic predisposition to it. We know that its incidence is at its highest in northern Scotland, that it affects more women than men, and that on average it first presents in young adults, but there are enormous variations within that.</p><p>When my husband was diagnosed with the condition in his late 60s, it came as a relief to him that his quadriceps muscle&#8217;s wasting was not the result of a spinal problem that would require surgery.

Others have rapidly increasing and widespread problems, and many have spells of good health with relapses from time to time.</p><p>Because of the complexity of MS and the variability of its symptoms, it is difficult for people in general to develop a proper understanding of the condition&#8212;hence, the importance of regularly reminding people about it, as happens through national MS week.</p><p>The last time I spoke on MS was in 2004 in a members&#8217; business debate that had been secured by Tricia Marwick. At that time, there was concern about the postcode lottery that neurological patients, including those with MS, faced in accessing appropriate healthcare, and about the need for a code of national standards of care. I am pleased that clinical standards for neurological healthcare were published in 2009 and that health boards are implementing them. I also welcome the Government support for a neurological advisory group to be led by the Neurological Alliance.</p><p>Having checked with NHS Grampian before the debate, I am pleased to say that there have been significant improvements in its area since 2004. As well as the four full-time neurologists who were employed then, there are now another three who work part time, and they are all experienced in diagnosing and managing patients with MS. The waiting time to see a neurologist has come down from a year to 12 weeks for a routine appointment, and to two to three weeks if the appointment is urgent. MS specialist nursing time has almost doubled, and most newly diagnosed patients are contacted within 10 working days and seen within two to three weeks. If an existing patient requires an appointment, the waiting time is based on their needs at the time. For example, it is five working days for a relapse, two to four weeks for continence problems, and 10 weeks otherwise. There is also in Grampian a rehabilitation consultant who has a specialist interest in MS. Things have improved significantly up there, but there is no room for complacency.</p><p>I note the MS Society&#8217;s support for the Scottish Government&#8217;s Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill, which is embarking on its progress through Parliament. I welcome it because I agree that people with MS, and many other disabling conditions, ought to be able to choose the support that is right for them, at the right time. If we get the legislation right, SDS should offer that flexibility. I look forward to working with the MS Society and other interested organisations, as well as with patients and carers, as the bill proceeds.</p><p>I agree with the MS Society, however, that legislation alone will not deliver meaningful choice and control for people with MS, and that SDS must be understood and flexibly applied throughout Scotland, as George Adam said. I am also aware that there is often a lack of services for people to choose from, for example in respite care facilities.</p><p>Four minutes is nowhere near long enough to deal adequately with the many facets of MS and the needs of those who live with it, but I hope that the debate will help to raise awareness of the condition and improve our understanding of what is needed by the many patients in Scotland who are diagnosed with it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to take part in the debate, and I congratulate George Adam on bringing it to the chamber because it is important to acknowledge national MS week, to salute the valuable work that is done by the MS Society and by everyone who supports people who are diagnosed with MS, and to show that we, as parliamentarians, want to do what we can to help people who are coping with MS and other...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80522", "house": "4", "member_id": "80522", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "22666310", "hpos": "265", "gid": "2012-05-02.39.5", "epobject_id": "22666315", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2012-05-02.39.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g39.5", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80522"}, {"body": "<p>I commend Richard Baker for securing the debate. I have disagreed vehemently with him and his Labour colleagues on a number of issues in Aberdeen recently, but we are at one in praise of UCAN and its on-going fundraising campaign. I am delighted that he has brought this unique and excellent charity to Parliament&#8217;s attention.</p><p>As a young anaesthetist in Aberdeen royal infirmary many years ago, I gained a fair bit of experience in my regular gynaecological list of the traumas of major surgery such as hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair. I was also involved in colorectal surgery and prostatectomy. Patients often had to be transfused to replace blood that had been lost, and they were left with sizeable abdominal wounds that took weeks or months to heal enough to let them return to work and their daily lives. Laparoscopy was just beginning to be pioneered as a minimally invasive procedure, and the subsequent development of keyhole surgery has revolutionised procedures such as cholecystectomy and other major abdominal surgery, which has led to early recovery, fewer surgical complications and shorter stays in hospital. The more recent development of robot-assisted surgery has taken minimally invasive surgery a stage further by allowing more surgeons to be trained more easily to undertake complex surgical procedures and benefiting an increasing number of patients, as a result. These are changed days, indeed, since my early medical experiences.</p><p>No one visiting the UCAN care centre in the urological ward in the ARI could fail to be impressed with the care of the patients as they embark on their journey following diagnosis of prostatic and other urological cancers. In the calm and pleasant surroundings of the unit, which were provided in great measure thanks to the generous philanthropy of George Stevenson and his company and others donating to the UCAN charity, patients have their conditions and treatments explained to them. They also meet up with patients who have experienced what they are embarking on, which takes much of the mystery and fear out of what lies ahead. That peer support is freely given as they progress through their journey of care.</p><p>UCAN works hard, too, to raise awareness of prostate cancer, by encouraging the early diagnosis that can make such a difference to the prognosis of that cancer, which is very common in men. Surgeons working in the urological unit have become extremely skilled in operating on those patients using minimally invasive techniques. The next move is to take that a stage further by introducing robot-assisted surgery. When I visited the unit, I was most impressed by the possibilities of that technique&#8212;as explained to me by the consultant who demonstrated them to me&#8212;not only in urology, as we have heard, but in several other specialist areas as well.</p><p>UCAN&#8217;s efforts to procure the equipment for Aberdeen are ambitious and very worthy of support. The &#163;2.5&#160;million that UCAN aims to raise by next year will allow the installation of the robot in the new theatre suite that is required to house it and will bring high-precision robot-assisted surgery to the north-east. That will bring benefit to many local people who require specialist surgery by allowing many more to be treated, and by speeding up operating times and reducing recovery times.</p><p>Many people believe ideologically that NHS provision should come entirely from the public purse, but the &#163;2.5&#160;million that is required to ensure the success of the UCAN project is simply not available within the NHS budget. Those who are spearheading the fundraising efforts are to be highly commended for bringing the latest in advanced surgical technology within the reach of patients in the north-east of Scotland, Orkney and Shetland.</p><p>I wish UCAN every success in this exciting project and hope that it acts as an exemplar for community-minded people in other parts of Scotland, allowing more NHS patients to benefit from techniques and equipment that are currently beyond the reach of the public purse but which, by reducing recovery time and complications, not only can help more patients, but can result in savings within pressured NHS budgets.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666042", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Robot-assisted Surgery"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend Richard Baker for securing the debate.

That is simply not good enough if we are to tackle obesity and its attendant risks of high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes, to name but a few long-term conditions that are prevalent in an underactive population. Cycling can aid weight loss even in the absence of dieting and, as well as having physical benefits, it has been proven to assist in preventing and overcoming depression. Indeed, statistics show that people who undertake regular moderate activity, such as cycling to work, enjoy the wellbeing of people a decade younger, as well as being more alert, more self-confident and better able to cope with stress and anxiety.</p><p>I find walking an excellent way to enjoy our beautiful countryside, and cycling enables people to see even more of it&#8212;that is particularly true of cycling on mountain bikes, which allows people to go on fairly rough terrain. Such activities are a great attraction for tourists, and it is good to see mountain biking tracks being developed at Glenshee, the Lecht and other ski centres, which have, of course, suffered from a lack of snow this winter.</p><p>Studies done last year reckoned that mountain biking contributes &#163;139 million to the Scottish economy, which is expected to rise to &#163;155 million by 2016. So, it is an activity to be encouraged.</p><p>The minister may be interested to know that yesterday I met the chief executive of Glasgow 2014 Ltd, the organiser of the Commonwealth games. We discussed a range of issues, including the role that cycling will play in the games and the possible benefits from the games in terms of a physical activity legacy. In that regard, I note the caveat from Ramblers Scotland that such benefits will be achieved only if there is a massive increase in the proportion of the population who spend much more time walking or cycling.</p><p>I was interested to learn that the stunning new Sir Chris Hoy velodorome is scheduled to open in Glasgow in October, which will allow members of the public to use it for almost two years before the games take place. Given the intention to encourage people to cycle and walk during the course of the games, it would be no bad thing if ministers were to lead by example and get on their bikes instead of into their expensive ministerial cars.</p><p>No debate on cycling would be complete without a mention of the nation&#8217;s favourite cyclist: the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. Boris bikes have now become as much a feature of the capital city as red buses and Big Ben. His groundbreaking initiative of introducing 6,000 sponsored bikes for hire around London and 400 docking stations is, as he himself has said,</p><p>&#8220;a glorious new form of public transport&#8221;.</p><p>Therefore, I was pleased to learn that there are plans to extend the scheme across the east end of the city.

Those people increasingly depend on the staff who look after them for good-quality care.</p><p>In recent years, there have been disturbing reports of people who have been let down by the care services that were available to them. The Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s report on the regulation of care for older people is timely and makes interesting reading, even for those of us who were not directly involved in hearing the evidence or producing the report.</p><p>I was pleased to learn that guidance will be published for care staff who wish to raise concerns about a care service confidentially. I am sure that we all know just how vulnerable older people feel who depend wholly for their health and wellbeing on the care that others provide. Many are frightened to complain, or even just to speak out, in case they get picked on&#8212;I am sure that we have all heard anecdotally of examples of that.</p><p>Government support to raise the profile of the complaints process is welcome, as is the national inquiry line, which was set up in April last year. The line deals with more than 2,000 calls per month on care issues and signposts people to other relevant bodies, but I wonder whether families, carers and users of care services, as well as care staff, are all fully aware of the service. I would like it to be publicised more widely.</p><p>I welcome the commitment and the work that has been done to reduce the time between inspections and the publication of inspection reports. It is important for those who commission care&#8212;whether that is a council, the NHS or families and carers&#8212;to have access to the most recent information as soon as possible before making any decisions about placement in care homes. I would also like a system to alert councils to a very poor inspection report, so that they may consider suspending placements until they are satisfied that significant changes have been made to bring the service up to the quality standards that are expected of it.</p><p>Paragraphs 42 and 43 of the report relate to enforcement powers, which have concerned me for some time. I think that most people in Scotland would like to be sure that, following a poor report, the service will be improved to the extent that it meets quality standards, but that will happen only if rigorous enforcement procedures are implemented.</p><p>Training is another important issue that the report deals with. I have no doubt that better training will lead to higher quality standards, higher morale and, I hope, a higher rating by the care inspectorate. That win-win situation should also lead to a better wage and career structure for many care workers, as many of them are underpaid. That should result in reduced staff turnover&#8212;turnover is another significant problem that faces people who receive care, in particular care at home.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to reduce the prescribing of psychoactive drugs.

Psychoactive and sedative medicines are the easy way to deal with them, but that is wrong and stops a number of people functioning at their best.

I also congratulate Andrea MacArthur on the tremendous work that she has done in pursuing awareness of vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anaemia. I am grateful to the PA Society for highlighting the current serious problems with the way in which PA is diagnosed and treated.</p><p>Members will be aware that it is thought that pernicious anaemia affects around one in 8,000 people over the age of 60, with the likelihood of developing it increasing towards the age of 80. It also sometimes affects children and may result in educational problems. It is more prevalent in women than it is in men. Symptoms include tiredness, headaches, breathlessness and heart palpitations as well as mouth ulcers, weight loss and blurred vision. Everyday tasks can become difficult for sufferers, and they often feel isolated.</p><p>Pernicious anaemia is caused by a lack of vitamin B12, which is vital for manufacture of new red blood cells. When B12 is in short supply, fewer red blood cells are produced, they are abnormally large in size, and they do not last as long as they should, so anaemia develops.</p><p>PA develops when the body becomes unable to absorb vitamin B12 properly from foods such as meat, eggs, dairy products and green vegetables. Normally a protein that is known as intrinsic factor, which is made in the stomach, attaches to vitamin B12 and carries it through the intestinal wall into the blood stream, but in pernicious anaemia, the stomach cells that produce intrinsic factor become damaged, so vitamin B12 is no longer absorbed and a deficiency develops.</p><p>The petition that is before us today rightly calls on Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to review the diagnosis and treatment of pernicious anaemia. Reading Mrs MacArthur&#8217;s testimony, one cannot fail to be moved by the her account of what she describes as a &#8220;forgotten illness&#8221;. In evidence to the committee, Mrs MacArthur said&#8212;incredibly humbly, in my view&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;solely due to the doctors that I have, I fared well.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 15 November 2011; c 238.]</p><p>However, it is unacceptable that despite demonstrating the signs of pernicious anaemia for 13 years, Mrs MacArthur was never tested. Indeed the Pernicious Anaemia Society has evidence to prove that today&#8217;s doctors do not, in the main, view many of the symptoms that are experienced by patients as being indicative of pernicious anaemia.</p><p>The lack of testing that is available to GPs and common misdiagnosis are at the heart of the petition that has led to today&#8217;s debate. Coming from a medical background, I fully accept that the symptoms of pernicious anaemia can often be mistaken for those of other conditions, but it is extremely important that GPs become better trained in diagnosis, because prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible nerve damage.</p><p>Diagnosis of B12 deficiency is difficult for two reasons. First, the lower threshold for determining deficiency is too low, so that patients who have all the symptoms of deficiency are not picked up because they are one or two points above the test&#8217;s threshold. Secondly, the test that is available in Scotland does not distinguish between active and inactive B12. The active form plays a part in forming red blood cells, while the inactive form is just that, and the available test does not take into account that the inactive form could be as high as 90 per cent of the patient&#8217;s vitamin B12 content.</p><p>Also, unfortunately, the classic test that was used to diagnose vitamin B12 absorption&#8212;the Schilling test&#8212;is no longer available; I was surprised by what Richard Simpson said about the website to which he referred. The test that doctors currently use to look for intrinsic factor antibody is only 30 per cent to 40 per cent reliable and it does not identify those who do not produce any intrinsic factor. That leads to patients who still have a lack of B12 producing a negative test. It is &#8220;a mess&#8221;, as one professor of general practice is quoted as saying.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s request for its comments on the petition was not entirely substantive. It said that all GPs should be able to manage any patient who presents with pernicious anaemia, but that is clearly not the case. Mrs MacArthur also made the valuable point that PA is often dismissed as being something that only the elderly suffer from or as being merely a vitamin deficiency. That clearly fails to acknowledge what a serious condition pernicious anaemia is, which is why we need the medical profession to acknowledge that.</p><p>I will deal with the approach to the treatment of PA and vitamin B12 deficiency in my closing remarks, but for the moment I end by saying that I am glad that my colleagues and I on the Public Petitions Committee pressed for the matter to be brought before members this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662509", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pernicious Anaemia and Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Understanding and Treatment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many members do, I welcome today&#8217;s debate&#8212;which is the first Public Petitions Committee debate and the first time that this serious matter has been discussed in this session of Parliament.

Sadly, that is not the experience of all patients. Members will have read on the website of the Pernicious Anaemia Society&#8212;an organisation that, like others, does tremendous work&#8212;of the concerns of many patients who have been told that B12 injections are not justified because they are not deficient enough. Other members have spoken of how testing does not lead to effective treatment. The petition makes it clear that adopting the new active vitamin B12 test would achieve early diagnosis.</p><p>Although pernicious anaemia is still treated by vitamin B12 injection, the frequency of administration has changed significantly over the years. When I was in clinical practice, the injections were given monthly. I had not realised that the situation had changed until the committee was told that, in 1974, the frequency was changed to every two months and that, in the 1980s, the frequency became every three months. Apparently, the medicine did not change in any way, and no explanation was given for the change to the frequency of administration. In France, where vitamin B12 can be bought at the same strength from any pharmacy&#8212;I do not know whether it is to be taken orally or by injection&#8212;the literature that comes with it states that it should be taken monthly. It appears that people in France are getting three times as much treatment as people in the United Kingdom and we do not understand why.</p><p>A number of important questions need to be asked and, despite what Malcolm Chisholm said, it is a matter for the Government as well as for medical bodies north and south of the border. Having heard the debate this afternoon, and given the disparities in treatment throughout the UK, does the minister accept that it would be at least useful to learn more about the serious issues surrounding PA and its future diagnosis and treatment from all stakeholders? Will he commit to setting up discussions between his civil servants and those in other parts of the UK to establish some clarity and commonality for patients throughout the country?</p><p>I close by adding my thanks and gratitude to Andrea MacArthur for bringing the issue to the Parliament&#8217;s attention.

Under the network supply review, spending on network television production in Scotland has doubled since 2007 and will continue to rise, even when budgets in London and other parts of England are being reduced. The BBC has undertaken to grow network TV production in Scotland to 6.1 per cent of eligible spend this year and to 8.6 per cent by 2016.

David Davidson secured the Parliament&#8217;s attention back in 2001 when he put in the public domain his daughter Suzy&#8217;s battle with anorexia nervosa. At that time in Scotland, support in the NHS for sufferers and their families was simply not available, either in the form of in-patient facilities or post-discharge psychosocial support, for what is a complex medical problem that is often accompanied by serious underlying mental health issues.</p><p>If patients were assessed as requiring in-patient treatment, they tended to be admitted to general psychiatric wards. The only residential unit that was dedicated to eating disorders was at the privately run Priory hospital, which was accessible to NHS patients only if their treatment there was funded by their local health board on the recommendation of a consultant. Intensive day-care support is needed after discharge and, at that time, few facilities were available within reach of the patients who required them.</p><p>Thankfully, things have moved on&#8212;at least to a degree. Following the referral of a petition by Gr&#225;inne Smith of North East Eating Disorders Support to the then Health Committee, of which my former colleague was a member, the committee held an inquiry into eating disorders in late 2004 and early 2005. That important inquiry, which took oral evidence in Dennis Robertson&#8217;s home town of Stonehaven, exposed the problems that patients with eating disorders and their families face. The framework for mental health services in Scotland that was published by the Scottish Executive in 2001 had merely been paid lip service and had not been implemented, mainly because there had been no real drive to implement it&#8212;it was left up to health boards to take action if they so decided.</p><p>The early diagnosis and referral to specialists that is so important if the condition is not to become chronic, and therefore more difficult to treat, depended on a GP workforce whose undergraduate training did not focus on eating disorders as a distinct issue within psychiatry rotations, so the Health Committee recommended that Government and the Royal College of General Practitioners look to improve that situation. It is clear from Dennis Robertson&#8217;s extremely moving speech that that has not yet been adequately achieved.</p><p>The committee also recommended that the costs of developing regional in-patient services and of establishing a managed clinical network for eating disorders be investigated, and that the Scottish Executive, as well as looking to ensure more specialist training of doctors, pursue proposals to develop specialist training for psychiatric nurses, teachers and social workers.</p><p>Thankfully, following that important inquiry things have improved somewhat. Certainly in my area, there is now a well-developed north of Scotland managed clinical network for eating disorders. Since it opened in 2009, the Eden unit in Aberdeen has provided specialist residential care in dedicated surroundings for people with eating disorders and, recently, has been running at almost full capacity.</p><p>Out-patient services have also been busy in Grampian, Tayside and Highland. NHS Tayside&#8217;s eating disorder service, which is based in Dundee, runs out-patient clinics in Angus, Perth and Kinross, and NHS Highland&#8212;following some staffing shortages&#8212;is now able to provide a comprehensive support service that is run by staff with accredited specialist training. The north of Scotland is now reasonably well catered for, and the new West Lothian unit will allow for similar care in the south-east of the country. However, as we heard from Dennis Robertson, there is still a long way to go, and it is important to continue to raise awareness of eating disorders so that they can be diagnosed and treated early and effectively.</p><p>There are still people losing their lives to the complications of these serious conditions&#8212;as Dennis Robertson knows only too well&#8212;but there has been significant progress during the lifetime of the Scottish Parliament.

Not being on the committee, I read the report in full. Citizens Advice Scotland kinship care service said that</p><p>&#8220;kinship carers of looked-after children often feel like the poor relations of foster carers,&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;kinship carers of non-looked-after children feel even lower down the ladder of access to services and support.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 17 January 2012; c 610.]</p><p>The words of Tommy McFall, who has looked after his granddaughter for 11 years and who took part in that discussion, are worth repeating. He said:</p><p>&#8220;kinship carers do not want ... parity with foster carers ... We are arguing that the children we look after in kinship care should have parity, as the Scottish Parliament decided in 2007.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;I make a brief point about other support services, which we sometimes miss. We are talking about some of the most vulnerable and damaged children in Scotland ... I have heard people say that counselling and psychological services are available but, believe me ... support for these kids ... is not there&#8221;.</p><p>He also said:</p><p>&#8220;There are not enough support services, psychological services or counselling services out there ... When we talk about priorities, the most vulnerable children in Scotland should be at the top of our list of priorities and we should stop making excuses.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 17 January 2012; c 621-2.]</p><p>As we know, kinship carers play a hugely valuable role and give enormous, unquantifiable support to their families. They need support, they need respite and they need freedom from serious financial worries. The willing self-sacrifice of people such as Mr McFall gives many children a much better early life than they could otherwise expect and at a fraction of the cost, were the state to be providing their care.

Indeed, Nicola Sturgeon has spoken directly to Iain Duncan Smith about the issue, as was confirmed in evidence to the Health and Sport Committee by Neil Couling of the DWP, who said that ministers had been impressed by the case that had been made from Scotland. It is clear that what has been a long-standing matter of concern, not just under the current coalition, is being taken seriously and it is to be hoped that progress will be made.</p><p>We owe it to kinship carers to find a resolution to their problems.

It is now fewer than 950 days until the Commonwealth games come to Glasgow&#8212;members will note that I am slightly less precise about the number of days than the previous speakers were.</p><p>The games have been a long time in the making, since Glasgow was announced as the host city in 2007. We must remember that we still have another two and a half years until they become a reality, and that before then there is a lot more hard work ahead.</p><p>I believe that the games will be good news not only for Glasgow and the surrounding Strathclyde area but for Scotland as a whole. Like the London Olympics next year, they will be an occasion for everyone the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to celebrate and be involved. Glasgow 2014 will be an opportunity to promote everything that is great about the British spirit and, of course, to boost our national economy.</p><p>In that regard, I think that all of us in the chamber would agree that among the most significant and, to my mind, far-sighted aspects of the games are their Scotland-wide inclusive approach and the legacy that we hope they will leave.</p><p>Although we Conservatives are happy to support the Government&#8217;s motion, we will also support the Labour amendment, which rightly takes a slightly cautious approach to the success of the games&#8217; legacy. Evidence from previous events suggests that it will be difficult for the Commonwealth games to deliver all the objectives in terms of providing a legacy. Although multisports events undoubtedly deliver tangible benefits to their host cities, results in the past have been limited. Although it is right to set high standards and aspirations&#8212;it is very good to hear from the minister that so far the Government&#8217;s plans are on track&#8212;it is still important that we retain a sense of realism about the difficulties that might be ahead.</p><p>The Labour amendment calls on the Government to update the Parliament and, therefore, the Scottish people on progress on the games&#8217; legacy. That is a sensible point to make, so I was glad to hear from Patricia Ferguson that the minister has agreed to do that.</p><p>Given that the Commonwealth games will be the largest multisports event that Scotland has ever hosted, it is only right that activities will not be confined to the west coast. In my home city of Aberdeen, there is a rolling programme of events involving schools and local organisations. As far as I know, we have five community sports hub sites, and a youth legacy ambassador has been recruited for Aberdeen. Only last month, we saw the opening of the new &#163;700,000 international artificial-grass football pitch at Banks O&#8217;Dee sports club. The new state-of-the-art sports village is running at full capacity and is involving people from all sections of the population in Aberdeen, including students&#8212;I gather that there is quite a long waiting list to get in. Of course, we are also eagerly awaiting the completion of our new Olympic-size swimming pool at Linksfield.</p><p>Further afield in Aberdeenshire, the impact of the games is demonstrated by the awarding of some 63 community grants by the Big Lottery Fund. Those grants are aimed at bringing people and communities together, breaking down barriers and supporting existing groups to take part in new competitions.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that at least 10 athletes from my region, which is North East Scotland, competed at the previous Commonwealth games in Delhi, including silver medallist trap shooter Shona Marshall and&#8212;much more local to me&#8212;gold medallist swimmer Hannah Miley, from Inverurie.</p><p>Ultimately, one of the key legacies that is intended as an off-shoot from the games is an aspiration to improve the health of our nation through greater physical activity. In that sense, I commend the Government and Glasgow City Council for launching their programme three years ago.</p><p>The focus on getting more disabled people and people over 65 years of age engaged in physical activities is significant, given that those two sections of our society are sometimes ignored when it comes to sports activities in general.</p><p>As we know, the four themes of the overall games legacy of Scotland are &#8220;active&#8221;, &#8220;connected&#8221;, &#8220;sustainable&#8221; and &#8220;flourishing&#8221;. Under the sustainable theme, I note that environmental projects that have benefited include the development of community woodlands and the Clyde walkway pilot project. The minister might be interested to know that a group called the Children&#8217;s Orchard attended the Public Petitions Committee last week. Its aim is to encourage local authorities, schools and community groups to plant fruit trees in schools and community settings so that children, their families and the wider community can learn how to grow, harvest and enjoy their local seasonal fruit at the same time as they develop their physical fitness and general knowledge. Will the minister look favourably on the Children&#8217;s Orchard petition&#8212;when it comes to her&#8212;which is asking for support from the Scottish Government as part of the Commonwealth legacy? I am sure that she would agree that that worthwhile project also meets the aims of the Government&#8217;s national food and drink policy, recipe for success.</p><p>We in the Conservatives welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to pursuing a lasting legacy from the Commonwealth games for Scotland and the UK.

In the late 1960s, there was hardly a mention in Britain&#8217;s statute books of disability but Alf Morris, who was deeply affected by his father&#8217;s disabilities, set about drafting a private member&#8217;s bill that encapsulated ideas such as providing help at home, assessing a person&#8217;s needs and&#8212;most important&#8212;making local authorities responsible for ensuring that the environment around disabled people was accessible. Despite what was, at best, Government indifference, Lord Morris&#8217;s bill was passed as the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and, four years later, he became the first minister for the disabled anywhere in the world.</p><p>However, there was still much more to do, such as getting disabled people out of institutions in which they had been incarcerated as a result of wrong assessments and giving them the freedom to lead independent lives. Disability benefit was eventually introduced and, in 1995, John Major&#8217;s Conservative Government passed the Disability Discrimination Act, which made it unlawful to discriminate against those with a disability when providing services and, in most cases, when employing people.</p><p>Further legislation in the past decade has impacted on and benefited the lives of disabled people; indeed, one example that will be apparent to all of us in the chamber has been the requirement on us either to alter our constituency offices or to make alternative arrangements to ensure that we are accessible to our disabled constituents. Although that is progress, it should not have taken legislation to make that happen.</p><p>I applaud the mood of the debate but I am slightly disappointed that, when we are here to celebrate the struggle for equality for disabled people&#8212;and rightly so&#8212;the second part of the motion makes a partisan point that I know Siobhan McMahon and others feel strongly about but which I feel would be better left out of this debate and left to tomorrow&#8217;s discussions. However, I finish by quoting Alf Morris, who, last year, said about disabled rights:</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like talking about what I or my bill achieved. That way lies complacency.

We welcome that move as an important step towards improving care services for older people and having services that are developed locally in partnership with Government, the NHS, local authorities and others, led by clinical and social care professionals and tailored to meet the needs of local people and their families and carers.</p><p>We all know about the problems of securing quality and consistency in care for older people and the difficulties in finding them appropriate community provision after discharge from hospital, often as a result of the failure to sort out funding between local authorities and the NHS&#8212;the so-called cost shunting that goes on. Although things have undoubtedly improved in recent years, there is no room for complacency. Delayed discharge is creeping up again and the demand for care for older people is set to rise steadily as the number of frail elderly people increases.</p><p>In these difficult times, we have to make the best possible use of resources, human and financial, and all parties have come to realise that that can be achieved only through effective integration between the NHS and local authorities. This year, all parties had an election manifesto commitment to that effect, although each set out a different approach to achieving that goal. My party went into the election seeking to merge the health and social care budgets and integrate social care for older people into the general health budget under NHS control. Although that goes a step further than the current Government proposals, the decision in Highland to give adult social care powers to the NHS, with councils having responsibility for child community services, chimes well with our manifesto proposals.</p><p>As we know, the integrated resource framework model chosen by the SNP to develop systems for resources to follow the patient between partner organisations, with the intention of delivering care in the most appropriate setting for the patient, is being trialled in four different health board areas. We await the assessment of those trials with interest. The Scottish Government and Lord Sutherland favour the Highland model of lead commissioning, but the Royal College of Nursing, in particular, is flagging up difficulties in fully implementing it by the target date of next April. As she is much closer to the trial than I am, my colleague Mary Scanlon will deal with it in her speech.</p><p>Whatever model is used to achieve the integration of health and social care, the aim has to be better outcomes for patients, with improved local services that provide patient-centred care based on an assessment of individual needs and focused on helping more of them to live in their own homes rather than in a care home or hospital. However, in order to achieve that, we will need more input from social care professionals and clinicians into local service planning, and NHS boards and councils will have to be required to produce integrated budgets for older people's services, as proposed by the Government. Indeed, we are pleased with the proposals in that respect.</p><p>Attitudes have to change, too. We need strong leadership and co-operation between clinicians and social care professionals, who must put aside cultural differences and overcome the ingrained organisational practices that often get in the way of integrating and sharing services, such as segregated training and professional rivalry. I found the briefing paper from the Association of Directors of Social Work unhelpful in that regard. Such problems will need to be overcome by effective transition management if better integration is to be achieved.</p><p>The change fund has allowed the shift to community provision to begin. I agree that legislation will be needed to ensure the development of better local services for local people. The existing CHPs have become overly bureaucratic, and from their inception they have failed to engage clinicians, particularly at primary care level, as the cabinet secretary said, but also at secondary care level. They have also failed to bridge the gap between health and social care.</p><p>A radical overhaul is overdue&#8212;the British Medical Association made the point forcefully in its briefing paper. I welcome the proposed health and social care partnerships, which will be jointly accountable to the NHS and councils, as well as to the cabinet secretary, the local council leader and the public, for the delivery at local level of nationally agreed outcomes.</p><p>There is enormous enthusiasm for greater integration of health and social care for older people&#8212;from the RCN, carers organisations and Macmillan Cancer Support, for example. All those organisations are eager to become involved in helping to shape the change process and the new legislation, and it is important that such organisations are involved from the outset. I hope and am confident that the Government will welcome their input.</p><p>There is a fair wind behind the Government&#8217;s proposals for shifting the balance of care. I hope that the framework that is proposed for the delivery of nationally agreed outcomes will allow delivery mechanisms and structures that best suit local needs and priorities to be developed locally.</p><p>We are at the beginning of what could become an exciting journey of achievement in patient care, but a great deal remains to be done to change attitudes and working practices. It is very much work in progress, which we will follow with interest.

The central focus of the carers strategy for 2010 to 2015 is to identify, assess and support carers in a consistent way, taking account of their personal circumstances. I welcome the minister&#8217;s progress report this afternoon.</p><p>In the few minutes at my disposal, I shall focus largely on young carers in the north-east of Scotland. However, I first highlight the concern that has been expressed to me by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers that the outcomes sought in the strategy for adult carers are not always being achieved in reality, with disparity across the country, from local authority to local authority and even within local authorities, in getting support for carers and cared-for people.</p><p>In common with other political parties, we fully support the integration of health and social care services. The Government&#8217;s recently renewed focus on delayed discharge and its commitment to ensure that, from next year, at least 20 per cent of the change fund spend for older people&#8217;s services will be dedicated to supporting carers to continue caring for older people are very welcome. Nevertheless, there is real concern that caring families might feel pressurised to get relatives home before effective support is in place. We need to know that the Government will ensure that a shift takes place from acute care to community settings and that that will be evaluated properly.</p><p>Discharge with inadequate home care can lead to early readmission, which is demoralising for patients and costly for the NHS&#8212;I experienced that with an elderly relative a few years back. More focus is needed on older couples who look after each other, who often have little or no contact with the statutory services and are becoming increasingly frail. With proper support, such people can remain at home for longer and avoid unplanned admission to hospital or care homes. Emergency planning should be in place to ensure continuity of care for a cared-for person should their unpaid carer become ill or die. I welcome the proposals that the minister described on that.</p><p>Access to respite is another important issue for carers. As we have heard, the concern is that some local authorities might cut back on that as resources become tightly stretched. I was encouraged to hear the minister&#8217;s acknowledgement of that concern and his on-going commitment to short breaks for families and carers, which chimes with our manifesto commitment.</p><p>Particular issues affect groups that support individuals who are affected by alcohol or substance abuse. Many young carers and kinship carers fall into that category.</p><p>That brings me to the Voluntary Service Aberdeen young carers project, which works in the city of Aberdeen and in Aberdeenshire. VSA began identifying and supporting young carers 11 years ago and has continued to develop that support. It has a hub that is known as its chill-out zone in the heart of the city, where a variety of identified needs can be met in one setting. There, young carers can let their hair down, meet their friends and chat about their problems and frustrations over a cup of tea or a can of juice. They get peace to do their homework and access to computers, which they need but which might not be available at home. On occasions, they even have the chance to get much-needed sleep.</p><p>To raise awareness of young carers and the issues that affect them, the VSA project has worked directly with pupils in the school setting to deliver a personal and social education lesson, which has been developed and evaluated in a couple of local academies and has already identified previously unknown young carers. Other schools are interested and it is hoped that the PSE session will eventually be delivered to first and second-year pupils in every academy in Aberdeen.</p><p>Direct advocacy support is given in a variety of situations, which include dealing with education, health, family and social services, to ensure that the young carer has a voice and is listened to and involved in all support plans. Homework-cum-respite groups are run weekly to support primary and secondary-age carers, who are helped by a part-time education support worker.</p><p>A part-time male support worker acts as a role model and supports all young carers. That has resulted in male young carers seeking advice and support, and the number of them who are involved in the project has increased. Another part-time worker works with 17-year-old carers to plan for the continuing support that they might need as young adults. A pilot substance misuse post is in place to target children and young people who are carers as a result of parental substance misuse&#8212;it is hoped that the pilot will be developed. Group work, one-to-one support and partnership working with community groups, social work trainees, the local authority and the NHS all take place. School holiday activities are provided, as are two respite breaks&#8212;one for older young carers at Easter and one for primary-age carers in the summer.</p><p>All that&#8212;it is a lot&#8212;is managed by Mary Drever of VSA, who has a dual role as manager and support worker and works tirelessly for her young carers. Her working team is small, but it provides a variety of services to meet needs. Only one post is full time.</p><p>The strategy is working very well in Aberdeen city, and enormous strides have been made since I first met Mary Drever seven years ago and brought a group of her young carers to visit the Parliament. Young carers from Aberdeen have also visited at least two young carers festivals; I welcome the Government&#8217;s continued commitment to funding for the festival. There are still issues with equity of provision in rural Aberdeenshire and still more support is needed, but it is so far, so good in the north-east.</p><p>As far as I can gather, the young carers strategy appears to be working better than the strategy for older carers. The Government must set out how it aims to fulfil its vision for all carers. We are encouraged that progress is gradually being made, but there is still a great deal to do.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-01399.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; however acknowledges that this is a work in progress, and calls on the Scottish Government to put carers ahead of targets by clarifying how it will achieve the vision and outcomes contained in the strategy.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In recognising the enormous contribution that carers and young carers make to society and to the Scottish economy through the considerable sums of money that they save in undertaking services that would otherwise fall to the state, social care and the national health service to provide, we very much welcome this debate on the implementation of the carers and young carers strategies in the...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80522", "house": "4", "member_id": "80522", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "22655398", "hpos": "15", "gid": "2011-11-23.1.11", "epobject_id": "22655409", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-11-23.1.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g1.11", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80522"}, {"body": "<p>I congratulate Siobhan McMahon on securing the debate.

Although only 43 north-east schools are currently affiliated to the heartstart scheme that the BHF administers, that is not to say that more schools have not had training from other organisations, such as those that I mentioned. I certainly support the drive to increase the number of schoolchildren who are competent to administer ELS.</p><p>Six years ago, a group of medical students at the University of Aberdeen who were newly trained in CPR set up their own heartstart scheme, affiliated to heartstart UK, with the aim of teaching life support in local schools. They hoped to pass on their skills to younger people and give them the confidence to deal with challenging emergency situations.</p><p>They had a great deal of help from heartstart UK and university staff in setting up their scheme, and they had plans to extend it to students from Robert Gordon University&#8212;also in Aberdeen&#8212;to form a collaboration that, as well as providing a community service, would enable students from different areas of healthcare to interact and work together, hopefully building up relationships that would continue into professional life. I have tried to get an update on the scheme from the University of Aberdeen but, unfortunately, the university did not get back to me in time for the debate.</p><p>However, there is an on-going collaborative project, which may or may not be associated with the scheme that I just described. It involves the teaching of basic life-support skills by final-year medical students from the University of Aberdeen and final-year nursing students from Robert Gordon University. The recipients of that teaching project are students from the faculty of health and social care, and it has been received with enthusiasm by all students and staff involved. The medical and nursing students are trained together and work in pairs to train their fellow students. It is hoped that, following the success of the project, the concept of peer teaching and an interprofessional approach will become a sustainable part of the curriculum for future students. I can also see how school pupils who are trained could then teach their peers the same skills.</p><p>Another collaborative project involves the Grampian Cardiac Rehabilitation Association&#8212;a self-help group of heart-attack survivors who are doing sterling work in Aberdeenshire and with whom I have been connected. Through a partnership between St Andrew&#8217;s Ambulance Association and RGU, the association&#8217;s members have undergone training in CPR and the use of six automated defibrillators that they have purchased, so that they can help to ensure the continuing safety of their cardiac rehabilitation classes throughout the region.</p><p>I appreciate that I have digressed a little from the motion, but I fully endorse any moves to train people of all ages&#8212;from school pupils, to students, to citizens in general&#8212;in CPR and emergency life support. The heartstart scheme is doing a fantastic job, and I am happy to support it and encourage its expansion. I just wanted to emphasise the benefit of collaborative projects in increasing emergency life-support and CPR skills right across our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655380", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Heartstart"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Siobhan McMahon on securing the debate.

As Jackie Baillie has said, there are already problems with how change fund money is being spent.</p><p>At their core, rehabilitation and enablement are known to be effective not only in improving the independence of individuals but in reducing the cost to the taxpayer of care services. The 2007 framework expands the style of healthcare delivery outlined in the earlier document, &#8220;Delivering for Health&#8221;, which I believe was the first real attempt to define rehabilitation. Similarly, its sister manifesto, &#8220;Changing Lives&#8221;, highlighted the need for a greater emphasis on cross-agency co-operation, with a particular focus on delivering services close to where people live, offering services on a suitable and reasonable timescale and promoting a greater stress on anticipatory care as well as supporting individuals and carers in the self-management of long-term conditions. That is key to a successful future for the wellbeing of people in this country.</p><p>That revolutionary shift in how the NHS works, which has taken it from a hospital-driven service to one that is embedded in the community, is important as it represents a significant attempt to make services more patient focused. The framework was also the first to instruct NHS boards to appoint rehabilitation co-ordinators to measure existing services, implement the recommendations of the national implementation group, redesign services, where appropriate, and promote new treatment styles. As the minister has said, we are some way along the road to success in that regard, but there are many challenges ahead that must still be met.</p><p>Another extremely significant point is the emphasis on the greater use of e-health to increase service provision, for example when local authorities work to develop local transport for rehabilitation purposes. There is enormous untapped potential for telehealth in many spheres, including rehabilitation and enablement. My colleague, Mary Scanlon, will touch on that point in her speech.</p><p>There are areas of concern that were highlighted by the Parliament&#8217;s Health and Sport Committee when it conducted an investigation into the rehabilitation framework three years ago. Among its findings was a call for better information and data on what services are available, greater multi-agency working through joint management structures, better workforce planning and training, and greater co-operation between health and social care services.</p><p>As Jackie Baillie said&#8212;I totally agree&#8212;there is a key concern about allied health professionals. I totally agree with the minister that AHPs are vital to patients in their health journey, and he outlined the many areas where they play a leadership role in patient care. That is clearly very important. However, AHPs such as physiotherapists find that once they are qualified they are unable to get positions. Indeed, in 2007, unemployment among physios stood at 71 per cent, with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy predicting a crisis in recruitment.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654203", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation and Enablement"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The change fund arrangements are welcome, but they will need to be closely monitored to ensure their effectiveness.

The Royal College of Nursing is naturally concerned that that may indicate the financial pressures&#8212;at which Jackie Baillie hinted&#8212;that health boards have been facing on the ground, despite the comparatively positive position of the NHS in the Scottish budget.</p><p>The ready availability of properly trained health personnel working together as teams&#8212;which is in itself important&#8212;is clearly essential if the Government is to realise its ambition to move away from reactive, unplanned and episodic care to a service that gives on-going co-ordinated and personalised support.</p><p>With an increasingly ageing population requiring support, particularly when the patient is moving from acute care into the community, staff availability is crucial. There must be proper co-ordination between health and social care, which is why all parties have come to realise that those services need to be integrated, however that may be done.

I must say that I was extremely pleased with my treatment in the NHS and the teamwork of the various professionals who were involved in my care. Pre-operatively, the occupational therapist investigated my home circumstances and ensured that the necessary aids, such as raised toilets and a perch stool for the shower, were in place before I was discharged from hospital. Post-operatively, I was shown how to get in and out of bed without stressing the new hip joint, and the physiotherapists supervised the necessary exercises and provided the walking aids that I required for the first six weeks of recovery. I have to say that, even though I am a medic, I was a good patient and did all my exercises religiously every day.</p><p>Once the staff were satisfied that I could cope unaided, I was discharged without further support, which raised a few eyebrows. However, if necessary I would have had physiotherapy after discharge, and therefore I was not at all concerned that I was not immediately referred for physiotherapy.</p><p>My only concern was about the lack of nursing staff on the ward at night. Day staff were pleasant, efficient and plentiful, and those on night duty did a terrific job, but it was hard for one charge nurse and one auxiliary to cope with a whole ward of post-operative patients, six of whom were on intravenous antibiotics and a few of whom needed significant help to get in and out of bed.

It is self-evident that the money that is saved could be put to a variety of clinical uses, such as more drug courses for breast cancer or Alzheimer&#8217;s. However, the statistic that struck me most forcefully was that, if the &#163;44 million that is currently wasted on prescription drugs was saved, nearly 11,900 patients could potentially be relieved of the severe pain that I endured earlier this year, prior to hip replacement surgery, and could return to a normal, productive lifestyle&#8212;I accept that that might be labouring a point, as I mentioned that earlier this afternoon.</p><p>As we have heard today, recent research has shown that, although not all prescribed medicine waste is avoidable, it can certainly be reduced, and often to the clinical benefit of patients.</p><p>When my husband was in general practice, he regularly found unused prescribed medicines in patients&#8217; homes. That is not only wasteful but is also a potential hazard to any youngsters who come across them. They included antibiotics that were unused because patients felt better before their treatment was completed, pills not taken because of side effects and repeat prescriptions that had been ordered unnecessarily, resulting in stockpiles of them building up in medicine cupboards while the recipients were selective with regard to which pills they swallowed, resulting in less than optimal treatment of whatever long-term condition they were meant to treat.</p><p>I am sure that my husband&#8217;s experience was not unique&#8212;Richard Simpson&#8217;s experience clearly agrees with it. If that experience is multiplied across households in Scotland and the many care homes in which patients are on multiple and often changing drugs for long-term conditions, it is not difficult to see where savings can be made.</p><p>It is therefore encouraging that health boards are at last seriously trying to take action in that regard. We have already heard about NHS Forth Valley&#8217;s effective eWARD scheme and the awareness-raising campaigns that are being undertaken by other health boards in Scotland.</p><p>In February this year, GPs and pharmacists in NHS Grampian joined with those in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles in a bid to educate patients about their treatment and to help them understand more about the medicines that they are taking and why they are taking them. The campaign was supported by television advertising and the colourful campaign materials were displayed in pharmacies and GP surgeries to raise awareness of medicine waste among patients and, importantly, carers, with more information to be found on a new national website. Patients were encouraged to have regular reviews of their prescribed medicines with their pharmacist or prescribing doctor, to iron out any issues that they might have with taking their medication.</p><p>A senior pharmacy representative said at the launch of the campaign:</p><p>&#8220;The least cost effective medicine is one that is sub-optimally or not used at all once supplied. It is estimated that up to half of all medicines are not taken as the prescriber intended&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>I am sure that members agree that that is a frightening statistic. She went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Real value for money can only be achieved if the NHS supports patients to get more benefit from their medicines.&#8221;</p><p>I commend the recent and on-going campaigns by health boards and I encourage the minister to take up the Royal Pharmaceutical Society&#8217;s suggestion and organise a higher-profile national campaign, which involves community pharmacists alongside GPs and hospital practitioners. Community pharmacists undoubtedly have enormous untapped potential to help patients to understand and optimise their use of prescribed medication.

As other members have mentioned, it is well timed, just eight days before remembrance day&#8212;a day on which as a nation we show our respect and support for all those who are or have been active in the defence of our nation, sometimes suffering serious injuries or death in pursuit of their duty on our behalf. Many speakers, notably Tavish Scott, have graphically described how great that suffering can be.</p><p>My native north-east Scotland has a long and proud military history. Prior to entering Parliament, I was privileged to volunteer at the Gordon Highlanders museum in Aberdeen, where I met many visitors who were close to veterans of that respected regiment and keen to be reminded of its history, especially in the two world wars of the 20th century.</p><p>The Gordon Highlanders, freemen of the city of Aberdeen, are one of the great names in Scottish history and one of the most celebrated regiments of the British Army. They are renowned as a courageous fighting force with an exceptional reputation for good conduct, professionalism and steadfastness, and their legacy lives on through the current serving soldiers of the Highlanders, 4th battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland.</p><p>Today, our forces and their families are still making sacrifices for us. In recent years, with conflicts in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, the public have wanted to show their personal support for the UK&#8217;s armed forces wherever they have served or are serving. The fact that we have so many outstanding charities working to help and support our forces is testimony to the good will and support that the Scottish public have shown towards them. Like others, I pay tribute to all the service charities and veterans organisations that do so much great work to help those who have served in our armed forces, several of which have been mentioned this morning.</p><p>Specifically, I highlight the work of the North-East Scotland Disabled Veterans Association, which is a self-help group that was set up four years ago by veterans of the armed forces in the north-east who were experiencing disability either through their service or otherwise. The association now has more than 40 members, who have served in every conflict around the world from Korea to the Falklands, including three who served in the second world war.</p><p>Financed completely by their own fundraising efforts, the members provide social activities, comradeship and friendship, chaplaincy, counselling, alternative therapies, computer studies and the opportunity to take part in memorials locally and nationally. They also provide guards of honour at the funerals of the association&#8217;s members. They have taken members who were prisoners of war during the second world war back to their place of battle and capture for the first time, enabling those veterans to find some closure after all these years. From day to day, the association provides an understanding support mechanism, drawing disabled veterans out from years of exclusion and loneliness to be supported by those who share their experiences.</p><p>Each year, the nation comes together to pay its respects to all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and to the families who they have left behind. Each year, it is right that we express our unequivocal support for our armed forces, wherever they may be deployed. I was interested to hear Liz Smith&#8217;s examples of school projects, which indicate that young people, too, are aware of the debt that we owe our armed forces.</p><p>Like others, I put on record my admiration for all those who work at the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh. The Scottish poppy appeal marks its 90th anniversary this year. The massive &#163;2.3&#160;million-plus that the appeal raises each year, combined with other year-round fundraising, allows the charity to provide financial assistance to thousands of ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen as well as to fund specialist services such as long-term care, housing and employment opportunities. However, as Alex Fergusson and other members have said, the work of the many charities that currently help veterans highlights the urgent need for better services for them.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s endorsement of the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to the military covenant. I welcome, too, its intention to strengthen the provision of, and access to, health, transport and housing services&#8212;all of which are extremely important to the wellbeing and reintegration into the community of many veterans&#8212;as well as many other support mechanisms for ex-service personnel that are provided via the private, public and voluntary sectors. All must work together to provide the best help and support to our armed services personnel, to veterans and, importantly, to their respective families, including the bereaved.</p><p>I welcome the many initiatives that the minister has highlighted this morning and which the Scottish Government has introduced, especially those that relate to health. Many positive steps have been taken, for example, to extend the priority treatment scheme to all armed forces personnel and veterans, including reservists, and to provide effective services for veterans and their families who experience mental ill health&#8212;a common problem for people who have undergone the stresses of modern military involvement. However, as the minister and others have indicated, that is work in progress and more has yet to be done.</p><p>I support the motion and Richard Simpson&#8217;s amendment whole-heartedly. I welcome the positive steps that the UK coalition Government and the Scottish Government have taken to rebuild the military covenant. At the same time, I hope that additional opportunities can be provided for individuals and businesses to show their support for all those who have been actively involved in defending our nation.</p><p>Our treatment of the men and women of our armed forces and their families speaks volumes about us as a nation. I hope that, by working together, both of Scotland&#8217;s Governments can help to provide first-class services and the respect and dignity that those people deserve, whether they are still in active service or adapting to life back in civilian society.

The truth of that remains to be seen.</p><p>I thought that I would use the opportunity of this debate to set out some of our ideas in the field of health policy that we feel would help towards improving the health of Scottish people and their access to health services.</p><p>Some of our manifesto pledges were very similar to those of the SNP. We promised to protect NHS spending in Scotland, by increasing it in line with inflation; we promised to reduce top-level management costs in the Scottish NHS by 30 per cent over the course of the parliamentary session; we promised a new in vitro fertilisation fund to broaden access to fertility treatment; and we promised to preserve free personal care and to streamline care for the elderly by merging health and social care budgets, placing social care under the control of the NHS.</p><p>All those Conservative policies are comparable with equivalent policies in the SNP manifesto. In a cross-party hustings about women&#8217;s health, organised by Breakthrough Breast Cancer just before dissolution of the Parliament, there was consensus across all the parties on the need for early diagnosis and treatment not only of cancer but of other common conditions in Scotland today, such as diabetes, asthma and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Beyond the policies that I have just described, Scottish Conservatives have other proposals that we believe would help to prevent illness where possible and, if not prevent it, allow symptoms to be picked up early to ensure the optimum treatment to improve the wellbeing of our fellow citizens. For example, as Annabel Goldie touched on this morning, investment in a universal health visiting service, available right across the social spectrum to give advice and support to families from a child&#8217;s birth through the early years to age five, would go a long way towards helping people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and would enable conditions such as asthma and type 1 diabetes in the young to be picked up early.</p><p>Attaching such health visitors to general practice, as was the norm until fairly recently, would allow problem families to be flagged up, difficulties to be identified and health issues to be brought to the doctor&#8217;s attention as soon as possible. I have seen that in practice when my husband was a general practitioner, when the health visitor was an invaluable member of the health team, and I think that all families could benefit from a return to such an arrangement right across Scotland.</p><p>The walk-in centres that we would like to see piloted in Scotland would allow busy working adults and those who are reluctant to visit surgeries to access health advice and treatment for minor conditions at a time and place convenient for them. Our proposals for free health checks for 40 to 74-year-olds would encourage those who are most at risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer to have their health checked before symptoms appear so that warning signs of impending illness could be picked up.</p><p>Those are a few of our manifesto proposals that I commend to the new SNP Government, as well as encouraging it to consider setting up a cancer drugs fund to level the playing field across the UK for access to drugs that are currently not available north of the border and to review the provision of out-of-hours services, which we know are not uniformly satisfactory across the country.</p><p>I do not intend to go into the issue of minimum unit pricing of alcohol today, because the arguments for and against it will be well rehearsed when the Government reintroduces its proposals.

Specialist nurses who are, in my opinion, invaluable and cost effective in the service that they provide for patients with many long-term conditions find that they are an easy hit in difficult financial times and face being put back into the wards instead of continuing in their specialist role. Physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists cannot find work, there are not enough podiatrists to cope with demand and even young medical graduates are potentially under threat of unemployment. The situation is becoming serious: we cannot train highly skilled professionals for non-existent jobs. I urge the new health committee to undertake an urgent inquiry into workforce planning in the NHS, bringing together the expertise that might assist the Government in finding a solution to the problems that lie ahead.</p><p>In Scotland, we have an excellent NHS with dedicated and hard-working staff, but it is not perfect.

I have commitments elsewhere in the building.</p><p>Mary Scanlon has brought a very important issue to the chamber, and I congratulate her on securing the debate. I realise that a number of people in my age group and above suffer significant aches and pains from wear and tear and that arthritis of various kinds affects many people of all ages in Scotland. Before I started on my preparations for the debate, I confess that I was unaware of just how many people&#8217;s lives are adversely affected by chronic pain and how many are severely disabled by it. Any condition that affects nearly 20 per cent of the population must be taken seriously. It came as something of a surprise that, even today, chronic pain remains poorly recognized and often poorly managed and that progress is only now beginning to be made in developing chronic pain services in Scotland.</p><p>The recognition of chronic pain as a long-term condition in its own right and not just a symptom of other problems has been a major step forward. The development of a national policy to cope with it puts us ahead of England, but it is clear that the policy is not yet implemented consistently across Scotland. Chronic pain is yet another condition where adequacy of care is a postcode lottery.</p><p>There are, however, encouraging developments and there is a growing momentum to recognise chronic pain as worthy of clinical and academic investment. The acceptance by the Royal College of General Practitioners that it has a major role to play and its decision to make chronic pain one of its clinical priorities for the next two years is very encouraging. The appointment of the first lead clinician in chronic pain will, I hope, add to the momentum to develop good practice across the country.</p><p>I was heartened to read the aspirations of the RCGP, notably to develop enhanced chronic pain education and training for professional staff and to work with the third sector on developing public awareness of the condition, tapping into the rich pool of patient information and resources that is already in existence.</p><p>The drive to achieve an audit of the pain services that are currently available in the United Kingdom, to review existing models of good practice and assess existing evidence-based data, plus the intention to press for a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline on a quality standard for treating chronic pain, are important developments that should bring together the important work that is already being done in a piecemeal fashion by many organisations, mostly in the voluntary and charitable sectors.</p><p>It makes sense that every health board should have a pain group or managed clinical network to develop specialist pain services, but that is not yet the case. It also makes sense to increase GPs&#8217; understanding of pain and its management. Surely it does not make sense to spend more than &#163;600,000 in two years to send patients with chronic pain to the south of England to access pain management programmes, yet that is happening to patients in more than half of Scotland&#8217;s health board areas. Surely proper investment in local services would be far more cost effective.</p><p>Progress is undoubtedly being made, but it is evident that much more needs to be done. The cross-party group is to be congratulated on putting chronic pain on the political agenda, as is Mary Scanlon for highlighting the issue today. I hope that, next time such a debate takes place in the chamber, we will hear that good practice in the management of chronic pain has been replicated across Scotland and that sufferers have access to appropriate services regardless of where they live. Now that the will is there, I hope that more rapid progress towards that goal will be made.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647113", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to you, Presiding Officer, and to colleagues for not being able to stay for the whole debate.

As we know, costing amendments for the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill was time consuming for members, Parliament clerks and Government officials. Expecting such cost assessment, consideration by the Presiding Officer and publication of the groupings to take place to current stage 2 timescales is simply not feasible.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee considered lengthening the existing deadlines for lodging amendments at stage 2 to allow sufficient time for that to be the standard process. However, the committee anticipates that, although the number of instances of bills being introduced with no financial resolution is likely to increase, cost-bearing amendments will not necessarily be lodged for each bill. The majority of bills that will be passed by Parliament will most likely proceed according to standard procedures, as opposed to having to adhere to the procedures that are set out in the report. Therefore, on balance, the committee considered that lengthening the time between lodging amendments and their consideration at stage 2 for all bills would be a disproportionate response.</p><p>Although the committee is not recommending a change to standing orders to extend deadlines for lodging amendments, it strongly encourages the Parliamentary Bureau to allow additional time at stage 2 for bills without financial resolutions, if the bill has a wide scope or is based on a policy that is likely to be conducive to cost-bearing amendments being lodged. At least an additional week should be factored in to stage 2 deadlines in such situations, and the knock-on effects of timetabling chamber time for stage 3 should also be taken into account. In addition, the committee recommends that committees that consider such bills should factor sufficient flexibility into their work programmes to allow for stage 2 considerations to be timetabled for a later date when cost-bearing amendments are lodged.</p><p>I support the committee&#8217;s recommendations and the associated rule changes.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646074", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Financial Resolutions and scrutiny of revised Financial Memoranda&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate that the rule changes are technical in nature and may therefore strike members as being challenging to apply in practice.

I assure him that that was the result of forgetfulness and that I support the motion whole-heartedly.</p><p>In this day and age, it is extraordinary that many people who deal with children day to day are unaware of the long-term conditions with which many children must learn to live, and of the impact that those conditions might have on their physical and social development.</p><p>Epilepsy is clearly a major condition, as it affects about one in 130 people. Each year, 800 new cases are diagnosed in Scotland, predominantly in people&#8217;s first two decades of life. I include asthma and perhaps type 1 diabetes as other common conditions of which awareness among teachers and fellow pupils can make an enormous difference to how a child can cope with their condition, and to understanding what a child must experience.</p><p>Awareness allows children to be regarded as normal, rather than their being stigmatised and singled out as being different from their peers. At meetings of the cross-party groups on epilepsy and on asthma, I never cease to be amazed at how much the lack of awareness of those conditions can damage the quality of life of those whom they affect.</p><p>Epilepsy seizures&#8212;particularly the grand mal type&#8212;are frightening to witness for people who are unfamiliar with them and are disturbing and potentially embarrassing for the sufferer. If teachers can identify what is happening and deal with the child calmly and with confidence, that is of great benefit to the child and to those who are around him, and it can promote understanding and acceptance of the condition, which are essential if the child is to be treated as an equal by peers.</p><p>As we know, children with epilepsy may exhibit many problems including anxiety, depression, problem behaviour and co-ordination difficulties. Research has shown that at least 50 per cent of affected children achieve less at school than would be predicted from their intelligence quotient. The National Centre for Young People with Epilepsy believes that about two thirds of children and young people with the condition who attend mainstream school underachieve academically in relation to their intellectual level.</p><p>It is therefore important for teachers to be able to detect and deal with epilepsy and its consequences, but their training is patchy and might occur only after a pupil who is in their care has been diagnosed with the condition. Epilepsy awareness training in schools can be&#8212;and often is&#8212;provided by a range of people, such as a school nurse, a local health-centre nurse, an epilepsy specialist nurse or a voluntary organisation, but it does not form part of student teacher training and it is not mandatory, so it varies from school to school. That is unfortunate, because knowledge brings a more compassionate attitude to people with epilepsy and a reduction in the stigmatisation of those who must live with the condition.</p><p>The ideal is obviously to ensure awareness of epilepsy and how to deal with it among all teaching staff: that would be best achieved in teacher training. Epilepsy awareness training and raising awareness of other childhood conditions, such as asthma, would sit well in a student teacher-training curriculum, which would result in more informed and sensitive treatment of affected pupils. That would enable such pupils to fulfil their academic and social potential and it would reduce the stigma that surrounds their medical conditions, which would allow them to be regarded as normal by their peers as they go through their schooling.</p><p>That is what Epilepsy Scotland asks for. I certainly do not think that it asks for too much, which is why I am happy to support Kenny Gibson&#8217;s motion.

Indeed, if variety is the spice of life, the Public Petitions Committee has it in full.</p><p>It is not possible to do justice to all the work of the committee in the short time that has been allocated for this debate, but I will touch on three petitions that originated from my neck of the woods to highlight the importance to our citizens of a successful petitioning process.</p><p>During a meeting with a modern studies class at Dyce academy in Aberdeen, I explained the work of our committee, and said that we were keen to encourage more young people to become involved with it because the typical petitioner to date had been middle aged, middle class and male. I was therefore delighted when, a few weeks later, a petition was submitted by Laura Stebbings, on behalf of the Dyce academy fair trade group, that called on the Scottish Parliament</p><p>&#8220;to urge the Scottish Government to amend the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Act 2007 to allow pupils to act responsibly in respect to their own health and to learn about &#8216;fair trade&#8217; through running stalls in their schools which sell FairTrade products.&#8221;</p><p>Because of that legislation, the pupils were no longer allowed to sell fair trade chocolate and, as that had been the most popular product on sale, the stall was no longer viable.</p><p>The committee was pleased to get confirmation from the Scottish Government that regulations allow products such as fair trade chocolate to be sold on limited occasions. The Minister for Children and Early Years clarified that in a letter to all directors of education, so the petition was concluded successfully, to the satisfaction of the petitioners, who recorded their satisfaction to the committee.</p><p>The petition by Tina McGeever and her husband, the late Michael Gray, on access to cancer treatment drugs, which has already been mentioned, should result in an easier journey for many future patients with terminal cancer. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has worked in collaboration with the petitioner and the committee, and that has resulted in important changes to the process for accessing cancer treatment drugs at NHS board level. As Bruce Crawford pointed out, as well as improving the process for exceptional prescribing&#8212;or individual patient treatment requests, to give the process its new, more patient-friendly name&#8212;new guidelines will result in better information being made available to patients, and should ensure more consistency in patient management and reduce the likelihood of postcode prescribing.</p><p>The petition has not yet been closed, because there is still work to do in monitoring the response of health boards to the new guidelines. It is an important and far-reaching petition, which has received praise from many cancer specialists. Its success is a fitting tribute to Michael Gray, who spoke to it very movingly at a time when he was gravely ill because he wanted a better deal for future patients in his situation.</p><p>The other petition that I want to mention, which sought improvements to school bus safety, also arose out of personal tragedy, as it was lodged by Ron Beaty after his granddaughter was seriously injured on alighting from a school bus. As a result of his efforts to raise awareness, Aberdeenshire Council has led the way in safety improvements and has put in place measures that, unfortunately, have still not been adopted by all councils in Scotland. Responsibility for the safety of school transport is split between the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments, but real progress finally became possible only after a meeting last October that the Public Petitions Committee arranged, when the UK transport minister indicated that powers on school transport could be devolved if the Scottish Government wished to take competence on that.</p><p>Unfortunately, progress has been very slow since then. The committee is frustrated by that, because we wished to see a positive outcome during the current parliamentary session. Hopefully, a discussion with the minister at our final meeting of the session on 8 March will move things forward.</p><p>I hope that, in the short time at my disposal, I have managed to convey to Parliament just how far reaching some of our work has been, and I hope that future petitions committees will have similar successes and will be instrumental in helping petitioners to benefit themselves and their fellow citizens.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions Committee"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Having been a member of the Public Petitions Committee throughout the third session of Parliament, I can honestly say that it has been the most rewarding and interesting committee on which I have served.

It is little wonder that politicians from other legislatures have taken a keen interest in our work and have adopted some of our practices. The international reputation of the Public Petitions Committee is due in no small measure to the enthusiasm and efficiency of the clerking team.</p><p>The main difficulty in dealing with a debate such as this, on four years&#8217; work by a very busy committee, is deciding what to put into one&#8217;s speech and what to leave out. I am thankful that committee members have covered a broad range of the topics that the committee has considered and the various activities in which its members have been involved. Rhona Brankin dealt with the general culture of the committee, which has developed since the beginning of the Parliament in 1999. As she said, in the current session we have dealt with a large number of petitions at our 73 meetings, and many issues have been addressed that might otherwise never have come to the attention of politicians.</p><p>We have had some interesting external meetings and have always been made welcome by our hosts. I will not forget being met by a young piper on a Monday morning in Alness or the excellent buffet lunch that was put on for us in Fraserburgh. We have also been most impressed by the confidence and ability of many of the petitioners&#8212;especially the young ones&#8212;who have spoken to the committee on the substance of their petitions. I am pleased that Anne McLaughlin highlighted that.</p><p>Bruce Crawford&#8217;s appreciation of our work is welcome. He referred to the cross-party co-operation in the committee as it has dealt with petitions. Indeed, I think that we were divided only once during the entire four years of the committee&#8217;s work. However, as Bruce Crawford rightly said, the committee must continue to be innovative if it is to maintain the high standards and growing reputation of its first 12 years. I am sure that we all agree with that.</p><p>Paul Martin referred to representations that he made to the committee on behalf of constituents. The direct involvement of MSPs in that way is of considerable assistance to committee members. Although on occasion it prolongs significantly already long committee meetings, it adds very positively to the petitions process.</p><p>Mike Rumbles referred to the open petition on the junction of the A90 at Laurencekirk. The committee has been committed to making progress on the issue and, as we have heard, has called ministers to the committee on more than one occasion to answer questions. Unfortunately, an ideal solution has not yet been found, but real progress might be made in the next session of Parliament.</p><p>Bill Butler was the third member to refer to the cancer drugs availability petition from Tina McGeever and her husband, which underlines how important the petition has been to the cancer journey of many patients in Scotland. He also rightly highlighted the excellent petition from his constituent, Ryan McLaughlin, who impressed us all&#8212;especially, as Robin Harper said, with his organisation of the parade down the Royal Mile.</p><p>John Wilson referred to the petition on domestic violence against men&#8212;an issue that has rarely been highlighted but which ruins the lives of the significant number of men who fall victim to it. The petition raised awareness and resulted in support being given by the Government via a UK telephone helpline. Although more work needs to be done, significant progress has been made on that very important issue.</p><p>Robin Harper called the committee</p><p>&#8220;the listening ear of the Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>That description is appropriate, because petitioners&#8212;even those whose petitions are unsuccessful&#8212;generally appreciate that their concerns have been given a fair hearing.

I am in no doubt that investment in child support from birth&#8212;indeed, from pre-birth&#8212;to school age pays off handsomely in later life.</p><p>Those of us who are parents have experienced the joy of early interaction with our children and of seeing their excitement as they discover their surroundings and their responses to the people and things that are around them. We probably did not realise at the time&#8212;I certainly did not&#8212;how crucial that was for our children&#8217;s future welfare and success in life.</p><p>I still recall the fun that we had at bedtime sharing with my son the Richard Scarry books that were popular when my son was young&#8212;that might date me. My son squealed with delight night after night as he found the little gold bug character that was hidden in the books&#8217; illustrations. I recall, too, the stories that my mother made up for the children when she looked after them&#8212;I was lucky enough to have my mother to look after the children on the days when I worked. Her scary introduction to witches and ghosts caused trembling excitement but left the children unscathed, because they were safe in the knowledge that they were secure and would not really be harmed by those wicked creatures. Surely that is how imagination develops and how children learn to come to terms with the world that is around them. To achieve that, they need security and stability.</p><p>My children were privileged to have two resident parents and three grandparents who had the time and interest to interact with them. I can only imagine how hard it must be for single parents who live far from their parents and want to do the best for their children but do not have the knowledge, resource or support to give them what they need.</p><p>Ross Finnie is right: we face second and third generations of parents who have not received adequate parenting. It is sad that many children live in chaotic households with parents who are addicted to drugs or alcohol and who cannot parent them adequately. That results in many grandparents taking over the care of their grandchildren.</p><p>Many such kinship carers do not receive the support that they need emotionally or financially. That applies particularly to informal carers who have rescued their grandchildren from an emergency and who are left literally holding the baby. I know that the Minister for Children and Early Years has engaged with that group of kinship carers, but there is still some way to go to help them. Those people sacrifice much to support their grandchildren and save significant public resources by doing so.</p><p>Parenting is not easy. We have not reached the stage at which we can be satisfied that the support for all who cannot give their children the best start in life is adequate.</p><p>We have heard from Murdo Fraser about the importance that we attach to a comprehensive health visitor service as part of the primary care team, which can give invaluable support to the parents of babies and young children up to the age of five and can pick up problems quickly when they arise. As a GP, my husband had a high regard for the input of his health visitors, who could identify families who needed extra help or who had problems such as communication difficulties that needed quick investigation. I will not elaborate further on that, other than to say that health visitors are an ideal source of the advice and information that parents need if they are to be the good parents most of them aspire to be.</p><p>We also want other sources of helpful, clear and concise information to be made available and readily accessible in all maternity units, early years settings and GP surgeries. We are committed to providing information about good parenting websites via trained staff and information through leaflets and other explicit publicity material.</p><p>All three and four-year-old children are legally entitled to 12.5 hours per week of pre-school education, but Liz Smith has explained why more flexible provision and a wider range of providers are needed. Parents should be able to choose the nursery provision that best suits their needs and those of their children.</p><p>When children are under three, mother and toddler groups and playgroups are invaluable organisations for bringing parents together and allowing them to share their problems and for allowing children to learn to socialise and play together before they enter the more structured world of pre-school nursery. Many parents enrol their children in those groups. Such groups would benefit from enlisting the help of older people, who could share with younger parents their experiences of parenting and of life and could help them with storytelling, teaching nursery rhymes and playing with the youngsters. They would bridge the generation gap and act almost as surrogate grandparents. That might not be feasible in the current climate of child protection and disclosure, although I have seen excellent intergenerational contact with an older group of children in a community cafe in Aberdeenshire, where the youngsters help the oldies with the internet and in return learn about the history of their village from the first-hand experience of the older generation.</p><p>On a different note, and in line with what Karen Whitefield covered in her speech, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland has highlighted for us some of its continuing work to support dysfunctional families, and it has called for more decisive action in responding to people in cases where the support that is available does not appear to be improving outcomes for children. That includes proper consideration of removing the child from the family at an early stage. Barnardo&#8217;s has also highlighted the problems that arise from failed attempts to reunite families and the need for timely decisions about a child&#8217;s permanent future, such as adoption, which can be a very positive outcome for a child who is permanently removed from its birth family. We would do well to heed the advice of an organisation such as Barnardo&#8217;s, which has very practical experience of the problems that are faced by all too many young people.</p><p>There is general agreement that early intervention has a positive impact on a child&#8217;s ability to achieve its potential, but its provision needs to be more strategically planned and delivered, and in a more integrated way. Scottish Conservatives regard early intervention as a positive and productive investment in our country&#8217;s future, which we will treat as a priority, and we will work with other parties to ensure its effective delivery.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644235", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Intervention"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Research has shown that the interaction between a child and its parents early in life is key to that child&#8217;s physical and mental development, educational attainment, emotional development and social responsibility as it progresses through childhood.

I am pleased that he focused much of his speech on the work that is being done in Dundee, as that allows me to concentrate on Aberdeen&#8217;s science centre, Satrosphere, which has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. I must declare an interest at this point, as my husband is currently a director of Satrosphere, as an Aberdeen city councillor.</p><p>I remember the embryonic Satrosphere back in the early 1990s. It was set up through the vision of Dr Lesley Glasser of the University of Aberdeen, who wanted younger generations of Aberdonians to experience the thrill of scientific discovery at first hand. The group of extremely dedicated volunteers who ran the small organisation struggled for years to find suitable premises but refused to give up and eventually found a permanent home for the centre in the old tram sheds near the beach in Aberdeen. I was delighted to hear from our visitors this afternoon that Dr Glasser is still a board member.</p><p>Satrosphere nearly went under a few years back, after a spell of poor management, but I am delighted that it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes, and that, working in partnership with other organisations, particularly the University of Aberdeen, and with experienced representatives of the Dundee centre, it is making rapid progress in bringing the excitement of science to many people, young and old alike, in Aberdeen and beyond, and is now close to being financially profitable.</p><p>To do justice to the university&#8217;s summary of the work that is currently being undertaken by Satrosphere would take much longer than the four minutes that have been allocated to me. Suffice it to say that the partnership between the university and Satrosphere has led to a constantly evolving programme that is attracting growing numbers of people to the centre and has resulted in the achievement of its most positive HMIE inspection report in years. Satrosphere now provides an extensive quality education programme, which has gained extremely positive feedback from teachers and pupils. The programme has been produced in close collaboration with the university&#8217;s school of education, whose staff have been heavily involved in creating Scotland&#8217;s curriculum for excellence.</p><p>The University of Aberdeen&#8217;s public engagement with science strategy has led the way in Scotland and has resulted in the establishment of the UK&#8217;s largest and most diverse community cafe science programme, which attracts nearly 4,000 visitors a year and hosts unique medical, rural and topical evening events. Hundreds of researchers who are prominent in their fields now interact with the public and schools throughout the year. For example, last year alone, the university&#8217;s natural history centre engaged with more than 17,000 pupils, parents and members of the public.</p><p>The public engagement with science strategy has led to an invitation to the first world conference on science festivals and cafes, which is to be held this month in Washington DC, to present the Aberdeen public and schools engagement model as an exemplar to the audience there.</p><p>The reputation of that engagement effort has strongly influenced the decision of the British Science Association to bring the British science festival&#8212;the biggest festival of its kind in Europe&#8212;to Scotland next year, with the University of Aberdeen as its host, and an expected attendance of around 50,000 people.</p><p>Techfest, which was the brainchild of my late council colleague Bob Rae, is now the largest and longest-established science festival outside Edinburgh, and annually draws in more than 25,000 people, with a programme that includes school workshops and is linked directly to the curriculum for excellence. For the past three years, the festival has gone on a tour of Highland schools, reaching a further 3,000 secondary school pupils.</p><p>Time prevents me from going on, but I hope that I have given a flavour of the important work that is being done by Satrosphere and its partners, thanks to its very committed staff, whose enthusiasm drives the organisation forward and who deserve our high commendation. I hope that in the current funding round, when money is undoubtedly tight, the chief scientist will look favourably on Satrosphere and give it the little boost that will ensure its success into the future.</p><p>I know that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is well aware of the strengths of Aberdeen&#8217;s science centre, and I hope that the minister will endorse its valuable work in her response to this debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644207", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Science Centres"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Joe FitzPatrick on bringing to Parliament&#8217;s attention the exciting development of Scotland&#8217;s four science centres.

I agree with most of them. I note that nearly all those who have spoken are members of the Health and Sport Committee, which puts me in a small minority alongside Stewart Stevenson, who entertained us with his personal experiences.</p><p>When one is not a member of the committee that is scrutinising a bill, it is difficult enough to assimilate the detail of what is proposed and the reaction of the witnesses called by the committee, without having to absorb the Government&#8217;s response during a stage 1 debate to issues that the committee raised in its detailed report. Like Mary Scanlon, I would have welcomed some prior knowledge of what the minister was going to say, because the debate has not been enhanced by what has happened today.</p><p>Like most members, I agree that there is a need for new legislation, given that much of Scotland&#8217;s burial and cremation legislation is more than a century old and does not reflect life in the 21st century. The Harold Shipman affair was a wake-up call that highlighted the need for a review of the processes governing death certification, burial and cremation, even though&#8212;as everyone has agreed&#8212;no new system could deal with a future Dr Shipman.</p><p>An improvement in the accuracy of death certification is needed in the interests of health care planning and, not least, to provide reassurance to the public. However, when I read the Government&#8217;s proposals, they seemed to me to be less robust than the current system. My initial reaction has been backed up by the expert witnesses who gave evidence to the committee and by the BMA in its briefing for the debate.</p><p>As we know, currently at least two doctors are required to examine a death certificate before cremation can be sanctioned. Consequently, in around two thirds of deaths, three doctors are involved, with the remaining one third of deaths, following which the deceased is buried, requiring just one medical signature to certify death. Although the Government has stated that the two-doctor check may be perfunctory, the second medical check has resulted in a 15 per cent improvement in the accuracy of certification, as Richard Simpson pointed out, and has picked up a significant number of unnatural deaths that would otherwise have gone undetected.</p><p>Clearly, the Government disagrees with that approach and considers that its proposals to introduce a systemic quality improvement system, via intelligence-led medical review, would be more effective than the current system. It also does not approve of the non-targeted system that is being introduced in England and Wales, which would be more expensive.</p><p>As I understand it, under the minister&#8217;s amended proposals, which were presented in evidence to the committee on 15 December, 25 per cent of deaths will be randomly selected for level 1 review, with around 4 per cent being subject to level 2 review. That will mean that 75 per cent of deceased people will be buried or cremated on certification by only one doctor. The intended increase to 4 per cent in the number of deaths that are selected for level 2 review will still fall well short of the 10 per cent that witnesses recommended as the minimum percentage sample that is required to give a realistic chance of picking up errors.</p><p>The concern about the lack of confirmatory checks under the proposed system was summed up by Gerard Boyle of the National Association of Funeral Directors, who said:</p><p>&#8220;We welcome any improvement to the medical certification for statistical analysis, but we feel that, for cremation, going from a two-doctor system plus a medical referee at the crematorium down to one doctor is ... a bit of a backward step ... the proposed system is definitely not as robust as the current one.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 1 December 2010; c 3764.]</p><p>Professor Fleming acknowledged that, without post-mortem examination, we will not get anywhere near 100 per cent accuracy. Nevertheless, he thinks that we can improve the current accuracy rate, although he believes that the bill&#8217;s proposals will make that less likely.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s concerns about the changes to certification for cremation have not yet been fully addressed. Although I accept that the procedures for burial and cremation should be aligned, I agree with the committee&#8217;s conclusion that, given the finality of cremation, any alignment should have as its benchmark the rigor of the current cremation procedures. Ross Finnie emphasised that point well.</p><p>The proposed universal fee in relation to burial and cremation is welcome. It will ensure that a lower fee is payable by everyone rather than a higher one being payable by only a proportion of bereaved relatives.</p><p>There is also a concern that no level of experience is specified before a doctor can sign a medical certificate on cause of death. That means that a junior doctor could authorise cremation without any supervision. The BMA makes a good point that, if the second doctor&#8212;who must have five years&#8217; post-registration experience before they can sign a cremation certificate&#8212;is to be removed from the process, all junior doctors must be supported by high-quality training programmes before they become eligible to sign such certificates. That is a huge training commitment, as Ian McKee pointed out.</p><p>Concerns have also been expressed about the adequacy of the proposed medical reviewer workforce, given its remit to advise, train and carry out the level 1 scrutiny of 25 per cent of deaths and given the likely resultant increase in the number of level 2 reviews. I was pleased to hear the minister say that the number of reviewers is not set in stone.</p><p>The short timescale for reviews will impact on doctors&#8217; workloads, and there are worries about how part-time or shift-working doctors will take part in reviews. It is clearly important to avoid delays to funerals in the interests of the bereaved and of faith groups for whom early funerals are the norm.</p><p>Members have flagged up several other issues in the debate, most notably the lack of proposals for an electronic registration system.</p><p>It is obvious that a great deal of work remains to be done during the next stages of the bill&#8217;s passage through Parliament if the result is to be improved and more robust legislation.</p><p>We will support the general principles of the bill at this stage but we expect amendments at stages 2 and 3 in response to the concerns and criticisms that many people expressed during the stage 1 scrutiny.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644027", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Certification of Death (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been interesting to hear the comments about and criticisms of the bill as introduced.

The Scottish Government&#8217;s publication of Scotland&#8217;s national dementia strategy was therefore warmly welcomed as a first step towards improving dementia care and support.</p><p>Dementia has always been around and has always caused stress and turmoil&#8212;for sufferers in the early stages of its development and for friends and families as the disease progresses. However, as the population ages, dementia is becoming more common. There are 72,000 people with dementia in Scotland and the figure is predicted to double in 25 years. As families become more dispersed and more elderly people live on their own, caring for people with dementia becomes a significant problem for society, which must be faced up to.</p><p>It is difficult and bewildering for people who are in the early stages of dementia and their families to come to terms with the gradual loss of memory and skills that leads to a loved one becoming a mere shadow of their former self, often lacking confidence and becoming depressed as they lose their ability to cope with the pace of modern living. I am pleased that Mary Scanlon and Ian McKee stressed the need to deal with depression in dementia sufferers, which is important.</p><p>It is key to patients&#8217; welfare that their condition is diagnosed as early as possible, so that they and their carers can get access to the information that they need and the support services that can help them to live as normal as possible a life at home and delay, or indeed avoid, the need for admission to residential care.</p><p>If we are to achieve the best care for dementia sufferers, there must be an act of partnership between national Government, local government, the health service and the voluntary and private sectors. The skills and knowledge of staff in health and social care settings need to be improved, to ensure the dignity and respect to which people are entitled, as we heard from Hugh O&#8217;Donnell. As of right, people should have access to services that provide the appropriate support, care and treatment.</p><p>In the implementation of the dementia strategy, two key areas on which we need to focus are the availability of quality support and information for people with dementia and their carers following diagnosis and the need to respond better to dementia in the general hospital setting by considering alternatives to hospital admission and by better planning for discharge into the community, as Mary Scanlon said.</p><p>On the latter point, Conservatives think that there would be significant benefit if Lord Sutherland&#8217;s recommendation that health and social care budgets be merged were implemented. A single budget for health and social care and a common commissioning policy, to eliminate duplication, would lead to better continuity of care between the hospital and the community, which is important. It would reduce delayed discharges from hospital and ensure a better service for people and a faster response to addressing their needs. Such a joined-up approach would potentially lead to savings in administration costs, which could be ploughed back into front-line services.</p><p>We are happy to note the progress on the implementation of the dementia strategy. We particularly welcome the announcement of funding for specialist nurses and support for continuing research into the condition. Of course, all that is work in progress. Demands on services will continue to grow and it is important that scarce resources achieve best value in dementia care. It is proven that admission to residential care can be delayed if there is better support at home for patients and their families, and even a short delay can release resource to improve home care and support.</p><p>Careful monitoring of how the strategy operates during the next two years will feed into the review that is planned for 2013. I hope that the strategy will evolve after that, as progress is made on meeting the needs of people with dementia and their carers. The work that has been done so far is commendable, as members have said, but it is not complete. I hope that future Scottish Governments will continue to regard dementia as a national priority and focus on the needs of sufferers and their carers.</p><p>We will support the motion and the amendment in Richard Simpson&#8217;s name.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643366", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I well remember, from when I entered Parliament in 2003, the strenuous efforts that were being made then by the late Jim Jackson of Alzheimer Scotland, and by the cross-party group on Alzheimer&#8217;s, led by Irene Oldfather, to raise awareness of this devastating condition and to achieve better support and care for those people across Scotland who are affected by it.

The chamber will be pleased to know that First ScotRail provided an emergency bus link to Edinburgh fairly quickly&#8212;and I must say that its customer care was exemplary&#8212;but I experienced at first hand the opportunities that can exist for journey sharing when a fellow passenger from Aberdeen offered to get me more speedily to Edinburgh in a vehicle that he arranged to pick us up. I accepted his offer to ensure that I got to my meeting on time. Such opportunities clearly exist, and in this era of modern technology a perfect real-time link between commuters could become the ideal way forward for reducing car use.</p><p>As has been mentioned, liftshare and getabout have already helped individuals to travel more sustainably by sharing their journeys to and from work. The online network has helped to match people with similar journeys so that they can travel more easily together, saving them money as well as helping the environment by cutting their carbon footprints.</p><p>As Alison McInnes said, the social enterprise liftshare has gone from strength to strength, and I pay tribute to all those involved in building it up to include more than 400,000 members in a United Kingdom-wide car-sharing network&#8212;a great achievement that I hope will grow and grow.</p><p>Getabout, which is a partnership that involves eight bodies&#8212;Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Councils, the two universities, Aberdeen College, NHS Grampian, the Energy Saving Trust and the Dyce Transportation Management Organisation&#8212;has also made significant progress in promoting better transport choices, including car sharing, across the north-east. I am grateful to Alison McInnes for explaining so clearly how it operates.</p><p>Liftshare and getabout clearly demonstrate that we can take positive steps to reduce car use by developing local car-share networks. In the north-east, the statistics speak for themselves. At present, 80 per cent of commuting cars have only one occupant. Half of all car trips are less than five miles. When my children were small, groups of parents took part in school runs&#8212;each family took one day a week. Now, I see a stream of cars, often four-by-fours, go to my local school with one child per vehicle. That is surely a retrograde step that should be reversed if we really want to ease congestion and combat climate change.</p><p>The MSPs in the chamber who represent the north-east will be only too aware of how reducing the number of cars, especially at rush hour, would help to address local transport difficulties, such as the huge tailbacks that we experience at the notorious Haudagain roundabout.</p><p>With the current high fuel prices and the impact that they are having, especially in rural areas, on top of other challenges to household budgets, we should be hearing about the promotional material published by getabout&#8212;Alison McInnes quoted some of it&#8212;which states:</p><p>&#8220;Car sharing can make a real difference to your fuel bills&#8212;find 3 other people and you only pay to go to work every 4 days!&#8221;</p><p>For those trying to cut down on their journeys, it says:</p><p>&#8220;if you live to the North or West of Aberdeen meet at Bridge of Don, Ellon or Kingswells park and ride and share from there! Parking is free as well.&#8221;</p><p>I congratulate Alison McInnes on an informative debate.

I hope that members will agree that the committee has managed to achieve the intended clarity and simplification of the register of members&#8217; interests as outlined in the principles that guided the committee&#8217;s deliberations&#8212;notably, that the register should capture significant financial interests; that it should be as straightforward and simple as possible for members to comply with the register&#8217;s requirements; and that the proposed changes should be in the public interest and ensure that transparency and accountability are maintained. We hope that that will be achieved by reducing the number of interest categories in the schedule from eight to five and by amending the remaining categories, as outlined by Gil Paterson.</p><p>The only category that I will discuss at length is remuneration. It is in the public interest that significant financial interests that could influence or be perceived to influence a member&#8217;s views or actions should be registered, but if many interests that are so trivial that they are unlikely to create the appearance of prejudice are recorded, no useful purpose is served. The definition of remuneration that is in use also makes registrable some interests that most people who read them would not look on as remuneration.</p><p>The committee felt that it was important that the code of conduct made clear as far as possible what is and is not registrable. An example that vexed most members, including me, was participation by members in opinion surveys by organisations that make a small payment for that participation directly to a charity that members nominate. The legal advice is that, because a member can direct where such a donation is paid, it falls within the definition of remuneration and should be registered. I will not go into other such examples, but I think that the proposed changes to the remuneration category will help members to decide when they need to make an entry in the register of interests.</p><p>If the registrable threshold for gifts, heritable property and shares is fixed at the start of the parliamentary session rather than being raised whenever members receive a salary increase, as has happened until now, that will make it more straightforward for members in the next parliamentary session to register those items.</p><p>I have only skimmed the surface of the proposed changes to the schedule and the code of conduct, but I hope that the Parliament will appreciate the committee&#8217;s efforts in reaching our conclusions and will see the merit in what is proposed.

I doubt that that has changed significantly in the past few years.</p><p>As we know, people on the autistic spectrum vary enormously, from those who have minor communication difficulties, as cited by Christopher Harvie, right through to those who are severely affected, have extremely complex needs and require highly specialist care, peaceful surroundings and a well-established routine if they are to have any hope of achieving their potential, however limited it might be.</p><p>Autism does not end with childhood; it is a lifelong condition. It is, therefore, important that people on the spectrum are identified early and provided for into adult life so that they do not miss out on life's opportunities because they are disregarded by society.</p><p>Currently, there are undoubtedly gaps in provision. As well as coping with the significant daily problems of caring for an autistic child, many parents have a battle on their hands to secure appropriate therapies and schooling for their offspring. Many adults are living isolated lives, unable to integrate into society and make full use of the talents that they possess.</p><p>I am in no doubt that much more needs to be done to help those who suffer from autism. When Hugh O'Donnell presented his proposals for an autism bill, I was happy to give him my support so that they could be scrutinised by Parliament. I congratulate the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee on doing that so professionally and thoroughly. It is clear from reading the committee report and from discussions with my colleague Liz Smith, who is a member of the committee, that the debate has polarised not around whether help is needed for people with autism, but whether new legislation is the best way to achieve that. Contributions have been informed and passionate, and opinions have been varied, with even specialist organisations such as the National Autistic Society Scotland and the Scottish Society for Autism having differing opinions on whether the legislative route is the best way forward.</p><p>There is general agreement that if individuals with autism are to receive the support that they need, a robust autism strategy is required to enable public bodies to focus on more effective delivery of services to those people. As we know, the Scottish Government is in the process of <place-holder colnum=\"32032\"/> drafting an autism strategy for Scotland, following public consultation. Hugh O'Donnell is to be congratulated on enabling that to happen.</p><p>The consensus of the committee was that to be effective, such a strategy does not need to be set in statute, particularly when legislation exists that would, if properly implemented, result in better support, not only for people with ASD but for people with other conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, who also find it difficult to access services consistently across Scotland. That seems to me to be the responsible approach. If the enforcement of existing law, coupled with an autism strategy for Scotland, does not result in the desired improvement in service availability, then the legislative route can be looked at again, as the committee flagged up.</p><p>I fully understand the concerns of the many people who have urged us to support Hugh O'Donnell's bill and who will feel their disappointment keenly if Parliament does not agree to its general principles. However, I have to accept the view of the committee, which has examined the proposals with an open mind and in very great detail so, like my colleague Elizabeth Smith, I will vote against the bill at decision time.</p><p>That said, if the bill is defeated today, all of us as responsible members of this Parliament have a clear duty to ensure that the Government's proposed autism strategy is indeed robust and properly implemented, so that all those who suffer from autism will in the future receive the help and support that many people currently cannot access but to which, in a modern and caring society, they are entitled.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175903", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Among the first constituents whom I encountered in my role as an MSP were the parents and carers of a group of autistic Aberdeenshire children who felt that those children's needs were not being met adequately by the services that were available to them.

It is expected that its incidence will double in the next 20 years, largely as a result of the ageing population, but also as a result of the huge rise in type 2 diabetes in the many people who are obese because of their poor diet. That will have a major impact on health and social services, and Robert Brown is to be commended for raising members' awareness of the situation by securing this debate. I apologise for failing to sign his motion; that was an omission on my part.</p><p>We know that age-related macular degeneration already accounts for more than 50 per cent of all registered blindness, and that figure will undoubtedly increase as the population ages. The affliction is a serious one that has a major impact on people's lives. It certainly ruined my mother's last few years. She became quite seriously depressed as a result of losing her ability to read books, which was a lifelong passion that could not be satisfied by the talking books that she was offered as a substitute. There are certainly more and better magnification aids available now than were available then, but reading or watching television with them is a real hassle for elderly people who find it difficult to learn new techniques. Within a few weeks, an uncle and a close friend went from being able to drive a car to finding it difficult to recognise faces when they met people. The affliction interferes with people's lifestyles in a major way, particularly those of people who live in rural areas and depend on their cars to get around. It is obviously key to their welfare that they receive whatever help is available as soon as possible.</p><p>Unfortunately, the common dry type of macular degeneration is currently untreatable, but something can be done about the aggressive and rapidly progressive wet form, as we have heard. It is therefore important that it is diagnosed early, when treatment to reverse it, halt its progress or at least mitigate its effects can be effective. Robert Brown referred to that in his speech. Older people must be encouraged to have regular eye checks <place-holder colnum=\"31896\"/> so that AMD can be picked up early. Eye checks are freely available, so there is no reason for anyone not to see an optician regularly.</p><p>Because of my family history of macular degeneration, my optician has encouraged me to check for it regularly by looking at a card with a grid printed on it, which is available from opticians, or a crossword puzzle grid, to check whether the lines are straight. If they are seen by either eye to be at all wavy, that could be a signal that all is not well and that an urgent optician appointment is necessary. It would be beneficial if the importance and ready availability of such a simple test was made known to the older population in general so that older people could look out for early signs of something that would ruin their lives if it was not diagnosed and treated early.</p><p>Unfortunately, as with many medical conditions that we hear about in members' business debates, there are postcode issues with services for macular degeneration. In its helpful briefing for the debate, the RNIB stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Regional inequalities in treatment and criteria are particularly evident.\"</p><p>The RNIB sees a clear need for a nationally agreed standard of provision, taking into account, obviously, that resources will vary across regions. It has also highlighted the need for improved services for patients who have already been diagnosed, such as counselling services, which Stuart McMillan mentioned. Counselling is below an adequate standard in most parts of Scotland.</p><p>As we have heard, there are also issues to do with equipment and accommodation. I agree with Robert Brown that it is vital that NHS boards are able to meet demands for treatment now and in the future. That will reduce the demands that are placed on social and mental health services by patients who find it difficult to cope with the development of visual impairment in their later years. To that end, the Government should look at putting in place a formal five-year plan for the provision of macular services in Scotland, as recommended by the RNIB, if that is not already being considered.</p><p>I look forward to the minister's response.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21156649", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Age-related Macular Degeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we have heard, sight loss is becoming a serious issue in Scotland.

I also add my condolences and my admiration for his decision to attend the debate. We are all familiar with newspaper headlines&#8212;we see them from time to time&#8212;about the sudden death of a fit young person on the football pitch, the running track or the rugby field, and we all lament the wasted potential and the lost years to a group of talented, athletic people who are ideal <place-holder colnum=\"31518\"/> role models for youngsters who aspire to develop their physical talents and fitness. A number of those unexpected deaths are due to the sudden onset of a fatal arrhythmia that could have been prevented if the victim had been screened to detect an underlying heart condition.</p><p>SADS was first brought to my attention soon after I became an MSP by the founder of Scottish HART, Wilma Gunn of Selkirk. She has campaigned tirelessly to raise awareness of the syndrome since her son suddenly died as a result of an underlying heart condition. She enlisted my help and made me, along with other MSPs, a patron of Scottish HART. I did what I could at the time to achieve her ambition to have screening carried out on young people to identify young athletes who might be at risk.</p><p>Like Christine Grahame, I recall an interesting meeting in St Andrews house with Mrs Gunn, Professor Stewart Hillis, Malcolm Chisholm&#8212;the then health minister&#8212;and some of the Executive&#8217;s health team. The clear advice from the national advisory committee was that such screening of young people was not considered appropriate.</p><p>Undaunted by that and supported by Professor Hillis, Wilma Gunn pursued her case and continued to raise awareness of SADS across the country. As we have heard, she raised money for defibrillators and presented them to sporting organisations, including Aberdeen Football Club at Pittodrie. Although those machines do not prevent the occurrence of potential fatal arrhythmias, they have made possible the immediate treatment that offers the only hope of survival to the unfortunate victims.</p><p>The cardiac assessment in young athletes pilot programme that is based at the Hampden sports medicine centre and run by Professor Hillis was therefore warmly welcomed when the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing launched it just over two years ago. I am delighted that it has been so successful that the Scottish Government has extended it for a further two years, allowing its expansion to include satellite assessment units that can be taken into rural parts of Scotland. The screening of 800-plus people aged between 15 and 25 has revealed a number of cardiac health issues, and early intervention thereafter has prevented the occurrence of more serious complications while allowing the young people concerned to take part in competitive sport, which is particularly important. I am glad that the prevention of SADS is being taken seriously in this country and that the programme of cardiac screening of young athletes is providing an accurate and informative bank of research data that can be used as a reservoir for the development of future expertise. However, I wonder whether matters would have progressed <place-holder colnum=\"31519\"/> this far so quickly without the dogged determination of people such as Wilma Gunn to keep up the pressure on Government. We should pay tribute to charities such as Scottish HART and Cardiac Risk in the Young for highlighting the preventable deaths of young people from SADS and for campaigning resolutely to raise awareness of the condition among the population of Scotland.</p><p>I hope that the next phase of the screening pilot is as successful as the first and I look forward to the day when all those embarking on strenuous sporting activity can be offered appropriate screening if they so wish, because every preventable death in a young person is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible.

I firmly believe that it could, as do many medical colleagues in this country.</p><p>There have been significant improvements in palliative care in Scotland in recent years. For me, that is the way forward to ensure that the vast majority of patients experience a dignified and comfortable death when that inevitability arrives. Death is part of a continuum with life, and to achieve a good death is as vital a part of health care as any that a patient receives throughout life. I sincerely believe that good palliative care to take the fear and pain out of dying is far better than looking to voluntary euthanasia or legally assisted suicide.</p><p>I accept that for a few patients&#8212;indeed, they are few&#8212;palliative care cannot be 100 per cent effective. However, I am not convinced that that is sufficient reason for us to legislate to allow assisted death as described in the bill, and nor are the palliative care specialists who deal with those difficult cases convinced about that. For those who say that assisted death happens already when doctors give a drug to relieve suffering in a dose that, to be effective, has the double effect of causing respiratory failure, I point out that the Solicitor General stated clearly in evidence that to administer a drug with the intention of relieving suffering is different from doing so with the intention to end life, the latter being an act that is classified as homicide.</p><p>The committee felt that the bill's title is ambiguous. In my opinion, it is euphemistic, because its intention is to decriminalise assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, when in fact it is palliative care that gives practical assistance to people at the end of life. Moreover, by seeking to decriminalise both those means of ending life, the bill differs significantly in breadth and scope from the examples from other cultures and jurisdictions that the member in charge of the bill cited as if they were comparable.</p><p>In the time that is left to me, I will touch briefly on a few other aspects of the bill that were of concern to the committee and to me in particular. I am not convinced that the difficulty in detecting undue influence on a person seeking end of life assistance can be overcome, especially given that the necessary approvals to proceed would be obtained after two meetings with a medical <place-holder colnum=\"31056\"/> practitioner and one with a psychiatrist, neither of whom would need to have had previous contact with the requesting person.</p><p>The definitions of dignity and autonomy and the bill's qualifying conditions of terminal illness and intolerability exercised the committee considerably. Those who are in favour of the bill's proposals see assisted suicide as a means of preserving dignity in the terminal stages of life and at the moment of death. However, against that is the equally compelling argument that a hastened death is undignified by its hastening and that the way to preserve dignity in the terminal stages of life lies in the quality of care that is available and the respect that is offered to the dying. The committee found it impossible to reconcile those opinions.</p><p>Most committee members felt that a balance must be struck between an individual's autonomy and the interests of society as a whole and that, in the context of the bill, society's wider concerns should prevail.</p><p>The progress of terminal illness is extremely difficult to predict accurately and the judgment on intolerability is subjective. The eligibility requirement that is based on an inability to live independently rang alarm bells with many disabled people and their representatives who contacted the committee, because it raises issues of definition, clarity, subjectivity and possible unintended consequences. Those people also pointed out that a person's life might be rendered intolerable by a society that fails to provide sufficient and appropriate support for people with disabilities, which is clearly an equality issue.</p><p>Under current national health service law, health service personnel cannot give the end of life assistance that the bill seeks, and nor can NHS premises be used for it. That raises the equality issue of affordability. Those who live in remote or island communities would also face issues of accessibility of such a service.</p><p>Other concerns, which I do not have time to deal with, were raised. As I said at the outset of my speech, the bill's principles are flawed. In keeping with my sincerely held belief that the dying will be best assisted through improving palliative care, I reiterate my opposition to the bill, which I will vote against at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21113884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "They indeed said that, but there remains the perception that that could happen.

It is expected that that figure will rise by 10 to 15 per cent year on year as the population ages and more effort is made to identify cardiac arrhythmias, notably atrial fibrillation. To ensure the efficacy and safety of that therapy, which is usually given orally as warfarin, and to ensure that its effect stays within the defined therapeutic range, regular monitoring is essential. The dosage is adjusted according to the time it takes for a blood sample to clot.<place-holder colnum=\"30706\"/></p><p>Because serious complications can arise if warfarin is poorly controlled, it is vital for patient welfare that the clotting time is frequently checked. Traditionally, that has been done via hospital-based anticoagulant clinics. There is often quite a long time lag between the blood sample being taken from the patient, after which it is processed in the laboratory, and the result reaching the clinician and the patient's dosage being adjusted. Even if the general practitioner takes the sample and posts it to the lab, there will be a wait of several days before the dose can be adjusted. The clinics are extremely busy and overcrowded.</p><p>Thanks to modern technology, portable devices are now available that allow patients to self-monitor their blood without having to visit a hospital or their general practitioner, or to wait for results&#8212;because the result is available in minutes. It allows patients to manage their warfarin dosage themselves. Alternatively, they can contact their physician with the result of the blood test; their physician will then interpret it and adjust the dose accordingly. I saw a portable meter in use this afternoon. It is impressively compact and seems to be extremely easy to use.</p><p>It has been found that around a quarter of patients would be willing to self-monitor but, so far, national health service boards generally do not provide support for self-monitoring or self-management. In Scotland, only one health board&#8212;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&#8212;does it, and only for children.</p><p>We lag behind England&#8212;where 60 hospitals support self-monitoring&#8212;and the rest of Europe. That is a pity, because there is clinical evidence to show that self-management results in a better quality of anticoagulation as well as a better quality of life for patients. It gives them control of their treatment: testing can be done at home and results are immediate. Self-management means that fewer hospital visits are needed. That could be a significant advantage to patients&#8212;particularly in rural areas&#8212;who currently must take time off work to attend hospital and bear the expense and time cost of travelling there.</p><p>A portable meter costs only &#163;300 and is currently either purchased by the patient or provided by a charity, because the cost is not reimbursed. The annual cost of test strips is around &#163;65. If that cost is set against the &#163;60 to &#163;100 cost to the NHS of each clinic visit and the need for the patient to attend hospital anything between four and 12 times per year&#8212;or even more&#8212;it is easy to see the advantages to the NHS, as well as to the patient, of self-monitoring the treatment.</p><p>As I said, there is little support in Scotland for self-monitoring. The NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde service for children at Yorkhill is very well <place-holder colnum=\"30707\"/> received&#8212;more than 100 young patients are self-testing&#8212;but when they move on at age 18, few adult services will be available to them.</p><p>NHS Fife has run a pilot study on self-monitoring and continues to support a small number of patients from the pilot, but the service has not been rolled out. NHS Grampian has a few self-monitoring patients. At present, it does not formally support them, although it is looking to develop a system to do so. Following the transfer to NHS Lanarkshire of a patient from Yorkhill, that health board is now setting up a service, having acknowledged the need to support self-monitoring.</p><p>There is growing awareness of the possibility of self-monitoring and self-management of anticoagulation therapy in Scotland but, unfortunately, the Government does not collect appropriate data on young people. That is a pity because although Yorkhill has more than 100 young people who are self-testing, the Minister for Public Health and Sport indicated in response to a parliamentary question that very few people on anticoagulant therapy would be eligible for the approach.</p><p>The Government's document \"Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan: What it Means for You\" states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"patients living with long-term medical conditions and their carers should have the information and support that they need to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis, in the knowledge that the NHS is there for them when they need it.\"</p><p>Key aims of \"Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan\" are to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Enable and support patients to be partners in their care ... Make health care in Scotland safer ... Modernise the NHS\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Deliver the quickest treatment ever available in Scotland's NHS\".</p><p>Self-testing and self-management of anticoagulation therapy fit well with that strategy. They are of great benefit to the patients who use them but, beyond that, they seem to be very cost effective for the NHS.</p><p>In this day and age we look to use scarce resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. Therefore, I urge the Government to look closely at how anticoagulant therapy is managed and to consider investigating the potential of increasing self-management with a view to rolling it out across health boards to suitable patients. That would save the NHS money and improve the quality of care for the large and increasing number of people in Scotland who need long-term anticoagulation therapy.

That is a significant change.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats initially agreed with their Labour colleagues, went on to support abolition and then returned to opposing it last year. I am pleased that the Liberal Democrats appear finally to have made up their minds and to have made a reasoned decision on the issue. Ross Finnie's speech was measured. He demonstrated clearly the harsh realities of the choices that the NHS faces in the present financial climate and the need to spend resource wisely throughout the service. We have no difficulty in supporting his amendment.</p><p>As we have said, removing prescription charges for everyone has superficial appeal. The existing exemption criteria have inequities and it would be nearly impossible to produce a fairer list of exempt categories, as the cabinet secretary said. That is why we supported the initial reduction of the charge in 2008 from &#163;6.85 to &#163;5, which brought the cost of a 12-month prepayment certificate down to &#163;48. As that was less than &#163;1 a week and more than halved the previous cost, it was affordable and a significant help to people who require multiple and long-term drug treatment. The increasing take-up of such certificates shows that that was the case.</p><p>The initial reduction cost the NHS about &#163;17 million, which was justifiable at the time. We opposed further reductions because of the increasing loss of revenue, which amounts to about &#163;32 million this year. We do not support the final move next year to a zero charge, because to remove a further &#163;25 million a year from the NHS is inappropriate given that it is under severe financial pressure, although its budget is protected, and given that the report of the Government-commissioned IBR referred to<place-holder colnum=\"30604\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"a pressing need to reconsider the planned abolition of prescription charges\".</p><p>As we know, the vast majority of people who require help to pay for prescriptions receive it. As 92 per cent of prescriptions are exempt from the charge and a further 6 per cent are issued to people with prepayment certificates, that leaves a small percentage of prescriptions subject to the full charge. Removing that charge completely would subsidise the prescriptions of people who can well afford to pay for them with money that could be better spent in the NHS. However, to avoid doubt, as Derek Brownlee said, we do not intend to put the clock back and to charge the elderly, the young or those who are in full-time education.</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned Wales. The Welsh experience of free prescriptions is of increasing demand for prescriptions for drugs such as paracetamol, Gaviscon and Calpol, which are readily available over the counter at low cost. That not only takes money out of the NHS but increases the demand on GP time that could be better used. I know that some members of the National Assembly for Wales regret the policy, particularly at this time.</p><p>Some people do not hand in a prescription that they have been given because they find&#8212;as Jackson Carlaw did&#8212;that buying the drug over the counter is cheaper. That is not uncommon.</p><p>Our resolve to keep prescription charges has, if anything, been strengthened by the current tough financial future that we face as a result of Labour's mismanagement of the UK economy. It is more important than ever to spend public money as efficiently and effectively as possible. If revenue is removed from the NHS to pay for free prescriptions, something else in the service must suffer.</p><p>Many health services could benefit from the income that is derived from prescription charges. As the Parliament knows, a priority for us is the restoration and development of a universal service of practice-based health visitors, which would be of incalculable benefit to many families and young people. When one hears of malnourished children presenting in hospital, surely it is more important to spend money on health visitors who can advise vulnerable families and pick up problems before they have a serious impact on a child's welfare than it is to spend scarce resources on providing free prescriptions.</p><p>Government is all about priorities, particularly in difficult times. Opening up the NHS to another indefinite spending commitment now is not the action of a responsible Government, so we oppose the move.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21091650", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prescription Charges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That position is nonetheless a radical departure from where Labour was in 2006, when it was in government.

In hospital, they were talked over by a retinue of people in white coats who assumed that the patient would have no understanding of their medical condition. That approach is clearly unacceptable in the 21st century, and thankfully things have moved on, with patients having rights, including that of being fully involved with the management of their health <place-holder colnum=\"30507\"/> issues. However, the system is not perfect and patients can feel let down by it. The Scottish Government's intention to create a fully patient-centred and genuinely mutual NHS is laudable and has widespread support.</p><p>The point at issue is whether legislation, as outlined in the bill, is necessary to achieve that goal. From the evidence that was given to the Health and Sport Committee, it is clear that many witnesses believe that it is not. Consumer Focus Scotland noted that patients have rights already, but they are not mentioned in the bill, and as we have heard, the SPSO pointed out that the bill does not extend significantly patient rights in relation to the quality of NHS services that are provided for them in Scotland, and fears that to enshrine them in primary legislation could lead to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an unwelcome increase in legalism and litigation in disputes between members of the public and the NHS.\"</p><p>The Law Society articulates a common concern of witnesses, that the bill lacks teeth because it does not include the provisions that are necessary to enforce the principles and guarantees that it contains. The RCN is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unconvinced that legislation is more useful than a review of how rights and responsibilities are promoted and implemented\"</p><p>and the GMC is not clear about how those rights that are included in the bill would be implemented, measured and enforced.</p><p>It is unusual to have such a weighty body of opinion questioning the need for a bill and doubting the effectiveness of the proposals within it. Mary Scanlon has pointed out that the treatment time guarantee that is set out in the bill is not legally enforceable, and that many people who have conditions that are not included in that guarantee, such as mental health problems and deafness, stand to lose out under the proposed legislation. The list of conditions might be small, but that is no comfort to the patients who are affected. The BMA has serious concerns, which I share, that to place treatment time guarantees into statute will skew clinical priorities, and although I do not always agree with the BMA, I certainly agree that targets should always be based on clinical evidence and not on political imperative.</p><p>Finally, there is doubt about the accuracy of the projected costs that are associated with the bill. A number of concerns have been raised about that by organisations, including NHS boards and Citizens Advice Scotland. I worry about added bureaucracy developing around an unspecified number of patient rights officers.</p><p>I am not a member of the Health and Sport Committee but, from what I have read about the bill, I cannot see that it is necessary, or even that it would produce the cultural change that the cabinet <place-holder colnum=\"30508\"/> secretary seeks. Of course, I believe in a patient-centred health service and that patients should have the right to quality treatment whenever they need it within an NHS that has their best interests as its foremost consideration. I also believe that patients should be supported and helped if and when they feel let down by the service.</p><p>We need a more open and accessible system of patient feedback in the NHS. Many patients would like to give constructive feedback following a health care experience, but they do not want to do that through a formal complaint. There should be a mechanism to cope with that. However, to set in new legislation what the NHS has been striving to do throughout its existence&#8212;namely, to ensure that anything done in relation to a patient takes into account the patient's needs and that regard is given to the importance of providing optimum benefit to the patient's health and wellbeing&#8212;does not seem necessary to me or to many of the people and organisations that have taken an interest in the bill.</p><p>Surely a much better option would be to look again at the patient charter, which was devised by John Major's Government in 1990 and revised 10 years later by Labour. A strengthened patient charter would be every bit as effective as the bill in improving the promotion and implementation of existing rights and responsibilities for those who use and work in the NHS. Its efficacy across Scotland could readily be judged by Government ministers during their annual review of health boards' performance. We all want the best deal possible for patients but, along with many others, my party feels that the bill is not the best way in which to achieve that. However, as Mary Scanlon said, we are willing to co-operate fully with the cabinet secretary should she be willing to go down the road of producing a more effective patient charter.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21088379", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The NHS with which I grew up was a paternalistic organisation in which patients were the passive recipients of treatment that was meted out to them by those who thought that they knew best what was good for them.

I myself have been in the hands of a physiotherapist in recent weeks because of a back problem, and without going near my GP. I am sure that there are other people like me. Many more visit chiropractors on a regular basis for the treatment of back and joint problems.</p><p>From the helpful briefing notes that have been sent in by various organisations, it is clear that there needs to be an increase in awareness among GPs, particularly of rheumatoid arthritis, which is arguably one of the most serious of the conditions. Early diagnosis is vital if the reversible joint destruction and disability are to be avoided and if people are to continue in work.</p><p>I will focus on osteoporosis, the complications of which can cause very severe pain and disability. I have taken a particular interest in the condition as an MSP and am patron of the Aberdeen branch of the National Osteoporosis Society. Fragility fractures resulting from osteoporosis are common and they are very painful. Hip fractures are associated with high levels of mortality and are expensive to deal with. Many older women, in particular, develop osteoporosis. It is sad to see people such as my husband's late stepmother, who was an active physical education teacher, walker and gardener in her younger days, in constant pain, shrunk in size and bent over from collapsed osteoporotic vertebrae.</p><p>With modern detection methods and the application of bone-protecting treatments, the fracture risk can be halved. It is now therefore recommended that all fracture patients over the age of 50 should be identified, assessed and treated where appropriate.</p><p>Osteoporosis affects not only older people. At the risk of this speech becoming a Milne family history, I will mention my son, who developed a degree of osteoporosis as a result of prolonged <place-holder colnum=\"30444\"/> steroid therapy undertaken when a teenager. He was not aware that he had the condition but, fortunately, it was looked for and picked up during a routine check-up. Thanks to treatment, his bone density is back within the normal range, fortunately before he had any fractures&#8212;and despite his passion for downhill skiing.</p><p>The work of fracture liaison services is invaluable in detecting and treating osteoporosis, and the associated specialist nurses make an enormous contribution to the national health service. There is concern that posts could be at risk in some areas, given the current financial pressures on health boards. I hope that the minister will listen to pleas from the National Osteoporosis Society to protect threatened posts.</p><p>The NOS stresses that it is important that all hospitals that deal with fracture patients are linked to a comprehensive fracture liaison service and that incentives are given to primary care staff to improve prevention and treatment in relation to osteoporosis and fractures.

The early problems with NHS 24 and its undoubted failures, which were exposed in the 2005 review, inevitably led to patients receiving poor levels of out-of-hours service. Patients were&#8212;and, indeed, still are in many instances&#8212;unsure of the difference between out-of-hours primary medical care and emergency services. They are unsure whether they should call NHS 24 or an ambulance. I feel that the failure to prepare the public properly in 2004 for the changing pattern of out-of-hours care, together with a lack of information about the standards of care that they should expect, has had much to do with the public's lack of confidence in the service, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>Enormous improvements have been made, with NHS 24 now much more local and working more closely with health boards. Indeed, in some places, such as Aberdeen, it is co-located with the on-call GPs and alongside accident and emergency and telemedicine facilities. However, more needs to be done to integrate out-of-hours services with each other and with the systems that operate in normal working hours, as the Health and Sport Committee's inquiry found out.</p><p>In a country with Scotland's geography, a one-size-fits-all approach to out-of-hours provision is of no use. The needs of specific communities require services that are developed locally and in consultation with local people. In parts of Grampian, for example, advanced nurse practitioners and paramedics work with GPs in <place-holder colnum=\"30417\"/> rural areas. They are in telephone contact with their GP colleagues, who have telemedicine links to their out-of-hours hub, and with accident and emergency services in Aberdeen if advice is required. They are able to diagnose, prescribe for and treat many acute conditions, and they can refer patients for admission to hospital when necessary.</p><p>In Braemar and upper Deeside in Aberdeenshire, where the GP did not opt out of 24-hour responsibility for his patients and where there are also trained first responders, patient calls can be answered very quickly. Problems arise, however, if urgent hospital admission is required, as it can take far too long to get an ambulance there to transport the patient safely to Aberdeen with a paramedic free to care for the patient en route.</p><p>I have been working with MSP colleagues from all parties, with the GP, with the local community and with the Ambulance Service to solve the problem. It is hoped that, following a productive meeting here a few weeks ago that the cabinet secretary presided over, it might be possible to set up a retained ambulance service for out-of-hours cover in the area similar to one that already operates in Shetland. I am hopeful of a satisfactory result in the not-too-distant future, and I put on record my thanks to the cabinet secretary on behalf of the local community for her help in the matter. They greatly appreciate that.</p><p>I am confident that with co-operation between communities, health boards and the emergency services, satisfactory out-of-hours care can be provided for patients throughout Scotland using appropriate models of provision. There is still a long way to go before everyone receives the seamless service that they look for and deserve, but I am encouraged by the Government's response to the committee's report&#8212;notably, its commitment to continuous improvement and its commitment to work with NHS boards to develop national out-of-hours quality standards. It has taken far too long, but I am certain that, if the will exists, we can have out-of-hours services that restore the confidence of rural communities.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21069994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Out-of-hours Health Care Provision"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will be brief, Presiding Officer.

That issue was flagged up in consultation on the revised code by stakeholders who include&#8212;importantly&#8212;the chairs of public bodies.</p><p>The current code requires selection panel members to be familiar with its content, but it does not say that panel members must be competent to assess applicants by the assessment methods that are chosen, nor does it require them to be knowledgeable about equality and diversity issues and about how such matters might affect the outcome of appointment rounds. I share the commissioner's belief that a requirement for competence and knowledge of those matters should have an impact on the people who apply for roles on selection panels and&#8212;ultimately&#8212;on the make-up of the boards that they select. I therefore agree with her that those attributes should be a requirement in the revised code of practice.

Robbie Renwick and David Carry, who are both double swimming medallists in the Delhi Commonwealth games, live near me on the outskirts of Aberdeen, and world champion Hannah Miley comes from Inverurie, which is just a few miles away. Shooting medallists Jennifer McIntosh and Kay Copland are also from the Aberdeen area, and three Nordic skiers from Huntly&#8212;Andrew Musgrave, Andrew Young, and Callum Smith, who was in reserve&#8212;were part of our team in the last winter Olympics. All those people deserve our warmest congratulations on their achievements and all can be held up as tremendous role models for the youth of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.</p><p>World-class sporting events like the Olympic and Commonwealth games and this week's Ryder cup do a great deal to stimulate national pride and patriotism and to bring communities together in support of their local heroes. Not everyone can aspire to being an elite athlete in whatever sporting discipline, but everyone can improve their fitness by taking part in physical activity such as walking, cycling, swimming or by participating in organised sport. There are many on-going initiatives in Scotland to encourage walking to school or walking for pleasure, cycling to work or even getting involved in allotment gardening, which is a pet hobby-horse of mine.</p><p>Sport has an enormous impact on the lives of very many people in Scotland. I was amazed to learn from the sports alliance that there are about 12,000 sports clubs across the country, with 20 per cent of the population participating in them. Beyond that, many more of our fellow Scots are involved in sport through gym membership or as active supporters of sports such as football, rugby <place-holder colnum=\"29530\"/> and hockey who attend matches all over the country almost every weekend.</p><p>Sport is Scotland's missing link, as it bridges the key policy agendas of health, education, communities, the economy, justice and the environment. In the limited time that is available to me, I will focus on the positive impact that sport has on our health&#8212;physical and mental&#8212;as a nation.</p><p>With over a million adults and 150,000 children in Scotland already obese, with obesity levels predicted to reach more than 40 per cent by 2030 and with an estimated 2,500 people dying prematurely in Scotland every year due to physical inactivity, there is an urgent need to encourage people to adopt an active lifestyle at an early age and to maintain physical activity throughout their lives into old age. That will contribute to the prevention and management of many common health problems that cost the national health service a small fortune, including cardiovascular disease and hypertension, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and some cancers.</p><p>Moreover, the benefits of physical activity are well recognised in preventing and relieving mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. As was said in evidence to the Health and Sport Committee,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is very hard to be active, sporty, obese and depressed at the same time.\"</p><p>It is vital that we spread the word across Scotland of the value of physical activity and sport to society. That is why I have signed up to the Scottish sports alliance's pledge for sport and why I, too, encourage all MSPs to do likewise, if they have not done so already.</p><p>I asked a teenage class from Dyce academy in Aberdeen who visited the Parliament this afternoon about their involvement in sport. They all said&#8212;boys and girls&#8212;that they currently play an active part in sporting activity. I found that quite heartening.</p><p>I have come nowhere near to dealing with all the many benefits that are to be derived from sport in our communities, but I will sum up by quoting England's former chief medical officer. He stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The potential benefits of physical activity to health are huge. If a medication existed which had a similar effect, it would be regarded as a 'wonder drug' or 'miracle cure'.\"</p><p>Presiding Officer, 2014, when Scotland will host the Commonwealth games and the Ryder cup, is fast approaching, and I cannot imagine a better legacy from those iconic events than to achieve a healthier Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21007025", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate James Kelly on securing this timely and important debate, and I fully endorse his motion.

It is therefore exciting that Scotland could be in a position to harness the offshore renewables sector's potential. With three of the world's largest offshore renewables projects in the pipeline and set to come on stream in the next four years, we need to do more to ensure not only that the north-east and the rest of Scotland benefit from the development, but that the jobs and economic growth that might stem from it are maximised. The offshore valuation study clearly points to how that potential can be realised through the development of a European supergrid. The study suggests that harnessing just a third of Scotland's practical offshore wind, wave and tidal resource by 2050 would take the country's installed offshore renewables capacity to 68GW.</p><p>As everyone knows, I do not always agree with the First Minister, but I fully endorse the comments that he made this week at the low-carbon investment conference in Edinburgh and the launch of the offshore wind industry group's route map. With required capital expenditure in offshore projects estimated to be at least &#163;177 billion in Scotland alone, it is vital that all political parties work to demonstrate the opportunities that exist for private finance leaders to seize the multibillion pound opportunities in renewables and low-carbon technology and, more importantly, to demonstrate that Scotland is not only open to business but has people with the transferable skills that can give businesses a competitive advantage. The jobs potential cannot be underestimated, with up to 60,000 new green jobs potentially being created across the low-carbon sector by the end of this decade, some 28,000 of them directly servicing domestic and worldwide offshore wind markets.</p><p>Although the First Minister is not here this evening, I am sure that he would want to acknowledge and warmly endorse the decision by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition Government at Westminster to review the transmission rates scheme and the coalition Government's agreement to work to deliver an offshore electricity grid in order to support the development of a new generation of offshore wind power.</p><p>The future development of the renewables sector in Scotland will go hand in hand with the future of the oil and gas industry, and the many present and future opportunities that both sectors offer our country. However, there are many challenges&#8212;not least the need to develop the sector skills that will be required to take advantage of the jobs and economic potential that the renewables sector can develop.<place-holder colnum=\"29235\"/></p><p>I believe that all political parties can see that potential, and what we need now is the political will to create the right environment for business enterprise, and lower regulation that will allow that potential to be delivered.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21015261", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offshore Renewables"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "MSPs who represent the north-east of Scotland, such as myself, clearly see the importance of the oil and gas and offshore renewables sector and view it as being pivotal to the future economic prosperity not only of our part of Scotland, but of the entire nation.

That put pressure on the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, of which I am a member, to produce our report on the procedural implications of the Calman recommendations in time to feed into the UK Parliament's bill and it limited the time that we could give to consideration of some of the proposals, as others have said. In particular, it precluded our carrying out of an in-depth procedural review of the Scotland Act 1998, as was recommended by the commission.</p><p>However, as we have heard, we gave proper consideration to the best means of implementing a number of the Calman proposals, notably those on relations between parliamentary committees and between our Parliament and Scottish MEPs. We looked carefully at the commission's proposal for the establishment of a joint liaison committee of the UK and Scottish Parliaments to oversee relations and at its recommendation to remove barriers to joint working between the committees of the two Parliaments.</p><p>However, because significant amendments to the Scotland Act 1998 would be required to allow those proposals to be adopted, we felt as a committee that the detailed consideration that would be needed to inform legislative change would not be possible within the current timescale and therefore concluded that more informal working arrangements could be looked at, in the first instance, at least.</p><p>With regard to developing better interaction with Scottish MEPs, the committee felt that the suggestions for forging closer links that the Parliament's European and External Relations Committee put forward would, in effect, deliver the spirit of the commission's recommendations. The committee's proposed open-door policy, whereby MEPs could add agenda items to its meetings, along with a programme of regular videoconferences with MEPs and the holding of an annual meeting of the committee in Brussels with Scottish MEPs to go over the European Commission's work programme, would allow closer links to develop between the two Parliaments and would avoid the complexities of committee membership for MEPs. For those reasons, we felt that the European and External Relations Committee's proposals should be accepted as the best way forward.</p><p>We also looked at intergovernmental and interparliamentary relations, at legislative consent <place-holder colnum=\"29051\"/> motions and legislation in reserved areas, at the issue of members' interests and at recommendations concerning the Scottish Parliament's procedures. Positive interaction and dialogue between the UK and Scottish Governments and between the two Parliaments are, indeed, important as we look to Scotland's future development, and recent experience has shown that much of that can be achieved informally by political agreement or protocol rather than by procedural change.</p><p>As my colleague David McLetchie indicated, an excellent start was made when David Cameron came to Scotland in his first week as Prime Minister, and the meeting between the Secretary of State for Scotland and committee conveners that followed soon after set a precedent for positive interparliamentary relationships in the future. I am also encouraged by the on-going dialogue between Parliament and Westminster such as in the current co-operation between Scotland's party leaders in their approach to the Secretary of State for Defence, and this week's agreement to put Richard Lochhead at the forefront of fisheries talks in the European Parliament.</p><p>On the legislative process, as we have heard already, the Calman recommendation for a four-stage bill procedure was not considered to be necessary. There is already enough flexibility in our current rules for a four-stage process to be used when necessary. However, we accepted that section 31 of the Scotland Act 1998 should be amended to take account of recommendations on legislative competence, even if that is at odds with the Government's opinion.</p><p>The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee's work was limited to considering procedural issues and so covered only 16 out of 60 of the Calman report's recommendations. Clearly, there is still to take place the much wider debate on all the commission's findings. I think that we have given a fair representation of what can be achieved informally, and what will require some changes to the Scotland Act 1998, such as recommendations to give Parliament more discretion over how it regulates members' interests, and more flexibility in the appointment of our Presiding Officers and their deputies.</p><p>The committee has done its best in the limited time that was available to it to give a reasoned and overall positive response to the procedural recommendations in the Calman commission's report.

There is no doubt that Lothian and Borders MSPs have similar concerns about the potential closure of the Edinburgh lab. The issue has united politicians across the political spectrum, because we all recognise how important the forensic services are to the wellbeing of the communities that we serve.</p><p>I do not intend to rehearse all the concerns that have been expressed about the potential loss of the Aberdeen lab, but I want to highlight the inevitability of an increased turnaround time, which would adversely impact on the speed with which criminals are identified and brought to justice. That could be a significant issue for the Aberdeen area, which has a particularly high incidence of drugs-related crime and a serious incidence of crack cocaine abuse. There would be significantly more movement of forensic material between the Grampian and Highland areas and the Dundee laboratory, which would lead to as yet unspecified transportation costs, security issues and environmental impacts as a result of repeated journeys by road.</p><p>From our study of the options paper, my party reached the conclusion that option two&#8212;the base case and evidence management solution&#8212;gives the most viable alternative to the status quo, as it would ensure that services would remain accessible throughout Scotland and lead to savings of &#163;5.6 million over five years, followed by savings of &#163;2 million a year thereafter, from 2012-13. Option two is also favoured by staff in the service, who are very receptive to change and are ready to move forward. They are dedicated and expert providers of the service, and I hope that their views have been given the attention that they deserve.</p><p>The past few years have been extremely worrying and unsettling for the many people involved in providing the essential forensic services on which we all rely. I hope that, having listened to members, the cabinet secretary's response to the SPSA's recommendation will allay our fears and lead to a modernised national forensic service in Scotland that we can all be proud of.<place-holder colnum=\"28859\"/><place-holder time=\"10:52:00\"/></p><p><a id=\"TOC_SPKR_eb795f4c-ae30-44c9-87d5-bf022e\" name=\"TOC_SPKR_eb795f4c-ae30-44c9-87d5-bf022e\"><strong>Christina McKelvie (Central Scotland) (SNP): </strong></a>>I always take great delight in such debates. They are full of hope, partnership and the desire to engage constructively in the subject matter, and arguments in them are presented in a positive and forward-looking manner. They are a pleasure.</p><p>To be serious, the commitment and passion that members across the chamber have demonstrated clearly show the high esteem in which they hold our forensic services in Scotland.</p><p>It is important to know the background facts, so I would like to remind members of some of the SNP Government's great achievements. I know that members always like to hear about those achievements&#8212;I can tell by the noise&#8212;and I am delighted to indulge them.</p><p>The SNP manifesto commitment on an extra 1,000 police officers has been more than achieved, and they have had an effect. They are part of the reason why there has been a 32-year low in crime rates. That is an excellent effect that the SNP Government has produced, and it demonstrates that Scotland is safer.</p><p>Anyone who has been following the news cannot have failed to notice the emphasis that there has been on tackling serious and organised crime. Drug dealers are getting longer sentences under the SNP Government. With strong political backing, our police forces are putting the bad guys behind bars. The SNP Government is tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime: the criminals.</p><p>Part of the force&#8212;the successful team&#8212;that is arrayed against those criminals is, of course, our forensic capability. That forensic prowess, from a service that is essential to policing, relies on the specialist staff who are employed in each of Scotland's eight force areas, as well as on the experts who are employed in the fingerprint departments and laboratories by the Scottish Police Services Authority. The services that are under review, which are mentioned in the motion, are the four laboratories, not the scene-of-crime teams or the fingerprint teams. The services that are under review are provided by the forensic scientists.</p><p>I have been told that the fastest way to upset a police forensic scientist is to compare their work to what happens in the \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" television programme and to say that our forensic teams would love to be able to stroll into a crime scene, spray some magic powder, shine an ultraviolet light, and then be able to tell whodunnit and how. However, the reality is that we are talking about serious and dedicated professional scientists who deliver an excellent <place-holder colnum=\"28860\"/> service and help us to make Scotland a safer country.</p><p>They do not sweep in with sirens and flashing lights and they do not make arrests&#8212;they leave that to the police. They do not make prosecution decisions or construct a case&#8212;they leave that to the procurators fiscal. They do not decide what can and cannot be used as evidence or take sentencing decisions&#8212;they leave that to the courts. What they do is to provide analysis of the evidence that is presented to assist those other people to do their jobs. They do that well and conscientiously and without fanfare. They work as quickly as possible, but take as much time as is needed to get the job done properly, and they make sure that it is done properly. They will continue to do that.</p><p>The idea in the motion that the possible reorganisation would somehow threaten the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"speedy access to evidence for the detection of those responsible for crimes and the prevention of further offences\"</p><p>is an insult to those scientists. They will not hold up the processing of evidence and nor will they take longer than is necessary. Neither the individual scientists nor the SPSA would suggest any reorganisation or new practice that would impact adversely on their ability to do their job well and in good time.</p><p>Employment concerns will surface in the mind of anyone whose place of work is under review.

I also share the concerns that are expressed in the report about the slow and inconsistent provision of electronic technology in Scotland over the past decade or so. Like Christine Grahame, I am a bit of a technophobe&#8212;I hope that I have understood correctly the report on clinical portals, especially as I am not a member of the committee that took evidence during the inquiry.</p><p>Given the undoubted financial savings and improved services for patients that would result from clinical portal technology and telehealth solutions, it seems inconceivable that progress towards their implementation has been so slow and patchy at a time of rapidly advancing technology. The speedy exchange of patients' health information&#8212;be that their medical history or information about their allergies and drug sensitivities or the medication that they are currently receiving&#8212;must be of immense benefit to patients, particularly in an emergency situation when they may be in the care of health professionals who are not familiar with their records. The rapid transmission of test results to a hospital or GP will help to ensure speedy diagnosis, treatment with appropriate drugs based on accurate information and the ending of the common practice&#8212;which Ian McKee, Richard Simpson and I know all too well&#8212;of repeating a barrage of tests every time that a patient presents in hospital. That will surely result in significant savings in junior doctor and laboratory time and costs.<place-holder colnum=\"28770\"/></p><p>I fully understand the concerns of the BMA and others about the risks of breaching patient confidentiality and the need for a proper identity and access management system across the NHS. With that in place, and a reliable system to ensure the application of ethical standards of confidentiality, I can see only benefits from clinical portal technology in the NHS, although the caveats from Ian McKee and Jamie Stone cannot be ignored.</p><p>The committee appears to be somewhat at odds with the Government in recommending strongly that efforts should be directed towards a single portal system across all health boards, rather than the incremental approach towards a maximum of four portals that is currently proposed. Although there is a need for the speedy implementation of clinical portal technology, health boards are in different states of readiness for it and there are difficulties in merging existing systems into one national portal, as Dr Kelly, the Scottish Government's e-health clinical lead, explained to the committee. I therefore see why the Government has opted for a portal that draws relevant patient information from a variety of systems at the point that it is required by the patient's clinician rather than going with the committee's recommendation, although the Government states that it shares the committee's desire for more sharing and greater commonality of systems.</p><p>Cost and value for money are particularly important at this time of financial constraint and I welcome the committee's stated intention to focus on the financing of clinical portals when it considers the Government's draft budget for next year, given that information on the capital costs for the development and implementation of projects is not readily available.</p><p>I am appalled that telehealth and telemedicine are still not available right across the NHS in Scotland. I remember being excited about the possible applications of telehealth solutions way back in my early days as a doctor in Aberdeen when Nelson Norman, who was at the time a senior lecturer in surgery at the university, pioneered their use in connection&#8212;if I remember rightly&#8212;with the oil industry. He did so initially from a tiny room at the back of my husband's health centre.</p><p>Over the years, as technology has improved, and largely due to the enthusiasm and hard work of clinicians such as Jim Ferguson at Aberdeen royal infirmary, telehealth solutions have increasingly been used, in the north-east and elsewhere, in the diagnosis and treatment of skin disease, the management of epilepsy, the interpretation of X-rays sent from remote centres <place-holder colnum=\"28771\"/> and in empowering patients to manage their long-term conditions at home.</p><p>There are so many benefits for patients, particularly in remote and rural communities, and there is still enormous potential for the future, provided that the communications infrastructure&#8212;up-to-date broadband technology, in other words&#8212;is available, as Jamie Stone stressed in his contribution.</p><p>I visited the Scottish centre for telehealth with Mary Scanlon a couple of years ago, and I still remember Jim Ferguson's frustration at being hampered in the roll-out of services by what can only be described as the vested interests of senior clinicians who were afraid of losing their fiefdoms to modern technology. Surely patients' interests must come first, even if clinical empires have to fall by the wayside to accommodate them.</p><p>During the committee's consideration of telehealth development, it became clear that there was a lack of national assessment criteria on which to base assessment of the impact, effectiveness and cost sustainability of telehealth projects in the delivery of health care. For example, the potential benefits of telehealth solutions in providing GP out-of-hours cover in remote and rural areas are well recognised, but that is one instance in which the lack of national assessment criteria is proving to be a stumbling block in the transition of telehealth pilot projects into permanent delivery tools for health care across the country. A key element of the telehealth strategy must therefore include such criteria to allow for the effective analysis and delivery of telehealth solutions in the health service.</p><p>I very much hope that the incorporation of the Scottish centre for telehealth into NHS 24 will allow rapid progress to be made in realising the full potential of what is a magnificent technology. Patients deserve no less, and the pioneering work of the NHS personnel whom I have mentioned deserves no less. I was excited by the report that we are discussing and I hope that the Government will implement many of its recommendations, which I am sure will allow the best modern diagnosis and treatment to become available to patients wherever they live in Scotland and ensure best value in the use of our precious NHS resources.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21001008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: E-health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join others in acknowledging the painstaking work of the Health and Sport Committee and its clerks that has led to the comprehensive report that we are discussing.

However, in its briefing for the debate, the BBC makes it clear that at present it is resistant to Scottish rugby's plea to extend its coverage of the sport and says that it makes significant investment in Scottish rugby. It emphasises that Scottish football draws its mass audience and that that is its main focus for investment. I support the terms of the motion and share the concern that has been expressed by the SRU about the BBC's reluctance to commit to this year's autumn test matches against New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa. I hope that the BBC will review that decision and take into account the growing appetite for more rugby to be broadcast in Scotland.</p><p>Growing the game in Scotland is important and great efforts have been made by Scottish rugby at national and local levels to involve more young people in the sport. That is paying off with a genuine increase in the sport's popularity, in terms both of more people participating in the sport and increasing viewing figures. It is clear that there are major gaps in broadcast coverage in Scotland, unlike in Wales, where as we heard, broadcasting has increased.</p><p>Rugby players can act as extremely positive role models. They can inspire young people and encourage them to become physically active, with consequential benefits to their health, local community and society in general. That process would be given a boost if increased regular <place-holder colnum=\"28153\"/> coverage, particularly on television, could be secured. An e-mail was sent to my office by Greenock Wanderers Rugby Football Club, which said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The lack of broadcasting coverage of Scottish rugby could jeopardise the good work which has been done at grass roots level to build up the sport. Across Scotland a considerable number of initiatives have been undertaken to improve facilities and the image and popularity of the sport. However, without support from Scottish broadcasters, we face an uphill battle. It is notable that in other parts of the UK the sport does receive support from broadcasters, and this is having a positive effect at grass roots level.\"</p><p>I am sure that that represents the sentiments of many other rugby clubs across the country.</p><p>The SRU and local rugby clubs throughout Scotland are to be commended on the work that they do day in, day out, to help increase youth participation. In the north-east, for example, we have some great clubs such as Aberdeen Grammar Rugby and Ellon Rugby Football Club. I was invited to watch the Ellon players train and it was a great experience to witness the enthusiasm of the up-and-coming young players. The work that is being done to develop the talent of all ages, from micros to secondary 4 pupils, is most impressive and will deliver the sporting stars of tomorrow, as the north-east has done in the past. Many individuals give their time freely to coach and help support local clubs and they are all to be praised for their community commitment.</p><p>This debate is timely as Scotland looks to the legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth games in Glasgow. It is vital that we see more rugby coverage at all levels to allow the sport to operate on an equal footing with other major sports.</p>", "hdate": "2010-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20876837", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rugby (Broadcasting)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sarah Boyack on securing the debate.

The Rev Gary McIntyre put it well when he explained that the intention was to protect the \"DNA\" of the home.</p><p>However, as the convener has highlighted, the committee also heard evidence about the widening demand for the home's services and the wish of the trustees and the chief executive to provide services for men and women of all ages. That has been a key component in the promoter's wish to bring forward the bill for the Parliament's approval.</p><p>Unfortunately, alcohol-related dementia is a growing problem in Scotland and current social trends mean that the home's facilities are required by a much younger age group than is allowed by the home's current constitution. Now, men and women as young as in their 30s need the facilities that the home provides.</p><p>We heard how the bill will help the home to meet the demand from client groups that councils have had extreme difficulty in placing&#8212;particularly women, who are still in the minority but who are increasingly becoming a demand area for the services offered by the home.</p><p>The home has made an excellent job of using its current facilities to serve its residents, but its care manager felt that it could do even better</p><p class=\"indent\">\"with more modern facilities for the future. [<em>Official Report, William Simpson's Home (Transfer of Property etc) (Scotland) Bill Committee</em>, 27 April 2010; c 21.]</p><p>One further positive outcome to be achieved by the home's future development that was welcomed by the local authorities from which we took evidence is the development of the home's outreach and rehabilitation services.</p><p>We were pleased to find out that placement at William Simpson's home is made on the basis of social need and does not have any geographical constrictions.</p><p>Should the bill be passed today, William Simpson's home will become a charitable company with a very different management structure from that which was established by the <place-holder colnum=\"27063\"/> 1864 act. During its evidence taking, the committee examined how that would work in practice and how it would impact on the work and ethos of the home. The patron of the home, Dennis Canavan, felt that the restructuring to a charitable company would allow for \"more of a link\" between the local community, the families of service users and the home. It is felt that that development will mean that people will have more of a sense of ownership of the home.</p><p>The convener has set out the home's continuing commitment to ex-servicemen and women.

Techniques, drugs and procedures are available now that were undreamt of when I was a medical student, and others are long since obsolete.</p><p>From what was a paternalistic organisation, where the consultant was god and the patient was the passive recipient of what was thought to be best for him, the NHS now rightly seeks to involve the patient at every level of his journey through the system. There is a much greater emphasis on prevention of disease and, increasingly, patients are encouraged to take personal responsibility for managing their long-term medical conditions. More and more demands are placed on the NHS, which to some extent is becoming the victim of its own success. People are living far longer, which is made possible by the long-term treatment of many conditions that killed off previous generations.</p><p>Thankfully, since the inception of the NHS, Governments of whatever colour have remained committed to it, and resources have been made available whenever possible to enable it to flourish. Medical fashions have come and gone, and political ideologies have influenced how the organisation has developed and been managed. Despite that, though, as we have heard today, we still have a health service that, although not perfect, is one that we can be proud of, and an NHS workforce that is committed to doing its best for the patients it serves.</p><p>It is therefore good news, when our new Westminster Government has to face up to the enormous debt crisis left by the outgoing Labour Government, that the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition has clearly stated its commitment to the NHS by guaranteeing a real-terms increase in health spending in each year of the Parliament. It is further good news for Scotland that the SNP Government has agreed that all resultant Barnett consequentials will be applied to the NHS in Scotland. That means that the financial crisis that we have inherited from Labour should not impact on the NHS as it will on other public services.</p><p>However, if the NHS is to live up to the rising standards of patient care that people nowadays expect and deserve, it has never been more important to ensure that resources are deployed efficiently and effectively. There is an urgent need to look at how the NHS delivers and to consider introducing reforms that will achieve our ambition to have a world-class NHS that delivers the best health care possible. I agree with Ross Finnie that we had a helpful and constructive briefing from the Royal College of Nursing.<place-holder colnum=\"26900\"/></p><p>Patient needs are paramount, and any changes and efficiency savings must ensure that patient welfare is not compromised. As Murdo Fraser said, that is achievable; by considering carefully the outcomes for patients under the care of the NHS, and planning with that in mind, it should be achievable. Easy accessibility is very important for patients, which is why my party believes in local provision of NHS services wherever possible. If we make local access easy for patients, it becomes easier for them to self-manage their long-term conditions. With the help of good primary care services, they are less likely to need the much more expensive secondary and tertiary services that are provided in our major hospitals. That is one way of saving money for the NHS.</p><p>Local access is important day and night, which is why we feel that out-of-hours cover must be improved, particularly in more remote parts of the country such as Kinloch Rannoch, with whose petition to the Parliament I have a great deal of sympathy; I hope that the cabinet secretary responds appropriately to it. The need for local accessibility is why we fought the previous Scottish Executive's plans to centralise A and E and maternity services. It is why we were delighted that A and E services were retained at Ayr and Monklands, and why I as a North East Scotland MSP was relieved when Andy Kerr was finally persuaded, after a hard-fought campaign, to retain and develop some of the local maternity services in Aberdeenshire. It was also important for the north-east that we were able to retain neurological and children's cancer services in Aberdeen, rather than having them centralised in Edinburgh or Glasgow, as proposed by Labour. Such centralisation would have been to the detriment of patients.</p><p>As the NHS evolves, service changes and efficiencies will always be necessary, but those must all have the interests of patients at their core. Some of the best improvements come from suggestions made by members of staff. Health boards will always benefit from involving staff in any plans that they have for generating efficiencies. Small changes in delivery can lead to far-reaching benefits for patients.</p><p>Of course, people are fearful of change, particularly when that change can affect how staff are deployed in running the service. However, I do not share Labour's gloomy outlook on the future. We have been assured that there is a commitment to having no compulsory redundancies in the NHS in Scotland, but there is also a realisation in the service that funding is going to be tight for the foreseeable future. I think that staff will willingly do their best to deliver efficiencies while protecting high standards of patient care. I welcome the independent scrutiny group that is being set up, <place-holder colnum=\"26901\"/> which I have no doubt will make certain that standards are kept high.</p><p>When resources are under pressure, priorities become increasingly important. For my party, it was extremely important to reverse Labour's plans to increase employers' national insurance, which would undoubtedly have put jobs at risk in the NHS. We also oppose the SNP's plans to abolish prescription charges completely, because the money that that would lose the NHS would, in our opinion, be far better spent on treating patients than on affording free prescriptions to people who are able&#8212;and indeed willing&#8212;to contribute towards their cost.</p><p>In the hard times ahead, it will be essential to deliver health care in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. However, that need not and should not be to the detriment of patient welfare. It is therefore important that health boards and Government consider carefully their current workforces and skills mix, and produce workforce plans that will ensure that those are appropriate to meet the current and future needs of the service. That is why I am happy to support the SNP and Conservative amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20818209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During the near half century that I have been associated with the NHS, there have been enormous changes in what it has delivered and how it has delivered it.

There is a certain irony that, as I pick up the health <place-holder colnum=\"26750\"/> brief again, just as the new Conservative-Lib Dem coalition takes the reins at Westminster, the first debate to come my way should be about the achievement of Government-set waiting times targets.</p><p>That is not to decry the very welcome progress that has been made on shortening the time that patients have to wait between referral and treatment, which is clearly of great importance for patients at a time when many of them will be fearful of what lies ahead. There is no denying that spectacular progress has been made towards the 18-week referral-to-treatment target. To have reduced waiting times to the unprecedented levels that the cabinet secretary quoted at the start of the debate is a tremendous achievement, which could not have been possible without the co-operation at every level of a committed, very hard-working and dedicated NHS workforce, which has rightly received plaudits from all sides of the chamber today.</p><p>I note the cabinet secretary's caveat in connection with cancer waiting times&#8212;that they must be sustainable. That is indeed important.</p><p>Waiting times are not the only indicator of performance in the NHS, nor are they the most important, as members have said. Improving patient outcomes must be the focus for the NHS, as well as the quality of care that patients receive. The cabinet secretary is well aware of that, but it is always worth reiterating it. As Mary Scanlon pointed out in her speech, in a target-driven system there is too often a temptation to make decisions that tick boxes and meet paper deadlines rather than clinical need. If that is pushed too far, it eventually frustrates professionals and demoralises the workforce to the detriment of patients' welfare, and it erodes trust in the ability of the NHS to deliver the outcomes that we all want to see. Ross Finnie's amendment makes some important points in that regard, and we are happy to support it.</p><p>There will always be competition for resource in the NHS, as demographics change, as biomedical science and technology advance and as pharmaceutical research makes available new drugs that can prolong life and improve its quality for patients who previously would have had no hope of survival. For example, there has been real progress in recent months on the availability of cancer drugs for terminally ill patients, following the determined campaign by the late Mike Gray and his wife Tina McGeever. The cabinet secretary is to be commended for her response to their petition to the Parliament.</p><p>It is so important to protect funding for the NHS at this time of severe pressure on public sector finance, as Murdo Fraser said. That is why our amendment looks to the SNP Government to <place-holder colnum=\"26751\"/> commit to protecting health service spending, just as the UK coalition Government has pledged to guarantee real-terms health spending increases year on year. We are delighted to have the cabinet secretary's reassurance about that commitment.</p><p>Much can be done in the NHS by the people who work within it looking critically at current practice and suggesting changes and innovations that will impact on its efficiency in achieving the best outcomes for patients. There have already been a number of successful innovations in the Scottish NHS as a result of staff input, and there must be many more possibilities.</p><p>The example that comes most readily to my mind is the dramatic reduction in waiting times for patients in Tayside who require physiotherapy, which was brought about after physiotherapists there took a long, hard look at why patients were waiting 18 weeks to be seen&#8212;18 weeks during which many readily treatable acute conditions could progress to a chronic state, resulting in easily preventable time off work and the inevitable impact of that on the benefits system and the local economy. Having considered the detail of the referral-to-treatment process, streamlined it and cut out the duplication, those physiotherapists were able to reduce the waiting time to four days&#8212;a dramatic reduction by any standards. Not only did that achieve the best outcome for patients, it resulted in staff ownership of the patient journey and a greatly increased level of professional satisfaction.</p><p>Such great ideas often come out of stressful situations, and I reckon that if clinicians and others working in the NHS were allowed to focus just a bit more on patient outcomes rather than centrally set targets, we would see some real efficiency improvements in the service, such as better use of available resources, better outcomes for patients and more satisfaction for staff, who are the bedrock of our NHS.</p><p>We all know that significant challenges lie ahead. The legacy of the recently defeated Labour Government's mismanagement of our public services will take some sorting, but with the Scottish Government's commitment to protect NHS funding, and the continuing dedication of our hard-working NHS staff, whom we rightly applaud today, we can look forward to improving outcomes for patients and an NHS that is fit to cope with the increased demands that will be placed upon it by an aging population and the availability of new treatments that are made possible as a result of scientific and technological innovation.</p><p>We are happy to acknowledge the progress that has been made so far in improving NHS access times for patients.

Being firmly rooted in the north-east of Scotland, I am afraid that I have no direct personal experience of crofting. However, I am aware of the fragility of the crofting lifestyle, which has been made worse by the recent decline in sheep farming, and of the need for crofters to have an alternative income, which may sometimes mean going quite far away from their crofts, for example to work in the North Sea oil industry.</p><p>The laws that regulate crofting have become increasingly complex over the years and there seems little agreement among crofters on how they should be improved. The bill is a genuine attempt to underpin and sustain a way of life that is extremely important for some of Scotland's most remote and fragile areas.</p><p>I have spent some considerable time reading the <em>Official Reports</em> of the committee's evidence-taking sessions and its conclusions in its stage 1 report, and I have listened with great interest this morning as members across the chamber have articulated their opinions on various aspects of the bill's proposals.</p><p>Sarah Boyack and Elaine Murray expressed significant concerns about several aspects of the bill, as detailed in the Labour amendment, and they stressed the point that financial resources and incentives must be identified to underpin the legislation. Peter Peacock remains fundamentally opposed to a map-based register of crofts, which he regards as unnecessary, and to charging for registration. However, he is in favour of community mapping, which appears to have widespread support throughout the chamber.</p><p>For the committee, Maureen Watt reminded members that we should be realistic about what legislation can achieve on its own and that regulation alone will not secure the future of crofting.</p><p>My colleague John Scott expressed a fear, which he hopes will not be realised, that there will be apathy and low turnout for elections to the crofting commission&#8212;and, as members know, we <place-holder colnum=\"26172\"/> have not had it all our own way recently on the methods for voting in elections. He also emphasised the need for crofters to be resident in order to sustain the crofting community.</p><p>Liam McArthur voiced concerns about the intention to have ministers appoint the chairman of the commission instead of leaving that to members of the commission. John Farquhar Munro, with his lifelong personal experience of crofting, sees no need for further crofting legislation as he feels that existing regulation has served the crofting communities well.</p><p>The policy memorandum to the bill makes it clear that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The objectives of this Bill are to put in place a robust regulatory and governance framework for the future of crofting ... and ensure that crofting continues to contribute to sustainable economic growth in some of Scotland's most remote, rural communities.\"</p><p>That sounds good, but it is clear from the evidence sessions that crofters are not happy with the bill as it stands and that, assuming the general principles are accepted at decision time today, further work will be required to strengthen and improve it as it progresses through the parliamentary process.</p><p>There has undoubtedly been growing and widespread concern in recent years that crofting is in decline as a result of persistently high levels of absenteeism, increasing neglect of crofting land and the ongoing removal and development of land from crofting tenure. There has been a general feeling that the existing governance arrangements and regulatory framework have not been successful in stopping that decline. As I said at the outset, there is a general acceptance that crofting law has become overly complex and needs to be consolidated and simplified, but I know that it is agreed that that would be for consideration by a future Administration and not part of the bill under discussion.</p><p>The intentions of the various parts of the bill are clear and admirable: to make the Crofters Commission more effective in delivering its core function of regulating crofting; to allow it to amend its constitution to allow for directly elected members, thus making it more representative of, and accountable to, the people it regulates; and to give it more flexibility to develop its regulatory policy in the interests of crofting communities and the wider public interest. All those proposals seem very sensible and acceptable.</p><p>The proposals in part 2 for a new, map-based register, which would clearly define the extent of, and interests in, a croft and other land within crofting tenure, such as common grazings, should, it is claimed, give security to crofters over their tenancy. The proposals in part 3 to place a duty on the commission to take action in respect of <place-holder colnum=\"26173\"/> absenteeism and neglect by tenant and owner-occupier crofters should, on the face of it, help to ensure that crofting will contribute to the sustainable economic growth of crofting communities by requiring crofters to be resident on or near their land and to put it to some kind of productive use.</p><p>Part 4 is aimed at helping to sustain crofting communities and the environmental, cultural and landscape benefits that derive from a crofting lifestyle, by tackling speculation on the development value of croft land through strengthening the commission's ability to reject an application to take the land out of crofting tenure.</p><p>All of that sounds fine, but the devil is in the detail, and many of the proposals in the bill have proven to be controversial in the crofting communities, and the committee has not been able to agree on some of them either, as we have seen from the report and heard in today's debate. There has clearly been a great deal of discussion and debate around the bill, and many issues are as yet unresolved. Overall, however, it appears that the proposed legislation should have a positive impact on the crofting communities, and will go some way towards halting the decline that has beset them in recent years.</p><p>I conclude by stating that, as John Scott has said, we will support the general principles of the bill at stage 1, but on the basis that there will have to be significant changes and amendments at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766264", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not a member of the committee that scrutinised the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill at stage 1, so sadly I did not have the opportunity afforded to committee members to visit some of the crofting communities to see and hear at first hand the issues that the bill needs to address.

Jean Lyon, the home's chief executive, said that Francis Simpson</p><p class=\"indent\">\"realised the dream of his son, William, who had, like his father, served in the navy and had seen men coming home and living rough after serving their country.

Although the planned expansion is considerable, Mr Canavan told us that it \"will not be massive\", with the number of residents increasing from 40 to approximately 60, and said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"With additional staff, it would be possible to expand the provision while keeping the original ethos.\" &#8212;[<em>Official Report, William Simpson's Home (Transfer of Property etc) (Scotland) Bill Committee</em>, 27 April 2010; c 26.]</p><p>Moreover, in its evidence, OSCR said that although the new company will benefit a broader section of people, the proposed change remains</p><p class=\"indent\">\"within the spirit of the original constitution\".</p><p>Although the committee was reassured by evidence from the promoters of their commitment to keeping the home's original purpose, we were keen to examine how the move to new governance arrangements would fit with that. In that respect, we heard how a new structure will allow broader representation on the board of directors and broad membership of the company. The proposed constitution will allow members to decide who will become directors of the charitable company; it is envisaged that that will facilitate the involvement of residents, their relatives and the community.</p><p>Another important issue for the committee to examine was how the promoter had consulted people who would be affected by the bill. We heard about how the promoter had talked about the home's development at residents' meetings, had used the key-worker system and in-house staff meetings to talk about proposals, and had met staff, trustees, board members, families and service users to discuss changes. Marion Robinson, who is an advocacy worker, advised us that she had met service users to discuss their views on the proposed changes.</p><p>The convener of the committee touched on the unique nature of the home and on how we heard about the increasing demand for its services. The committee recognised the promoter's wish that the home be able to able to offer its services to a wider and larger group of people. We also noted the lack of any geographical restriction on who <place-holder colnum=\"26102\"/> might access the home's services. Users come from various parts of Scotland, albeit that they are mainly from the central belt. The committee recognised why the bill is necessary and supports the promoter's commitment to retain the home's original ethos.</p><p>I, too, thank all the witnesses who appeared before the committee and those who provided written evidence to it.

We also agree that investment in waste recycling infrastructure will be essential if we are to have any hope of delivering a zero waste Scotland: Elaine Murray made some interesting points about resourcing that. I therefore hope that the forthcoming zero waste plan will pave the way for reducing the <place-holder colnum=\"26090\"/> amount of waste that we produce, for the reuse of resources, and for increasing recycling levels. The cabinet secretary has shared some of his thoughts on waste reduction this afternoon, and we await the plan with interest.</p><p>If we accept that a zero waste Scotland is our aspiration, everyone needs to consider how to contribute to that, whether we are householders, in business or involved in the public or voluntary sectors. If we succeed, the benefits will be considerable in environmental, social and economic terms, will help in the fight against climate change, and will afford significant business opportunities.</p><p>A number of speakers focused on food and commercial waste, which clearly contribute enormously to the total amount of waste that we generate. Any zero waste plan must target the 0.5 million tonnes of packaging and the 650,000 tonnes of food waste that are thrown out each year by Scottish households. With 75 per cent of all Scotland's waste coming from commercial organisations, that must also be targeted.</p><p>Although I personally try to be careful when I am buying food, I am as guilty as anyone of generating food waste, which I am now trying to save for composting as far as possible. However, it is quite difficult for a housewife nowadays to stick to buying the foods that she needs with every supermarket pushing multiple packs of produce at her, as Rob Gibson highlighted. Just yesterday, I went to purchase a pack of yoghurt drinks to find that one pack cost &#163;2.56, but I could get two packs for &#163;4: a temptation that I could not resist. I will use what I bought, but similar offers apply to much more perishable foods like soft fruit and vegetables, which are then wasted. Indeed, it is sometimes hard to see the unit price in some supermarkets because the two-for-one offer, or whatever the offer is, is far more prominently displayed. We need co-operation from the supermarkets if we are to be encouraged to change our buying habits to avoid food waste.</p><p>Other members have dealt with large-scale commercial waste in detail this afternoon. Councils must get together with local businesses to identify their recycling needs and put in place the necessary infrastructure and the incentives to use it. I have a great deal of sympathy with the FSB, members of which are frustrated in their efforts to recycle waste by the current lack of kerbside recycling facilities and centres that are accessible to small businesses.</p><p>Zero waste Scotland is a welcome development. As the FSB pointed out in its briefing for this debate, until now at least seven different bodies delivered national business waste and environmental advice, on top of a lot of other local projects and organisations. That overlap of <place-holder colnum=\"26091\"/> publicly funded organisations was inefficient and confusing for the business community. I hope that zero waste Scotland, as a one-stop shop, will be a greatly improved means of giving advice and support to businesses, individuals, local authorities and communities.</p><p>Zero waste is a desirable aspiration, but if there is to be hope of achieving anything even close to it, a huge effort will be required to change our habits as consumers, and serious investment will be needed to secure the necessary recycling infrastructure, especially for commercial organisations. I hope that the zero waste plan will be effective in moving us towards a zero waste Scotland, and I look forward to studying it in due course.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766193", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Zero Waste Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's short debate has shown that all sides in the chamber agree on the need for a coherent waste policy to encourage the prevention of waste and the efficient use of resources.

It improves general fitness, reduces anxiety and depression, and is proven to reduce deaths from heart disease by more than 30 per cent over 10 years. At a cost of &#163;600 per patient, compared with &#163;1,400 per day in a coronary care unit and &#163;8,000 for a heart bypass, it is clearly cost effective. It saves national health service resources by cutting readmissions to hospital, and it reduces the risk of further cardiac events by helping people to make and maintain changes in order to have a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>Prior to 2001, cardiac rehab in Grampian was NHS funded and run by the Swedish style association, but those classes were stopped on the ground of safety. Thereafter, the NHS paid for the training of exercise instructors to British Association for Cardiac Rehabilitation&#8212;BACR&#8212;standards to allow them to take classes. The local authorities did not take up the running of such classes as anticipated, so three of the people who <place-holder colnum=\"25959\"/> had attended the Swedish style classes decided to set up an association to develop and run their own classes. That was eventually achieved after lengthy discussions with NHS Grampian as to their ability to cope with the task.</p><p>The inaugural meeting of GCRA was held in June 2002, following which it became a charity and began to run its classes. Thereafter, it became a company limited by guarantee and continues as such today.</p><p>The classes are run by instructors within BACR guidelines and use a mix of exercise styles. They are aimed at giving members the type of exercise that they want and enjoy, and have become popular and are much in demand. The association has grown to 600 exercising members in 32 classes, spread throughout Aberdeenshire. The total number of present and past members to date is estimated to be more than 1,100. I have heard excellent reports from participants, and it is my intention to see for myself, and to take part in, a class as soon as possible after 6 May has come and gone.</p><p>GCRA's funding initially came from a variety of local groups, private donations and fundraising events. Then, for three years from June 2004, it received New Opportunities Fund money, and in 2007 got significant funding from NHS Grampian. BACR training courses were paid for by the Grampian heart campaign and the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland. However, most of GCRA's funding now comes from annual subscriptions, class fees, donations and fundraising events&#8212;which is not easy to sustain in these straitened times.</p><p>Partnerships have been set up with local industry, a university and councils to enable classes to be held in their facilities at little or no cost to GCRA. The Robert Gordon University school of health science was approached and has run BACR training courses in Aberdeen, which makes it easier to recruit instructors locally. Negotiations to put in place elective modules for CR instructors within physiotherapy, occupational therapy and sports science degrees are continuing. That is a first in Scotland, and only Loughborough University is currently doing the same thing.</p><p>A survey is planned for the autumn to get clear information on GCRA's members, their motivation, what they like or dislike about the classes and how their health has improved, or otherwise, as well as statistical information on referral and so on. All that should be very useful for future planning.</p><p>From a rocky start, when NHS Grampian regarded the pioneers of GCRA as a \"band of old codgers\"&#8212;to quote GCRA's briefing paper&#8212;who did not know the implications of what they were <place-holder colnum=\"25960\"/> trying to do, GCRA is now very much a working partner with NHS Grampian. Hundreds of patients and GCRA members are being helped to return to normal, active lives in the community. Two members of the GCRA management board, all of whom work on a voluntary basis, now sit on the coronary heart disease and stroke managed clinical network project board.</p><p>It is GCRA's intention that there will be nowhere in Grampian where anyone who needs and wants a cardiac rehabilitation class cannot access one easily. That is an ambitious goal, but GCRA is working on it.</p><p>I am sure that members will agree that GCRA is an excellent example of the voluntary sector at its best: it provides a very real service to patients and saves a great deal of money and resource for the NHS in Grampian. The board would like to see what GCRA does being repeated throughout Scotland. To that end, it now works with the British Heart Foundation and with Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland to promote cardiac rehab throughout the country. It is working actively in the current Scottish campaign for cardiac rehabilitation and it participates in the Parliament's cross-group party on heart disease and stroke. I know that it has put questions to the Scottish Government about the future provision of cardiac rehab in Scotland, which I hope the minister will deal with in her response to the debate.</p><p>The availability of cardiac rehabilitation is patchy across Scotland at present. It ranges from being non-existent in many areas to being driven by the council, by the NHS or by the voluntary sector in other areas. It is clear that that is less than satisfactory.</p><p>In 2005, in a speech to the European Society of Cardiology in Amsterdam, Professor Bob Lewin said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If there were a pill that cost very little, reduced cardiac deaths by 27 (now over 30)%, improved quality of life, and reduced anxiety and depression, every cardiac patient in Europe would be expected to take it. There is no such pill, but taking part in a cardiac rehabilitation programme can provide all these benefits.\"</p><p>Surely such programmes should be available to all who need them.</p><p>I will finish by warmly congratulating the founders and management board of GCRA on their magnificent achievements to date, and by wishing them well for the future. I hope that the minister will take on board the importance of their work to the whole of Scotland and let us know, in her reply to the debate, what the Government will do to secure the availability of cardiac rehab to all those in our country who need it and want it, whatever their postcode.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764752", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Grampian Cardiac Rehabilitation Association"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Until I was contacted by one of the directors of Grampian Cardiac Rehabilitation Association Ltd&#8212;or GCRA for short&#8212;I had no idea how much valuable work was being done by that organisation throughout Aberdeenshire.

However, like others, I think that the subject would have been worthy of a full morning's debate to allow a more in-depth discussion of the important issues that have been raised in the recently published UK Committee on Climate Change report and by many members this morning.</p><p>It is clear that Scotland's interim target of a 42 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020, in comparison with 1990 levels, is ambitious. With some sectors unlikely to achieve that target, others will need to achieve significantly more if the economy-wide target of a 42 per cent cut in emissions is to be reached. However, there are real opportunities for reducing emissions from the energy-intensive industries that are covered by the EU emission trading scheme, particularly in the power sector, where the investment in renewable electricity that is already well under way also has the potential to open up significant employment and other economic benefits. In that area, the Government is well aware of its important enabling role. However, my party believes that, in order to ensure secure, affordable, low-carbon energy, we need a balanced mix of energy provision in which renewables and nuclear are complementary.</p><p>In the short time available, I will touch briefly on the non-traded sector, which the Committee on Climate Change believes will need to achieve up to 47 per cent cuts in emissions if we are to meet the economy-wide target of 42 per cent. That is a tall order, for which sustained co-operative working will be required among Government, businesses large and small, and individuals. However, the target is reckoned to be achievable by adopting a wide range of measures&#8212;which have been amply expanded on by Sarah Boyack and others&#8212;such as improved energy efficiency, increased levels of heat penetration, cars that are more fuel and carbon efficient and reduced agricultural emissions.</p><p>Ahead of the debate, members received two briefings from RSPB Scotland, of which I declare my membership, and NFU Scotland, which make some important points about land use and climate change. RSPB Scotland highlights the opportunities to reduce emissions significantly through the restoration and conservation of our peatlands&#8212;an issue that Rob Gibson touched on. Our peatlands are of international repute and are recognised as important carbon sinks. Peatland restoration is cited as being cheaper than many other forms of carbon abatement, and it has the benefit that a single initial expenditure can lead to indefinite carbon reduction and long-term carbon <place-holder colnum=\"24715\"/> sequestration. It also brings financial benefits through local employment and tourism.</p><p>NFU Scotland rightly stresses the importance of farming to food security while accepting that food production will always lead to some emissions. If our growing world population is to be fed, a sustainable agricultural industry is essential, and appropriate management of nutrients, livestock and soil can ensure that food production methods become more sustainable. Further research into those areas will help the industry to continue its fight against climate change. There has already been some success, with UK emissions of methane and nitrous oxide down by 17 per cent since 1990 and CO2 emissions down by 5 per cent since 2006.</p><p>I mention the RSPB and NFUS briefings to illustrate the important contribution that land use can make in fighting and adapting to climate change. We must urgently develop a strategy to manage the complexities, conflicts and opportunities around land use so that its future potential can be realised. I hope that the Government will produce its proposed land use strategy soon.</p><p>Today, we have heard several important and interesting speeches from members, but we have only scratched the surface of how we can reach our targeted low-carbon economy. I have no doubt that the topic will be revisited many times in the chamber in the months and years ahead. We will support the motion and the Liberal Democrat and SNP amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20701619", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that the Labour Party has chosen to   make climate change the topic of its debating time today, given the pressing need for Scotland to make progress towards a low-carbon economy in order to achieve the targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.

It has allowed members to take stock of the industry and the progress that has been made since the publication last year of <place-holder colnum=\"24415\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"A Fresh Start: the renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture\".</p><p>There is general agreement that aquaculture is important for Scotland and that the farmed fish and shellfish industries need to grow. As they do so, they need to be sustainable, market led and profitable, promoting best practice and social benefits while respecting the environment. That is an ambitious target, but it is achievable if everyone who is committed to the prosperity of the fish farming sector works together in pursuit of it.</p><p>The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation states in its briefing for the debate:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Salmon farming is a major player in Scotland's food industry, producing for both the home market and for export to over 50 countries. It makes a significant contribution to the Scottish economy, and in particular to the fabric of rural communities\".</p><p>As the global demand for seafood has increased, the aquaculture industry has grown to supply that demand. The proportion of farmed fish consumed has increased from 9 per cent in 1980 to more than 50 per cent of total consumption. Exports of Scottish farmed salmon have increased by 500 per cent over the past 20 years and it is now Scotland's leading food export, worth &#163;200 million according to the SSPO.</p><p>Salmon farming represents 95 per cent of the Scottish aquaculture industry but, as we know, halibut, trout, char and cod are also important to the industry and there is enormous potential for developing the Scottish shellfish industry, particularly the production of mussels, as the minister detailed in her opening speech.</p><p>With demand continuing to grow, and given the problems that are being experienced in Chile, there is clearly increasing market potential for Scottish farmed salmon, which is regarded as a high-quality product across the world. As several members have said, it is recognised in France, under the label rouge, and in the EU through PGI accreditation. Although some issues in that regard were raised ahead of and during the debate, I, like Jamie McGrigor, hope that the Government will get it right for the Scottish industry during the forthcoming PGI consultation.</p><p>The industry needs to expand if it is to cope with demand. Scottish salmon farmers have committed to sustainable growth of 3 to 5 per cent per year during the next five years. Such growth must be accompanied by respect for the environment and high regard for the health of the fish that are produced. During my visit with Elaine Murray last summer to one of Marine Harvest's fish farms and processing plants&#8212;the visit is mentioned in the voluntary section in my entry in the register of members' interests&#8212;I was struck by people's clear commitment to monitoring and ensuring the <place-holder colnum=\"24416\"/> health of the fish that they produce, at all stages of development.</p><p>The need for vigilance and for research into the prevention and control of disease is well recognised by the industry, and the need for secure containment is of extreme concern to the people who work in the industry, because incidents such as the recent loss of smolts into Loch Lochy cause not only financial loss for the industry, but well-justified friction with wild fishing interests. The current review of the code of good practice and the on-going research and development programme are welcome and important.</p><p>Significant barriers to fish farm development have been identified, as John Scott said. The industry depends on workers who live locally and the lack of affordable housing in many of the remoter parts of Scotland is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The licensing and planning systems have made it problematic for new fish farm developments to gain approval, so the Government's newly published document, \"Delivering Planning Reform for Aquaculture\", is welcome. The intention is to streamline procedures, clarify what information is necessary to support planning applications and encourage co-operation between stakeholders in planning fish farm development. I hope that the approach will result in the restructuring and rationalisation of existing farm sites and the development of new locations that the SSPO regards as necessary if we are to meet the industry's expansion goals and the Scottish Government's stated economic intentions. However, environmental non-governmental organisations have expressed concern about proposed industry growth. The Government and the industry will have to work with NGOs to ensure that future development is sustainable.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives are strong supporters of the aquaculture industry in Scotland. The industry is a success story for Scotland and deserves credit for promoting worldwide recognition of a high-quality Scottish food product and creating jobs that make a vital contribution to sustaining some of our most fragile rural communities. It is important that Government promotes the industry nationally and internationally and tackles barriers to its expansion, while ensuring that the environment is protected in some of our most iconic and scenic tourist areas. It is also important that our world-renowned salmon angling sector is protected from contamination from escaped farmed fish.

In the preliminary stage debate, I spoke about the remarkable nature of Mrs Isabella Elder. She married into a remarkable and notable family. When I became a member of the committee, as a North East Scotland MSP I little realised that I would come to know so much about Govan and Isabella Elder.</p><p>Isabella Elder's father-in-law was David Elder, who is often described as the father of marine engineering on the Clyde. Her husband, John Elder, a marine engineer and owner of Fairfield Shipyard, was apparently an enlightened employer who, among other things, provided schools for the children of his employees. He initiated a pattern of <place-holder colnum=\"24131\"/> philanthropic works that was continued on a larger scale by his widow, Isabella. Elder park was established in 1885 by Mrs Elder as a monument to her shipbuilder husband. She wanted to give the people of Govan healthful recreation through music and amusement&#8212;the music being provided in the bandstand that used to be in the park. Statues of the husband and wife can still be seen in the park. John Elder stands beside one of the compound engines that underpinned Fairfield's success, and Mrs Elder is depicted in a statue by the Scottish sculptor, Archibald Shannon, dressed in academic robes to denote her honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow in 1901&#8212;which was quite a feat for a woman at that time.</p><p>Elder park library, which was built with funds that were given by Mrs Elder, is the only surviving Glasgow branch library, and predates the Carnegie libraries. Apparently, Mrs Elder insisted on Sunday openings for the library in order to make it accessible to working people. As I said, she was quite farsighted.</p><p>I can understand why one of the trustees of the fund, Dr McAlpine, felt moved to write a book about Mrs Elder. It is entitled, \"The Lady of Claremont House: Isabella Elder&#8212;Pioneer and Philanthropist\". Claremont House was Mrs Elder's home in Glasgow for the 36 years of her widowhood. Mrs Elder certainly justifies a book about her life and works, and we could speak at length about her achievements. However, in relation to the specific achievement of the Ure Elder fund, I want to say simply that I commend the trustees of the fund for seeking to free up its workings and for seeking out new beneficiaries.</p><p>The &#163;25 that the trustees are allowed to give recipients under the terms of the act that set up the fund was a significant amount of money at that time. However, over 100 years later, that amount of money is clearly trifling and is of no real value to potential beneficiaries. By changing to a modern charitable trust, the trustees will be able to disburse more significant amounts of money and should be able to attract the interest of more people who could derive meaningful benefit from the intended largesse of Isabella Elder.</p><p>The trustees have made a great deal of effort and incurred significant expense in the process of bringing to Parliament a bill to repeal the act that set up the Ure Elder Fund for Indigent Widowed Ladies. Their efforts, which will enable them to proceed with their plans to more meaningfully benefit more recipients of the funds that are at their disposal, will be justified when the trustees of the newly created trust meet to discuss and agree on the new applications for the funds. I wish them well in their efforts.<place-holder colnum=\"24132\"/></p><p>The Elder family name and spirit live on in the name and works of the fund&#8212;which will soon, we hope, become a trust.</p><p>I ask Parliament to support the motion at decision time today.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20662583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ure Elder Fund Transfer and Dissolution Bill: Final Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As David Stewart noted, when it was constituted, the Ure Elder Fund was a modern and forward-thinking body, which was set up by a modern and forward-thinking lady.

I, for one, look <place-holder colnum=\"24093\"/> forward to seeing what appears in the final report once all the issues that have been raised during the almost-complete public consultation phase are collated and considered by the expert team. There is a general consensus that, as the report argues, direct support for agriculture must be continued in one form or another to ensure a productive and sustainable agricultural sector in Scotland, to help the industry to adapt and improve, to maximise the delivery of public goods, and to mitigate the disadvantage that Scottish farming experiences, with 85 per cent of its land in the LFA category as we know.</p><p>There is also acknowledgement that the CAP budget is under pressure. Currently, it accounts for 41 per cent of the total EU budget but it is likely that, in the long term, the level of support for agriculture will fall and the available funds may have to be more closely targeted than hitherto. There is agreement that future support should be targeted at active farmers, with the so-called slipper brigade losing their entitlement to support, and there is a recognition that the current system of entitlement has made it difficult for new entrants to make their way in the industry, although there does not seem to be a consensus on how we should deal with that.</p><p>Brian Pack's conclusion, backed by emergent thinking from the EU, is that the current, historic system of entitlement to the single farm payment should be replaced with an area-based system. That seems to be generally acceptable, although how and when we should progress to that system is proving controversial. The resultant redistribution of support between regions and between farms of the same type will undoubtedly result in winners and losers. The more intensive livestock farms such as we have in parts of Aberdeenshire will be the worst hit&#8212;hence our amendment, which encourages the Scottish Government to ensure that any redistribution process is as equitable as possible and takes particular account of less favoured areas.</p><p>NFU Scotland suggests that the first step towards changing the Scottish single farm payment system should be the updating or rebasing of the historic model, which it says would better recognise the activity that is currently taking place on those farms that are likely to benefit from support. John Scott elaborated on that in his speech. Tenant farmers, too, have concerns about the proposed move to area-based payments, about which Dave Thompson told us in detail. They feel that that would discourage landowners from letting out their land.</p><p>The report deals with many complex issues, including top-up funds, a new rural development programme, continued less favoured area support and others issues that I, as a layman&#8212;one of the <place-holder colnum=\"24094\"/> few in the chamber just now&#8212;rely on the farming community to explain to me in detail. No doubt, the north-east NFUS will do that when it briefs MSPs at our next meeting at Thainstone, which was due to take place tomorrow but has been postponed because of the wintry weather. Getting a consensus on how we can best support our farmers into the future will not be easy. However, I have no doubt that the various concerns and points of view that were put to Brian Pack and his team during the consultation will be considered seriously as they work towards making their final recommendations.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives recognise that, although a market-driven approach to providing a sustainable future for Scottish livestock production is the ultimate goal, continued support for agriculture throughout Europe is vital for the foreseeable future. The way in which that support is provided beyond 2013 must reflect Scotland's unique difficulties, given that most of our land is classified as LFA and given our peripherality in European terms. We very much welcome Brian Pack's interim report, with its realistic and complex analysis of the issues that Scottish agriculture faces, and we look forward to seeing the final report in the early summer.

Parliament's agreement to letting the bill proceed is of importance not only to the fund's trustees but to the greater number of people who would be assisted more meaningfully by the changes that are proposed.</p><p>As David Stewart said, scrutiny of the bill has been an interesting process for the committee, not least because of the background to it and the history of Isabella Elder, who was the architect of the fund.</p><p>As Shirley-Anne Somerville said, Isabella Elder was an impressive lady and had many ideas that would not be out of place today. For example, she started classes that taught people how to provide the best nutrition on a limited income&#8212;a common advertising theme for some of our supermarkets and something that could well be replicated for the many people today who live on convenience foods because they do not know how to cook.</p><p>Isabella Elder's contribution to society becomes even more remarkable when we consider the world of 1905&#8212;the year in which she died, aged 77&#8212;and the place of women in it. That year, Eleanor Roosevelt married Franklin D Roosevelt. History records her work in the ensuing years to enhance the status of women and her work as a volunteer in the slums of New York. Isabella Elder <place-holder colnum=\"23645\"/> had, before that, been doing similar work in Govan in Glasgow for many years, to the benefit of many underprivileged and impoverished women in that area. She was, indeed, a pioneer in many ways.</p><p>I will quote something that Eleanor Roosevelt said and with which I am sure Isabella Elder would have agreed. She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"One thing life has taught me: if you are interested, you never have to look for new interests. They come to you. When you are genuinely interested in one thing, it will always lead to something else.\"</p><p>How true that is.</p><p>Isabella Elder's school for cooking and domestic economy led to lectures for women on clothing cleanliness and how to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and then to the provision of a district nurse to give instruction to her classes. Again, that is work that would not go amiss today.</p><p>She took a particular interest in promoting opportunities for women in higher education and she set up a medical school for women at a time when women were rarely educated to such a level. When women were finally admitted to universities, the first students from her school were able to graduate. She bore the whole expense of building and furnishing a cottage hospital in Govan and the subsequent running costs: largesse, indeed.</p><p>Elder park in Govan was provided by Isabella Elder when she bought land opposite her late husband's shipyard. She designated the park as a recreational space for local people.</p><p>A great deal of that good lady's work was directed towards the further education of women and to improving the health and wellbeing of the people of Glasgow.</p><p>I think that Mrs Elder would have approved of the way in which the trustees of the fund have resolved to carry on her work and legacy by modernising the fund to help as many people as possible. I hope that in the future many deserving women will derive significant benefit from the fund, as Isabella Elder intended when she set it up as a tribute to her brother and her husband.</p><p>I urge Parliament at decision time to agree to the general principles of the bill and to agree that it should proceed as a private bill.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20561437", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ure Elder Fund Transfer and Dissolution Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the other members of the committee for their contributions to the debate.

I believe that much more could be done to expand that area through the development of new ventures or the expansion of existing projects.</p><p>As the briefing from the Scottish social enterprise coalition shows, the issue of supported environments is complex. People who are disadvantaged, for example through disability, will find it very difficult to secure meaningful employment. Supported work environments such as Glencraft and Remploy offer jobs to people who would simply not get a job elsewhere. They also offer a much higher level of meaningful employment than is available to that group of people in the conventional jobs market. People in such work feel safe, benefit from peer group association and receive on-going support&#8212;all critical factors in ensuring social inclusion.</p><p>The campaign to reopen Glencraft through a new venture, Glencraft (Social Enterprise) Ltd, which will provide sustainable employment for the workforce, has been supported by many people in north-east Scotland, and I am pleased that, through joint working, it has been possible to find a positive solution. Specifically, it is important to note the painstaking work that has been done by Aberdeen City Council, Scottish Enterprise and the Aberdeen-based energy firm PSN. I also congratulate the council on its offer to allow the new venture to operate rent free for its first year. I wish all who are involved well in taking Glencraft forward and developing a viable future to sustain employment for as many staff as possible.</p><p>The north-east has many great social enterprise success stories, including Wood Recyclability near Pitmedden, which provides meaningful employment in a workshop environment for 45 adults with learning difficulties and minor physical disabilities, and the Bread Maker in Aberdeen, <place-holder colnum=\"23343\"/> which provides work and training for 27 adults with learning disabilities, supported by a staff of 13 people and a group of volunteers who give their time freely. I may say that the products of both enterprises give excellent value to their appreciative customers, as have the products made by Glencraft over many years.</p><p>The motion refers specifically to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"greater awareness and use of Article 19 of the EU public procurement directive, which allows public sector contracts to be reserved for workplaces where more than 50% of the workforce is disabled\".</p><p>I believe that that can be used to help to develop additional opportunities, and I hope that all public sector organisations, including the national health service, the Scottish Prison Service, local authorities, police forces and the Parliament, will investigate the opportunity to actively support such contracts while satisfying the criteria for best value, which is, of course, vital.</p><p>The recession has shown how vulnerable many businesses are&#8212;especially those that have a charitable or social enterprise element. In the recession, many have experienced a decrease in or loss of funding. The coming financial period will be difficult for many businesses, voluntary organisations and social enterprises. I hope that a sustainable Glencraft venture can be developed to employ as many former employees as possible.</p><p>I congratulate all those who are involved throughout Scotland in supporting the work of supported workplaces.

Around 4,000 children and young people are diagnosed with it each year in the United Kingdom. They face many issues that are akin to those that are faced by their peers who have other complex health needs, and they and their families need co-ordinated community-based care and support to help them to navigate health and social care services, and to keep up their education. They also need help with their emotional needs, financial support and clinical support at home, particularly towards the end of their lives. Survivors need help to live with and beyond their cancer. Those who survive into adult life may be problem free, but others may experience late effects either of their initial illness or of the treatment that they received for it. The late effects of childhood cancer will be discussed next Wednesday in the cross-party group on <place-holder colnum=\"23084\"/> cancer, of which I am a co-convener. I encourage any interested colleagues to come along to that meeting.</p><p>CLIC Sargent Cancer Care for Children is the United Kingdom's leading children's cancer charity. It provides care and support services to children, young people and their families throughout the UK. We should acknowledge its excellent work and pay heed to its recommendations for improving the cancer journey of all of those who are affected. Last February, CLIC Sargent published a report entitled, \"More Than My Illness\", which dealt with the needs of children with cancer. Soon, it will issue a report on how to support sufferers in the 16 to 24 age bracket. The recommendations in the report followed a survey that showed that 97 per cent of children and young people who have cancer feel that it is important to be able to return home during their treatment. It also showed that many parents fell that they are not getting the support that they need when their child is at home.</p><p>Children and young people clearly feel that living with cancer is about more than the illness itself. They want to live their lives as normally as possible, which means that they need to keep in touch with their friends and keep up with their school work. They need help to enable them to cope with normal life, wherever they live, whether that is in cities that are close to specialist treatment centres or in remote and rural parts of the country.</p><p>CLIC Sargent's research found that there is inequity of provision across the country&#8212;something that often comes up when we discuss health issues in the chamber. It identified a lack of children's nurses and social workers, which means that parents are not getting the level of support that they feel they need when their child is at home. That results in children spending more time in hospital, staying there longer before they go home, and ending up back in hospital for minor treatment that could easily take place in the community.</p><p>CLIC Sargent recommends a more co-ordinated approach in order to address the gaps in care provision. If safe and effective care is to be given as close to home as possible, each patient should have a key worker to co-ordinate care across all clinical and non-clinical services, who would act as the main family contact with health, social care, education and other services. That person should be a trained children's cancer nurse.</p><p>Each child's care needs should be carefully assessed, and a care plan should be put in place that should, as a minimum, take account of clinical, educational, social, emotional and financial needs. The services that are identified in the proposed care packages should then be <place-holder colnum=\"23085\"/> delivered by health, education and social care professionals working together&#8212;and with the family&#8212;as a fully integrated multidisciplinary team.</p><p>That holistic approach to caring for a child with cancer is the ideal, but it is not easy to achieve. However, progress is being made in Scotland, particularly in helping children and young people with their education. Paediatric outreach oncology nurses&#8212;POONs, for short&#8212;are now working in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. They are liaising with schools and are working on the development of individual education plans and continuing support plans for their young patients. They are visiting their schools at the start and at the end of treatment and are addressing issues as they crop up.</p><p>In the Grampian NHS Board area, a CLIC Sargent nurse who is based in the Royal Aberdeen children's hospital supports young patients in the northern isles as well as those in the less distant parts of the area. I have no doubt that other members will talk about the contribution of such specialist nurses in other parts of Scotland. I asked for some detail about what the Grampian nurse's work entails in practical terms and was given the example of a toddler from the islands who has been diagnosed with leukaemia, which is one of the more common forms of childhood cancer. From the time of the patient's impending discharge from hospital, with a Hickman line in place for the administration of chemotherapy, the nurse was involved in the detailed planning and co-ordination that is required to formulate a care plan for a youngster who is in the acute stages of cancer, at home on an island. Highly specialist education was required for the family and for a wide range of the local health care professionals, who had little experience of dealing with such a case.</p><p>Also included in the nurse's responsibilities were weekly blood counts and reporting the results to Aberdeen for titration of the chemotherapy dosing; arranging the supply and administration of monthly chemotherapy injections; arranging flights for follow-up visits to Aberdeen; maintaining regular contact with the family and advising and counselling them; overviewing clinical change and progress; interpreting blood results; and, on completion of the primary treatment, arranging monthly general practitioner follow-up visits and three-monthly specialist follow-up visits in Aberdeen. Obviously, a great deal of highly skilled and specialist work was involved to ensure that that child and his family from a remote community got the same high-quality care and treatment that they would get if they lived on the mainland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20514646", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Childhood Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that the motion that we are debating has received a great deal of cross-party support, because it is important that we get to grips with the issues that surround childhood cancer.

I was a member of the Health Committee when Colin Fox of the Scottish Socialist Party introduced his proposals for free prescriptions, and I listened carefully to the evidence that was given to us by various interested parties and experts. Given the inequity of the existing criteria for exemption from prescription charges and the difficulties of producing a fairer list of exempt categories, there is a superficial appeal in making prescriptions free for everyone. However, there were and are good counterarguments, not least of which is the significant amount of revenue that would be lost to the Government if that happened, which is currently estimated at around &#163;33 million per year. That money could be better spent, particularly in financially straitened times, in other health care <place-holder colnum=\"22956\"/> areas, hence our decision to oppose any further reduction in charges.</p><p>I remember having informal discussions with Lewis Macdonald, when he was Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care, about encouraging more people on multiple and chronic drug treatment to reduce their prescription costs by taking up prepayment certificates and about making shorter-term certificates available to those who could not afford to pay for a whole year up front. The Lib-Lab Executive was very much opposed to free prescriptions at that time, and Andy Kerr, as Minister for Health and Community Care, was outspoken in his opposition to a proposal that he saw as being</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unfair on the NHS and unfair on the patients\"</p><p>and as something that would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"rob the poor and the unwell to give to the rich.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2006-01-25.22662.3\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 25 January 2006; c 22648.]</citation></p><p>But that was in 2006.

Those non-exempt people who have prepayment certificates now pay just &#163;38 per year, which is less than half of what they used to pay. Less than 75p per week is surely a price worth paying for good health, and the resultant income could be put to much better use elsewhere, in the interests of patients.

The visiting committee fears that moving the prison to a site that is some 35 miles from Aberdeen and accessible only by car or an infrequent bus service will result in less family contact for many prisoners, whose relatives&#8212;particularly those with young children&#8212;will find the journey tedious, difficult and expensive.</p><p>The petitioners' concerns were clearly understood by Andrew McLellan who, just before he stood down as Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons for Scotland last summer, stressed the importance of family contact to the rehabilitation process and expressed his fear that forcing visitors to embark on a 70-mile round-trip to a new superjail in Peterhead would have a detrimental impact.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee has discussed the petition at length since it was lodged in May 2008 and has taken evidence from a number of sources, including the cabinet secretary. To my mind, there is little doubt that, in an ideal world, a prison facility would be retained in Aberdeen.</p><p>What is proposed is a compromise that is based on financial expediency. Of course, money is very tight and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Craiginches prison, built in the Victorian era, is overcrowded and unfit for modern purpose, and it would be expensive to upgrade it. It is on a site that is likely to be of significant interest to developers, so it could be a potential nest egg for a cash-strapped Government. Land is, of course, expensive in Aberdeen, which makes a new build there less attractive in financially hard times, whereas there is ample ground in Peterhead for rebuilding alongside the existing prison, which is already in the ownership of the Scottish Prison Service.</p><p>It is therefore hardly surprising that the decision was made to site the new prison in Peterhead. However, it is disingenuous to claim that HMP Grampian will be a community-facing prison for Aberdeen. Certainly, female prisoners from the Aberdeen area who are currently housed in Cornton Vale and young offenders in Glenochil or Polmont will be nearer to their relatives than at present, but, with Craiginches prisoners significantly further from their relatives, few HMP Grampian inmates will be ideally placed to have regular family contact, given the public transport provision between Aberdeen and Peterhead.</p><p>While I do, of course, acknowledge the financial pressures on Government, it seems to me a <place-holder colnum=\"22682\"/> retrograde step for rehabilitation to remove an existing facility from one of Scotland's major cities and replace it with a large institution some 35 miles away. I therefore hope that the cabinet secretary will consider very carefully the results of modern academic research and the concerns that Andrew McLellan and others have expressed. If, after due consideration of all that, he decides to press ahead with his current plans, I hope that he will be honest enough to state clearly and openly that that is far from an ideal solution for the prison population in Scotland, but rather a compromise that is based purely on financial constraints&#8212;and, indeed, that it is a regressive rather than a progressive step towards successful prisoner rehabilitation, and should be seen as such.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495405", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Prisons"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The petition that we are discussing has arisen out of the real and on-going concern of the Aberdeen prison visiting committee, backed by the Association of Visiting Committees for Scottish Penal Establishments, that the Government's proposals to replace Craiginches prison with a new, large, so-called community-facing prison within the grounds of HMP Peterhead will have an adverse impact on...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80364", "house": "4", "member_id": "80364", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "20495405", "hpos": "79", "gid": "2010-01-13.22680.2", "epobject_id": "20495416", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2010-01-13.22675.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g22680.2", "minor": "0", "htime": "16:18:00", "speaker_id": "80364"}, {"body": "<p>I, too, am delighted with the announcement about the road, having been involved in trying to get it for more than 20 years.

It provides exercise in the open air, which we can take at our own pace, so it is suitable for all ages. It helps to relieve stress, and is of proven benefit to mental health and wellbeing. Not only does locally produced food contribute to healthy eating, helping to combat the risks of obesity and the sedentary lifestyles of many people today, it tastes better and, as Jim Tolson said, helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Cultivated land is beneficial to the environment aesthetically and it also helps in attracting wildlife.</p><p>The Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society has done a great deal to support allotment holders and community gardens in Scotland, and there are already many initiatives that encourage local food-growing projects. We heard about a number of them in a recent debate on the central Scotland green network, and I have encountered good work in Aberdeenshire, such as the horizon project in Stonehaven, which has taken on responsibility for the floral displays in the town, which the council can no longer afford to pay for. There is also a community council initiative in Kincardine O'Neil, near Aboyne, which has produced beautiful floral displays in the summer and is now extending its efforts into spring flowers as well. Further, many local schools in my area have their own vegetable gardens.</p><p>There must be many pockets of land in public ownership&#8212;land owned by councils, health boards or Network Rail, for example&#8212;that could be allocated for use as allotments or community green space.

It appears that there is a need for clarification of that legislation. According to my constituent, councils throughout Scotland appear to be ignorant of the provisions of the 1892 act. I ask the minister to undertake to have her officials examine that legislation to ascertain whether it is fit for purpose in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, or whether it needs tweaking to bring it up to date. My constituent could give some input on the current interpretation of the law, as illustrated by his recent experiences in Aberdeen.

I hope that the debate will send out a signal to all those who are participating in the Copenhagen meeting that the Scottish Parliament takes seriously its commitment to the stringent targets that we set when we voted unanimously earlier this year to support the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. That groundbreaking legislation should ensure that we set an example for others to follow in meeting the unprecedented environmental challenge that nations around the globe currently face.</p><p>Despite the recent severe flooding episodes that have afflicted people in the north of England, the Borders and parts of north-east Scotland, which were terrible for them, our problems are as nothing compared to the devastation that people in some of the poorest and most heavily populated parts of the world will face unless early action is taken to achieve a significant reduction in the volume of greenhouse gases that are emitted from our terrestrial activities.</p><p>Of course, there have always been cyclical variations in climate, but I have seen enough in recent years to convince me that there is more going on than that. The increase in the melting of the Arctic ice cap in 2008, which was sufficient to clear the north-west and north-east shipping passages north of Canada and Siberia of ice for the first time in probably thousands of years; the loss of glacier snow in the French Alps, which requires artificial snow to secure the ski season; the extended growing season in our gardens; and the early mating of birds&#8212;to name but a few examples&#8212;all convince me that global warming is real and that urgent action must be taken if world temperature rises are to be kept below the critical 2&#176;C, above which there are likely to be very serious consequences of flooding or drought for vulnerable countries.</p><p>The consequences of unmitigated climate change pose a long-term threat to political stability and economic growth. In a recent speech, William Hague MP, the shadow Foreign Secretary, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in areas dogged by conflict, instability, terrorism, poverty and scarcity, global warming has the ability to act as a 'threat multiplier'. Disagreements between countries could increase as tensions rise and existing problems are exposed.\"</p><p>He went on to say that the 2,500 mile-long \"security barrier\" that has been constructed by India along its border with Bangladesh to reduce existing high levels of migration would be put <place-holder colnum=\"22145\"/> under enormous strain by the potential increase in migrant numbers were the sea level to rise by just 1m, which would permanently flood a fifth of Bangladesh and endanger the lives of some 30 million people. That is just one example&#8212;there are many more in other parts of the world where global warming is a serious political threat, as well as a physical threat, to the people who live there.</p><p>There is a growing international acceptance that action needs to be taken urgently to tackle climate change: that the developed world has to be serious about cutting its emissions of greenhouse gases and that it must support developing countries to allow them to undertake the significant action that is required if they are to do likewise.</p><p>Of course, Scotland's contribution to global emissions is relatively small, but given that it is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, it is right that we take some responsibility for climate change. We have the proven ability to show leadership in the fight back against it, and our commitment to the stiff targets that were set in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 show that we as a country are serious about that. We must strive to ensure that the targets are met if we are to do our fair share in fighting climate change.</p><p>As others have said, to be successful we must all work together as countries, Governments, businesses and individuals. We must all do our bit. It is heartening that at individual level more and more people are looking at their lifestyles: they are seeking to reduce their energy consumption, improve insulation of their homes, reduce the amount of waste that they send to landfill and generally be aware of the importance of reducing our carbon footprints.</p><p>However, Governments have to take the lead and I am encouraged by my party's statement at UK level.

In agreement with the motion that we are debating today, we look to the participants in the Copenhagen talks to be ambitious in their efforts to fight global warming and to reach a political agreement that will, at the earliest possible opportunity, lead to a legally binding commitment to keep the rise in world temperatures at or below 2&#176;C.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449504", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be taking part in this debate on climate change.

Indeed, some strains exist in healthy people as part of their normal gut bacterial flora, as Ian McKee pointed out. My husband tells me that when he was in general practice, it was not uncommon to get a report indicating the presence of C diff in a specimen, and the bacteriological advice was usually that no treatment was required.</p><p>However, when infection occurs, causing symptoms such as diarrhoea, C diff spores can survive in the environment for many months. Infection, particularly in older and frail people can, as we know only too well, be fatal, or can result in serious complications or many months of morbidity or hospitalisation. The problem therefore has to be tackled from several different aspects, as the Government and health boards have been doing in recent months, with some success, although more remains to be done.</p><p>Much of the ground has already been covered in previous speeches, so I will speak about just three issues, two of which have already been mentioned.</p><p>The first is antibiotic prescribing, because that has probably been one of the main causes of our present problems with antimicrobial resistance. GPs are still under severe pressure from patients who want an instant cure for their symptoms. They resent having their lives disrupted by minor ailments, and they see antibiotics as the instant cure for everything, even though the viruses that afflict us all from time to time are impervious to them. The prescribing of such drugs for illnesses that are usually self-limiting has undoubtedly resulted in the development of resistant strains of bacteria, but still the pressure is on GPs to prescribe them. A tough, on-going education regime is needed to make people understand that antibiotics are not a panacea, and GPs have to be strongly discouraged from indiscriminately prescribing them.</p><p>Secondly, cleanliness, both personal and in the community, our hospitals and other health care settings, is an essential part of tackling HAIs, and on-going education campaigns to encourage regular hand washing are of major importance in containing the spread of organisms such as C diff. Rigorous enforcement of hand washing before visitors and staff make contact with patients can make a huge difference, and I welcome the role that has been given to senior clinical nurses in overseeing that on wards.<place-holder colnum=\"21339\"/></p><p>Thorough cleaning of clinical areas is also essential, and the highest standards are expected. Frankly, I do not care whether that is done in-house or by outside contractors. The end result must be scrupulous cleanliness, and it can be achieved by any provider if it is properly supervised. If that is not happening, it should be.</p><p>The interesting fact that hospitals that are cleaned by outside staff actually appear to have a somewhat better record on C diff infection puts the lie to the dogma that only in-house cleaning is effective. The service for patients is what is important, not the provider of that service, and that is where I part company with those who believe that private provision is automatically bad for NHS patients.</p><p>Finally, and importantly, I want to consider those who are in the front line of health care provision in our NHS hospitals, particularly the nursing staff, who have a huge role to play in infection control, and who, by and large, do a fantastic job for their patients. As Ross Finnie said in his speech, when the Royal College of Nursing focuses its briefing for the debate on its concern about the plethora of strategies for controlling HAIs that are being pushed at nursing staff, to the extent that staff are becoming stressed and confused, the Government must sit up, take notice and do something about it.</p><p>Undoubtedly the HAI task force delivery plan, the national action plan arising from the Vale of Leven C diff outbreak, and the health care environment inspectorate that was set up earlier this year are important initiatives, but when a further nine or 10 strategies and standards are thrust at front-line staff as they face the challenges of seriously ill patients, something has to give.</p><p>The NHS QIS report that was published earlier this year after it visited three health boards that experienced C diff outbreaks clearly indicates the need for a fresh look at how front-line interventions in the management of HAIs are coordinated. It found</p><p class=\"indent\">\"widespread lack of clarity at all levels\"</p><p>within health boards, due to the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"perceived large volume and complexity\"</p><p>of the national, specific and general guidelines, tools and documents on managing HAIs.</p><p>I conclude by urging the cabinet secretary to take heed of that report, and to examine how things can be simplified for those who are in charge of patient care. Perhaps one advisory body to set the standards and one other to monitor their implementation would clarify the situation for health care practitioners, and would lead to better infection control.<place-holder colnum=\"21340\"/></p><p>Like others, I look forward to the outcome of the public inquiry into the Vale of Leven C diff outbreak, but in the meantime we should do everything possible to support our hard-working front-line staff in their on-going battle to protect patients from the HAIs that can all too easily endanger their lives.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20389460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clostridium Difficile"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the RCN reminded us in its briefing for the debate, health care acquired infections are not new, be they MRSA, Clostridium difficile or anything else, but they have become a serious problem within our hospitals for two main reasons.

I am attracted to Sarah Boyack's suggestion to give the opportunity to do constructive work to unemployed young people in such areas and to engage them practically in creating a better future for themselves and their fellow citizens.</p><p>I have a bee in my bonnet about allotment gardening, which I see as having a significant contribution to make to a green network. To quote the allotments regeneration initiative, they provide</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a sustainable source of healthy local food, as well as exercise and education for local communities, and an important biodiversity habitat for native flora and fauna. They provide green lungs in built-up areas and access to publicly owned land.\"</p><p>Currently, there are over 200 allotment sites throughout Scotland, around 70 per cent of which are owned by local authorities. They equate to 6,300 plots in all, which falls well short of satisfying demand for them. The waiting list throughout Scotland is about 3,000, with 600 people in Glasgow and 1,000 people in Edinburgh waiting to become plot holders. I would like to see those waiting lists disappear and I am pleased that the minister is committed to doing something about that, as she told me in response to a recent question. There is a good opportunity for the green network to bring together local authorities, health boards and other landowners to examine the potential for developing allotments in their areas, which would greatly benefit their communities.</p><p>I grew up on vegetables that were grown on my father's plot and I would like to see many more people benefiting from the fresh produce that I learned to grow and like as a child and the knowledge that I gained about nature and the joys of gardening, which have stayed with me throughout my life.

It is now important that lessons are learned from their early days and development so that we can ensure value for money for the increasingly pressurised public purse ahead of the designation of any further national parks that may be considered.</p><p>Legislation requires national park authorities to conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area that they represent, while promoting the sustainable use of their natural resources and recognising the needs of local <place-holder colnum=\"20809\"/> communities within the designated areas, as many members have stressed this afternoon.</p><p>Seven years after the establishment of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park, and after six years of the Cairngorms park, it is appropriate to examine what the parks have achieved so far and to consider their future development and management, hence our support for the proposed national parks strategy group that is to be chaired by the Minister for Environment. However, we feel strongly that that group must be time limited and focused and must have a clear sense of what it is trying to achieve. A key consideration for the setting up of such a group has been the broader agenda for simplification of the public sector, and it is therefore important that the group does not develop a separate administrative identity or budget or employ additional staff.</p><p>We are content with the Government's decision that the strategy group should have a fixed term of no more than 18 months, and that it should operate at a strategic, rather than an operational, level, with a remit to focus on establishing the principles that are involved in considering boundary changes to existing national parks and the establishment of new ones.</p><p>Of the two existing national parks, I am more familiar with the Cairngorms park, whose current plan focuses on outdoor access, sustainable deer management, biodiversity, sustainable housing, awareness and understanding, tourism and business and sport and management. I am told that, so far, halfway through its five-year span, 29 of the plan's 41 outcomes have been met. Some progress has been made on developing the necessary affordable housing within the park area, which Peter Peacock and Mike Rumbles mentioned, although that has been difficult in the current financial climate. There has been a significant focus on a land-use strategy and on creating a low-carbon national park, with clear renewable energy targets, as well as on moorland management, local food production and promotion of the excellent and varied food and drink product that is available throughout the park. Further, the Cairngorms business partnership has been set up to assist businesses&#8212;most of them SMEs&#8212;within the park. As the minister said in her opening remarks and Jamie McGrigor highlighted in his speech, business training has been provided to a significant number of people.</p><p>A great deal of work has gone on in the past six years to achieve the aims of the Cairngorms national park, and I have no doubt that that is also true for the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs park. However, we are all aware of Professor Neil Kay's highly critical report regarding the organisational structure of the existing national parks, and there <place-holder colnum=\"20810\"/> is little disagreement that it is overly bureaucratic and would benefit from being streamlined. We therefore welcome the Government's proposals to keep the existing park authorities, but to reduce their size. We feel that local involvement in management is essential, and the proposals will allow that, but they will also help to ensure better value for money and, hopefully, better delivery.</p><p>Some people, including my colleague John Scott, think that the park authorities would benefit from being made smaller still than the 17 and 19 members that the Government proposes to reduce them to. Personally, however, I am pleased that the proposals will allow directly elected board membership to increase proportionately as the number of Government and local authority appointees decreases.

In April of this year I was pleased that the transport minister agreed to my request for a meeting with interested parties, including Graham McDonald and Kenny Thomson from Kintore and district <place-holder colnum=\"20357\"/> community council, as well as my North East Scotland region colleagues&#8212;cross-party colleagues&#8212;whose responsibilities, like mine, include Kintore and the neighbouring communities.</p><p>The reopening of Laurencekirk station has undoubtedly been a major success. It has been warmly welcomed and supported, and the number of passengers using the station has exceeded the provisional estimates by around 80 per cent, as the motion states. That is good news and I believe that it makes a positive case for the reopening of Kintore station and, eventually, other local stations.</p><p>Given the inevitability of future housing developments across Aberdeenshire, reopening the station and improving the transport infrastructure for communities north of Aberdeen city is becoming increasingly important. I hope that the reopening of Laurencekirk station has acted as a catalyst to promote the case for including Kintore as a stopping place on the Aberdeen to Inverness line.</p><p>I have said in previous debates on the issue that Kintore must surely be one of the fastest growing villages in the country. In only five years its population has grown from just over 1,600 to more than 2,500, completely changing its character from a traditional north-east village to an urban satellite of Aberdeen, with tightly packed streets of modern houses clustered around its historic village centre. That has had a significant impact on the back road to Newhills, on the Haudagain roundabout and on Anderson Drive, where peak-time traffic is noticeably heavier.</p><p>Think of the advantages to the environment if even half of the cars from Kintore were to stay at home while their owners commuted by train. That method of travel is increasingly favoured by residents in Inverurie and Dyce and many people in Kintore would also like to have local access to the rail network.</p><p>Recent developments that allow hourly services to operate between Aberdeen and Inverness are an important step forward and I hope that Kintore will be developed as a stopping point for some of those services. I realise that the single track at Kintore is a problem, but it is one that can in due course be overcome if the political will is there to open the station. From the minister's response at our meeting I think that he is supportive of that in principle.</p><p>It is a little premature to ask for funding to be allocated to the project&#8212;rightly or wrongly, I took Mr Rumbles's motion to be asking for that&#8212;given that it has not yet been costed and that we do not have the results of the study into the feasibility of the station's reopening.

Everyone concerned in its production is to be commended for looking into an issue that we all agree is extremely important for the long-term sustainability of rural communities across Scotland. Clearly, there is not time in a short speech to deal in detail with all the report's aspects, but I will try to respond to a number of the key issues that the committee explored.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives believe that there is, indeed, a fundamental lack of affordable rural houses. We agree with the committee that current planning procedures are often outdated and conservative and that they hamper new developments in rural Scotland. Those of us who represent rural areas, wherever they are, will all have anecdotal examples of the difficulties faced by constituents who cannot find a house locally within their means or fail to get planning permission in the countryside, even for a retiral home for a farmer, because it is considered to be sporadic development and therefore not allowable.</p><p>Aberdeenshire Council, for instance, has had a policy for years of insisting that new rural housing must be attached to an existing settlement, unless there is a proven need for a rural worker to be resident on a farm. That policy has made it well-nigh impossible for intending retirees to build on their farmland and has led to farmers putting off their retirement or facing great difficulty in handing on their farm because there is no accommodation for their successor. It has also inhibited the development of new rural businesses. Moreover, where properties have fallen into disrepair or are derelict, strict planning rules often insist that the replacement must occupy exactly the same footprint as the original building, which may result in extra costs to the householder and a less than satisfactory building for modern-day living.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives agree with the report's call for a cultural change in local authorities to end the overcautious approach to planning, which is hindering rural development. As we said in our 2007 manifesto, we would like a relaxation of planning guidelines to allow housing development in rural locations, thus helping to service the accommodation needs of retiring farmers and allowing much-needed new businesses to set up <place-holder colnum=\"20308\"/> in the countryside, which will attract tourists and other contributors to the local economy in more remote and rural communities.</p><p>Housing design is an issue in rural Scotland, particularly in the more exposed parts of the country. We would like to encourage the building of well-insulated, energy-efficient housing in rural areas that would bring long-term economic and environmental benefits. As the committee noted, the Government's climate change agenda and the implementation of current climate change legislation provide an opportunity to make progress in this area. My party would certainly like more to be done to promote energy efficiency in Scotland, which is why we were pleased to have accepted our amendments to the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill, which will enable green council tax and business rate discounts and ultimately benefit many householders in Scotland, not least in rural areas.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20206413", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have enjoyed ownership for the past 24 years of a modest second home in a rural Aberdeenshire settlement, but my house has not been in demand as a full-time residence within living memory.

We have concerns about overzealous standards and specifications in rural areas regarding roads and related infrastructure, and about connections to the energy supply and to mains water and sewerage, although we acknowledge that the latter is now less of a problem than it was just a few years ago. We agree with the committee that imposing urban specifications in a rural context without considering whether that is necessary is, in fact, bad planning. We believe that common sense should be used in planning for rural development.</p><p>We share the committee's concerns about the current lack of planning professionals in councils throughout Scotland. We support moves to attract and retain experienced planners at local authority level. Without them, it will be very difficult to tackle the problems of sustainable rural development.</p><p>Finally, and importantly, we agree that the private rented sector could make a much greater contribution, through either restoration or new build, to address the current lack of affordable rural housing. I know that a number of Aberdeenshire landowners are keen&#8212;indeed, some have already started&#8212;to make more <place-holder colnum=\"20309\"/> properties available for rent to local people. If their role is to be fully exploited, they will need help to overcome some of the practical and financial difficulties that stand in their way.</p><p>I was therefore encouraged to read this week that the Cairngorms National Park Authority is actively considering ways to increase the supply of affordable private rented housing in its area. We believe that public sector bodies should be encouraged to consider the appropriateness of their land for affordable housing development, as exemplified by the Forestry Commission's national forest land scheme initiative. Where council land is redundant, it should be used. If the most pressing need is for affordable rural housing, such developments should be considered as an appropriate use for that land.</p><p>To summarise, the Scottish Conservatives believe that there is a lack of affordable rural housing in Scotland. We believe that planning procedures need to become more flexible and responsive to local needs and that it is right to champion the development of sustainable, well-insulated and energy-efficient housing stock. We wish full engagement with the private and public rented sectors in rural areas.

Although the petition sought payment for donors, it became obvious during our discussion that the main intention of the pupils was to raise awareness of the need for donors and of how to go about giving blood. One suggestion was for Scotland to reduce the minimum age for giving blood from 17 to 16, as it is in Northern Ireland. That could sensibly be considered. Physically, there is generally little difference between a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old, and I can think of no real drawback to <place-holder colnum=\"20061\"/> reducing the qualifying age by a year. A further suggestion from Andrew Danet, of holding donor sessions in high schools, might get donors into the habit of giving blood before they leave school, and could result in a long-term commitment to blood donation.</p><p>Countries such as France and Belgium were cited as having higher-profile awareness campaigns than we do, with widespread posters and numerous television advertisements. In France, there is apparently a very effective e-mail and text alerting system, which lets people know that they can give blood at a particular place on a particular date at a particular time. There are also opportunities to donate in offices, shopping centres and schools. The SNBTS might already be considering such ideas, but if it is not doing so, I suggest that they are worthy of consideration.</p><p>I commend the pupils of Alness academy for studying practice in countries in which donation rates are higher than rates in Scotland. I cannot support proposals for financial or similar inducements to give blood, but a number of other avenues are worth exploring in the effort to increase blood donation and I hope that some of our petitioners' suggestions will be followed up.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20197636", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Blood Donation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept what Rhoda Grant says, but we clearly see the issue from a different point of view.

However, before I do that, I thank and compliment the committee clerks and our support services for the enormous effort that they put into arranging and preparing for the committee's successful visits to Berwickshire high school in Duns, Easterhouse and Fraserburgh academy in Aberdeenshire as part of our inquiry; and to Alness academy this week, where we received a real Highland welcome&#8212;piper and all&#8212;as we started to deliver our resultant plan to hold committee meetings in all regions of Scotland.</p><p>I was unable to attend the Easterhouse meeting but, by all accounts and to judge from the <em>Official Report</em>, it was an extremely well-attended and lively event. The school meetings were, without exception, extremely successful in engaging with the young students who attended them and took part in the committee's work by presenting their own petitions to us.</p><p>Two things struck me forcibly about those external meetings: first, before our visit was announced, few of our attendees knew anything about the Parliament's petitions process; secondly, our visits were popular and very much appreciated by those who attended. Furthermore, once people understood how our petitions system worked, they thought that it was excellent and wanted to engage with it.</p><p>At each of the three schools that we visited, pupils presented two petitions to the committee, all on significant and interesting topics. In Duns, we heard about local shortcomings in funding for enterprise education and the inadequacy of rural bus services. In Fraserburgh, we heard a very well-researched petition that urged the Prime Minister, as leader of the G20 summit, to take urgent action on African poverty and debt, as well as one that highlighted some problems with NHS services in rural Aberdeenshire. In Alness, there was a very timely petition urging action to increase the number of blood donors in Scotland&#8212;timely because there is a members' business debate on the topic tomorrow afternoon, during which I hope to bring the petition to the attention of the Minister <place-holder colnum=\"19849\"/> for Public Health and Sport. That petition was followed by a well-presented case for equity in funding for educational school visits. All were excellent petitions, which would probably never have come to us if we had not made the effort to visit the schools.</p><p>As well as hearing those petitions and considering others that we had previously discussed, the committee had a good question-and-answer session with not only the pupils but other members of the communities who turned up at the meetings in each school. As an aside, those of us who met the colourful character Mr Tupy the previous evening were slightly disappointed that he did not make an appearance at the Alness meeting.</p><p>We had good feedback from our external meetings. As Bruce Crawford indicated, they resulted in significant media coverage. The people whom we met in the communities we visited were very appreciative of the fact that the committee had reached out to them. I have no doubt that they will continue to take an interest in and engage with the Parliament and the petitions process.</p><p>That said, there are many communities across the country that we are unable to visit. The challenge is to reach out to people in those communities and raise awareness of what we do. When people get to know about the public petitions process, they become very positive about it. They see it as a worthwhile engagement route into the Parliament. Indeed, people come forward with ideas on how to make what we do more relevant to them.</p><p>As a result of our inquiry, we committed to holding further external meetings, the first of which was held this week in Alness. If possible, three further meetings are planned for next year in locations where no parliamentary committee has visited. We want to encourage two-way dialogue with the people who come to our meetings. Where possible, we intend to involve the Parliament's education and community partnerships team in facilitating that activity. Alongside our external meetings, we intend to make presentations to explain the committee's work. Local schoolchildren and disability, community and equality groups will be encouraged to attend and take part in those sessions. We tried out that approach in Alness with primary school children and it will be evaluated and developed for future use.</p><p>In response to a suggestion from a pupil in Fraserburgh, we are looking into the possibility of running a young people's petitions meeting, at which it is suggested that we will discuss only petitions from young people. If the meeting succeeds, we will consider holding similar meetings that focus on petitions from disability groups, equalities organisations and the like.<place-holder colnum=\"19850\"/></p><p>We also heard suggestions for improving the ways in which to bring our existence and work to people's attention. The suggestions included producing better leaflets in more languages and formats, improving our website and using the latest electronic technologies to reach younger people&#8212;technologies that I confess to neither using nor knowing about, but in which other committee members have a particular interest.</p><p>Our inquiry was interesting, enjoyable and revealing. I am pretty sure that the people whom we met and with whom we held discussions are as enthusiastic about our petitions process as we are. Clearly, we want to reach out to and engage as many of Scotland's citizens as possible. As communication methods improve and evolve, I hope that the Parliament's Public Petitions Committee will become known to many more people and become increasingly recognised as a gateway to participation in the on-going and developing work of the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20195663", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Petitions Process Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The report that we are discussing is the culmination of a significant amount of work by the Public Petitions Committee to encourage more people throughout Scotland&#8212;particularly the many young people and others for whom the Parliament may hitherto have seemed remote and inaccessible&#8212;to engage with the work that we do as part of the democratic process.

I was delighted to meet the excellent group of girl guide dancers from Aberdeen, who performed very well outside the Parliament this afternoon.</p><p>As I dug out my girl guide badge in anticipation of the debate, I was somewhat aghast to realise that I first received it more than half a century ago, somewhere around 1954. Memories came flooding back of my excellent guide captain who, unfortunately, could not take us camping because of a health problem; of my pride in the swallow patrol and its leader; of polishing my badge and learning to fold the triangular tie that doubled up as an elbow sling; of the sporting activities that we took part in; and of the badges gained in music, embroidery, first aid, cooking and many other subjects. I well remember the meal of mince and doughballs followed by chocolate pudding that I had to prepare for my cook's badge, and being asked to make more of the pudding, because my first attempt was not quite sweet enough. Even then, I wondered whether the examiner was simply indulging her liking for chocolate pudding.</p><p>I was a very shy 12-year-old when I joined the guides. I had dropped out of the brownies, probably because I was too immature to enjoy their activities. However, within a few years, when I was a patrol leader, I proudly carried the company colours into church and read the lesson at a thinking day service. I was a much more capable, self-confident and responsible member of the guiding family, and was interested in being an active part of my community. However, I was not at all interested in politics at that time; according to \"Girls Shout Out!\", which is a report produced by Girlguiding UK, today's girl guides do not appear to be interested in politics, either. That said, I suspect that my eventual interest, and then involvement, in politics grew from the seed of community responsibility that was sown in me by the girl guide movement.<place-holder colnum=\"19575\"/></p><p>I benefited enormously from my girlguiding experience, as did my daughter, who from brownie to guide developed from a quiet and uncertain little girl into a self-assured and confident young lady. When my daughter and I learned of what today's young guides are doing&#8212;of their charitable efforts, their varied work experience in the voluntary sector, their contribution to supporting young people in poorly developed third world countries, and the exciting activities and challenges that they undertake at home and abroad&#8212;we wished that we were young enough to benefit from the opportunities that are now open to them.</p><p>Girlguiding has not stood still, but has steadily adapted to ensure that it still appeals to young girls in a world that is completely unrecognisable from that of the 1950s, when I joined the guides, and which is moons apart from that of 1910, when the first girl guides took their promise to do their best to seek spiritual development, contribute to society and live by the guide law. The activities have changed, but the principles of girlguiding have not. The 10 million guides in the world today are still taught to live by the same ethical code by which their predecessors were taught to live. Today's guides learn to live healthy lifestyles, to develop skills and relationships and to celebrate diversity, and they develop a global awareness that was far beyond the reach of my generation when we were their age.</p><p>I congratulate all those&#8212;rainbows, brownies, guides and leaders&#8212;who have put a lot of effort into preparing for the celebrations to mark the centenary of girlguiding next year. I hope that everybody concerned will have a wonderful year, and that they will have many happy memories of the activities that lie ahead.

I will focus on one: the corn bunting, which is one of Scotland's fastest-declining birds and a species with special connections to the north-east of Scotland.</p><p>Corn buntings were once abundant throughout the British isles but have declined drastically since the 1970s because of changed cropping and intensive agricultural production methods. They are now a red-listed species in the United Kingdom, extinct in Ireland and classified with unfavourable conservation status due to declines throughout Europe.</p><p>Around 800 to 1,000 territorial males remain in Scotland, but several local extinctions have occurred during the past decade. Eastern Scotland now contains most of the outstanding Scottish population, but even there they have declined rapidly. A recent study shows an 83 per cent decline in singing males on sites in Aberdeenshire and Tayside between 1989 and 2007. A combination of factors&#8212;notably a preference for nesting in growing crops, a late breeding season and a seed diet that centres on grains&#8212;is likely to have made corn bunting populations especially susceptible to modern agricultural practices.</p><p>The staggering 83 per cent decline over the past 20 years was revealed by a study called \"The Decline of Corn Buntings Emberiza calandra<em> </em>on east Scottish study areas in 1989-2007\". It examined 30 sites in Aberdeenshire and Angus and was published in <em>Bird Study</em>, the journal of the British Trust for Ornithology. Dr Adam Watson&#8212;a well-known scientist in Aberdeenshire&#8212;who led the study with RSPB Scotland scientists, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"When I began this study in 1989, I knew that corn buntings were already scarcer than when I saw them as an Aberdeenshire schoolboy in the 1940s, but thought they might hold their own in the strongholds that remained. <place-holder colnum=\"19430\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">Although it has been interesting to follow their numbers on the 30 areas, the huge decline has saddened and worried me. Many areas that held singing birds in the early years are now silent, as one local population after another went extinct. However, all is not yet lost and the government must urgently extend the targeted initiatives which have reversed declines on some farms.\"</p><p>To try to reverse that trend of decline, the RSPB set up an initiative called the farmland bird lifeline. The initiative is supported by Scottish Natural Heritage and with farm planning by the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group Scotland. It has been running since 2001 and involves 37 farms in Inverness-shire, Aberdeenshire, Angus and Fife. Where there has been sufficient winter seed provision, such as winter stubble, and safe nesting habitats, such as hedges at the margins of fields, a positive response has been recorded from the corn buntings: on 23 farms that were involved between 2006 and 2008, there was a 40 per cent increase in singing males at management sites. That shows that it is possible to halt and reverse the decline in one species of songbird and that we must act now to ensure that other songbird species manage to sustain healthy populations.</p><p>Further research is needed into the causes of songbird declines, especially among woodland species and long-distance migrants. It is vital that we raise awareness of the plight of songbird populations and that we work together to ensure that they can thrive in the Scottish countryside in time to come.

A gentleman from the London area gave us a notable account of his experiences. His blood sugar was maintained at stable and near-normal levels, and his quality of life had improved <place-holder colnum=\"19341\"/> enormously since he began to use his insulin pump.</p><p>That was in stark contrast to the frustration of those who could have, but do not yet have, insulin pumps, which was expressed forcibly by members of the insulin pump awareness group. Their pleas were quite moving because it was clear that they or their children were having a hard time controlling their diabetes and that their quality of life was less than ideal.</p><p>It is quite concerning that, across Scotland, an average of just over 1.5 per cent of type 1 diabetic patients currently use pumps, when NICE guidance indicates that up to 14 per cent of patients should be considered as suitable users of pumps. It is also concerning that there is considerable variation in health boards' provision of the service and in waiting times for pump provision.</p><p>I know that health boards are having to look carefully at their budget priorities at a time of increasing financial constraint, but the provision of insulin pumps to appropriate patients is undoubtedly a spend-to-save exercise, as the resultant improved blood sugar control and reduced incidence of complications will inevitably lead to fewer primary care contacts and fewer out-patient and in-patient hospital attendances. As David Stewart told us, according to one published study, that will mean an estimated saving of around &#163;23,500 over two years, which surely represents good value for money.</p><p>Pumps are also popular with patients. It is notable that they are popular with parents of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, who will be confident that their offspring's blood glucose is easier to control effectively, with less risk of severe and incapacitating hypoglycaemic episodes. As Ross Finnie said, the NICE guidance recommends pumps for children under 12 if multiple injections of insulin are reckoned to be inappropriate or impractical.</p><p>This is not a good time to urge health boards to spend extra money. They are looking to tighten their financial belts.

I welcome the SNP Government's acknowledgement that our manifesto commitment to rural schools, which was initiated by Murdo Fraser, merited inclusion in its Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>Proposals for school closure always evoke strong feelings within communities, be they urban or rural. In recent years, we have seen many campaigns in cities such as Aberdeen and Glasgow, as well as rural areas such as Aberdeenshire and Moray, where changes have been proposed to the schools estate. Of course, increasingly cash-strapped councils have to rationalise their estate and it is clear that, if the families of a once-young community have dispersed to the periphery of a city, not all city centre schools might be educationally or financially viable. There may also be circumstances in which a rural school must be closed if the interests of pupils or a community merit it. However, before that happens, there must be genuine, open and honest consultation with the people concerned so that decisions are reached reasonably, rationally and&#8212;one hopes&#8212;with community co-operation. That is why the proposed legislation is important.</p><p>I can understand the argument, which the EIS and others have advanced, that the same criteria should apply to all urban and rural schools. The ramifications of that argument are worthy of further consideration as the committee recommends but, as it stands, I very much agree with the bill's proposals that special consideration should be given to changes that would affect rural schools because such establishments are often the hub of their communities. They are often in areas that no longer have churches, post offices or local shops and, without them, no community activities could take place. In such areas, the closure of the school is tantamount to killing off the community. It is right to regard the closure of a rural school as a measure of last resort, as the cabinet secretary stated in her opening speech.</p><p>As an aside, I point out gently to George Foulkes and others who seem to forget that deprivation is not confined to urban areas. There are significant pockets of rural Scotland in which communities are just as needy.<place-holder colnum=\"19143\"/></p><p>I first became involved with a campaign to save a group of rural schools in central Aberdeenshire when I was a parliamentary candidate before 2003. The director of education at the time genuinely believed that pupils would receive a better education in a large modern school than they were getting in three smaller, old-fashioned, community-based buildings. His proposals incensed local parents and pupils, and a tremendous battle ensued to save the schools on the basis that they were excellent, popular establishments; that they were the hubs of their communities; and that travelling on narrow, rural roads to a new school building would not be in the best interests of pupil safety or wellbeing, particularly in the winter. The battle was won and the schools stayed open, although it was recognised that one of the buildings was really not fit for purpose.</p><p>Only two years later, to the dismay of the communities, another proposal was made to close not three but four of the schools in the area and replace them with a large new building. The reasons for proposed closure were advanced and discussed at a very lively and extremely well-attended public meeting. One of the schools was deemed unfit because it had no disabled access. Imagine the expression on the council officials' faces when they were informed that the school currently had a pupil in a wheelchair and that, only recently, appropriate facilities and access arrangements had been put in place to accommodate that pupil. The meeting collapsed. The closure proposal was later withdrawn and a promise made to build a new school to replace the one that needed upgrading. I am not at all sure that that satisfactory result would have been achieved without extremely vigilant and highly committed parents who were willing to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to save their schools and who researched the consultation proposals thoroughly before the public meeting.</p><p>I have since visited one of the schools as part of the Parliament's education outreach programme and met a happy, confident, very well-informed group of young people. They were welcoming and clearly supportive of one another. They have a dining room, where they receive excellent, healthy meals, and a garden that was made and is maintained by the pupils. They interact with all ages in the community at their regular coffee mornings and social events. When the time comes to move on to secondary school, they find the transition easy and straightforward, by and large. Such an education fully justifies the retention of small rural schools, many of which have the same ethos as the one that I have described.</p><p>I am delighted that those schools in Aberdeenshire were saved from closure, at least for the foreseeable future. However, the closure <place-holder colnum=\"19144\"/> proposals contained significantly inaccurate and outdated information. I have no doubt that members will be aware of similar examples in other parts of the country. I note the concerns about the involvement of HMIE in the consultation process, particularly about the resources needed to comply with the bill's proposals, but I hope that what is proposed in the bill will help to prevent the sort of problem that I have described from happening in the future; it could save many parents and pupils who are faced with the prospect of losing not just adequate but excellent small local schools from a great deal of anguish.</p><p>From my reading of the stage 1 report and from listening to the debate, it is clear to me that there is cross-party agreement on the general principles. However, as highlighted by Liz Smith in her speech and by several other members, there are concerns about a number of areas, which need to be dealt with in the next stages of the parliamentary process. By and large, though, the bill should result in a better-understood, thorough, robust and meaningful consultation process that should benefit communities across Scotland when changes are proposed for the school estate. As Liz Smith indicated, we are happy to support the bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173748", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to take part in the debate in place of my colleague Murdo Fraser, who&#8212;I am sure&#8212;will just now be happily getting to know his new little daughter and bonding with her.

In particular, I pay tribute to the committee's legal and clerking teams, which have put in a power of detailed and painstaking work to bring the proposals for the new procedure to Parliament in a relatively short timescale.<place-holder colnum=\"18890\"/></p><p>Not being of a procedural or legal frame of mind, I must admit that when I first read the committee report, I felt that it could rival watching grass grow or paint dry&#8212;it was very technical. However, it was extremely important to devise a procedure for hybrid bills to deal with any future bills of a public nature that affect private interests. I hope that the procedure that we are discussing today will provide for stable and competent law making in this and future parliamentary sessions.</p><p>The fact that the Scottish Parliament's standing orders do not already contain rules for handling bills that include provisions affecting private interests is perhaps a sign of the relative youth of the Parliament as we commemorate our 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The new procedure that we plan to adopt today will therefore bring our devolved legislature into line with Westminster and the hybrid bills procedure that operates there.</p><p>Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the administration of the hybrid bills procedure will be the make-up of future hybrid bill committees. In the case of a new Forth road crossing bill, which is likely to be the first hybrid bill presented to the Parliament, the 32 members who represent the Lothians and Mid Scotland and Fife regions will most likely not be eligible for appointment as members of the hybrid bill committee. I wonder whether North East members such as me, who regularly cross the Forth en route to and from Edinburgh, will also be deemed to have an interest and therefore be excluded from the committee's membership. As with private bill committees, members of a hybrid bill committee will be expected to attend every meeting of the committee, which could regularly take up a considerable amount of time. That could present difficulties for the Parliamentary Bureau in future in constituting the membership of committees.</p><p>Retrospectively, one wonders how a Scottish Parliament of 129 members would have managed to put together a committee to deal with an M8 motorway construction hybrid bill that covered the Central Scotland, Glasgow, West of Scotland and Lothian regions, effectively excluding 66 members from the committee's membership.</p><p>I hope that the hybrid bills procedure will reassure members of the public about their rights in connection with possible objections to future hybrid bills and about the protocols that will allow objections to be fully and fairly considered.</p><p>It is essential that we have in place a hybrid bills procedure for any future major construction projects that will be required to secure Scotland's national infrastructure and economic development, such as the proposed Forth crossing.

However, although I fully understand the need to have the legislation in place as early as possible, to my mind three weeks was not long enough for stages 2 and 3 of such a complex and far-reaching bill. The flurry of stage 3 amendments at the last minute made the final stages of the parliamentary process considerably more stressful for members and staff than they might have been.</p><p>The stakes are high and the challenges are awesome. If they are to be met, all of us, in every community, institution and business and in our homes, will have to make a determined effort to reduce our individual contributions to atmospheric pollution by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. John Swinney and Brian Adam were right to highlight the need for public engagement in the delivery of the bill's objectives, and I am glad that the Parliament has acknowledged that.</p><p>I am sure that significant efforts will be made in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom to meet the targets that are set for us, but I worry about some of the bigger players in the world whose impact on climate change is on a much bigger scale than ours but whose efforts to offset it are smaller. At least we are setting an example and beginning to move in the right direction.</p><p>Much of the focus in recent days has been on part 1 of the bill and the emissions reduction targets within it. We have been happy all along to support the target to reduce emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 and the recently amended interim target of 42 per cent by 2020. That is an ambitious target but, as Scottish and Southern Energy stated in its stage 3 briefing to us, it demonstrates the leadership to which Scotland rightly aspires. It should deliver greater competitive advantage for investment and economic opportunities in a low-carbon economy, with the jobs that that will create. It should also help Scotland to lead the way in securing the necessary policy actions elsewhere in the UK and the European Union.</p><p>With ambitious targets in place, it is clear that progress towards achieving them must be carefully monitored. We fully support the duties to be placed on ministers to make regular reports to the Parliament. That will give members the opportunity to question them effectively and openly and to hold them to account for meeting the targets. Although we prefer carrots rather than sticks to encourage businesses, public sector bodies and individuals to make the necessary changes to their behaviour in the interests of climate change mitigation, we accept that public <place-holder colnum=\"18811\"/> bodies should have regard to the guidance that they will receive from ministers.</p><p>Finally, I will deal with a couple of aspects of part 5 of the bill that concerned my party. Following the Government's decision to drop the forestry leasing proposals, we are pleased that the bill now requires ministers to lay a land use strategy before the Parliament by March 2011. Given the desire for significantly more woodland in Scotland and other competing land uses such as the food production that is so important for our food security, the increasing need for sustainable flood risk management and the need for land for industrial and housing development, it is extremely important that Scotland has a proper plan to use its land in the most appropriate and sustainable way.</p><p>On the Conservative benches, we are keen to encourage and improve energy efficiency, so we are pleased that the Parliament has approved the various amendments that will allow energy efficient improvements to dwellings and non-domestic properties. I join other members in commending Sarah Boyack for her immense contribution in that regard over the years. As a north-east MSP, I am also extremely pleased with the minister's stated commitment to extend the combined heat and power schemes that a number of Aberdeen residents enjoy and his intention that that will be done from April next year.</p><p>I could say a great deal more about the detail of this groundbreaking legislation, but I conclude by welcoming the many measures that will help us to make progress in the battle to reduce and mitigate the effects of climate change. There are those who will not be happy with the progress that we have made, but the bill is a major step in the right direction and we will be happy to support it at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19977578", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's long and well-fought battle will, at decision time, result in the passing of an extremely important piece of legislation that, following on from the UK Climate Change Act 2008, should ensure that our small island punches well above its weight in the battle against the global warming that threatens our planet's future, and should set an example for others to follow.

As we have heard, witnesses who gave evidence during the stage 1 consideration of the bill highlighted two key areas of concern that must be tackled. The first is the lack of infrastructure that would allow a more rapid transition from disposal to recycling. The second is the urgent need to focus on reducing the amount of commercial and industrial waste that goes to landfill.</p><p>It is particularly concerning that, in the two years between 2004 and 2006, construction and demolition waste increased by 61 per cent according to surveys that were carried out by SEPA. I was pleased to hear the minister say this afternoon that there is a determination to reduce that waste significantly by 2012. I wonder whether more encouragement should be given to social enterprises such as Wood Recyclability in Aberdeenshire, which is well known to some members, and the Wood Works in Edinburgh, which does an excellent job of reusing and recycling waste wood from demolished buildings and the like.</p><p>In recent years, most of the focus has been on household waste, and relatively little has been done by councils to encourage businesses to divert their waste from landfill.

The SRC makes the point that facilities are needed that are capable of handling mixed plastics and that functioning markets need to be established to drive an increase in recycling rates.

Climate change is likely to result in more wet summers, and a rise in sea level is possible. It is recognised that flooding is a threat to nearly 100,000 properties in Scotland. Water surges threaten our coastal defences and may cause surface flooding with which our urban drainage systems will struggle to cope.<place-holder colnum=\"17391\"/></p><p>There is an urgent need for long-term planning, with an emphasis on sustainable flood management, so the bill is welcome indeed. There is a plethora of flood-related legislation, but much of it is now outdated and out of line with changes to the delivery of Government and local services in Scotland. The bill gives us the opportunity to put right that situation.</p><p>By establishing a framework for assessing flood risk, mapping flood hazard and risk, developing flood risk management plans and transposing the EU floods directive into Scots law, the bill ought to lead to a reduction in the incidence and adverse consequences of flooding. The bill's main provisions have been ably discussed by many members this afternoon, so I will not repeat them&#8212;I will just highlight a few areas.</p><p>The initial provision in part 3 of the bill on the preparation and review of the assessments and plans that are required by the EU floods directive caused us some concern, because it contained no requirement to implement natural flood management techniques, nor was there a presumption in favour of natural flood management, hence our support for the stage 3 amendments that dealt with that.</p><p>The use of agricultural land for natural flood management must be considered carefully alongside the need to protect food security&#8212;that is of prime concern to my party. Although we welcome the provisions in part 4, which give local authorities broad powers to develop a full range of flood risk management measures, we feel strongly that land managers must be adequately compensated for any income loss sustained because their land is used as flood plain or as a means of holding back the flow of water.</p><p>We very much welcome the emphasis on natural flood management, but we recognise that it will not completely get rid of the need for hard engineering solutions to flooding problems. However, the bill should help to induce a culture shift in the minds of local authorities, with natural solutions being used wherever possible.</p><p>We are pleased that the Government has announced a review of all inland waterway rescue services, because they clearly require consideration and improvement. We look forward to the outcome of the review in due course.</p><p>There is clear consensus on the need for the bill and on its provisions.

He was instrumental in developing the antenatal and perinatal care that we have come to take for granted in Scotland and, thanks to his research and practice, maternal mortality rates tumbled.</p><p>Although those excellent results stem partly from better health and nutrition, they are in no small measure due to the expertise and commitment of midwives, both in hospital settings and in the community. Sadly a few women here still die in childbirth; however, the vast majority of women can expect to come through the process unscathed, although, as Mary Scanlon made clear, there are areas in which care is still not ideal.<place-holder colnum=\"17136\"/></p><p>Women in Scotland value their local maternity services. Indeed, as many of us who have been involved in campaigns to save maternity hospitals know, whenever changes are proposed to the delivery of such services, the women make it clear that they do not want them to be tampered with. In a relatively successful campaign in which I was involved in Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, a birthing unit was retained within the cottage hospital. However, most of the antenatal and perinatal care was transferred to the community, with expert community midwives in charge of patient care.</p><p>With many women lacking the family support that previous generations of mothers could rely on, and with increasing numbers exhibiting the effects of drug and alcohol misuse, our midwives are playing an increasing role in educating mothers before the birth of their babies, giving them information on how to bring them up in a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>By and large, we like our maternity service, which is, on the whole, very successful and gives most mothers a choice about where their babies will be born. Improvements can always be made, and we must be ever watchful for complications that can affect mother and baby. However, we can generally consider ourselves to be fortunate.</p><p>Sadly, in many other parts of the world&#8212;for example sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia&#8212;maternal mortality rates are still unacceptably high with, as we have heard, more than half a million women dying from pregnancy and childbirth complications every year. I find it shocking that in this day and age the developing world accounts for 99 per cent of all maternal deaths. It is indicative of the severe poverty that still exists in those parts of the world.</p><p>Led by Professor Wendy Graham, the University of Aberdeen is again playing a major role in combating maternal mortality, this time globally. Professor Graham, who is internationally renowned for her work in measuring maternal health outcomes and interventions, has undertaken collaborative research work in a large number of developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and regularly provides technical support to a number of international agencies.</p><p>Professor Graham also runs the initiative for maternal mortality programme assessment&#8212;or immpact&#8212;a well recognised global research programme. Its results should provide science-based information on maternal, perinatal and economic outcomes, with the objectives of improving knowledge of the health, social and economic consequences of pregnancy, abortion and delivery for women in developing countries, and of mobilising that knowledge in comprehensive efforts to evaluate interventions to <place-holder colnum=\"17137\"/> make pregnancy safer. Clearly, that research will inform progress towards achieving the millennium development goal of improving maternal health, which is targeted at reducing maternal deaths and providing universal access to reproductive health. Key to achieving that will be the availability of skilled midwives, with appropriate equipment and supplies, better access to family planning services and action to deal with unsafe abortion.</p><p>Much remains to be done. So far, little progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa and, as the motion suggests, greater international action is needed to resolve the global problem of maternal and infant mortality. However, I hope that, in the fullness of time and with the help of the midwifery profession, the work that has been initiated by the Aberdeen team will bear fruit and be instrumental in improving global maternal health, in the same way that Sir Dugald Baird's pioneering work last century did so much for mothers and infants in this country.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Midwives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very pleased to speak in support of Mary Scanlon's motion, and to congratulate her on securing the debate.

If we are to achieve that, tough but meaningful targets need to be set and attained. That is why my party gave support to a climate change bill for Scotland that sets out the targets and policies by which such change will be <place-holder colnum=\"17115\"/> achieved and by which progress towards our goal will be carefully monitored.</p><p>I did not have the opportunity that was afforded to the members of the three parliamentary committees that scrutinised the bill of hearing evidence from the many groups of people with an interest in the issue. However, although the bill focuses on long-term targets, it contains little practical detail on how those targets will be achieved. The detail has been left to subsequent policy and regulation. That is particularly the case in section 5, in which many enabling provisions&#8212;for example, in the area of waste management and recycling&#8212;are set out. Our concern is that the provisions could result in a raft of future subordinate legislation that could have significant financial implications for local authorities, businesses and consumers. That provoked much disquiet during the scrutiny of the bill at stage 1. I will elaborate on the issues later in my speech.</p><p>I will confine most of my brief remarks to section 5. Before I do so, I too align myself with the Church of Scotland eco-congregations, the Energy Saving Trust, the Confederation of British Industry and many other organisations on the need for public co-operation and involvement in fighting climate change. If people around Scotland are not aware of the bill or how it might affect them&#8212;indeed, it would appear that few of them are&#8212;they will press on with their lives regardless of climate change and what they can do to fight it.</p><p>If the bill is to achieve its intended results, individuals and communities must become involved in trying to meet its set targets. To that end, I am pleased to note the recommendation in the lead committee's stage 1 report that ministers should produce proposals for an engagement strategy as part of their implementation plan for the bill. I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary's positive response to that recommendation in his opening speech.</p><p>Section 5 addresses a number of important issues, not least of which is the requirement for a programme of action on how Scotland will adapt to the impacts of climate change to be placed before Parliament. Given that agriculture produces a significant proportion of our greenhouse gas emissions, land management techniques have a key role to play in mitigating climate change. Habitat conservation and agricultural and forestry activities can help by way of reducing losses from soils and sequestering carbon in vegetation.</p><p>There is increasing competition for land use in rural areas. Much land has been&#8212;and continues to be&#8212;developed for housing and industry. In addition, biofuels are increasingly displacing food production and conflict can arise where woodland replaces heather moorland. Of course, there can also be complementarities, one example of which <place-holder colnum=\"17116\"/> can be seen when the restoration of peatlands improves water quality in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving habitats. If we are to get the greatest benefit from the use of our rural land, we need to develop a sustainable land use strategy. The Parliament gave cross-party support to that in the forestry debate on 19 March.</p><p>The RSPB pressed the Government to include a commitment in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill to introduce a sustainable land use strategy. I have a deal of sympathy for that approach. We are pleased that the Government decided to drop its forestry leasing proposals following widespread opposition during the consultation process. That said, we are supportive of other roles that the forestry sector can play in reducing carbon emissions; joint ventures such as renewable energy projects are one example of that.</p><p>We welcome the Government's intention to review muirburn provisions. The minister's stated intention is to lodge an amendment to ensure that the power to vary muirburn dates will maintain the current number of days when burning is allowed, thus protecting carbon storage and reducing the risk of wildfire, as well as protecting our natural heritage.</p><p>We are supportive of measures to encourage energy efficiency, as explained by my colleague, Alex Johnstone. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, we remain to be convinced by many of the provisions that are included in section 5 and the level of subordinate legislation that it provides for regarding waste management, recycling and packaging, deposit-and-return schemes and charges for plastic carrier bags. The British Soft Drinks Association, for example, is concerned that the sections on waste, recycling and deposits contain some potentially far-reaching provisions that have not yet been fully analysed. It fears that those sections might impose additional cost burdens on both industry and consumers that will run into many millions of pounds and might weaken existing measures to ensure the recycling of packaging waste.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak in this stage 1 debate in support of the general principles of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill.

Essentially, the differences concerned the respective roles and responsibilities of constituency and regional MSPs. The committee was right, by agreeing to remove from the code section 8.3.1, which refers to the \"usual point of contact\" for constituents, to dismiss the idea that such differences should be defined or reflected in the code of conduct, and to acknowledge that constituents have the freedom to choose which elected representatives to approach.</p><p>I agree with the committee's decision to remove the requirement for regional members to notify constituency members when they take on casework. In a number of cases that come my way, a considerable amount of work has already been done by the constituency member. Apart from affording that member the courtesy of knowing that I am also involved, it is useful to know what has gone before in order to avoid duplication of effort. However, some cases come to a regional member as a constituent's first choice. In such cases, there is not the same need to notify the local member, especially when that could be seen as a breach of confidentiality&#8212;a point that was made in evidence to the committee. We know, to quote Brian Adam, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the notification rule is honoured much more in the breach than in the observance.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee</em>, 18 March 2008; c 177.]</p><p>In my opinion, a rule that is widely broken is often not a particularly good rule.</p><p>In my experience, my fellow regional members and I have a good relationship with our constituency colleagues. We have worked successfully on a cross-party basis on a number of local north-east issues, and we regularly attend collective briefings by health boards, enterprise companies and the oil and gas industry. That is good practice, but I do not see the need for a statement on working collectively to be part of the code of conduct and am content with the proposal to remove that. However, I agree with Mary Mulligan that it is important for regional members to be seen to work for constituents across the region. The requirement for us to work in more than two constituencies in the region is a pragmatic way of ensuring that our activities are regional in nature.</p><p>There are other parts of the committee's report that I have not had time to touch on but, overall, the review of section 8 of the code of conduct has been carried out in a painstaking and sensible manner. The committee's recommendations should result in a clearer understanding of the role of MSPs, and in practical steps to ensure that our <place-holder colnum=\"16118\"/> constituents are represented conscientiously and reasonably as we undertake our daily work as MSPs, whether constituency or regional.

We were pleased by the minister's statement last Friday in that regard. There is no doubt that forestry is important to the Scottish economy in terms of tourism, recreational and sporting activity, and, of course, as a source of the timber that is increasingly being used by the construction industry as a substitute for concrete and steel, and as a fuel source, with the potential to make a serious contribution towards meeting Scotland's renewable energy targets. Forestry is also important for our biodiversity, because it provides a habitat for many species of wildlife and vegetation. It has a significant contribution to make, too, in locking up carbon, although how much is debatable. We welcome the Forestry Commission's on-going review of carbon science, which is perhaps much more complex than was hitherto realised.</p><p>Commercial forestry's 39 per cent growth in the past decade is indicative of its economic potential. However, we are still far from achieving the 25 per cent forest cover to which the Government aspires and which would mean expansion of our woodland by 10,000 hectares per annum, as several members have said. That could have serious implications for biodiversity and agriculture. Like the RSPB and NFU Scotland, we hope that the Government's forthcoming land use review will enable a strategic approach to be taken to managing Scotland's land in relation to food production, wildlife adaptation and climate change mitigation. Forestry must not be looked at in isolation. It must be considered alongside other, competing land uses, not least because an increase in afforestation from 17 to 25 per cent could have a significant impact on agricultural land, much of which has already been lost to housing and industrial development.</p><p>Food security is increasingly important in a hungry world, and careful thought must be given to any significant diversion of land from primary food production. On the other hand, sensitive and well-thought-out woodland expansion, involving the sustainable maintenance of forests alongside other land uses, will help to safeguard biodiversity. It will also allow us to address some of the impacts of climate change and help us to meet our climate change targets.</p><p>We have heard about some of the opportunities that could come from the pursuit of joint ventures between the Forestry Commission and other interested parties and which would help to <place-holder colnum=\"15960\"/> generate the huge financial investment that will be needed if planting targets are to be met.

Indeed, for a number of years, there has been cross-party support for re-opening the station at Kintore.

As my colleague John Scott said, Scottish Conservatives welcome the Government's commitment to deliver a Scottish marine bill that aims to protect Scotland's marine environment and to drive growth sustainably.</p><p>Our marine environment is world class. It contains a wealth of biodiversity that supplies commercial and recreational fishing interests, supports our renowned seabird colonies and underpins a significant tourism industry, particularly in more remote parts of the country. That environment is increasingly threatened by overexploitation, climate change and development, such as the now-mature offshore oil industry and the growing renewable energy sector, which plans to harness wind, wave and tidal <place-holder colnum=\"15336\"/> power. Of course, such activity is important for our current and future energy needs and our economic wellbeing.</p><p>The many activities that take place around our shores and a growing awareness that we need to manage our seas in a sustained, integrated way have led to demand for the marine bill that is now promised by the Scottish Government and which was welcomed by most respondees to the recent consultation. Current legislation has developed in a piecemeal, fragmented manner and has become overly complex and bureaucratic; there is clearly a desire to simplify that. The analysis of responses to the consultation showed that the need for simplification and a reduction in bureaucracy were the chief reason given for welcoming legislative change. That must be put at the heart of the bill.</p><p>We see an overarching strategic spatial plan as essential for the marine environment. We agree with the proposal for a three-tier marine planning framework. We have long been supportive of a devolved marine management organisation for Scottish waters, so we strongly support the Government's creation of marine Scotland, with responsibility for marine science, planning and policy development. The body will bring together under one umbrella the work of the Fisheries Research Services, the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency and the Government's marine directorate. Provided that an associated appeals process is set up, we see that as the best means of enabling the provisions that are planned for the bill to be implemented. We think that the sooner marine Scotland is up and running, the better, so we are unwilling to support Labour's amendment, despite the explanation that Elaine Murray gave to John Scott.</p><p>We welcome the Liberal Democrats' positive approach and will vote for their amendment. We will also support the Green amendment, although I must respond to Robin Harper. As John Scott and Jim Hume said, there need not be incompatibility between sustainable development and economic development&#8212;surely they can progress together.</p><p>John Scott explained our amendment, which I hope will have the support of the Parliament. Our commercial fishermen, who have weathered significant problems in recent years, need to be involved in all plans for marine conservation measures, to ensure that they benefit from the sustainable management of fish stocks. Likewise, recreational sea-angling interests should have a strong voice in marine Scotland, as a healthy marine environment is crucial to the continuing future of an activity that makes a major financial contribution to the many coastal communities that depend on the business that visiting sea anglers create. We are concerned about the European Commission's article 47 proposals to regulate sea <place-holder colnum=\"15337\"/> angling and ask the Government to consider whether it can use the marine bill as a means of safeguarding recreational angling off the Scottish coastline from the Commission's potentially damaging plans.</p><p>Following yesterday's members' business debate on seabirds, at which there was general agreement that action is needed to protect our iconic seabirds from the impact of climate change and depletion of their food sources, we look forward to the forthcoming marine bill containing measures that are designed to tackle the severe decline in our breeding seabird colonies.</p><p>We welcome the general thrust of the proposals for the marine bill, which have received the support of many of those who responded to the consultation. Clearly, the devil will be in the detail, and many diverse interests will plead their case during consideration of the bill. However, I hope that the Government will remain true to its intentions, so that we end up with simplified legislation that will ensure the future protection of our marine biodiversity and a sustainable economic future for our diverse marine industries.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14740648", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Bill Consultation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has highlighted the crucial importance of the Government's proposed marine bill to the future of Scotland's marine environment and the need to get that right.

I especially welcome the signature of the minister, Roseanna Cunningham, albeit that she signed it in her previous guise as a humble back bencher. I am sure that her elevation to the ministerial team has in no way diluted her interest in the subject, and I look forward to hearing her response at the end of tonight's debate. I also congratulate her on her promotion and wish her well as she gets to grips with her new role, appropriately during Scottish environment week.</p><p>Scotland can rightly be proud of its world-class bird-life and its reputation as an ornithologist's paradise. From the Highlands and Islands to the south-west and along the east coast, our small country is home to numerous rare and interesting species. Given our magnificent coastline and island habitats, it is no surprise that it is our seabirds for which Scotland is arguably most famous. From Sumburgh in the Shetlands to St Abbs in the Borders, and from Ailsa Craig in the west to the Isle of May in the east, our spectacular colonies house 45 per cent of the European Union's breeding seabirds and are of international importance. They also generate significant tourism revenue, as members who represent our coastal communities will know.</p><p>It is therefore a tragedy that the subject before us tonight has arisen. There have been not simply one but successive poor seasons for our seabirds <place-holder colnum=\"15192\"/> over a period of years. Populations can recover from one or two bad seasons, but it is clear that year after year of little or no breeding success will have a catastrophic impact on the survival of certain species.</p><p>The numbers involved are frightening. In some cases, we have witnessed the near collapse of colonies. At North Hill on Papa Westray in the Orkneys, more than 1,000 Arctic tern nests were abandoned early in the 2008 season, thereby failing to fledge a single chick. Also affected is the beautiful Arctic skua, which is a bird on the edge of its world range in Scotland. Reserves run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the northern isles witnessed a 30 per cent decline in nesting pairs, with only three chicks fledging last year. Dr Douglas Gilbert, an RSPB ecologist, has said that the outlook is dire for the three worst affected species&#8212;the Arctic tern, the Arctic skua and the kittiwake.</p><p>Only yesterday, on the eve of this debate, the National Trust for Scotland, whose properties are home to nearly a fifth of Scotland's seabirds, warned that if current trends continue</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the evocative cries of the kittiwake, that much-loved feature of our coastal cliffs, could be consigned to folk memory\".</p><p>Even the iconic puffin could be in trouble, with the population on the Isle of May declining by 28,000 pairs in a period of just five years.</p><p>We abuse our oceans at our peril, and the decline in seabirds is an indicator that all is not well with the ecosystem as a whole. The issue is complex, but it appears that the main problem is a shortage of food, which is driven by the warming of our seas, particularly in the north-east Atlantic, where winter temperatures tend to be higher and which appears to have seen the worst decline. According to the RSPB, the biomass of zooplankton there has dropped by 70 per cent. Not only has the abundance changed, but the prevalent cold-water species is progressively being replaced by a warmer water species.</p><p>Zooplankton are eaten by sand eel larvae, so they too have declined in number, and the birds that normally use them as their preferred diet are being forced to feed their young on pipefish instead. That often results in the chicks' choking on the bony pipefish or starving due to the low nutritional value of that alternative source of food. The following quote from the seabird ranger on St Kilda during the 2005 season underlines the terrible consequences:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As soon as we entered the puffin colony, we could tell something was wrong. As we started to investigate marked burrows our hearts sank, as we were finding burrow after burrow with either no chick or a dead one lying in the nest. Pipefish were all over the ground throughout the colony, <place-holder colnum=\"15193\"/> and many of the burrows were full of piles of rotting pipefish which the young were unable to eat.\"</p><p>Adult birds, too, are suffering from a lack of food, and many are not attempting to breed at all.</p><p>After successive bad seasons, I fear that we could be in the early stages of an ecological catastrophe. All of us, perhaps, are guilty of not sitting up and taking notice sooner, but we still have the opportunity at least to attempt to do something.</p><p>The marine environment is clearly sensitive to climate change. We will need to take a strong and sustainable approach in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill if we are to overcome the problem. The forthcoming marine bill, too, can be a vehicle to improve the resilience of the marine environment if it includes measures to protect some of our most precious wildlife from overexploitation and the damaging effects of development, thereby ensuring that all our marine resources are managed sustainably. Combating the warming of our seas is no easy task. In the short term, measures must be sought that give greater protection to fragile ocean habitats if we are to avoid the possibility of a future of lifeless seas and empty oceans.</p><p>The Government must work closely with everyone who has expertise in the subject to examine what can and must be done. Future generations will not forgive us if we simply preside over the loss of the great seabird colonies for which Scotland has long been renowned.

Nearly 210,000 people in Scotland have been confirmed as <place-holder colnum=\"14633\"/> diabetics, but another 90,000 probably have type 2 diabetes that is as yet undiagnosed. As the population ages and the number of obese people increases, we can expect more diabetics in Scotland and in younger age groups. Coping with the subsequent complications will put significant strain on the NHS.</p><p>Diabetes UK's work, which is already valuable, will become more necessary, particularly its delivery of information, peer support and contribution to service improvement for diabetic patients. The organisation's funding of research projects is crucial, because only by genetic and stem-cell research will we find a cure for the disease. It is also important to find out how to prevent insulin resistance, to consider the issues on the use of insulin pumps and to add to our knowledge of the aetiology of and the best ways to prevent cardiovascular disease. Diabetes UK is a worthy charity, so it is right that we congratulate it on the excellent work that it undertakes and supports financially.</p><p>It is quite amazing how the treatment and monitoring of diabetes has changed since my mother first became a type 2 diabetic in the late 1950s. Diet, soluble insulin and&#8212;if I remember correctly&#8212;metformin were the only options for treating the condition. Testing for blood sugar was laborious and not very patient friendly, and monitoring and controlling diabetes meant regular, time-consuming visits to the diabetic clinic in a hospital out-patient department.</p><p>Patients had little real understanding of the condition or its complications; they often said that they had just a touch of diabetes, as if it were some minor complaint, and did not realise how important it was to maintain their blood sugar within normal limits. Responsibility for managing diabetes lay with the medical profession, not the patient. The present-day recognition that patients must have ownership of the monitoring and treatment of their condition is long overdue. It will ultimately benefit many patients and, it is to be hoped, will in due course relieve some of the costs and pressures on the NHS.</p><p>It is hugely important that we get to grips with the obesity epidemic that is leading to the rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. It is crucial that the condition is diagnosed at the earliest possible opportunity, and I warmly welcome the actions that many community pharmacists are taking in that regard. It is important that patients have a clear understanding of their condition and know how to control it&#8212;as Karen Whitefield said, education is of the utmost importance&#8212;and that complications are picked up early by investigations such as routine retinoscopy, which is now readily available in opticians' consulting rooms.<place-holder colnum=\"14634\"/></p><p>My mother had never heard of Diabetes UK; indeed, I am ashamed to say that I had not been aware of the full extent of the organisation's activities until I entered the Parliament.

The improvements over recent years in services for people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes are in no small measure due to the efforts of Diabetes UK. That work needs to continue, and I agree with Karen Whitefield that the Parliament should commit to further action on diabetes in Scotland to ensure that we cope with the predicted upsurge in its incidence.

Wood is also important as a fuel, with biomass now regarded as having the potential to make a serious contribution to the achievement of Scotland's renewable energy targets. We also accept that significant new forestry development is needed to bring Scotland's tree coverage anywhere near the level in Europe. Woodlands are home to numerous species of insects, plants and animals, thus benefiting the country's biodiversity. Thanks to the Forestry Commission and others, many forests have been opened up in recent years for valuable recreational activity and sporting events.</p><p>The 39 per cent growth of commercial forestry in the past decade is indicative of its economic potential. We can understand the Government's interest in exploring a possible role for the private sector in the future management and development of some commercial aspects of the Forestry Commission's work. The commission has done a great deal of excellent work over the years, but there are concerns that some of its activities do not always give good value for money and may sometimes hinder rather than help the private forestry sector. On the other hand, we fully appreciate the legitimate concerns that have been expressed by the Forestry Commission and other stakeholders.

An increase in Scotland's forest coverage from 17 to 25 per cent would have significant implications for agriculture, as good agricultural land would be likely to become woodland. In a nation where much agricultural land has already been used, and is still being used, for housing and industrial development, and in a world where demand for food is escalating, any plans to divert major tracts of land from primary food production will have to be thought through carefully.</p><p>It would be foolhardy to consider forestry in isolation.

The primary legislation must be strong and robust enough to underpin effective implementation of flood risk management plans. The benefits of getting this right and reducing the risk of flooding in a sustainable way will not only help to improve and restore the status of the water environment, but will also reduce the economic and social costs of flooding.\"</p><p>I am sure that none of us can disagree with that.</p><p>There is no doubt that flooding and flood prevention have moved up the political agenda as we face up to the impact of climate change. Media coverage of several recent episodes of severe flooding north and south of the border has let us see something of the devastation that it causes <place-holder colnum=\"14373\"/> not only physically but emotionally: people who experience it remain ever fearful of a recurrence, as Angela Constance highlighted by referring to her constituents' experiences in West Lothian.</p><p>SEPA's flood risk map, which was published in 2007, indicates that nearly 100,000 properties in Scotland are at risk of flooding. It is predicted that floods that are currently considered extreme are likely to become more common, as are water surges that threaten coastal defences and cause surface flooding that is likely to overwhelm our urban drainage systems. There is an urgent need for long-term planning with an emphasis on sustainable flood management, which makes the bill welcome, if long awaited.</p><p>By establishing a framework for assessing flood risk, mapping flood hazard and risk, and developing risk management plans, the bill aims to reduce the adverse consequences of flooding. It also transposes the EU floods directive into Scots law in anticipation of the deadline for doing so, which is November this year. Our party fully supports the bill and has given a commitment to work constructively with the Government to take it forward at speed. We are pleased with its provisions, as John Scott said, but they can and must be improved.</p><p>We are happy to support the recommendations that were unanimously agreed by the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee in its stage 1 report. They take due cognisance of what the many expert witnesses said in evidence during the committee's painstaking scrutiny of the bill, and as my party's environment spokesman&#8212;although I am not a member of the committee&#8212;I congratulate the committee on a thorough piece of work.

Like others, I am pleased that the Government has responded positively to the committee's recommendation by agreeing to amend the long title of the bill to include a reference to sustainability.</p><p>Funding is clearly a major issue. Local authorities and others are worried that funding streams for the lead and responsible authorities are not currently in alignment. As Dave Thompson <place-holder colnum=\"14374\"/> stressed, NFU Scotland is deeply concerned about the possibility that money might be diverted from the Scottish rural development programme to flood management or to compensate farmers who lose valuable agricultural land as a consequence of natural flood management. The NFU believes that it is essential that the Government provides either an alternative source of funding or an increase in SRDP moneys that is commensurate with flood management requirements.</p><p>Alasdair Morgan highlighted the fears of SEPA and others that a lack of capacity in the recruitment and training of hydrologists and other specialists could seriously endanger the effective implementation of the bill. There is also concern that its implementation might be affected by the absence of a binding duty on responsible authorities to implement flood risk management plans and by the lack of a targeted funding stream for flood risk management.</p><p>Another concern is that the current prioritisation by Scottish Water of more immediate short-term cost options in assessing what form of flood prevention work to undertake could result in the benefits of more costly, but more sustainable, natural flood management techniques being overlooked. The cabinet secretary's commitment to look at that issue is welcome.</p><p>Finally, Scottish Water's worry that surface water management planning does not feature in the bill must also be considered as part of a co-ordinated approach to flood risk management. However, I appreciate that such issues might not come within the remit of the bill.</p><p>I have merely skimmed over some of the issues that the committee considered in depth. Clearly, as the committee recommended in its stage 1 report, some provisions need to be improved before stage 3, and the cabinet secretary's indication that he will address some of those issues at stage 2 is welcome.</p><p>The human cost of flooding can be devastating because of the damage it does not only to homes and possessions but to emotional wellbeing, and anything that the Government can do to prevent flooding and to mitigate its effects is to be welcomed.

The Scottish Government and the farming community have welcomed the agreement as largely positive. However, as members across the chamber have said, many challenges lie ahead in its implementation. We have been pleased to contribute to this afternoon's interesting and mainly consensual discussion, and we look forward to supporting the Government's motion&#8212;and, as John Scott said, the Labour amendment&#8212;at decision time. We particularly agree with the remarks of Sarah Boyack and others about the need for a bull hire scheme.</p><p>In the present-day world, where financial threats to national economies and a growing concern about food security increasingly occupy our minds, it is essential that the CAP operates to ensure that we have a sustainable and competitive agricultural industry, giving farmers the opportunity to play a full part in the expansion of our economy and to contribute to food security through efficient and profitable food production. At the same time, however, we must not forget the importance of Scotland's biodiversity and its contribution to our heritage and very important tourism industry, which is dependent on our land managers being able to function in a manner that sustains and enhances our environment. As we know, that has been under threat recently, as sheep have disappeared in large numbers from our upland and remote areas. The number of cattle, too, has been significantly reduced, and there is a growing threat to our biodiversity from ungrazed and unmanaged land because the animals are no longer there.</p><p>Increasing food shortages are becoming a global problem. It is becoming increasingly important for farmers to focus on their central role <place-holder colnum=\"14213\"/> of food production and for Government to ensure that they get the maximum support and encouragement to increase their productivity to satisfy an expanding world market as it tries to meet the ever-rising demand for western-style food. The Conservatives believe that, in the current climate, if the CAP is to be about anything it must be about increasing production in our agricultural industry. We are reasonably happy that the CAP health check has taken into account most of the issues that we raised in our response to the Government's consultation on the future implementation of the common agricultural policy in Scotland.</p><p>The move towards a more level EU-wide playing field on modulation has been mentioned by several members. Action is being taken to avoid progressive modulation, which would have led to cuts in the subsidies to larger farms and would thereby have disadvantaged Scotland, which has a higher proportion of large farms than continental Europe. In addition, Scotland is being given the freedom to decide how best to proceed with the beef calf scheme, which may be retained until at least 2012, to the benefit of beef production in the most fragile parts of Scotland. All that is very welcome to us.</p><p>We also welcome the retention, at this point, of the historic model of payment of the SFP. We feel that a purely area-based system would not be appropriate for Scotland, because the land quality varies so much throughout the country. Any move away from the historic model would, in our opinion, have to take account of the large land-quality variations. However, we think that the subsidy should be paid only if the land in question is being actively farmed. I hope that the cabinet secretary agrees with that.</p><p>We have long advocated the removal of the outdated milk quota system, and we are pleased that that will at last be achieved in a few years' time. We have advocated strongly the abolition of set-aside, because of our concerns about food security, and we are happy that that has now been completed. However, we recognise the need to preserve our biodiversity and environment. As John Scott said in response to its consultation, the Government must put in place schemes that will ensure that no detrimental environmental impact results from the removal of set-aside. That could be done via the provision of a new cross-compliance option for the establishment and/or retention of habitats, as suggested by some of the conservation bodies. In the meantime, the existing cross-compliance requirement to leave buffer strips and retain landscape features will help to make up for the loss of at least some set-aside land.<place-holder colnum=\"14214\"/></p><p>The key issue, as Peter Peacock stressed, is how to actively manage farmed land in a way that enhances biodiversity while increasing production. That is a major challenge for all concerned, be they farmers, politicians or conservation organisations, and it must be at the heart of any cross-compliance reforms.</p><p>In the meantime, we are anxious that when ministers look again at the current SRDP, they do so with a view to refocusing the spend of pillar 2 resources on food security and livestock retention. That would go some way towards addressing the substantial decline in livestock on our hills, which has been documented by the recent excellent reports from the RSE, the SAC and NFU Scotland, and it would help to answer the case that was made by the Scottish Conservatives in our food security task force support, which asks the Government to pay special attention to finding ways of boosting the less favoured area support scheme, following the loss of substantial numbers of Scotland's hill sheep.</p><p>We are broadly content with the outcome of the CAP health check, but we have concerns about food security and we hope that the Scottish Government will consider refocusing the rural development funds towards schemes that will support it, particularly with regard to the retention of livestock in remote and upland areas. Our farmers must be given every encouragement to maximise their contribution to our economic growth, through food production, and to the environment, through their capable management of our outstanding rural landscape.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Looking back over what was said here in May, ahead of the Government's consultation on the CAP health check, I think that it is fair to say that most of the issues that are of concern to members have been dealt with to our satisfaction in the deal that was struck in Brussels on 20 November.

Throughout the country, there was a sense that health boards were consulting the public on faits accomplis and pressing ahead with change in the teeth of local opposition. I am sure that I am not the only member who attended angry public meetings at which health board staff were accused of having closed minds and no real interest in local input.</p><p>It is generally recognised that there needs to be better engagement between the NHS and local communities&#8212;the cabinet secretary spelled that out, and it has been borne out in evidence to the Health and Sport Committee&#8212;but there seems to be little agreement about the best way of achieving it. The current situation is confusing. A number of bodies are responsible for various parts of public and patient involvement, such as the public partnership fora, the CHPs and the Scottish health council. There is a deal of scepticism about the effectiveness of those bodies. Only yesterday, I heard a popular practitioner decrying his local CHP. They said that it is a talking shop that is heavy with management and that general practitioners no longer engage with it. Such comments do not inspire public confidence; rather, they substantiate the general feeling that the consultation and engagement methods that NHS boards use still do not take sufficient notice of the views of patients and the public, and that the situation must improve.</p><p>In that context, I sympathise with the concept of having a proportion of directly elected members on health boards in order to give the public a place at the health board table when important matters and changes are being discussed and a direct input into the process before decisions are made. However, it is clear that there must also be significant input from professionals who are involved in running a service that is important to our wellbeing and extremely costly to run. A balance must be struck.</p><p>Two years ago, when Bill Butler proposed that health boards should have a majority of directly elected members, I voiced my concern that that could lead to short-term decision making, single-issue candidates and, occasionally, distorted priorities or delays in making difficult decisions, which could lead in some instances to care inequalities and an undermining of regional services planning. I am probably seen as part of the establishment, but I still have concerns about the bill's proposals. I am concerned about directly elected members and appointed councillors&#8212;who are likely to be political recommendations&#8212;constituting a majority on health boards, although I accept that, as a group on their own, directly elected members would be in a minority. I certainly do not go along with Bill Butler's continuing <place-holder colnum=\"14033\"/> commitment to having an outright majority of directly elected members.</p><p>Other valid concerns were expressed during the Health and Sport Committee's consideration of the bill. For example, will elections to health boards result in genuine public representation or will they merely attract people who are time and financially rich or who are standing on a party ticket? As a result, will they lead to the politicisation of boards? Will the extension of the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds lead to their representation on boards, or will time and money costs preclude that? Will the public actually become engaged with the electoral process or will there be voter apathy, as there has been in New Zealand? We know that turnout in New Zealand has decreased from 50 per cent, which it was at the outset in 2000, to 43 per cent in 2007. Will the costs outweigh the benefits? Will money be spent on elections that could be better spent on front-line services? Many questions are as yet unanswered.</p><p>I am relieved that, rather than seeking to introduce nationwide elections at this stage, the bill provides for pilot elections to be undertaken in certain health board areas. It is also right that, if the Parliament approves the bill, the Scottish Government should meet the costs of running the pilots and that those costs should not be paid out of health board budgets. However, I am concerned that if the pilots are a success and the roll-out of elections throughout Scotland is eventually approved, boards might have to divert money from front-line services to pay for them.</p><p>As there is a clear demand for the public's views to be better represented and for greater involvement in decision making, and as that is not being achieved by other methods currently, I am content with my party's willingness to support the general principles of the bill at stage 1. The proposed pilots should provide the substantive evidence that currently is not available on the workability and cost-effectiveness of health board elections.</p><p>It is important that the pilots are fully and thoroughly evaluated and that the results are presented to Parliament so that they can be scrutinised and debated ahead of any possible roll-out of elections. I welcome the cabinet secretary's assurance to the Health and Sport Committee that the lodging of a roll-out order will only follow a completely independent evaluation of the pilots and that that roll-out will depend on the super-affirmative procedure, as recommended by the committee.</p><p>The costs of direct elections are considerable, so it is right that the Government intends to amend the bill at stage 2 to ensure that the cost of the pilots and any potential roll-out costs will be fully <place-holder colnum=\"14034\"/> considered as part of the independent evaluation of the pilots.</p><p>As requested by the committee&#8212;this is also the subject of Ross Finnie's amendment&#8212;it is right that other methods of increasing public engagement and involvement should be evaluated alongside the piloting of elections. I am pleased that the cabinet secretary has undertaken to present details of such methods, which will be piloted concurrently with elections.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee is to be congratulated on its painstaking scrutiny of the bill and its recognition of the need for thorough evaluation and consideration of the results of the pilot schemes before any possible adoption of a national scheme for elections to health boards. Given the cabinet secretary's undertakings in her response to the committee following its consideration of the bill, I am content with my party's decision to support it at stage 1. However, as Mary Scanlon said, our support at stage 3 is by no means guaranteed.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14592920", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have said, there is no doubt that there has been growing dissatisfaction in the past few years with how health boards engage with the public on the provision of local services.

The SPSA has not weighed up the positives and negatives of the case and considered alternative solutions. The closure is, <place-holder colnum=\"13910\"/> rather, an ill-thought-out proposal, driven solely by economics, to support the business case that has been put up by Dundee.</p><p>In May last year, I was pleased when the Cabinet Secretary for Justice directed the SPSA to engage in fresh consultation with interested parties. Like others, I was assured that the consultation would be full, frank and transparent. I was therefore as dismayed as everyone else to see the new document, which professes to address the key questions surrounding the delivery of forensic services to north and north-east Scotland, albeit that it is not meant to be a consultation paper but a means of focusing the discussion. Far from addressing the issues in an open and unbiased manner, the document merely expands on the reasons for closing the Aberdeen laboratory and fails to consider any other options. It gives the impression&#8212;not the correct impression, I hope&#8212;that the SPSA has a closed mind and will not look at other possibilities.</p><p>There appears to have been no meaningful consultation. We know that the unions have not yet been formally consulted, although that is about to happen. We do not know whether the procurator fiscal or forensic pathologists in Aberdeen and Raigmore have been asked for their opinions. We do not have an up-to-date view from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, although we know that Grampian Police is very much against the proposal to close the Aberdeen lab and Northern Constabulary has serious concerns about it.</p><p>We also know that the KPMG report of 2003 and the Noble report of 2004, which have been much quoted by the SPSA, recommended new builds at Dundee and Glasgow but did not recommend any closures. The KPMG report stated that the human resources costs alone involved in relocation, even before considering the damage to service provision through loss of experienced staff, would be prohibitive. While I fully accept that new facilities in Dundee and Glasgow are needed&#8212;that is not in dispute&#8212;I fail to see that a proper assessment has been made of the impact of closing Aberdeen. The Aberdeen lab currently provides an excellent service to the whole of the north of Scotland and has received significant investment in its facilities. Indeed, finance and plans are available for co-locating all crime and major investigative and specialist support services on a single site in Aberdeen.</p><p>I agree with my colleagues that the consultation process so far does not inspire confidence that it will lead to unbiased recommendations to the Government from the SPSA, and I welcome the fact that a new board convener of that organisation is to be asked to review the consultation to date and carry out any further <place-holder colnum=\"13911\"/> consultation with stakeholders that he considers necessary. I hope that the minister will put it on record this evening that no decision has yet been taken on the future of the Aberdeen lab and that nothing has been ruled out or in.</p><p>There are many factors to be considered, and of course they include costs, but the ultimate goal must be the best possible forensic science provision to give the best possible support to our police in their pursuit of criminals.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aberdeen Forensic Science Laboratory"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend Lewis Macdonald for securing this important debate and for including members of all parties in the discussions that have preceded it.

There can be no doubt that the Parliament&#8212;and, indeed, the Government&#8212;takes the issue seriously and has given it substantial prominence <place-holder colnum=\"13640\"/> on the political agenda only two years after it approved the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006, some provisions of which were designed to enhance the rate of donation.</p><p>During our debates, we have heard some well-reasoned and, sometimes, emotional speeches, which have put on record the cogent arguments for and against a system of so-called presumed consent to organ donation. The debate continues, and both of this year's excellent reports by the organ donation task force make it clear that there is no simple way to achieve an increase in organ donation. However, it is beyond dispute that there is an urgent need for more organs if we are to get anywhere near meeting the needs of the many people who await transplantation.</p><p>There also seems to be little doubt that, as Richard Simpson said, the numbers of people with end-stage organ disease will increase as our population ages and individuals suffer the long-term effects of the diabetes, obesity and excessive alcohol consumption that are prevalent in Scotland today. We must step up our efforts to alter lifestyles as a means of avoiding those diseases in the first place but, of course, the culture change will not happen overnight. Research must also continue into finding a cure for the many chronic conditions that lead, eventually, to organ failure and into the practicalities of viable organ generation within the laboratory.</p><p>In the meantime, transplantation is the only hope of saving the lives of many people whose organs can no longer perform their vital function, so we must consider every possible means of increasing the rate of organ donation and giving hope to those who are going through the pain and trauma of end-stage organ disease. Members should believe me that it is traumatic and deeply distressing to watch close friends or family members suffer the extreme breathlessness of respiratory or heart failure, or the severe pain of procedures such as sclerotherapy for the oesophageal varices that result from a failing liver.</p><p>I welcome the organ donation task force's latest report, which follows on from the one that we debated in March. The reports make it clear that the current system of organ donation is failing to meet the increasing demands that are placed upon it and that everything possible must be done to increase donation rates in the United Kingdom now within the existing legislation, which provides for opting in to donation. Initially, I was not clear about the intention of Richard Simpson's amendment but, having heard his explanation of it, I am inclined to agree with it, although the five years that the task force proposes seems a reasonable timescale for proper assessment of the efficacy of its proposals.<place-holder colnum=\"13641\"/></p><p>The factors that influence the rate of organ donation have been well rehearsed in our previous debates and the task force reports, and I have little to add. There is no doubt that there are many more people in Scotland who are willing to donate their organs than are on the donor register, and that it is largely inertia that stops them from registering. As I have said in the Parliament before, it took me more than 10 years from my son's transplant to register myself, and I am not altogether sure that my husband and daughter are even on the register, although I know that both would want me to consent on their behalf should the situation ever arise.</p><p>Every opportunity to make organ donation easy should be taken up. Efforts should also be made to encourage people to think about what happens to their organs after death and to discuss the matter with their families. Unfortunately, in our society today, there seems to be a reluctance to acknowledge that death is an inevitable part of life, and it is seldom talked about in any depth. Our newspapers and other media are full of the fatal accidents that occur daily on our roads, but we do not often hear about the victims' contributions to saving the lives of others by the transplantation of their organs to which their bereaved families generously agree.</p><p>I agree with the BMA's assertion that improving organ donation infrastructure and increasing donor numbers are interdependent measures. To that end, we must somehow change our culture and create an environment in which donation becomes the normal choice. The task force has stressed the need to improve donor identification and referral and to enhance donor co-ordination and organ retrieval. The success of such efforts will depend on all parts of the NHS embracing organ donation as a usual, rather than unusual, event.</p><p>The recommendations to improve organ donation infrastructure and to remove the barriers to donation should, if implemented across the country, go a long way towards achieving the UK target of almost doubling the rate of donation by 2013, without having to resort to further legislative change. If the proposed infrastructure changes that the Government is addressing, which the cabinet secretary spelled out earlier, achieve the desired result, then well and good. However, if they do not, changing to an opt-out system with appropriate safeguards, which appears to be supported by more than 60 per cent of the population, will have to be considered again. I therefore very much welcome the task force's recommendation to review the situation in five years in the light of the progress that is made on implementing the recommendations.</p><p>I hope that between now and 2013, satisfactory progress will be made and sufficient organs will <place-holder colnum=\"13642\"/> become available for the many people who currently await them or who may require them in the future. Any one of us or our friends and family members could find themselves in need of organ replacement.

I clearly remember the physical impact on the teenage audience of a very hard-hitting and explicit presentation on the effects of serious road traffic accidents on victims, those who cause accidents and the families who are left to cope with the resultant disabilities or the loss of their loved ones. The expressions on the faces of the pupils as they left the Beach Ballroom, only to be faced with the mangled wreck of a car involved in a fatal accident, showed that the message had got home. Perhaps that presentation should be made more widely available to get the message across to a wider spread of young drivers.</p><p>The Government needs to act to improve safety on roads in the north-east and I am pleased that ministers are taking the matter very seriously. Anyone who has driven on the A96 or the A947 will be aware of the long stretches of straight road that can lull drivers into a false sense of security and encourage excessive speed. We must pursue all means of making drivers aware of the risks by, for example, introducing warning signs and non-skid road surfaces.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives have long advocated the establishment by the Scottish Government of a special accident black spot fund to target the most dangerous stretches of our roads and junctions with safety improvements.

There are many others, as we have heard today.

We were also very pleased to hear this morning about the co-operation on marine planning between all the UK Administrations, which will be welcomed by all who depend on our seas for their livelihoods.</p><p>We are extremely concerned, however, that the Commission's proposals for west coast stocks could severely damage the nephrops sector, which is worth more than &#163;30 million to the west coast economy, hence our amendment stresses the importance of achieving</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a settlement that successfully balances the need to conserve depleted west coast whitefish stocks with a thriving langoustine fishery.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12847\"/></p><p>That view is held across the chamber, and we think that it needs to be reflected in the Parliament's resolution at decision time. I hope that our amendment will attract cross-party support.</p><p>We can all agree that the European Commission's commitment to a more flexible, localised approach to fisheries management, with a focus on conservation measures rather than on the discarding of overquota fish, is a welcome policy change. Despite its decimating the Scottish fleet, the ill-thought-out and aggressive quota reduction policy of recent years has not benefited fish stocks. There is no doubt that the main problem with the system has been the huge number of discarded fish. Between 50,000 and 80,000 tonnes of fish per year were thrown back into the sea dead between 1992 and 2001. That amounts to up to 60 per cent of the North Sea cod catch. We fully support the Government's commitment to pursue vigorously the issue of discards in mixed fisheries.</p><p>It is to be hoped that the new cod recovery plan, which was agreed in Brussels last week, will lead to reduced mortality. Linking time at sea allowances with voluntary measures should allow fishermen to land more of their catch and reduce discards. The EC target of a 25 per cent reduction in cod mortality next year will be hard to meet, but it will be up to member states and their industries to work out how to achieve it, rather than there being central control from Brussels. That is to be welcomed. I hope that Scotland will be able to achieve the target by continuing with its pioneering efforts to avoid catching cod, including the voluntary closure of areas where there are young or spawning fish and the technical alterations to nets to release unwanted fish. Those measures should protect cod and reduce discards.</p><p>As I indicated earlier, we share the general dismay at the draconian proposals for the virtual closure of west coast fisheries, which have been made without consultation with the industry and are quite unacceptable. It is shocking, as John Scott said, that a proposed closure of such magnitude should come out of the blue, catching both fishermen and Government unawares. In an area such as the west coast, where white-fish stocks are known to be low, surely there are ways to allow for the catching of nephrops while minimising the bycatch of species such as haddock, whiting and cod.</p><p>Far be it from me to argue with Ross Finnie, given all his experience of fisheries, but we know that urgent steps are being taken by fishermen to develop suitable nets, as they consider the proposed grids to be impractical. There is still a danger that virtually the entire west coast nephrops sector could be closed down to secure <place-holder colnum=\"12848\"/> the demersal stocks, even though such scientific evidence as is available suggests that nephrops stocks are stable and are not being overharvested.</p><p>I support the plea that Roseanna Cunningham and other members made for more research into west coast fish stocks, because as long as there is a knowledge gap, the stance taken by Europe is likely to be overly precautionary.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271355", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sea Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The December fisheries council will once again be of crucial importance to Scotland's fishing communities, particularly those on the west coast.

Despite that, aquaculture in the EU and Scotland has not yet expanded in line with global market development.</p><p>As Peter Peacock said, expansion of the aquaculture industry could contribute significantly to our food security by delivering more home-grown, healthy and nutritious products. Therefore, the approach in the Government's consultation document to promoting and enhancing the industry is welcome. However, as my colleague John Scott said, actions speak louder than words. I hope that the new strategic framework will identify robust solutions to the important problems that are identified in \"A Fresh Start\". The new locational map that was announced and other significant statements by the minister this afternoon represent a good start. We look forward to more supportive action in the future.</p><p>We have heard from many members that Scottish farmed salmon is extremely important to the economy, with the Highlands and Islands in particular depending on the industry for economic growth. It accounts for nearly 40 per cent of all Scottish food exports, and its high quality is internationally recognised. According to the Scottish Salmon Growers Organisation's briefing document, farmed salmon generates close to &#163;200 million for Scotland every year and sustains many businesses that have grown to support the salmon farming sector, such as haulage firms, ice suppliers, equipment manufacturers and, of course, the veterinary services that look after the health of the fish stocks. There is also a significant spin-off for other small local businesses, such as hotels, that feed off the increasing success of the aquaculture industry.</p><p>A sustainable future for the industry is clearly of major importance to Scotland, particularly for some of its more remote and fragile populations. If the industry is to compete successfully in a growing global market, its commitment to good practice, environmental responsibility and sound commercial judgment will be increasingly important. Several members have rightly stressed the importance of environmental responsibility. The voluntary code of good practice that the sector has pioneered has been a major success, and more than 95 per cent of Scottish farmed salmon is now produced by companies that adhere to the code. Therefore, we welcome the involvement of the shellfish and fin-fish industries&#8212;as well as other groups&#8212;in development of the new strategic framework, which must be in harmony with the code that is already in place.</p><p>As our amendment suggests and as John Scott explained, we have two major concerns: the problem of escaped farmed fish and the need to <place-holder colnum=\"12679\"/> keep the Gyrodactylus salaris parasite out of Scotland. Tougher action is still needed on both. Our wild salmon angling sector is internationally renowned for the salmon's quality and purity, so contamination of wild salmon stocks from escaped farm fish could have a catastrophic effect on that reputation. Therefore, the interests of the wild salmon sector must be a key and integral part of the renewed framework, and robust measures should be put in place to limit escapes further and to improve traceability when they occur. Parliament knows our serious concern about the on-going threat to farmed and wild salmon stocks from potential infestation by the G salaris parasite, which has already devastated salmon stocks in Norway. It is vital that action be taken to keep it out of Scotland and, as we said in the recent debate on non-native invasive species, we are of the firm opinion that the Government should consider amending the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007 to include Ted Brocklebank's stage 3 amendment that would require declaration of potentially contaminated fishing gear, and the decontamination of such gear, at ports of entry. The cabinet secretary is well aware of the dangers of allowing the parasite into Scotland&#8212;indeed, he supported the amendment in Ted Brocklebank's name during the stage 3 debate last year&#8212;and I hope that the Government will accept our amendment to the motion as an indication that it will give serious consideration to our proposals.</p><p>John Scott also made some practical suggestions concerning the development of fish farming, particularly about facilitating the growth of the halibut and turbot sectors. I hope the Government will consider those suggestions.</p><p>The RSPB briefing raises some serious issues about the health of Scotland's seas. Repeated breeding failures and significant population decline of some species of coastal birds are worrying and make it crucial that we enshrine environmental sustainability in the renewed strategic framework and the forthcoming marine bill. It is important that the new framework be consistent with the bill and the EU water framework directive, therefore we are happy to support the Labour amendment.</p><p>We will also support the Liberal Democrat amendment because a streamlined regulatory system, a fair inspection regime, a skilled and qualified workforce and good liaison between communities and the industry are all desirable and ought to be achievable.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives recognise the enormous importance of the fish farming industry to Scotland. We are generally supportive of the Government's proposals to promote and enhance it and we look forward to the publication of the new strategic framework next spring, which we hope <place-holder colnum=\"12680\"/> will reflect the areas of concern that have been raised and discussed in the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14246854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for that clarification.

I am sure that the Presiding Officer will allow me to extend a warm welcome to the more than 30 RSVP volunteers who are in the gallery to listen to the debate. Some of them might wonder why not too many MSPs are in the chamber. I ask them not to see that as a lack of interest in the valuable work that they do; rather, it is possibly because two by-elections are taking place not far from here today.

Throughout Scotland, older volunteers have helped 360 primary school classes to read and write.</p><p>In the north-east, several groups of older people&#8212;including one who is over 90 years old&#8212;keep their joints supple and their minds active by knitting a large array of items, which are then donated to maternity units, family support units and charities such as Blythswood Care and the New Hope Trust. Those groups have donated nearly 4,000 items in the past year and the feedback from them is that the knitters derive great satisfaction from using their talents to help people in their communities and beyond. They benefit from social contact with their peers and they feel valued. One sheltered housing warden said of her group, \"They don't all knit.

It is a partnership between CSV, Exxon Mobil and Energy Action Scotland, which has funding from Exxon Mobil until the end of next month. The project recruits and trains older volunteers to bring fuel efficiency and energy savings advice to vulnerable people in their own homes&#8212;advice that will help them to achieve improved energy efficiency and therefore greater warmth. The work is on-going in Edinburgh, Stirling, Fife, Angus, Dundee and Perth. Assuming that current efforts to secure funding are successful, there is the prospect of the project expanding to Glasgow, Lanark, Ayr, the Borders and Inverness.</p><p>In Aberdeen, an embryonic project is under way with the city's Chinese community, which will hopefully be extended to other ethnic minorities in the city. Those are only a few examples of the work of RSVP volunteers. I am sure that subsequent speakers will give more.</p><p>This work is extremely important and cost effective. The staff-to-volunteer ratio of RSVP is one paid worker to 200 volunteers. It costs &#163;250 to recruit, train and support a primary care or schools volunteer. That is insignificant money when one compares it with the cost of putting an elderly person into hospital, a child into care, or of someone leaving school unable to read, all of which can have long-term cost implications.</p><p>RSVP has many successful local partnerships with public service providers, but the funding that it receives from that source cannot cover costs. Despite its best efforts to secure other funding, the Government's core grant to the charity is essential to help it to lever in additional money. Unfortunately, RSVP is in year 3 of a three-year grant and has been told that the grant will not be renewed at the end of the financial year because its work does not match the criteria for the Government's new funding priorities. Its small team&#8212;six development staff and two part-time administration posts&#8212;is under threat of redundancy unless an alternative means of funding can be found. Many valuable projects that its volunteers have built up over the years could wither on the vine if that Government support is withdrawn.</p><p>I hope that the minister understands the very serious concerns of RSVP, and its many volunteers.

Giant hogweed, Japanese <place-holder colnum=\"11959\"/> knotweed, Rhododendron ponticum, grey squirrel and American mink are just five of the invasive non-native species that currently threaten Scotland's biodiversity by squeezing out native plant species, competing for food with indigenous animals such as the red squirrel, or killing vulnerable animals, such as the water vole, and ground-nesting birds in the case of the American mink. Those five examples are only a small proportion of the 900 plus non-native species in Scotland that have been identified by Scottish Natural Heritage. Most are benign&#8212;indeed, many have made positive contributions to our landscape and heritage, such as the horse chestnut and the little owl. However, a few are serious threats to our native species, with an estimated one in 10 species that are prioritised for conservation action being under threat by non-native species.</p><p>The damage that is caused by such species worldwide is reckoned to equate to 5 per cent of the global economy, with the cost to Britain alone being in the order of several billion pounds annually. As a result of climate change and increasing trade and travel, there is a risk that more new species will become established here in the future to further threaten our biodiversity and economic interests such as agriculture, fisheries and forestry.</p><p>This is an important time for the Government, industry and the public to recognise the threats that invasive non-native species pose, and to try to reduce the risk of new ones becoming established. That is why we welcome the framework strategy that we are discussing today, and why we are content with the motion. The Labour amendment will be a useful addendum, and we are happy to support it. The Liberal Democrat amendment elaborates what I would have thought is implicit in the motion, but we accept that Parliament should be informed of progress towards achieving the strategy's key aims, so we will also support the Liberal Democrat amendment.</p><p>As I said, we welcome the framework strategy and we are particularly heartened to see the various Administrations of Great Britain pulling together on such an important issue. I hope that this co-operative way of working can become a model for dealing in the future with other vital cross-border issues, such as food security.</p><p>We note the intention of the strategy to deliver a more balanced focus between reactive management and a more preventative approach, and to make better use of existing resources. We welcome its comprehensive approach to dealing with invasive species in Europe. The true extent of the threat that these species pose has become much better understood in recent times, and we are becoming more aware of the potential consequences of introducing such species. <place-holder colnum=\"11960\"/></p><p>Prevention of their introduction is clearly important, but, to achieve that, people must be made to understand the threats to biodiversity that non-native species pose. There must therefore be on-going action to improve public awareness. Long gone are the days when it was acceptable to freely import plants and animals without thought of the consequences. The intention to promote better access to information about non-native species is to be welcomed.</p><p>When such a species is identified, it should be speedily dealt with locally before it can take over. Once an invasive species becomes widely established, it may not be possible to eradicate it completely: indeed, it has been found that full-scale cost-effective eradication is achievable in only a minority of cases. Therefore, we fully support the strategy's objectives, which are:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To develop effective mechanisms for detection, surveillance, monitoring and responding to any invasive threats posed by both new and established non-native species ... To minimise and manage the negative impact of established non-native species in a cost effective manner.\"</p><p>Until now, there has been no cohesive approach to tackling the problem. It is clearly important that existing powers be used more effectively through better liaison and co-ordination between the bodies that have the appropriate powers.</p><p>It may also prove necessary to modify legislation to allow a more coherent and comprehensive approach to tackling invasive non-native species. We will look carefully at any legislative proposals by the Government in the future. In that regard, Scottish Conservatives want to see a particular legislative adjustment, to which Jamie McGrigor referred in his intervention. I hope that the Scottish National Party Government will be sympathetic to it. We very much regret that, when the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill went through Parliament last year, the opportunity was not seized to put in place robust measures to prevent the deadly Gyrodactylus salaris parasite from reaching Scotland.

The cabinet secretary said in a recent news release that, should the parasite ever arrive in Scotland, it could result in a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"collapse in our iconic, valuable and important salmon angling heritage.\"</p><p>We still think that there should be a requirement to declare potentially contaminated fishing gear and to decontaminate such gear at ports of entry.

Thus, it was essential that disruptions to the norm were kept to an absolute minimum while, at the same time, a science base was adopted.</p><p>Sadly&#8212;as we heard in the recent parliamentary debate on hill farming and as is highlighted in the excellent reports from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Agricultural College&#8212;economic conditions for our sheep farmers and crofters have deteriorated since last year. The Scottish Government's immediate focus must be on doing whatever it can to support that very fragile sector, which is experiencing the loss of critical mass in sheep numbers in many areas.</p><p>The report's recommendations on the development of a risk hierarchy for priority movements based on veterinary assessment and a review of Scotland's foot-and-mouth disease contingency plan to ensure that it is fit for purpose are both commonsense proposals that we look to ministers and officials to deliver without delay.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives also welcome the priority that the report gives to regionalisation. We recognise that complexities are involved, but <place-holder colnum=\"11513\"/> regionalisation is desired by our farmers and crofters. It is important that preparations are made now so that the groundwork is completed. Given that regionalisation will involve working closely with other UK Administrations and the EU Commission, I welcome the fact that the cabinet secretary has already engaged with the Commission on the issue. I hope that he will continue to press the EU and the UK Government on regionalisation. If Scotland could maintain its export status in the event of a future outbreak in the south of England, that would be a huge lifeline for our farming sector.</p><p>We share the concern about the lack of clarity about which Administration has responsibility for key areas, particularly funding. We fully support the recommendation that existing concordats are urgently reviewed and that financial arrangements are made clear. However, to answer Jim Hume and to follow on from what John Scott touched on in his opening speech, because we are reluctant to pre-empt the outcome of the Calman commission's continuing work, we, like Labour, will not support the Liberal Democrat amendment. It is essential, however, that we get clarity in those areas and that the lines of responsibility are as open and as clear as possible to all stakeholders. We are happy to support Labour's amendment, which focuses on the problems still facing the pig industry and on the benefits that remote and rural Scotland could derive from the return of local abattoirs.</p><p>Most farmers and crofters in Scotland felt that communication was strong during last year's outbreak. The Conservative party is grateful for the efforts made by the cabinet secretary and the chief veterinary officer to keep us informed as the outbreak progressed. Nevertheless, we agree with the report that the communications strategy should be updated to take account of the recommendations and that the most modern technology should be used to ensure that communications are as smooth as possible.</p><p>It is pleasing that the generally consensual tone of the debate reflects the welcome that most people in the agricultural sector and all related stakeholders gave to the Scudamore report's publication earlier in the year. We all undoubtedly hope that we will not see a recurrence of the devastating foot-and-mouth disease in the future. However, implementing the report's recommendations should go a long way towards making Scotland as well prepared as possible to deal with an outbreak in the most effective way and allow normality to return to the sector as speedily as possible after an outbreak is confirmed.</p><p>Given the severe economic pressures that currently face farmers and crofters, it is vital that <place-holder colnum=\"11514\"/> they can feel confident that the Government has in place all the necessary systems and procedures to minimise the impact of any future outbreak.

It is fair to say that all members of the Public Petitions Committee were deeply moved by the bravery of the couple, <place-holder colnum=\"11337\"/> who, in the final stages of Mr Gray's illness, put so much effort into their petition, which aimed to secure a better experience in future for patients who suffer from terminal cancer and might benefit from drugs that are not approved for the NHS formulary. Mr Gray's evidence was delivered in a straightforward, unemotional way, as indeed was Tina McGeever's evidence when she returned to the committee a few weeks after her husband's death. That made a deep impact on committee members.</p><p>A number of important issues for the Government to take forward arose from the inquiry. If the end result is more clarity of procedure, more patient involvement and more support for people who are faced with terminal cancer, that will be a well deserved and fitting legacy for Mr Gray.</p><p>All five key areas that the Public Petitions Committee examined led to requests for Government responses. I welcome the cabinet secretary's sensitive and constructive reaction to much of what we put to her. The first area to be explored was that of defining the roles of and interplay between the bodies that are involved in appraising the clinical and cost effectiveness of a licensed cancer treatment drug. Although the committee was struck by the numbers and tiers involved in the process, we were reassured by witnesses that roles are well defined and have minimal overlap and that the system is clearly understood. However, the Patients Association thought that more transparency was needed in the appraisal process, specifically at local level, and the committee wanted to know how Government would improve the system and involve patients more at that level.</p><p>In that regard, it is interesting to note that a citizens jury that was set up by Breakthrough Breast Cancer regarded it as vital that all patients receive clear and realistic information on the true benefits, risks and limitations of new treatment so that they can make fully informed decisions on their treatment pathway. We hope that those issues will be addressed in the forthcoming better cancer care plan and that good practice at local level will be rolled out across Scotland.</p><p>On the issue of guidance to NHS boards, there is some doubt about whether the guidance is applied consistently and equally across all boards, despite the Scottish Government's expectation that health boards and clinicians should take full account of SMC advice and guidance from NHS QIS in light of any subsequent NICE multiple technology appraisal. The committee believes that more clarity is needed on how the Government monitors its expectation of health board compliance.<place-holder colnum=\"11338\"/></p><p>We were also concerned by the SMC assertion that it could not assess the uptake of its advice across Scotland because of inadequate data gathering. The current lack of data prevents the identification of areas where difficulties exist and where improvements could be made. All NHS boards would welcome a national data gathering system. It is encouraging to note that the Government's response to this section of the committee report states that steps are being taken to ensure that appropriate data are gathered, analysed and used to inform decision making.</p><p>Those roles of definition, guidance and data collection are clearly important in the equitable provision of approved and appropriate cancer drugs throughout the country. It is only right that patients receive the best recommended treatment available from the NHS.</p><p>The main focus of the committee's inquiry, in the light of Michael Gray's experience, was on the issue of exceptional prescribing, which comes into play when the SMC and the ADTCs have assessed that a drug should not be made available on the NHS, but the patient's clinician considers that the drug could benefit the patient and should be prescribed. NHS boards should have protocols in place to consider requests for non-formulary treatment, but the evidence that we received suggests that the procedure is not patient friendly and lacks equity and consistency across health boards. At a time when patients and their families are distressed and often bewildered by the realisation that they face a terminal illness, they need clear information, guidance and advice that lays out the options available to them. The patient and the clinician should be involved at every stage in the process of consideration as to whether a non-formulary drug is to be funded.</p><p>The committee believes that there should be a more consistent approach to non-formulary prescribing across health boards, with better communication between the board, the patient and the clinician. The process could be helped by the appointment of a liaison officer to guide the patient through the exceptional prescribing process. I welcome the cabinet secretary's commitment to consider that suggestion.</p><p>We also need unambiguous guidance on co-payments. For patients such as Michael Gray, who chose to pay for a non-formulary drug, the cost of the drug may be relatively inexpensive but the associated NHS costs can mean that the entire episode of treatment becomes prohibitively expensive. Of course, such issues are complex and involve financial, ethical, moral and clinical factors that need to be considered. Therefore, I very much welcome the cabinet secretary's stated intention to initiate a review of the guidance on co-payments. I also endorse Cathy Jamieson's <place-holder colnum=\"11339\"/> comments. Co-payments are an issue of increasing concern, particularly in the treatment of advanced cancer, and are already being looked at south of the border. I hope that the results of the on-going reviews in England will be considered by the cabinet secretary in the course of her review.</p><p>In conclusion, the Public Petitions Committee's inquiry has revealed some extremely important and complex issues. If those can be resolved to ensure a smoother pathway of care for people like Michael Gray, the efforts of that brave man and his wife will have made an enormous contribution to terminal care in 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14037918", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cancer Drug Access"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I fully endorse the comments of Frank McAveety and other members about the late Michael Gray and his wife, Tina McGeever.

The consultation is timely, given the serious challenges that our hill farmers face. We welcome the Government's stated commitment to work in partnership with stakeholders across the range of issues that threaten the sustainability of agriculture in our hill areas and more remote communities.</p><p>At his presentation, Professor McCrone expressed a very real anger about the UK Labour Government's recommendation to end direct support for farming after 2013. Despite comments from Labour members this morning, it seems incredible that the proposal has been put to the EU without either an assessment of the implications for farming in various parts of the UK having been made or any discussion having been held with the various devolved Administrations. The Conservatives have always suspected that Labour has scant regard for farming and rural communities. The Labour Government recommendation shows that the party is as out of touch as ever.</p><p>We have a number of concerns on the CAP. Clearly, Scotland is losing out on pillar 2 funding for rural development&#8212;we have by far and away the lowest EU allocation. Professor McCrone stressed that it is inexcusable for the UK Government not to have negotiated to resolve that funding anomaly. In saying that, I am not recommending the independence that SNP members advance in the debate; I am saying that it is time that we had an effective UK Government.</p><p>We agree with Sarah Boyack's remarks that single farm payments should be allocated to those who are actively farming. The current system actively discourages new entrants.</p><p>The SRDP has also come in for criticism, not least for the bureaucratic burden that it places on many land managers who are deterred from applying because of the complexity and high cost of making applications. There is also the fact that the application procedure depends on someone having access to broadband technology, an issue that Jamie McGrigor and other Conservative members have highlighted in the Parliament on a number of occasions, so far without effect. Indeed, many stakeholders have raised the issue with us.</p><p>As a number of speakers have said, a coherent, strategic approach needs to be taken to rural issues. Recognition has to be given to the fact that <place-holder colnum=\"10967\"/> our primary producers are central to ensuring the long-term capacity and capability of our food supply. Alongside food security, other land use considerations such as alternative energy, biodiversity, forestry and housing need to be addressed in a fully integrated and balanced way. As Roseanna Cunningham pointed out, those areas must not be viewed in isolation. We need to look at introducing less restrictive planning policies that would allow new rural housing to be built to accommodate retiring farmers and new entrants. Current practice is undoubtedly a serious obstacle to the sustainable development of farming, not least in parts of rural Aberdeenshire.</p><p>Fuel costs and the necessity of upgrading key strategic roads such as the A9 and A96 need to be addressed. Instead of pursuing the current post office closure programme&#8212;again, negotiated under the Labour Government&#8212;we should be pursuing an expansion of the range of services that rural post offices offer. We need to retain rural schools and return to the regional focus on tourism that we saw in the day of area tourist boards&#8212;that would ensure benefits. All those issues need to be addressed.</p><p>I commend to those who have not yet read it the report of our food security task force. Its recommendations are based on consultation with a number of leading agricultural and conservation organisations and are aimed at safeguarding our farming industry. The report makes interesting reading.</p><p>Food security is becoming a global problem. It is vital for our future that we do all that we can to ensure a sustainable and thriving agricultural industry. We all want to secure the future of our rural communities; I hope that we will all work together to achieve it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14004885", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Less Favoured Areas"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As John Scott clearly stated, we wish to see those payments brought forward as soon as practicably possible.

I will pursue a different line. It is clear that there is serious concern among people who think that they need to fill their staffing gap from the Indian sub-continent, but is that as much a cultural issue as it is an immigration issue? Is there a similar problem with ethnic chefs from outside the Commonwealth, for whom entry to the UK is even more problematic?

I accept that that is unlikely to be replicated in Scotland, with our smaller ethnic population, but I see no reason why our further education establishments, such as Aberdeen College, should not offer similar opportunities and so talk up the benefits of training as a chef specialising in Asian cooking.</p><p>Clearly, that would not be a quick fix, and the case needs to be made strongly to those who control immigration that skilled chefs from the sub-continent are needed to support the Indian catering industry in Aberdeen and elsewhere in the UK.

The Conservative party warmly welcomes the report and we share the committee's view that the Government should fully consider the recommendations that the report contains before it introduces its proposed bill on flooding and flood management.</p><p>Flooding and flood prevention have moved up the political agenda in recent years as awareness of the impact of climate change has grown and in the aftermath of some high-profile instances of severe flooding, notably, but by no means exclusively, in England. The devastation caused by flooding is hard to comprehend and goes way beyond the material losses sustained by those who are affected by it. The other evening, I watched a report on television about the on-going clear-up after last year's major flooding in the north of England and was particularly moved by the comment from one Hull resident, who said, \"You don't have to die to lose your life.\" Clearly, the emotional impact of flooding remains for a long time and the fear of further flooding is ever with those affected. I am pleased that the report highlights that and stresses the need for the Government to ensure that proper support is available to those in crisis.</p><p>The risk maps that SEPA published last year indicate that flooding is a very real threat to nearly 100,000 properties in Scotland and it is predicted that floods that are currently considered extreme are set to become more common in the future, with water surges threatening our coastal defences and causing surface flooding with which our urban drainage systems will struggle to cope.</p><p>There is an urgency about long-term planning, with an emphasis on sustainable flood management, because although the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 placed a duty on ministers, SEPA and responsible authorities to promote that, there has been little change in practical terms, with most councils still reacting to flooding by providing hard-engineered flood defence systems locally, rather than trying to manage flood risk at catchment level by working with the natural environment rather than against it.</p><p>It is concerning to learn from the report that the number of properties subject to rain-induced flooding is not known because work to map and <place-holder colnum=\"10203\"/> address pluvial flooding has not yet been undertaken in Scotland due to a lack of appropriate authority or funding. It is also worrying that there is a shortage of hydrological expertise in Scotland, which is likely to get worse as demand for flood risk management grows, unless greater numbers of students can be induced to study science, engineering and technology at school and in college and university.</p><p>There is widespread agreement that catchment-based flood management is the way ahead, as it allows a more integrated, holistic approach to be taken. There is also recognition that the highly complex legislation dealing with flooding and flood management needs simplification.</p><p>We agree with the report's recommendation that there should be one body that is charged with drawing together and co-ordinating whole-river catchment plans and coastal defence strategies, and that SEPA is ideally placed to be that competent authority. We note with interest the comments regarding a future role for Scottish Water in the management of pluvial flooding.</p><p>I am particularly concerned that planning and building regulations should be adequately enforced, in agreement with current policies that state that built development should not take place on functional flood plains, and with regard to Scottish planning policy 7, which requires developers and planning authorities to consider the possibility of all forms of flooding so that they can ensure that new developments are free of significant flood risk and will not increase flood risk elsewhere in the catchment or increase the need for flood prevention measures.</p><p>In that context, I am appalled that Aberdeen's new local plan, approved only yesterday after a long, convoluted and much delayed process, includes within land designated for residential development an area of ground in the Loirsbank part of my former council ward that is a known flood plain and was previously designated as green belt.</p><p>The proposal for that change of use was hotly disputed within the council. It was opposed vociferously by many local residents and unanimously by all three local councillors. However, it was eventually approved by a majority on the council and, sadly, endorsed by Government ministers.</p><p>I know that any future planning permission will be subject to a satisfactory flood risk assessment, but to have designated that area as residential is almost unbelievable, given that existing houses, set further back from the River Dee than any future new development would be, already carry loaded insurance premiums because of the known <place-holder colnum=\"10204\"/> flood risk. I sincerely hope that such folly will not be repeated elsewhere in Scotland.</p><p>My party notes and welcomes the report's recommendations on the need for a more streamlined process for the approval of flood management schemes, agrees that investment planning needs to be long term, with provision for updating in every parliamentary session, and welcomes the comments on flood warnings, weather radar and emergency responses. Those elements of the report complete a thorough, painstaking exercise whose recommendations, if eventually enshrined in new legislation, should make the prevention and management of future flooding in Scotland a simpler, more effective and more sustainable process.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13780521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flooding and Flood Management"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Rural Affairs and Environment Committee is to be congratulated on a thorough and timely piece of work, which coincides with the Government's consultation on flooding.

It is important that we discuss how to reduce the unsustainably high levels of waste, including waste packaging, that we still produce in Scotland.</p><p>I agree 100 per cent with the thrust of the motion but have not signed it because I have minor concerns about one or two of the specific points in it. Although there is no doubt that waste is still increasing, we have a responsibility not to exaggerate, and to describe the increase in waste levels as exponential is just a little bit excessive. <place-holder colnum=\"9581\"/></p><p>However, we undoubtedly need to tackle the waste problem, and the Scottish Conservatives are fully behind the Government's zero-waste target.</p><p>Packaging contributes significantly to waste. Food, drink, toys and household equipment all come with various amounts of packaging. Sometimes it can be easily removed and disposed of, but some of it is bulky and requires considerable ingenuity to unwrap, let alone get rid of&#8212;as Christine Grahame has just described so vividly.</p><p>There is a growing awareness that something needs to be done about packaging. I found the statistics provided in the Scottish Retail Consortium's briefing for the debate, which I am sure other members have read, reasonably encouraging. Public demand is beginning to drive commercial activity on packaging, and a number of supermarkets, including Asda, are starting to drive home the message by charging for plastic bags or encouraging the recycling or reuse of those that we already have. I was shamed into taking my old bags to Asda just last week, as I had forgotten the week before and was challenged on it.</p><p>I feel that the voluntary approach to reducing waste packaging is the way forward, as is demonstrated by the support of many retailers for voluntary company and sector initiatives through WRAP, which aims to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste. I have a second slight quibble with Jim Hume's motion: although I would be very keen for waste points to be provided in supermarkets, I think that doing so should be voluntary and that they should be provided on the initiative of the supermarkets.</p><p>The appalling scale of food wastage in Scottish households has recently been highlighted and must be tackled. It borders on the criminal that 40 per cent of the food that is put into the supply chain is wasted, lost or thrown out unused, with one third of the food that we buy being discarded as waste.</p><p>Plastic packaging still causes major problems on our beaches, where there is more plastic litter than ever before. I have taken part in the past two annual litter picks at Forvie sands, near Ellon in Aberdeenshire, and have been appalled at the amount of litter that we have gathered&#8212;there have been bags and bags of it. It has included plastic bags, cans, cartons, tissues and fuel containers&#8212;all sorts of rubbish, much of it plastic, discarded by irresponsible people onshore or at sea. Not only is it extremely unsightly, but it poses a major threat to coastal wildlife, with many seabirds and mammals killed each year by ingesting it. Back in April, we said:<place-holder colnum=\"9582\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is high time that we had a national strategy to tackle beach rubbish\".</p><p>I reiterate that call today, and I would like to hear the minister's reaction to that.</p><p>We also need to consider what else can be done to encourage individual responsibility for litter disposal, as the eco-schools programme does for children. Anyone who has visited an eco-school cannot fail to be impressed by the responsible attitude of the pupils, who have learned about the local environment and understand why they should not drop litter. Perhaps their parents and grandparents need to follow their example.</p><p>Waste, including waste packaging, is a serious problem. I am glad that a number of bodies are considering ways of redesigning and reducing packaging and that many larger retailers are beginning to respond to customer demand for that. There is a long way to go but, as public awareness increases, and particularly as the cost of food continues to rise, there might eventually be a reduction in the amount of discarded food and packaging. It is incumbent on us to lead the way and to support any initiatives that will contribute to that.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13736391", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Excess Packaging"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Jim Hume on securing the debate.

We are, after all, discussing a series of <place-holder colnum=\"9131\"/> proposals that could have a significant impact on the future of Scottish agriculture.</p><p>We welcome the Government's stated intention to consult not only on the EU's CAP health check proposal but on the longer-term implementation of CAP in Scotland to ensure a sustainable and competitive agricultural industry that allows farmers to play a full part in growing our economy and contributing to food security through food production and which, at the same time, lets them manage the land that provides their living in a way that sustains and enhances the environment and biodiversity that are so important to Scotland's heritage and tourism industry.</p><p>Given the growing global concern over food security, it is quite likely&#8212;and, indeed, is the NFUS's belief&#8212;that in the longer term farmers will be required to produce food as a priority. Therefore, it will be important to sustain the industry's viability until that time.</p><p>We are all aware of the difficulties that farmers have faced in recent years in achieving a realistic farm gate price for commodities such as milk. The NFUS is rightly concerned with ensuring that any altered system of CAP support to farmers does not distort the market and give retailers a further excuse to reduce the price that they pay to them. Moreover, farmers must be given the incentive to develop their businesses and increase not only their viability but their profitability by reducing the costs of food production or by adding value before food goes to market.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives have been at the forefront of the food security debate. We led a chamber debate on it only a few weeks ago and, months before that, John Scott said on record:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"current thinking suggests Europe will need in future not just to return to self sufficiency, but also to grow food for other parts of the world's population as well.\"</p><p>He added:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"with world grain stocks at their lowest since World War 2 and food price inflation increasing, farmers must be given incentives to increase food production to meet growing local and worldwide demand.\"</p><p>As a result, this mid-term review of the CAP comes at a particularly important time for Scotland's farmers, and we welcome a number of proposals in it.</p><p>I do not intend to go into much detail on those proposals, which have been well aired by speaker after speaker this morning. I should point out that the only aggressive input came&#8212;as usual&#8212;from Mr Rumbles on my left. However, as Jamie McGrigor and others have stressed, the key issue is that given the disproportionate reduction in profitability caused by modulation increases, any increase in EU-wide compulsory modulation must be matched by a corresponding reduction in <place-holder colnum=\"9132\"/> voIuntary modulation. I realise that that view is not accepted by everyone; indeed, in its briefing, the RSPB makes it clear that it sees it as a threat to rural development funding. However, in our opinion, it is vital in ensuring a level playing field for all EU member states.</p><p>We also reject any plan to introduce progressive modulation of higher payments, as such a move would undoubtedly put Scotland, with its higher proportion of large farm units, at a competitive disadvantage within the EU and would threaten good jobs in the various rural communities that are supported by large and efficient farm businesses.</p><p>Although the proposals to abolish set-aside are welcome, we must not lose the gains in biodiversity that resulted from the policy. As Peter Peacock pointed out, careful thought will have to be put into efforts to retain them. We also welcome the move towards abolishing milk quotas by 2015, and any measures that might benefit beef and sheep production in the most fragile areas of Scotland will also have to be given careful consideration.</p><p>However, as John Scott has made clear, we are not yet willing to accept a move from the historic basis of farm support to an area-based single farm payment. We believe that any such approach should be taken only after careful consideration and that, if it should happen, there should be a very gradual phasing-out.</p><p>We welcome many aspects of the CAP health check proposals. We need a proper level playing field across the EU, with support for rural and environmental development to ensure a fair deal for our farmers, who, despite producing food of a quality that, as Rob Gibson pointed out, is internationally recognised, still have to shoulder huge burdens of regulation and European red tape. I hope that one outcome of the health check will be to stop the Government interference that inhibits farmers from doing what they want to do and indeed what they do best: producing food.</p><p>We, Europe and&#8212;increasingly&#8212;the world need a successful and thriving agricultural industry, and we must fight for it in Scotland. We look forward to the consultation and hope that one of the outcomes will be, as the motion states, to ensure</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that agriculture remains a dynamic and competitive industry with farmers playing their full part in achieving ... sustainable economic growth through food production and environmental management of our agricultural land.\"</p><p>I hope that our amendment will receive Parliament's support at decision time.

Since I entered Parliament five years ago, my focus and that of many others has been on the frightening increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in our population, following what is almost an epidemic of obesity that affects younger and younger age groups. Because type 2 diabetes is such a great public health concern, it is easy to forget that the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scotland is among the highest in the world.</p><p>As we know, diabetics depend on a successful insulin regime to keep their blood glucose under control. The better and more consistent the control is, the less likely it is that they will suffer the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes, such as retinopathy, arterial disease and renal failure. Many people adapt to their changed lifestyles after diagnosis without too many problems, but others find it hard to achieve a normal blood glucose level and fluctuate widely between hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, both of which are dangerous for the patient in different ways.</p><p>There appears to be no doubt that better control of blood sugar, with fewer fluctuations and complications, can be achieved by many people who use insulin pumps, and that the quality of life of patients and their families is improved as a result. As David Stewart said, children in particular have been shown to adapt well to the use of insulin pump technology.</p><p>Clearly, any device that can improve blood-glucose control in diabetes will lead to long-term benefit, not only to the patient's health and wellbeing but also to the NHS, which will be faced <place-holder colnum=\"8833\"/> with fewer complications to treat, and will experience reduced hospital admissions and less medical staff time being used in primary, secondary and tertiary health care settings.</p><p>Not every type 1 diabetic is considered suitable for, or wants, an insulin pump, but even under the fairly stringent eligibility criteria that have been recommended by NICE, which are currently under review, there are significantly fewer pump users in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, and many fewer than in the diabetic populations of the rest of the European Union and in the United States. Now that all health boards in Scotland have strategies in place for prescribing insulin pumps, their use is on the increase, but there is still significant regional disparity in the provision of pumps. Many more people could benefit from them.</p><p>The pumps do not come without cost, and their effectiveness depends on a sufficient number of health practitioners having been trained to support patients in their use. However, the long-term savings could be very significant. It is indeed a spend-to-save provision that concurrently leads to improved quality of life for successful users of the technology.</p><p>Several recent members' debates have illustrated the patchy provision of life-enhancing equipment in Scotland. There was Trish Godman's debate on wheelchair provision, mine on alternative and augmentative communication aids, Alison McInnes's on school book provision visually impaired pupils, and now David Stewart's on the availability of insulin pumps. All those debates have concerned people for whom improved provision would make a huge difference to the quality of their lives. I am sure that there are many other long-term conditions for which treatment could be improved by technology or by more specialist nurses or other staff within the community.</p><p>Taken together, the improved quality of life for many people, and the resultant decrease in use of highly specialist secondary and tertiary NHS facilities and other public services, could only be of long-term benefit to our society, both physically and financially.</p><p>In supporting David Stewart's plea for greater provision of insulin pumps, I suggest to the cabinet secretary that a good deal of work needs to be done by, and with, the Long-term Conditions Alliance Scotland, to consider how provision could be improved across the board, with the ultimate goal of eliminating postcode lotteries in Scotland and improving the quality of life for all patients with chronic conditions who currently receive less than optimum care&#8212;including type 1 diabetics.

Thankfully, no decisions on the report's recommendations will be made today, and before the Government decides where it wants to go with crofting we should have ample time to give detailed consideration to a comprehensive report that appears to have the backing of the majority of people who live in the crofting communities.</p><p>The Crofting Reform etc Bill, which was passed by the Parliament in January last year, was very different from what was introduced by the Scottish Executive in March 2006, but it was less than radical and it did not deal adequately with the deep-seated problems surrounding crofting, the most notable of which was probably the sale of crofting land. As most members have said, Professor Shucksmith and his colleagues are to be commended for taking on board the concerns of all the stakeholders in the crofting communities in producing the radical proposals that are contained in the report. It is up to the Government to decide whether it, too, will listen to the crofting communities and follow through with the report's recommendations. It is unfortunate that the previous Executive did not engage effectively with those communities and other interests before proceeding to legislation. However, we now&#8212;at last&#8212;have a vision for crofting, which had not been developed when the flawed bill was introduced.</p><p>Various aspects of the report have been commented on by members across the chamber. I will not mention them in detail, but I think that they have given weight to what the minister said when he was presented with the report on Monday and what he emphasised again today. He said&#8212;I think that I am quoting him more or less accurately&#8212;that rural communities must be supported and developed as a priority; that crofting makes a unique and significant contribution to remote and rural areas; that it delivers environmental benefits and has a pivotal role in the cultural landscape of <place-holder colnum=\"8653\"/> the Highlands and Islands, which is famous worldwide; that it does not exist in global isolation; and that it must be capable of offering a viable and fulfilling way of life for future generations. We agree with those comments by the minister and, by and large, we agree with the report's recommendations, although we must give careful consideration to the detail of them.</p><p>We think that it is right that no change should be made to the rights that were given to individual crofters in the Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886&#8212;security of tenure, fair rents and the value of their improvements, as the minister said earlier. We also agree that those rights should be enjoyed only by those who have a commitment to crofting and who live on or near their croft, using the land beneficially as the report suggests. We agree with the proposal that croft houses should be tied to residency and we will, therefore, give serious consideration to the suggestion that the 1,700-plus absentee crofters who are scattered throughout the world should be made to forfeit the rights that were handed down to them by the original act. To prevent a rush to avoid the provisions of any forthcoming legislation, we support the suggestion that the introduction of a real burden to all assignations and purchases be backdated to the date of the report's publication&#8212;12 May this year.</p><p>Simplification of the accumulated legislation governing crofting is long overdue, and Shucksmith's proposals provide the opportunity to bring that about. It seems sensible to split the regulatory and enforcement role of the Crofters Commission from the development side of crofting, so we accept that careful consideration should be given to the possible replacement of the commission with the proposed federation of crofting boards, whose component local crofting boards would have the power to suspend the right to buy if that appeared to be in the wider interests of the community. That would help to overcome the undoubted abuse of the legitimate right to buy in crofting areas, which was the main reason why the Scottish Conservatives opposed the extension of crofting outwith the original crofting counties unless the right to buy was suspended in those areas. The proposal to give responsibility for the development side of crofting to a new crofting and community development body within Highlands and Islands Enterprise is interesting and could be a sensible way forward. It is certainly worth considering.</p><p>We welcome measures that will encourage new entrants to crofting and discourage decrofting. In the interests of some of the most beautiful and best-loved parts of Scotland's landscape, it is vital to support local communities and encourage them to develop but also to continue with the activities that, over many years, have sustained a way of life that has preserved some of our environmental <place-holder colnum=\"8654\"/> treasures, which would otherwise be at serious risk.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had a useful debate, following the publication on Monday of the Shucksmith report on crofting, which was commissioned by the previous Executive in September 2006 after brutal criticism of the bill that was introduced by Ross Finnie in that year.

Sadly, in 21 <sup>st</sup> century Scotland, a significant number of our fellow citizens daily experience such desperation and frustration.</p><p>The device that I have just used to open my speech is a modern and sophisticated talking machine. It is one of a range of alternative and augmentative communication aids that includes simple picture boards and sign and even personal body languages. The aids can be used either to augment speech or as an alternative to speech and writing for people who have difficulties with communication.</p><p>While I used the machine to highlight the debate, I had hoped that there would be some people in the public gallery for whom AAC is the difference between complete isolation and the ability to make meaningful contact with their families, friends and the outside world. Unfortunately, those people could not make it this evening, but I am delighted that a number of specialist speech and language therapists have come to hear the debate. I know that all members in the chamber will welcome their presence.</p><p>Earlier today, I was privileged to meet several younger AAC users from Crossford primary <place-holder colnum=\"8349\"/> school, who came along to show that difficulties with communication can affect all age groups.</p><p>I was very happy to lodge the motion on behalf of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. In partnership with Capability Scotland and the augmentative communication in practice group, the RCSLT has been leading a campaign called give us our right to communicate. I am grateful to the 43 MSPs who supported the motion.</p><p>There are an estimated 2,500 potential AAC users in Scotland. They range from pre-school children to elderly people, and they suffer from a wide variety of conditions, such as learning difficulties, cerebral palsy, autism, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease or head injury or are post-laryngectomy because of head or neck cancers. For all those people, AAC can make a huge difference to their quality of life, and allow them to express themselves, to have more control over their lives and to take part in activities at school and in their communities.</p><p>For AAC to work effectively, its users need two things&#8212;appropriate communication aids, and specialist and on-going speech and language therapy. The communication aids must match the user's communication support needs, which can change over time&#8212;for instance, as a child grows up or as a degenerative condition such as motor neurone disease gets worse.</p><p>With a limited number of potential users, the cost of equipment is not massive in public sector terms. Low-technology aids such as picture boards cost only the time that the therapist spends designing and making them, and the high-technology talking aids cost from &#163;100 up to around &#163;6,000 for the one that I have here, plus the on-going cost of insurance and maintenance.</p><p>On top of that, specialist speech and language therapists are required to assess communication needs, to identify the best aid for the individual, to design and produce simple aids, and to programme the high-tech aids with the language that the user needs to cope with education, work and social situations. Of course, users and the carers, teachers, employers and others who are involved in their lives need support to get the most benefit out of the equipment.</p><p>Unfortunately, at present, only around one person in six who could benefit from alternative and augmentative communication aids can access specialist AAC services in Scotland. Even when an aid is provided, there is often an unacceptably long wait between assessment and provision. Health boards throughout Scotland have recently had their AAC services rated according to funding procedures; budgets to loan, purchase, insure and <place-holder colnum=\"8350\"/> maintain communication aids; the availability of dedicated local speech and language therapy; and contracts with specialist AAC centres. Eight out of the 15 health boards&#8212;including NHS Tayside and NHS Grampian, the two in my region&#8212;have been found wanting and are rated as poor. In such areas, people can wait months or years for assessment and the aid and support that they require. In other areas, there is no wait at all between assessment and provision. Once again, Scotland has a postcode lottery of provision.</p><p>Services for children tend to be better than those for adults, but provision can fall short when the children move on from school and lose funding from the education budget. Funding tends to be erratic: sometimes it comes from the education authority, sometimes from the national health service and sometimes from a combination of both. Budgets are small, and money for the purchase of new aids often comes from ad hoc, competitive streams such as end-of-year money at the end of the financial year, so a patient is more likely to get their aid if their need is identified in January rather than September. Provision also varies according to disability and advocacy, with charities and a diverse range of statutory providers giving different degrees of support, hence the campaign to develop and implement a Scotland-wide AAC strategy to achieve a national standard of specialist provision.</p><p>The right to communicate is an equal opportunities issue; it is a recognised human right. That point has been stressed vehemently by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland, Kathleen Marshall, who has been highly supportive of the efforts that are being made to improve AAC provision throughout Scotland.</p><p>I am hopeful that the campaign will bear fruit, because the Scottish National Party Government has accepted the recommendation of the disability working group&#8212;which the previous Executive set up&#8212;that there is a need for adequate support and equipment to access education. That is backed up by the tenor of some of the comments in \"Better Health, Better Care\". Also, following a recent report by the Scottish Executive social research unit on communication support needs and its recommendations for further research into the problems that people with such needs, including AAC users, face, the Government said that it hoped to respond this spring with plans to address the issues that have been raised.</p><p>I hope that the debate has come at an opportune time. The campaigners, including a young AAC user from Dumfries and Galloway, are looking forward to their meeting with the minister to discuss AAC provision next week. I congratulate all the people who have worked hard to raise the profile of AAC, which is highly important for a <place-holder colnum=\"8351\"/> small but significant number of our fellow citizens.

During that election, the Scottish National Party pledged to lead a step change to bring our beleaguered transport network into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, including the dualling of the A96 and A90. I hope that that pledge will soon be acted on.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives have a long-standing commitment to the dualling of the A96 and a positive record of delivering for the communities that the road serves. For the record, the previous Conservative Government delivered the Huntly, Inverurie and Kintore bypasses, as well as the dualling of the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverurie, as the starting point for the dualling of the road between Aberdeen and Inverness.<place-holder colnum=\"7530\"/></p><p>Like my Highlands and Islands Conservative colleagues, I support the call for a bypass for the city of Elgin. The recent announcements on progressing the bypasses at Fochabers and Mostoddloch are welcome. However, those developments alone, which were already in Transport Scotland's road infrastructure programme prior to last May, do not go far enough to address the dangers of the A96 or the transport infrastructure improvements that are desperately needed by Elgin and the communities along the A96 corridor.</p><p>I recently contacted Transport Scotland to find out what timescale the new SNP Government had set out to undertake a study into dualling the A96. Its response stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"MTRIPS is undertaking a study into the dualling of the A96 between Inverness and Inverness Airport\".</p><p>There was no mention of any other dualling studies on the A96. Anyone who regularly uses the road will agree that it is a joke that the main road connecting the two great cities of Aberdeen and Inverness grinds to a halt at the bottleneck at the Inveramsay bridge, north of Inverurie. That situation will soon get even worse, with the instalment of another two sets of traffic lights in Keith, solely for the access to the new Tesco store in the town.</p><p>As I said, the recent announcements on the Fochabers and Mosstodloch bypasses are welcome. However, welcome as those are for the Moray communities, they expose the greater need for the community of Keith to have a bypass. In fact, just glancing at a map of the north-east, what shows up starkly is that only the communities of Keith, Elgin and Nairn are without bypasses. Just over a year ago, prior to the election, I lodged a motion calling on the previous Scottish Executive to reinstate plans for a Keith bypass. I was pleased that my motion attracted cross-party support, including that of fellow North East Scotland MSP Maureen Watt.

It is my sincere belief that good palliative care that takes the fear and pain out of dying is far better than exploring the route to euthanasia and legally assisted suicide. I know of very few people in the health care professions who believe that we should be heading down that route. I very much agree with the BMA's opposition to assisted dying, backed by a large majority of its members.

However, I cannot help feeling sad that the reputation of a health service that has achieved so much for so many patients has been blighted by a problem that, to a large degree, is preventable. There have always been patients who have developed wound infections following surgery, and cross-infection has always been an issue. However, many people now live into frail and advanced old age; large numbers of patients are on treatments that impair their immunity; many more invasive procedures are routinely carried out in a variety of clinical settings; and many people expect to be given antibiotics for the most minor of ailments, whether or not there is a proven scientific need for them. <place-holder colnum=\"7339\"/></p><p>As a result, it is hardly surprising that HAIs have become a significant problem.</p><p>As infecting organisms increasingly develop resistance to antibiotics, it is important to try to prevent infections in the first place. Such attempts will be successful only if people work together and constantly bear in mind the need to avoid passing infections on from person to person. There must be awareness of how to prevent infections at all levels of health care and in all clinical settings.</p><p>Almost all health professionals of my vintage bemoan the informality and apparent lack of discipline in today's NHS compared with what happened when we started our careers. We all have tales of belligerent ward sisters whose eyes were everywhere and who would pick up the slightest infringement of the strict disciplinary code of the ward&#8212;a code of efficiency and cleanliness. In those days, no pieces of fluff were seen under beds or in corridors and bedpans and urine bottles were disposed of immediately. Any visitor or doctor who sat on a patient's bed could expect an explosion of wrath and visitors were strictly kept to their visiting hours. No more than two visitors were allowed around a bed unless the patient was close to death. White coats and uniforms were for wearing inside hospitals; we never saw nurses, physiotherapists, radiographers and suchlike in uniform in buses or shops. There was constant polishing and cleaning, and there was obsessive tidiness in general. Perhaps such an approach is old-fashioned, but it seemed to work. I will be honest: I do not recall huge emphasis being put on hand hygiene then, except, of course, when people were preparing for invasive procedures, when they were thorough and meticulous. However, MRSA was not endemic in the population then and few organisms were resistant to antibiotics.</p><p>As Ian McKee highlighted, life in the NHS was less pressurised in those days. Managers did not breathe down people's necks to push more and more patients more rapidly through the system, and the turnover of beds was slower. Time was taken to clean and fumigate all equipment thoroughly between patients' use of it. Things have now changed and it is even more important to run a tight ship, with rigid control of hygiene at institutional and personal level. Therefore, infection prevention and control activities must be everyday practice and applied consistently across the board, with all health care professionals sharing responsibility for them. The BMA's guidelines on health care associated infection must be heeded by all staff, including&#8212;perhaps especially&#8212;the more senior staff, who are role models for their juniors.</p><p>Antibiotic prescribing should be done responsibly to reduce the development of <place-holder colnum=\"7340\"/> organism resistance. That can be difficult for a busy clinician, especially in primary care where patients demand treatment for minor ailments that would get better if left alone, although they might last a day or two longer. I must say that I am concerned about what will happen once prescription charges are dropped. Many patients nowadays think that they know it all&#8212;they browse the internet; they watch health programmes on television; they think that they know best&#8212;but they lack the years of training that go into making a competent health professional. Somehow, such patients must be educated to accept that a doctor who says that treatment is unnecessary is usually right, that viruses such as the common cold do not respond to antibiotic treatment and that, in normal people with normal immune systems, nature can often be an effective healer without the need for adjuvant drug therapy.</p><p>I think it sad that we need an HAI task force within the NHS, but I agree that, unfortunately, such a body is now needed if we are to be effective in combating such infections. I also think that the Government is right to pilot MRSA screening, and I very much welcome the cabinet secretary's announcement that three health boards will be involved. I will take a particularly keen interest in the pilot in the NHS Grampian area.</p><p>I accept that there must be a coherent approach to NHS service delivery, with links between patient safety and experience programmes and the HAI agenda. However, although I accept that a 90 per cent hand hygiene compliance target across Scotland may be reasonable and is right for this year, I think that we should nonetheless aim higher by seeking 100 per cent compliance as soon as possible thereafter. I am old-fashioned enough to recognise that that will be achieved only through stringent local enforcement by those who are responsible for the behaviour of staff, patients and their visitors&#8212;the old-fashioned ward sister, if you like&#8212;so that junior staff become so inured to good practice that it soon goes against their nature ever to breach the hygiene code and so that patients and visitors are constantly supervised to achieve the same result. I have seen that work effectively in a transplant unit, where infection control is, of course, vital. I see no reason why such enforcement should not work throughout the entire NHS.</p><p>I commend the cabinet secretary for her announcement this afternoon. I wish the Government every success in its endeavours to overcome HAIs and I hope that it will soon be able to report a very much reduced incidence of such infections in all health care settings.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Care Associated Infection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate on dealing with health care associated infections is extremely important.

Like others, we agree that no more time should be lost in finding the best means possible of simplifying the management of our seas and coastline in order to secure a sustainable future for the many social, cultural and economic benefits that are derived from them. That will allow future generations of Scots to be able to benefit from what has been, and still is, taken for granted by so many of us.</p><p>Although I am not and never have been a water baby, I have a huge respect and admiration for that grey North Sea, which has sustained the development of my home city from a small fishing port to the thriving energy capital of Europe that it is today. I am sure that, unless their livelihoods depend directly on it, most of the time many Aberdonians give little thought to our coastal waters except to admire their beauty on calm days, to wonder at their power in the teeth of a south-easterly gale or simply to bemoan the fact that so many warm summer days in Aberdeen come to an abrupt end in the late afternoon as the notorious coastal haar descends upon us.</p><p>We take for granted much about our maritime situation. The sea has always been there, it is vast, and it appears to be constant. We pay little heed to what goes on in or around it or to the damage that we have done to it by exploiting its many resources or by polluting its depths with the by-products of our modern daily lives. It is only in recent years that we have realised that, if we are to protect our marine environment and allow it to thrive far into the future, we will have to give <place-holder colnum=\"7255\"/> looking after it as much thought and planning as we have given to developing our landmass.</p><p>I am ashamed to say that, until this week, I did not know that Scotland had 11,000km of coastline or that its seas are among the most biologically productive in the world, with, as we have heard, more than 40,000 species of life within and depending on it. It is clearly important that we protect that world-class marine environment for the future.</p><p>Having come to the Parliament more recently than some members, I had no idea until fairly recently of the extreme complexity of the legislative framework that regulates Scottish waters. That complexity is now recognised as being so great that it no longer allows coherent governance of the marine environment. Therefore, we are delighted that the cabinet secretary has put maritime law reform high on his agenda and that he intends to continue engaging with the draft UK marine bill in a way that I hope will be ultimately productive. We also welcome the fact that he intends to consult soon on the Scottish marine bill, which he plans to introduce in the near future.</p><p>If the Scottish and UK Governments and the other devolved Administrations, which Sarah Boyack mentioned, all work together effectively, there are excellent opportunities to deliver to our mutual benefit the sustainable development of our seas, which we all desire. We have been promised a Scottish marine bill that will deliver a simpler regulatory system for the marine environment, more action on marine nature conservation, a strategic national approach to marine management and greater local control over marine and coastal areas. I have no doubt that the Government will consider with interest the ideas of bodies such as Scottish Environment LINK about how those aims can be achieved.</p><p>I am no expert on the marine environment, but I recognise its importance to the many and varied interest groups that rely on it. I was therefore pleased that when Richard Lochhead set up a sustainable seas task force, he included representation of many bodies that have a legitimate interest in the seas. I am talking about organisations such as the RSPB and the WWF; commercial fisheries interests, given that the livelihoods of stakeholders in those interests depend on sustainable fish stocks; sea angling and other leisure interests; aquaculture and energy interests, including oil, gas and shipping businesses, which are massively important; many statutory agencies, such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. All those interest groups were tasked with considering what the Scottish Government needs to do to deliver the sustainable <place-holder colnum=\"7256\"/> management of our seas and coasts, with the goal of developing a set of viable proposals for Scottish marine legislation.</p><p>The previous Executive's AGMACS group, which several members have mentioned, also included many stakeholders. It, too, made valuable recommendations&#8212;in particular that there should be an overarching strategic spatial plan for the marine environment, with a devolved marine management organisation for Scottish waters. Much work has therefore already been done to try to overcome the complexities of marine regulation and management, but it is clear that much more work needs to be done.</p><p>It is crucial that any new Scottish legislation is made to dovetail with emerging UK legislation in order to ensure the coherent management and protection of our seas and to avoid adding to the existing complexities of maritime law. All sectoral interests must be considered, but, given the stresses on our fishermen in recent years, it is particularly important that all plans for greater marine protection are progressed in close co-operation with our commercial fishermen to ensure that they are among the first to benefit from improved conservation measures. John Scott has said many times recently that the interests of recreational sea anglers must also be high on the agenda, given the invaluable support that they provide to many fragile coastal communities.</p><p>This has been a welcome debate. We look forward to the introduction, in due course, of Scottish and UK legislation that will allow us to manage and protect our marine interests long into the future, and which will take due account of the legitimate interests of our commercial and recreational fishermen and all the communities whose prosperity depends on the health of our coastal waters.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401333", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We welcome this afternoon's debate, which has been consensual, by and large.

They do not generally make very happy reading.</p><p>In 2004, we heard the fears of the people of Caithness that a predicted loss of their consultant-led maternity services would result in mothers having to travel more than 100 miles to Inverness, on poor roads, often in bad weather, or stay in bed-and-breakfast accommodation or hospital wards immediately before their expected delivery date. Fortunately, active campaigning resulted in common sense prevailing, as when services were retained at the Belford hospital in Fort William, which has a proud record of trauma management.</p><p>The Vale of Leven hospital was not so fortunate. In the two years following the closure of maternity facilities there, 11 mothers gave birth in ambulances en route to hospitals in Glasgow or Paisley.</p><p>In April 2005, many of us attended an excellent public debate on reshaping the NHS, which was attended by patients, campaigners and NHS professionals across the spectrum. It became obvious that people wanted a safe, accessible and sustainable NHS that was delivered locally wherever possible. Centralisation was accepted as necessary for highly specialised treatments only. <place-holder colnum=\"6824\"/></p><p>There was a clear demand for more meaningful public involvement in the planning and organisation of services.</p><p>People wish to retain local services wherever that is possible, especially in more remote and rural areas where, over the years, facilities have developed around communities. The hope was expressed that the Government would listen to the voice of local people and work with them to achieve a health service that was able to respond to all who wished to use it, that would be the pride of Scotland and that would give satisfaction to all who worked in it.</p><p>The Kerr report backed up those aspirations: it recommended that health care be delivered as locally as possible. But, by 2006, in the wake of Kerr, it was obvious that there was widespread concern about some proposed reconfiguration of health services. Some changes were welcome, but others&#8212;such as the well-known proposals to close A and E units at Monklands and Ayr hospitals&#8212;provoked intense and sustained campaigns against them. Those campaigns had the backing of politicians of all parties and of local people. They also had medical opinion on their side. Similar campaigns in the Borders put a strong case to ministers to retain hospitals in Jedburgh and Coldstream. Unfortunately, they were not successful.</p><p>In Grampian, there were active campaigns to retain maternity services in Aberdeenshire. Local people branded NHS Grampian's consultation merely cosmetic. That view was supported by the Scottish Health Council, which initiated further consultation. Only after that&#8212;and the further lobbying of ministers&#8212;was agreement reached to retain the capacity to give birth at Aboyne and Fraserburgh hospitals, which gave a measure of choice to the mothers-to-be who did not wish to travel many miles to give birth in Aberdeen.</p><p>We all agree that the public has a right to be consulted about major service change. Such consultation must be genuine and meaningful. When whole communities feel that that is not the case and responsible elected members of all parties support local opinion, ministers should be wary of taking decisions that are contrary to that weight of opinion.</p><p>Such decisions were not uncommon in the previous Administration. Often, public opinion was heeded only after strenuous local campaigns that cost a lot of time, effort and&#8212;sometimes&#8212;cash. The result was cynicism and a public perception that the Government was hell-bent on centralisation. Far from local people being involved in service redesign, they were brushed aside and ignored.<place-holder colnum=\"6825\"/></p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing's decision, soon after coming to office, to set up an independent scrutiny process with regard to A and E services at Ayr and Monklands was very welcome and it has already gone some way towards restoring public confidence in decisions on major changes to service delivery. I welcome the consultation, which has just finished, on the establishment of an independent scrutiny system and concur with the British Medical Association's view that an expert panel might well prove to be the most effective way of providing independent scrutiny of proposed options for significant operational change and that such scrutiny must not only be evidence based but focus on the criteria of safety, sustainability and value for money for NHS boards.</p><p>I agree that panel members, however they are selected, should have the skills, experience and stature to inspire public confidence and that their findings should be put into the public domain. Such an approach should go at least some way towards increasing public confidence in how changes are progressed. If the health service is to be responsive to increasing demands and improvements in technology, there is no doubt that change will be required and that, at times, very difficult decisions will have to be made. In such cases, independent scrutiny of proposals will restore public faith in the consultation procedure and help to gain co-operation when necessary changes have to be implemented.</p><p>I hope that the consultation, the responses to which are currently being considered by the Government, will lead to a process that gives the public confidence that proposals for service change are indeed in the best interests of the communities at their receiving end.</p><p>I do not profess to have any detailed suggestions on how an independent scrutiny strategy might be implemented, but I look forward to the Government's proposals with great interest and an open mind.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400232", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: NHS Independent Scrutiny"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "While preparing for the debate, I looked back over several debates on service changes proposed by health boards in many parts of Scotland.

Many of its findings are in tune with what I have seen in Aberdeenshire in the past few years.</p><p>Much of rural Scotland continues to flourish, but it is clear from the review that rural Scotland looks nothing like it did 20 or 30 years ago. Changes in the population, the agricultural industry and the rural economy have brought new challenges. In Aberdeenshire, for example, there are significantly fewer farms now, the remaining farmers largely work unassisted, and farmers' wives are employed off the farms to supplement household income. The area is now home to many former city dwellers&#8212;many are from the south&#8212;who commute daily to Aberdeen and beyond. There has been a proliferation of small craft shops and farm shops with integral tearooms, which are dotted along the main roads, and other small visitor attractions that are designed to supplement people's dwindling agricultural incomes.</p><p>Overall, the review paints rural Scotland in a relatively positive light. However, it makes it clear that rural communities that are thriving are doing so in spite of, rather than because of, the Scottish Government. I agree with the cabinet secretary that all credit is due to the many community activists in our small towns and villages who are responsible for the successful communities that they work hard to sustain. However, rural policy is fragmented. Multiple agencies work on rural issues, but no one body focuses on a distinctive rural policy. The Government's approach to rural Scotland is seen as centralised, poorly integrated, top down and inflexible. It is thought that there is a serious lack of involvement at the grass-roots level. That must change if rural Scotland is to develop and thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. I am <place-holder colnum=\"6766\"/> pleased that the Government agrees with us that there must be significant pruning of the agencies that are involved in rural policy.</p><p>The areas of specific concern to rural communities are many and diverse, and we have heard about a number of them this afternoon. John Scott highlighted the fragility of agriculture in parts of rural Scotland and the current threat to sustainable food production. Sarah Boyack voiced concerns about connectivity between rural and urban communities, highlighting the concerns in the Borders about the railway. Aileen Campbell and Alasdair Allan talked about the burden of high fuel prices on our rural and island economies, and concerns were expressed by Elaine Murray, Peter Peacock and others about council and national health service funding decisions that would have an adverse impact on several remote and rural areas.</p><p>Of the seven key priorities for action that are mentioned in the review, the four that I would single out are education, housing, the creation of an environment that is supportive of small and medium-sized businesses, and energy.</p><p>I have visited many rural schools throughout Aberdeenshire and parts of Moray during my time as an MSP, and the educational experience of the young people whom I have met has been second to none. Sadly, I have also been involved in several campaigns to save such schools from closure. The threat of school closure continues to hang over many rural communities; I hope that the matter will be addressed. I welcome Murdo Fraser's proposed member's bill, which would introduce a presumption against the closure of rural schools. I hope that the Government will abide by its manifesto commitment to introduce just such a measure.</p><p>I will not try to emulate the critique of Government policy that was made by Mike Rumbles, although I agree with him that there is an acute lack of appropriate and affordable housing in many rural areas. Local people often have to compete with high earners from elsewhere for properties that become holiday homes that are seldom used. In addition, many councils rigorously apply land use regulations that prevent building in the countryside, allowing development only within existing settlements. For example, in my experience, permission is usually refused when a retired farmer applies to build a new home for his retirement in order to release the original farm house for a new entrant to farming. I and my colleagues have been concerned about that for a long time&#8212;in fact, our manifesto for last May's elections mentioned it.</p><p>Although all developments must be sensitive to greenbelt considerations, there is a need to move towards a more flexible approach where that is <place-holder colnum=\"6767\"/> appropriate. Like many other Scottish rural areas, Aberdeenshire is home to many small and medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of the rural economy. They will welcome the Government's decision to fast track the promised cut in business rates&#8212;a decision that would not have been made if the Scottish Conservatives had not forced it on ministers. However, action is still urgently needed to improve water services and to cut the red tape that is strangling so many small enterprises.</p><p>We note the review's statement that it should be possible to expand the use of wind energy through the careful siting of wind farms and transmission lines as well as appropriate use of undersea and underground lines. That vindicates our championing of a moratorium on locally opposed wind farms pending a comprehensive renewables strategy. Inappropriately sited wind farms can cause damage to biodiversity, tourism and quality of life.</p><p>The OECD review is a welcome and timely contribution that makes it clear that the Government's approach to rural policy needs to change. There must be a move to a system that actively involves local people in planning for their future. If our rural communities are to be prosperous and sustainable in the long term, we must understand the importance to the rural economy of tourism, public services and diversification. A prosperous and sustainable future can be achieved only if concentrated efforts are made to engage with rural interests.

The contributors to that debate, in well-reasoned and, at times, emotional speeches, highlighted the urgent need for increased organ donation in Scotland, as well as the ethical and moral issues surrounding it.</p><p>Cogent arguments were made for and against a system of so-called presumed consent to donation. It was accepted that we would need to have a full and widespread debate before any such system could be introduced. There was also a general acceptance that many more donor organs are urgently required. I hope that today's debate will send the message that our Parliament takes the matter very seriously indeed.</p><p>A number of us will know of people whose lives have been saved or transformed by the transplantation of vital organs and of others who sadly have died of end-stage organ disease without transplant or whose chance of transplantation came too late or was unsuccessful. It is well known here that my son's life was saved and transformed by a successful liver transplant. Conversely, a close friend of mine died without regaining consciousness when the donor heart that he received failed to beat properly after <place-holder colnum=\"6610\"/> transplantation. That was a failure, but at least he died with the hope of regaining the sort of life that he had lost during the many years of failing cardiac output that preceded his long-awaited operation. Another friend lived well into his 80s before dying of a condition that was quite unrelated to the renal disease that had necessitated a kidney transplant more than 20 years before. Many people have been saved thanks to the generosity of all the families who have turned their personal tragedies into the gift of life for other people&#8212;thank goodness for them. Many others are not so fortunate. In the calendar year 2006-07, around 100 people died in Scotland alone before they could benefit from transplantation.</p><p>As we have heard, there is already a growing gap between the number of available organs and the number of people who need them. That will almost certainly spiral as the population ages, the incidence of kidney failure from type 2 diabetes increases and the hepatitis C that many people contracted in the 1970s and 1980s takes it toll.</p><p>There is undoubtedly a need to boost organ donation in this country soon. My family's gratitude to my son's donor's family knows no bounds and we would not hesitate to consent to donation should the situation arise. However, even though it is 16 years since my son's transplant, I am ashamed to say that I have been on the organ donor register for only about 3 years, having signed up electronically at an event that I attended as an MSP. If someone with my motivation took so long to register consent, there must be many more people who are willing to donate their organs but are not yet registered. Repeated surveys have indicated that 90 per cent of people would be willing to donate their organs after death, but only around 25 per cent are currently on the register.</p><p>There is a real need in Scotland to promote organ donation and I, for one, warmly welcome the work that the organ donation task force has done to identify barriers to donation and to consider the issues that might have a bearing on donation rates. I also welcome the cabinet secretary's commitment to implementing its recommendations in full. I sincerely hope that those recommendations will increase organ donation rates in Scotland by 50 per cent in five years, which would enable an extra 1,200 transplants a year to take place.</p><p>The task force has emphasised the need to improve donor identification and referral and to enhance donor co-ordination and organ retrieval, all of which depend on all parts of the NHS embracing organ donation as a usual, rather than an unusual, event. That might reduce the number of refusals by bereaved relatives when they face <place-holder colnum=\"6611\"/> the decision whether to give permission for donation.</p><p>I had high hopes that the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 would result in a significantly enhanced rate of donation. Sadly, so far, that does not look likely. I am increasingly coming round to the view that it might yet be necessary to move to a situation where consent is presumed.</p><p>If the recommendations of the organ donation task force result in the concept of donation as a usual, rather than an unusual, event, I foresee that there could be a relatively easy transition to a system of presumed consent, like the one adopted by Spain and other countries, which would make donation the default position from which people could opt out during their lifetime if they so wished. The introduction of such a so-called soft system of presumed consent, with proper safeguards to respect the views and sensitivities of relatives, would lead to a shift of emphasis in favour of donation without major changes to current practice. It might well be the best way of respecting the wishes of potential donors and the feelings of their close family.</p><p>Many clinical, ethical, legal and cultural issues would have to be considered before an opt-out system of consent could be put in place, but I am increasingly inclined towards the viewpoint of the BMA and others that we need fairly soon to have a genuine, informed public debate about organ donation and the best way to respect the wishes of those who feel that their organs should be used after death to save and enhance the lives of others. I am pleased that the task force is now undertaking detailed consideration of the presumed consent model for donation, and I look forward to its conclusions later this year.</p><p>It is no exaggeration to call organ donation for transplantation the gift of life, and until end-stage organ disease can be prevented or research allows the growth of extraneous new organs, it remains the only hope for many, and increasing numbers, of our fellow countrymen and women. We must examine every possible means of increasing the rate of donation so that that hope can be realised for the many other families who, like mine 16 years ago, are faced with the inevitability of a loved one's vital organ failure.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399784", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Organ Donation Task Force Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak in this debate, which follows on from the previously mentioned and excellent members' business debate that George Foulkes initiated just over a month ago.

Interesting and constructive contributions have been made by members from throughout the chamber.</p><p>As many members have said, in the past few years the desire for meaningful public engagement in the development of the NHS has been growing, alongside increasing dissatisfaction with the way in which a number of health boards have interacted with the public when major changes were planned in the local delivery of health care provision.</p><p>A number of us in the chamber today&#8212;including the cabinet secretary and the minister&#8212;will remember the enthusiasm and optimism in the chamber when the anticipated Kerr report on the future of the NHS in Scotland was being discussed, because patient groups and other NHS and public representatives who were present felt that at last they were having a real and meaningful input to the future shape of the NHS.</p><p>Sadly, as health boards across the country began the process of reconfiguring services in response to the Kerr recommendations, too many people in too many areas felt that health boards were consulting the public on a fait accompli and were paying scant attention to the reactions and responses of their local stakeholders&#8212;as Christine Grahame described graphically with regard to her region in the Borders.</p><p>The many campaigns that ensued across Scotland clearly showed the public's dissatisfaction with the consultation process. In my own area, the retention of the option for women to give birth in community hospitals in Aboyne and Fraserburgh was achieved only after a protracted, well-organised and vocal campaign by local people against NHS Grampian's proposals to close those maternity facilities. We are all familiar with the equally strong campaigns to retain A and E provision in various parts of Scotland and with the campaign that Mary Scanlon highlighted to save the Belford in the Highlands.</p><p>The battles to retain local facilities have taken time, commitment and resources. They could have been avoided had health boards been made aware of the strength of public feeling and the cogent reasons for that feeling before recommendations for closure were made. Instead, in several cases, the impression was that the consultation process was a sham, with decisions already having been made by the boards, out of the public's view.</p><p>I, for one, am pleased that the Scottish Government has brought forward its \"Better Health, Better Care\" action plan, and I welcome its <place-holder colnum=\"6280\"/> intention to promote a local health care bill within the first year of this session of Parliament.</p><p>There is no doubt that there needs to be improved public engagement. That need stimulated Bill Butler's Health Boards Elections (Scotland) Bill and has led to the current public debate on democracy in local health care.</p><p>Like many MSPs from across the parties, I had a great deal of sympathy with Bill Butler's member's bill, which was defeated at stage 1 last year. I saw the merit in members of the public being directly involved in discussions about important changes to services and having a direct input to the process before recommendations are made. However, I also felt&#8212;and still feel&#8212;that a majority presence of directly elected members on a health board could lead to short-term decision making and, at times, a distortion of priorities or delay in reaching difficult decisions, which could result in inequalities of care or undermine the planning of regional services. Ross Finnie, Mary Scanlon and others have highlighted the fact that there are also issues around likely single-issue candidates.</p><p>As has been pointed out in the debate, significant steps have already been taken to improve public engagement with the NHS in Scotland. The legal requirement in the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Act 2004 for health boards to consult their local populations on service change was a step in the right direction, even though the implementation has sometimes been flawed.</p><p>Recently announced plans for the Scottish health council to establish standards for consultation, the independent scrutiny boards that will examine proposed service changes, the intention to strengthen the public participation fora of community health partnerships and the opening up to the public of the annual review process between health boards and ministers should all help, together with other Government initiatives, to ensure that communities have a say in the design and delivery of local services.</p><p>The BMA, together with some other opponents of direct elections to health boards, thinks that those proposals have greater potential to improve public involvement in decision making than directly elected health boards. They may well be right to say that money would be better spent on direct patient care than on administering elections, with the attendant risk of the voter apathy that has been experienced south of the border.</p><p>Clearly, there is a serious debate to be had about the best way to achieve the stronger public involvement and enhanced local democracy that are requirements of 21<sup>st</sup> century health care planning.<place-holder colnum=\"6281\"/></p><p>My colleagues and I welcome the Government's drive to improve public and community involvement in the work of NHS boards. We also welcome its conviction that local people must always be at the heart of decision making and that the process for service changes should be rigorous, evidence based and open to scrutiny. We hope that the on-going consultation will be meaningful, as the cabinet secretary indicated it will be, and that the Government will pay careful attention to the suggestions of its consultees when formulating its proposals for the local health care bill, particularly any innovative ideas from those who are most closely involved with the NHS, be they staff or patients.

The debate has made it clear that that potential is enormous and diverse.</p><p>ConFor's chief executive, Stuart Goodall, is striving for greater public recognition of the value and benefits of forestry and I commend him for that. He argues, and we do not disagree, that forestry has a major role to play in tackling climate change, not only by locking up carbon, but by providing the wood that the construction industry is increasingly using as a substitute for concrete and steel and which has significant potential as a fuel, as many members have said.</p><p>Biomass generation could contribute seriously to meeting Scotland's renewable energy targets, as Jim Hume's amendment highlights. We are happy to endorse his call for continuing support for the biomass sector and we are pleased with the minister's commitment to continue the biomass support scheme.</p><p>I recently visited the Enterprise North East Trust's headquarters in Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, which is heated by woodchip biofuel. I was extremely impressed by the system's efficiency and the building's warmth. Market potential clearly exists for wood fuel and forestry expansion will be crucial to developing that market.</p><p>As Stuart Goodall told <em>The Press and Journal</em> in a good article last weekend, the industry is optimistic, as the price of wood from forestry has increased significantly. However, we need to look to the future by increasing the forest area in Scotland to ensure long-term supplies of timber to satisfy the growing demand. As the minister said, wood production is a long-term process.</p><p>ConFor also wants to restore the credibility of the industry, which is still in the shadow of the monoculture planting that blighted much of the Scottish landscape in the 1980s and early 1990s&#8212;as in the Caithness flow country, to which Jamie Stone referred&#8212;and which Jamie McGrigor described vividly. The industry accepts that new forest planting must be of mixed species and must have open spaces for people to enjoy and in which wildlife can prosper. That view is endorsed by organisations in Scottish Environment LINK, such as the Woodland Trust and RSPB Scotland&#8212;of which I declare I am a member&#8212;which want woodlands to be managed in ways that maximise biodiversity and which caution against tree planting purely for carbon sequestration.</p><p>As much of the existing forest is due to be felled, my party is pleased that the Government has promised to raise &#163;15 million a year from the sale of national forest estate to be reinvested in new <place-holder colnum=\"5967\"/> woodlands, which will be managed in line with the Scottish forestry strategy. We are especially pleased that the Government has firmed up the previous Executive's aspiration to increase forestry coverage from the current 17 per cent to 25 per cent by promising about 10,000 hectares of new planting per annum, most of which will be established through grant aid to the private sector. As we have heard, the industry's profitability depends heavily on partnership between the state and the private sector, and the latter is keen to be involved in developing the industry.</p><p>Great concern and despondency were felt when the previous Executive ended the forestry grant scheme prematurely, which in effect ended new planting by the private sector. The welcome new financial support should redress the situation by encouraging the establishment of new forests and not least by assisting owners of agricultural land to diversify into sustainable forestry.</p><p>The promised new planting provides an excellent opportunity to correct the damage that was done by the dense and largely lifeless plantations of the past and to regenerate our native woodlands, which are valuable for tourism and rich in biodiversity. As John Scott said, strategic forest planting could play a significant role in flood prevention.</p><p>As we have heard from all parties, there is no doubt that forestry is one of the most important industries in rural Scotland. With the increasing number and variety of businesses that use timber, it is at the forefront of sustainability and mitigating climate change. The industry's growth by 39 per cent in the past eight years shows its economic potential. It contributes nearly &#163;1 billion to the Scottish economy and employs many thousands of people in wood production and processing. In the past 15 years, it has achieved &#163;60 million of private sector inward investment.</p><p>Many benefits can be derived from our woodlands. They are home to numerous species of insects, plants and animals, including, as we have heard, the Scottish crossbill and the threatened capercaillie, whose survival depends on our ancient Caledonian pine forest.</p><p>Thanks to the Forestry Commission, the Woodland Trust and others, our forests have in recent years been increasingly opened up for recreation. Every day, my dogs enjoy walks in the woodlands at Countesswells, near my home. The tracks there are also used regularly by horse riders and cyclists. Many visitors and locals enjoy the sculptures and views in Kirkhill forest, and the Gight Woods, near Methlick, which are managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, provide education and enjoyment for many people from the local neighbourhood and beyond. Those are only a few examples from Aberdeenshire; there are many <place-holder colnum=\"5968\"/> more the length and breadth of the country. As we have heard, Scotland's forests also play host to many sporting events, such as car rallying and the mountain bike world cup.</p><p>We are happy to support the motion and the amendments. We want to see the on-going development of forestry, which is already a key industry in rural Scotland, in ways that will increase its biodiversity as well as its commercial value.

As a number of colleagues already know, the issue is of particular interest to me as the mother of a son who had a successful liver transplant very nearly 16 years ago.</p><p>After eight years of abnormal liver function due to chronic auto-immune hepatitis&#8212;and before he was considered for transplantation&#8212;my son's liver failed suddenly after a septicaemic episode. He went into a comatose state for nearly a week, following which a lightening of consciousness presented a window of opportunity for an urgent transplant, without which he would certainly have died. He was lucky, as he received a suitable donor liver within four days, and I am now the very happy granny of two lovely children who I never dreamed I would see during my son's dark teenage years of steadily deteriorating health.</p><p>I wish that it was possible to convey to those whose tragedies have allowed people such as my son to live a new, normal life the enormous value of their generous sacrifice and the happiness and fulfilment that it has given to the recipients of their loved one's organs. Believe me, my family's gratitude knows no bounds, and none of us would hesitate to consent to donation should the situation arise.</p><p>There is an urgent need to increase organ donation until there is a cure for the underlying conditions that lead to end-stage organ disease or until research allows the growth of completely new organs.</p><p>I was on the Health Committee when the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill went through Parliament, and I thought that its provisions would lead to a significantly enhanced rate of donation. Sadly, so far that has not happened, and I am increasingly coming round to the view that it may yet be necessary to progress to a situation in which consent is presumed. There would, of course, have to be safeguards to respect the wishes of those who do not want to be donors or who do not want their relatives to be donors. Many ethical and moral issues must be considered, but there has to be a serious debate. I think that we probably all agree on that.</p><p>In the meantime, I hope that the proposals put forward last week by the organ donation task force will achieve the result that it predicts, and I look forward to the outcome of its follow-up investigation into the pros and cons of presumed consent.<place-holder colnum=\"5557\"/></p><p>An existing problem, which I believe needs to be dealt with, is that of elective ventilation of brain-dead patients in order to preserve their organs for possible transplantation. The fact that, thanks to technology, brain death can now be diagnosed very quickly when a patient is admitted to hospital has resulted in the loss of healthy organs, because the elective ventilation of a person known to be brain dead solely for the purpose of possible transplantation is not currently permitted by law&#8212;I presume that that applies equally to people on the donor register.</p><p>A retired friend and colleague who did many renal transplants during his career told me that the early diagnosis of brain death has had a significant impact on the availability of organs. That is sad, because many of the people admitted to accident and emergency with mortal head injuries are young and otherwise very healthy.</p><p>Conversely, it is not uncommon to find that the organ function of those who survive into intensive care but who die later has been compromised by ventilation and intensive treatment to the extent that their organs are not suitable for transplantation. My friend is strongly of the view that the elective ventilation of brain-dead patients for the sole purpose of transplantation, coupled with a soft opt-out law, would be of immense benefit to our society.

Members in all parts of the chamber have illustrated just how important it is for people from all walks of life, including partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors, to continue to work together to meet the commitments of the biodiversity strategy that was created by the previous Scottish Executive.</p><p>The progress report, three years on, that we are debating today indicates some progress, but it does not leave room for complacency&#8212;for the reasons John Scott and others gave. Urgent action is required if we are to meet the challenges of our national and international commitments to safeguard our biodiversity. That will require everyone to engage in practical measures to protect and enhance our environment. That a worthy end in itself, but it is also vital to the wildlife tourism that is so important to our economy.</p><p>People travel the globe to visit our wilderness areas in the hope of seeing not only the beautiful, majestic scenery, but some of the iconic species that dwell within it, such as the golden eagle, the capercaillie, the red squirrel&#8212;and the wild cat. It is important that we stamp out wildlife crime and take adequate measures to protect our red squirrels from the invasive grey squirrels that have decimated them in so many areas.</p><p>As we have heard, much good is being done by farmers, gamekeepers and other land managers to safeguard and enhance the natural environment&#8212;it is important that that continues&#8212;but we have also heard that land management issues sometimes cause conflict with local communities, whose co-operation is vital. Bodies such as SNH, SEPA and the Forestry Commission need to show sensitivity in their dealings with local communities.</p><p>I will illustrate my point by giving an example from a community I know well. I hear at first hand from local people in the Braemar area of Mike Rumbles's constituency about their concerns about the red deer cull to protect and encourage regeneration of the native Caledonian pine forest. There is no doubt that there were too many deer in the area, even for their own good, but local opinion is emphatic that too many have now been shot.</p><p>Last autumn, during the rutting season, there was scarcely a stag's roar to be heard and many regular visitors who know where to look for deer are complaining that they are scarcely to be seen. Few local people agree that the right balance has been struck between preserving the forest and maintaining the red deer population, and they are <place-holder colnum=\"5530\"/> highly critical of the bodies responsible for the cull. It is crucial in such an area, given its dependence on tourism and game hunting, to get that balance right.</p><p>As John Scott said, we think that SNH, SEPA and the Forestry Commission should be reviewed to ensure that they always serve the best interests of the communities they are dealing with. The SNP had a manifesto commitment to do that. We want to know what progress the Government is making in that regard.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives strongly support efforts to give our seas greater protection. Poor management has resulted in our once rich marine environment harbouring few fish to attract the many sea anglers who visit Scotland's coastal communities or sustain many colonies of seabirds.</p><p>For the second time this afternoon, I draw members' attention to allotment gardening and domestic gardening, which contribute to biodiversity. They teach us how best to grow our food and flowers, what insect life and nutrients benefit food and flowers, and what damages them; and they provide physical exercise and fresh fruit and vegetables, which help our health and fitness. Properly designed gardens attract a variety of wildlife, such as birds, butterflies, bees and other insects, which are important to our country's biodiversity and which contribute greatly to our sense of wellbeing.</p><p>We have no hesitation in supporting the motion&#8212;or, indeed, the amendments. Jim Hume's amendment emphasises the responsibility of specific groups of people to deliver environmental benefits, and we think that it enhances the motion. Labour's short amendment on meeting the 2010 EU Gothenburg biodiversity targets emphasises the need for urgent progress, and we agree with that. The debate has been interesting and it is on an issue of vital importance to us all.

Sport and young people make a positive contribution to our society and to the sporting successes of our nation. It is crucial for the future of sport in this country that it be effectively governed, funded and co-ordinated.<place-holder colnum=\"4385\"/></p><p>This morning, we have heard some cogent arguments about why sportscotland should be allowed to continue to play its role. I hope that the minister will accept that he is on the losing side and agree that, although sportscotland might need some improvement, it certainly does not need to be abolished. As Jamie McGrigor stated, Scottish Conservatives totally reject the notion of abolishing sportscotland; the organisation is popular, it delivers much-needed and highly regarded expertise in effective partnerships to assist sports governing bodies in developing sport across Scotland, and it effectively integrates the investment of resources in Scottish sport.</p><p>The 2012 Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth games give Scotland a unique opportunity to build a great sporting legacy. Vitally, that legacy must be felt in every community the length and breadth of Scotland, and that is where sportscotland can play a leading role. It is notable that whenever national sporting events take place, we see our young people respond, often by taking to the streets or the local park to try out sports such as tennis, football, rugby, and, going by last weekend, even boxing.</p><p>I acknowledge the role that is played by Scotland's sports governing bodies in encouraging and nurturing young people who are interested in their respective sports. Specifically, I mention the work of the Scottish Rugby Union in developing a coaching network. Scottish rugby runs many coaching courses that are aimed at people at all levels of the game, and it is trying to ensure that every player, from mini to adult, has the opportunity to develop their full potential by receiving training from qualified, up-to-date coaches who are continually seeking to improve their coaching skills and knowledge. Sportscotland has played a pivotal role in developing that framework and, in partnership with the many local authorities that have a dedicated coaching officer, it is providing the sport that our young sporting talents of the future need to develop.</p><p>As Margo MacDonald rightly said, the Scottish Institute of Sport has been successful in helping Scotland's elite athletes to achieve success.</p><p>To lose a structure such as sportscotland would be quite wrong and clearly not what our grass-roots sporting organisations want. Every MSP knows of significant investments that have been made by sportscotland in their constituency, and it is vital that that body continues to work towards giving everyone access to high-quality sports facilities.</p><p>In my region, Aberdeen City Council recently received a sportscotland investment of &#163;450,000 to assist with pavilion and pitch development at Hazelhead. This year alone will see <place-holder colnum=\"4386\"/> sportscotland's total investment in sports facilities reach &#163;18.2 million.</p><p>I emphasise the importance of the proposed new 50m swimming pool in Aberdeen to the development of tomorrow's young swimming stars from north of the central belt. I hope that the minister is fully aware how important it is that he gives early commitment to that exciting project.</p><p>The ability of sportscotland to integrate the investment of resources in sport, the effective partnerships that it has built up, and the expertise that it has developed in assisting Scottish sports governing bodies are recognised by all sports organisations in Scotland. They all support sportscotland and, like us, they do not see a case for its abolition.</p><p>We support the retention of sportscotland, therefore if our amendment is accepted we will support the Liberal Democrats' motion at decision time. We hope that ministers will pay heed to today's important debate, and listen to the many voices throughout Scotland that are united in opposing sportscotland's abolition.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a good debate, which has given us an excellent opportunity to celebrate sport in Scotland and to look to its future.

However, our woods provide significant recreational benefits, with Woodland Trust sites receiving around 1 million visits per year and estates such as Mar Lodge and Glentanar on Deeside providing much scope for outdoor recreation.</p><p>The Forestry Commission has 20 visitor centres across the country, with 235 walking trails, 100 cycling trails, and 58 horse-riding trails. Our forests play host to many sporting events and activities, such as car rallying, woodland motocross and the mountain bike world cup.</p><p>In these days of increasing childhood obesity, it is important to encourage children to take part in active outdoor pursuits, and it is good to see a growing interest in eco-schools and forest schools, which stimulate the interest of primary school pupils in their surroundings. I was delighted to learn this week that there are already 44 forest schools in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.</p><p>On Monday I visited my local primary school in Cults, which has achieved the coveted green flag award as an eco-school and has recently started work with the Woodland Trust as a forest school. I met the 13 pupils who form the school's eco-council; they impressed me not only with their enthusiasm, but with their awareness of their local environment and their many ideas for enhancing it. They spoke of the pleasure that they got from being a forest school. Each week, pupils from primaries 3 to 7 go into a marked piece of woodland adjacent to the school, where they become nature detectives&#8212;building shelters, planting trees and generally experiencing the forest and learning about the animals and plants that it supports. In an interesting and enjoyable way, those children are learning about the benefits of woodland and green space and the opportunities for activity that they provide. Another initiative that I liked is being promoted by the school's eco-council; it is called park and stride, and it encourages pupils to walk at least part of the way to and from school. The children's enthusiasm is tangible, and I commend their efforts to the Parliament.</p><p>Cycle paths and walkways encourage people not to use their cars for short journeys in their communities; that is of benefit not only to health but to the environment, because it cuts down on fuel consumption and reduces congestion on local roads. Planning for future sustainable communities must provide for networks of local pathways and green spaces. I know that councils are considering that issue in great detail in their local plans.</p><p>In such a short debate, there is no time to deal in depth with all the physical and mental health <place-holder colnum=\"4320\"/> benefits that are to be derived from woodland and green space in our physical environment, but there are many such benefits. In that regard, I must touch on my own hobby horse of gardening as an example of an extremely beneficial contributor to our health and our local environment. I fully support the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society in its efforts to have more council sites allocated to allotment gardening. I commend the many local initiatives that we heard about in a recent SAGS seminar, which involve many patches of untidy or derelict urban land being transformed into spaces that can be used and enjoyed by local residents.</p><p>At that seminar, Sarah Boyack gave several examples of small community groups in her constituency who have come together to do that work; those groups benefit their own health by their physical activity and that of their neighbours by the environmental improvements that they have achieved.</p><p>Much is being done and much more can be done to improve access to woodland and green spaces.

Alongside that, however, is frustration and a feeling that the north-east is not getting all the help it needs to promote local tourism.</p><p>For example, there is anger that successive national campaigns for the UK market on areas in which the north-east has strong products&#8212;such as walking, wildlife, golfing and mountain biking&#8212;have largely ignored the area. As far as regional representation in TV adverts, direct mail inserts and specialist websites is concerned, the north-east may as well not exist.

There has been an interesting and worthwhile exchange of views that I hope will assist the cabinet secretary and his officials as they prepare for the meeting.</p><p>The Scottish fishing industry has been dealt with harshly in recent years. Now that the cabinet secretary is in government, he has the opportunity, with his UK counterpart, to secure the level playing field for our fishermen that he promised in opposition. We offer him our support as he embarks on this year's negotiations to secure the best possible package for the forthcoming year.</p><p>Some sectors of the fishing industry are now doing reasonably well but, sadly, it has taken the decimation of the Scottish fleet to get them there. <place-holder colnum=\"3683\"/></p><p>In August 2006, there were 1,092 fewer Scotland-based vessels than there were in 1999. During that time, nearly 3,000 fishermen lost their jobs. Because, in the white-fish industry, five onshore jobs depend on every one at sea, many people in north-east fishing communities such as Fraserburgh and Peterhead are experiencing real hardship as a result of the harsh treatment that has been meted out to our fishermen in recent years&#8212;to say nothing of the social consequences on which Jamie Hepburn touched in his speech. I agree with Richard Baker that the processing sector still faces real difficulties.</p><p>It is a credit to those who remain in the industry that they have led the way in taking voluntary conservation measures in the North Sea. It is essential that the EU is made to recognise what they have achieved, particularly in relation to the health of the cod stock. There has not been the 15 per cent reduction in fishing mortality that the European Commission quotes; rather, there has been a 36 per cent reduction and a significantly greater reduction in fishing effort than it recognises.</p><p>It is vital that efforts to assist the recovery of cod stocks&#8212;and to conserve other species&#8212;continue. Scientists and fishermen alike agree on that. However, as John Scott said, a sensible balance must be struck between allowing stocks to recover and preserving the livelihoods of our fishermen and those who process their products. That is why we welcome the on-going review of the cod recovery plan and support the cabinet secretary in pursuing his plans for a sustainable future for our fisheries.</p><p>The Scottish Government's blueprint is, by and large, a sensible document and we broadly support the actions that are proposed in it. We are particularly pleased by its emphasis on securing more regional and national management of our fisheries and we hope that that aim can be achieved as part of a serious effort to tackle the associated problems of unfair quotas and discards. Such an effort will ultimately benefit the environment, sustainable fish stocks, consumers and our fishing communities.</p><p>In recent days, there has been a great deal of media interest in the practice of discarding caught fish that are over quotas. We all agree that that practice is totally abhorrent to all reasonable people, including our fishermen, and that its continuation at such a high level is scandalous. Wasting up to 60 per cent of the cod that are caught in the North Sea is disgraceful. Our ministers must find the means to tackle the problem, whether by adopting the Norwegian approach of punishing people for catching undersized fish, getting people to pay a nominal amount for fish that are over quota in total <place-holder colnum=\"3684\"/> catches, or some other monitored scheme to ensure stock sustainability. For once in my life I agree with Mike Rumbles, who said that dealing with the scandal of discards is perhaps the most important thing that ministers can achieve next month. Such an achievement would bring great credit to them.</p><p>It is encouraging that cod stocks in the North Sea have recovered to the point that scientists can advise this year, for the first time since 2003, that a zero catch is not necessary. The Scottish fishing industry is to be commended for its pioneering efforts to find more effective and focused ways of protecting the cod population.</p><p>Scotland's fishermen have high expectations of the cabinet secretary this year. They are looking for a significantly better settlement than they have been used to recently. They, and we, are looking to our representatives on the fisheries council to negotiate an increase in the cod TAC alongside sensible and practical measures to prevent young fish being unintentionally caught in the North Sea mixed fisheries. I am glad that the cabinet secretary has given a commitment on that.</p><p>Our representatives must ensure that a balanced range of conservation measures is in place that will secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry. The current waste of precious marine resources makes no ecological, economic or ethical sense whatsoever, and that waste must be curtailed. It is particularly encouraging that Scotland's haddock, mackerel and langoustine fisheries are now committed to sustainability. I was pleased to hear about that.</p><p>I have focused on the white-fish sector, which I know best, but other members have spoken in detail about the diverse other fisheries around our coastline. As Jamie McGrigor said, different solutions are needed for different fisheries so that measures to conserve stocks in one sector do not penalise those who fish in a different sector, as has happened with the now discredited one-size-fits-all approach. Different solutions must be explored and implemented.</p><p>Our ministers will face hard negotiations in the next few weeks. We wish them luck in their endeavours and look to them to bring back a good settlement for the fishermen who have put so much voluntary effort into securing a sustainable future for their industry. They have put their trust in the Government; I hope that that trust will be justly rewarded in Brussels next month.</p><p>John Scott explained the reasons for our technical amendment to the motion.

At this point, I am afraid that I must correct Mr Kidd on his statement that there are only two such enterprises in Scotland There is indeed one in Edinburgh, but there is another in Aberdeenshire.</p><p>In May, Wood RecyclAbility, which is based on a former farm near Pitmedden in Aberdeenshire, celebrated 10 years of providing work placements for people of all ages with learning difficulties. The scheme started off with two employees and four trainees; at the moment, it has 11 employed staff <place-holder colnum=\"3632\"/> who provide places for 50 trainees, with an average of 26 people attending each day.</p><p>The wood used by the enterprise is made up mainly of pallets and packaging waste. The best-quality pieces are made into an increasingly wide range of garden furniture and wild bird and animal boxes, or are sold on to do-it-yourself enthusiasts. The rest is shredded and sent off to be manufactured into floorboards for the building industry. Last year, 2,286 tonnes of waste wood were processed, with just over half going to floorboard manufacture. None of the wood entering the premises went to landfill. This year, the figures are likely to increase to more than 3,000 tonnes processed, with nearly 2,000 tonnes being shredded.</p><p>When I first visited Wood RecyclAbility around seven years ago, it operated from fairly makeshift premises, but with great enthusiasm. The enthusiasm remains undiminished, but the premises are larger and purpose built, and the enterprise goes from strength to strength.</p><p>It is hard to describe the obvious satisfaction that most of the trainees gain from their employment. From those who spend their entire day removing nails from pieces of wood to those who hone their skills making high-quality garden furniture, the pride that they take in their work is clearly visible to visitors. Both trainees and trainers have every right to be proud of a business that makes such a worth-while contribution to the environment, as well as teaching skills and giving purposeful employment to a growing number of people with a variety of disabilities.</p><p>I want to touch briefly on an Edinburgh-based company that I encountered only last week at the social enterprise reception in the Parliament's garden lobby. The Wood Works is part of Forth Sector, which has a varied portfolio of seven social firms and whose stated intent is to build the health and well-being of people with mental health problems by developing businesses that create employment opportunities. It currently gives realistic work placements to 120 people annually. Fifty per cent of its income is generated through trading, and there are plans to increase that percentage.</p><p>The Wood Works began trading in January of this year and specialises in wood recycling, using waste wood collected from construction sites, households and wood tradespeople. After grading, sorting and cleaning, good-quality wood is sold at a reduced price to people such as builders, architects and gardeners; the company also sells bespoke products made from salvaged wood. Collection charges are lower than the standard waste disposal methods of skip and dump, and a valuable resource is therefore saved from landfill or incinerator.<place-holder colnum=\"3633\"/></p><p>I do not have time to discuss either Wood RecyclAbility or the Wood Works in depth, but both those social enterprises clearly benefit the environment, develop skills and give valuable support to their trainees. I encourage colleagues to spread the word about them, and I wish them and other similar social enterprises a growing, successful and sustainable future.

However, there was no time for a debate on the motion, so I resurrected the idea on my return to the Parliament and lodged a new motion. I am pleased that, of the 41 signatories to the motion, 15 are from the new intake of members. That augers well for the network, which has been developed and coordinated by the National Autistic Society Scotland to serve as an information channel to help members in our efforts to promote better understanding of autism in Scotland and to create a society in which people with autistic spectrum disorder are fully respected and supported and receive quality services that are appropriate to their individual needs.</p><p>It is fitting that the debate is taking place the day after the launch by the Minister for Children and Early Years of the Celtic nations autism partnership and during the think differently, act positively campaign, which was launched recently by the National Autistic Society. The campaign aims to tackle persisting misconceptions about autism and to change public attitudes towards people who are affected by the condition. I am delighted that the campaign has the backing of <em>The Scotsman, </em>which has published a couple of excellent articles by Fiona MacLeod, in which she exposed ignorance and myths about autism and highlighted problems that are faced by people who have the condition, such as bullying at school and difficulty in obtaining full-time employment. I hope <place-holder colnum=\"3294\"/> that the campaign will raise awareness sufficiently to make a positive difference to the lives of many people on the autistic spectrum who face discrimination and disadvantage because they are misunderstood by the people with whom they come into contact during their day-to-day lives.</p><p>I am sure that members know that autism is a lifelong developmental disability, which causes difficulty in communicating with and relating to other people and in making sense of the world. People with autism vary enormously, depending on where they are on the autistic spectrum, from the often highly intelligent individuals who have Asperger's syndrome, who might be regarded as somewhat eccentric and obsessive but otherwise quite normal, to people who have minor communication difficulties, right through to people who are severely affected and have extremely complex needs and require highly specialised handling, peaceful surroundings and well-established routines if they are to have any hope of achieving their potential, however limited it might be.</p><p>It is estimated that there are around 50,000 people in Scotland with autism&#8212;one in every 100 people. The incidence is quite high in the north-east and is rising throughout Scotland, as more people are recognised as having the disorder. Early diagnosis and therapeutic and educational interventions are needed to help people and their families and carers, so it is sad that there is still a lack of awareness among professionals and services are patchy. A survey of families and carers, which was carried out earlier in the year, revealed a dearth of support for adults with autism.</p><p>I confess that, when I entered the Parliament in 2003, autism was little more than a name to me and I knew next to nothing about the variety of needs of people with the condition. However, I was soon approached by a concerned group of Aberdeenshire parents who were determined to secure the best upbringing possible for their children, who were quick to tell me and my north-east colleagues about the lack of appropriate services, such as speech and language therapy and wheelchair provision. I take my hat off to those parents, who as well as coping with the day-to-day problems of having one&#8212;or more than one&#8212;child on the autistic spectrum, battle tirelessly for greater understanding of the condition and for appropriate services to support their families. Those people should not have to fight for the facilities that they need. I hope that via the autism parliamentary network we will be able to help them to achieve what should be theirs by right.</p><p>In the previous parliamentary session, I fought a battle, which I hope will be won, to retain the provision of special schooling for people who need <place-holder colnum=\"3295\"/> it, instead of putting everyone into mainstream education. The presumption that one size fits all simply does not work for people with autism. I fought hard, along with parliamentary colleagues and parents, to retain facilities such as the excellent St Andrew's school in Inverurie as free-standing special schools, rather than as special needs units attached to a mainstream school. St Andrew's is a happy school, with highly trained and dedicated staff and parents who are willing to travel many miles each day to get their children there because of the great benefits that they gain from the school's ethos and facilities. I hope that it will be able to deliver its highly specialised service for many years to come.</p><p>A current worry that was highlighted to me just this week may be of interest to members. The Grampian Autistic Society has operated in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire since 1988, running services to support people in developing their independence, helping to reduce anxieties and behavioural problems, and ultimately improving the quality of life for affected individuals and their families. Those services are now at risk because Aberdeen City Council has decided to categorise the society as a general home-care service and to fund it accordingly, which means that income from fees will be well short of running costs. If the society cannot continue its provision, the council is willing to commission non-autism-specific services for clients, which will suffice for some individuals but not for others who need the specialist provision that is currently on offer.</p><p>The society seeks my help in trying to persuade the council to change its decision. I am willing to do what I can to assist, but I flag up the issue today because I know that several charitable organisations in Aberdeen face similar difficulties. Given the budgetary problems that many councils are experiencing, it may well be an issue in other parts of Scotland, too.</p><p>There is no doubt that many children with autism struggle to access an appropriate education. Research has revealed that over a third of children with autism surveyed have experienced bullying at school; a third of parents surveyed have had to wait for over a year before their child received any support at school; and, although 1 per cent of children in Scotland are on the autistic spectrum, there is no requirement for teachers to undertake any training in autism and only one in three parents is satisfied with the level of understanding of autism at their child's school. To help children with autism to access the education that they deserve, the National Autistic Society's make school make sense campaign calls for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The right school for every child.

It is entirely appropriate that discussion and consultation should be initiated with the Parliament, the industry and wider Scottish society about the merits of a national food policy.</p><p>We hear ever more of the obesity epidemic and its complications, which now affect younger age groups than ever before. We lead more sedentary lifestyles. Children are ferried to school, are often prevented from playing outdoors and spend much time in front of television and computer screens. That makes a healthy food intake all the more important for their welfare as they grow up.</p><p>Climate change has put a focus on our carbon footprint and increased our awareness of the food miles that are involved when we import meat, fruit and vegetables. However, we have become used to eating fruit and veg out of season and to tasting exotic varieties that were unheard of in my youth. We have also become used to paying relatively low prices for our food, as supermarkets vie with one another for our custom.</p><p>Our primary food producers&#8212;farmers and fishermen&#8212;have had tough times and have been harshly treated by supermarkets. Our farmers are dealing with the after-effects of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease and they face the crippling impact of red tape. Our fishermen's livelihoods are threatened by quotas and reduced days at sea.</p><p>Given that, it is timely for the Government to consider a national food policy to bring together all interested bodies to help our producers, promote our local food, educate people to appreciate the excellent produce that is available in Scotland and encourage a healthier lifestyle. Everyone stands to benefit: we would feel better and look better and, in due course, even the health service might be relieved of some of the pressures that an increasingly obese society places on it.</p><p>Work to improve diet-related health in Scotland is not new, of course. As far back as 1996, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who was then the Scottish health minister at Westminster, introduced the Scottish diet action plan, which has been the basis of food and health activity for the past decade. The previous Executive updated the plan in 2004 but, overall, the action that has been taken has not had a significant impact on population trends and nutrition intake. More needs to be done, which is why we welcome the new Government's proposals.</p><p>Scottish Conservatives strongly support farmers' interests. After all, farmers are the stewards of the countryside and are ultimately responsible for safeguarding our food production. The attractions of rural Scotland are the result of their endeavours <place-holder colnum=\"3107\"/> and they are the bedrock of many of our communities.</p><p>We have supported the NFUS's what's on your plate? campaign and we have spent the summer vigorously promoting local food through our buy local, eat local campaign, because we see choosing fresh locally produced food as one way in which we can all help to shape a healthier, greener and better future for Scotland. Local food not only tastes better but brings benefits to consumers, producers, the economy and the environment.</p><p>As Peter Peacock mentioned, John Scott has been instrumental in promoting and expanding the successful network of farmers markets. The fact that crowds of people increasingly visit those markets regularly to buy fresh local produce shows clearly that they like what is on offer. However, as Sarah Boyack said, far too many people still do not have access to such food and still eat an unhealthy diet. Too many people have no idea where their food comes from&#8212;I was told the other day that that even includes people in rural areas. I, too, think that farm visits by schoolchildren or school visits by a mobile farm unit, such as that which Aberdeenshire farmers established, are invaluable in teaching children how their food is produced and where it comes from. I hope that such visits encourage them to seek out fresh local produce as they grow up.</p><p>Like other parts of rural Scotland, Aberdeenshire has a wealth of excellent produce. We have top-quality beef, lamb and pork, excellent wild venison, rabbit, game birds, fish, eggs and poultry, and fruit and vegetables in season that are full of flavour. Many local producers also process the food that they produce and now sell cooked meals, pies, chutneys and jams that cater for our busy lifestyles. As I said in Parliament last week, I hope that many of us will enjoy a little of that north-east produce when I welcome a taste of Grampian to Holyrood in January.</p><p>It is important that we as consumers support our local producers, but sales at farmers markets and farm shops are not enough. A national food policy must encourage and facilitate the procurement of fresh home-grown food for our public services&#8212;for hospitals, schools, prisons and other publicly run institutions. Our amendment stresses the importance of that.</p><p>Farmers need support in other ways. The Government must work to ensure that supermarkets act more responsibly in their relations with suppliers and on environmental issues, and action must be taken to insist that labels accurately reflect the origins of the products that they describe. We would also like more encouragement to be given to the formation of farmers' co-operatives.<place-holder colnum=\"3108\"/></p><p>In the wake of the recent foot-and-mouth outbreak, it would surely make sense to consider the possibility of reinstating local abattoirs and other processing facilities. The overregulation&#8212;much of which comes from Europe&#8212;that puts our food industry at a competitive disadvantage must be addressed. We urge the Government to proceed with its promised review of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage without delay.</p><p>Finally, on a visit last week to a very efficient and well-run pig farm in Aberdeenshire, I learned at first hand just how threatened the pork industry is as a result of the rise in feed prices. A loss of &#163;20 per pig is simply unsustainable. I hope that the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment will take prompt action to save the Scottish pork industry.</p><p>There is still a long way to go before we can achieve the cultural change in our national eating habits that will produce the healthy Scotland for which we are all striving, but I hope that the proposed national food policy will help to speed up that process.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391060", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is welcome and timely.

We do not talk enough about our castles, our golf courses, our excellent local produce, our festivals and much else. For instance, I have drawn the Parliament's attention to the unique Aberdeen international youth festival, in which I have an interest as a trustee and friend. However, after 33 years, the festival still has to find its place on the national stage. I ask Linda Fabiani to help us with that.</p><p>Early next year, I hope to bring a taste of Grampian's produce to the garden lobby, because we need to broadcast our culture and our food.

We have had an important and useful debate this afternoon, at a time when there seems to be an increasing determination to combat the sickening criminal activity that continues to threaten the well-being and very existence of some of the most magnificent creatures that make their homes in Scotland. The wonderful diversity of the wildlife that inhabits our countryside attracts nature lovers and watchers from across the globe, rewarding us in turn by sustaining a tourism industry that is important to the fragile communities of remote and rural Scotland and by supporting the livelihoods of the many people who earn their living in our hills and moorlands.</p><p>Wildlife crime takes many forms, and affects many species, but across the board it is sickening and disgraceful, and it does us no credit as a nation of so-called animal lovers. It needs to be tackled relentlessly until it is stamped out. The persecution of birds of prey&#8212;usually by poisoning&#8212;is the most high-profile form of wildlife crime, and we have seen some appalling examples of that this summer. Despite the stringent wildlife and animal welfare legislation that has been enacted in this country in recent years, it is concerning that last year produced the worst ever figures for recorded wildlife poisoning, with this year looking set to be little better.</p><p>More than 450 birds are known to have been poisoned since May 1999, and it is likely that many more poisonings were undetected. There is clearly a problem, and we Conservatives welcome the Scottish Government's stated determination to tackle it. Despite appropriate legislation being in place, enforcement is patchy and inconsistent. We therefore support the forthcoming review, which will examine those inconsistencies and report back with recommendations in March.</p><p>Elaine Smith made an interesting contribution on dog fighting and urban forms of wildlife crime. I commend her suggestion that the review should consider such issues as well.</p><p>At this stage, we do not see a need for new legislation on wildlife crime, but we await the outcome of the review with interest. We will respond in due course to any ensuing proposals that will aid the eradication of such crime. However, we see the need for better partnership working between land managers, conservation bodies, the Government and police. Today's clear statement of commitment by Scotland's land managers and sporting interest bodies to work with the Government and police to stamp out crimes against wildlife is very welcome indeed. It is crucial that people who are guilty of these <place-holder colnum=\"2531\"/> crimes are caught. They will not always be easily found.</p><p>There are concerns that some killings are malicious. As we heard from Jamie McGrigor, there have been cases in which an iconic bird has been found dead, but crows and gulls in the same locality&#8212;birds which are also voracious carrion eaters&#8212;have been unharmed. Such concerns have to be addressed as the battle to stamp out wildlife crime progresses.

He was appointed to the new post 18 months ago, in March last year, and he is responsible for wildlife crime matters across the whole Grampian Police area.

However, the persecution of birds of prey through shooting, trapping and especially poisoning is a serious problem and a major part of the full-time officer's work. After 18 months in post, the officer concludes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Wildlife crime is alive in Scotland, and it will take every police force in Scotland to make full-time appointments to go some way to tackling the problems and crimes we face.

It is an important piece of work, and the recommendations of FIAC's three sub-committees will, no doubt, substantially inform the development of a sustainable and integrated approach to flood risk management, which is the stated aim of the Scottish Government and has our full support. We welcome the SNP's proposal for a flood prevention bill, and we look forward to its introduction to Parliament next year. We also look forward to the flooding inquiry that the Rural <place-holder colnum=\"1953\"/> Affairs and Environment Committee is planning for this parliamentary session.</p><p>This interesting and important debate has covered issues that are extremely concerning to the many people in Scotland who are increasingly at risk of having their lives disrupted by flooding as climate change affects our rivers and seas. I note Mike Rumbles's remarks about funding and the similar concerns that have been raised by other members. Adequate funding will be crucial if satisfactory flood management is to be achieved and John Scott pointed out that the First Minister recently gave him a commitment on that; I hope that the First Minister will hold true to it.</p><p>Even if we have not had direct experience of flooding, our television screens have in recent years increasingly brought home to us the devastation caused by flooding. I have often thought how awful the aftermath must be of having one's home and possessions destroyed by flood water. Apart from the sheer unpleasantness and hard work of clearing up after a flood and trying to restore some sort of normal living, I am told that the emotional impact is akin to that of bereavement. That does not surprise me. Nor does the fear of flooding go away. Christine Grahame's and Peter Peacock's accounts of flooding in their constituencies were particularly moving.</p><p>The threat of flooding is real to almost 100,000 homes and 7,000 businesses in Scotland. There is an urgent need to put in place policies to reduce the risk of flooding and to support people who are affected by the aftermath of a flood.</p><p>If we are to take a more sustainable approach to flood risk management in Scotland, we must address several big issues, many of which have been touched on today. We know that, as well as the long-term risk of rising sea levels as a result of climate change, we can also expect more frequent storms to bring water surges that will threaten our coastal defences and cause surface flooding with which our urban drainage systems will struggle to cope&#8212;as we saw in several parts of the UK this summer. We need to look anew at long-term planning with more emphasis on sustainable flood management. The proposed flood prevention bill, together with the EU floods directive, will provide the opportunity to get it right.</p><p>The concept of sustainable flood management is not new to us. The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced a new duty on the Scottish ministers, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other responsible authorities to promote it. However, there is concern that we are seeing very little change on the ground four years later.

It seems to make sense to revert to natural flood management where possible, using systems such as flood plains and wetlands to absorb river water and slow its flow to the coast, and to have undeveloped coastal land that can cope with encroaching sea water. These so-called soft engineering techniques are not only effective; I understand that they are generally less costly than hard engineering solutions&#8212;Mr Harper mentioned some&#8212;although the two are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Such an approach to flood management will have an impact on riparian and coastal land owners who currently have the main responsibility for flooding. They are already under enormous regulatory pressure and they would need to be given incentives to adopt the natural flood management schemes being recommended.</p><p>Full implementation of sustainable flood management will require a lot of work and preparation as well as advice from experts outwith Government. There needs to be a wholesale review of where responsibility for flooding lies. Better co-ordination of flood risk management is also needed, and there are indeed calls for a national overseeing authority, such as SEPA, to deal with it. However, like the cabinet secretary, we do not wish that to result in added bureaucracy; we need less of that, not more, as Mary Scanlon said.</p><p>Land use planning for flood plains needs to be examined, and we need to investigate best practice elsewhere.

The aim would be to provide sufficient ground for people who would like to grow their own food. The Scottish Allotments and Garden Society estimates that there is a shortfall of 3,000 allotment plots in Scotland and that that shortfall is likely to increase.</p><p>Research shows that up to 20 people can benefit from the produce of one allotment. Allotments provide positive benefits. The health benefits of eating fresh fruit and vegetables are well documented&#8212;and, of course, fresh fruit and vegetables taste so much better. My father had an allotment in the immediate post-war years, so I was reared on home-grown vegetables of a quality and variety that were unknown to most of my peers. That gave me a taste for healthy eating that many of my contemporaries in north-east Scotland do not begin to understand.</p><p>Growing our own fruit and vegetables can have a positive effect on our mental well-being. We all remember Prince Charles's famous admission that he talks to his plants. He said that his plants provide some of his more illuminating conversations, with no risk that what he says will be repeated in the media. I find nothing more <place-holder colnum=\"1115\"/> relaxing than hand-weeding in my garden, when I can lose myself in daydreams&#8212;I might be sad, but I enjoy that.</p><p>I welcome moves to use locally produced and sourced food for school meals. The project in East Ayrshire and similar projects in Perth and Kinross have transformed school meals in those areas, where 70 per cent of food is sourced locally. Those examples prove that obstacles can be overcome and that our children can be provided with fresh, local produce. They also demonstrate that Scottish farmers are capable of supplying the markets. Enthusiasm for the projects among parents, pupils and teachers is high. As John Scott said, Conservatives support calls for the development of such initiatives throughout Scotland.</p><p>Farmers markets and farm shops are good things. Like other members, I am a regular customer, up in the north-east. It is clear from the growth and success of farmers markets and farm shops that more and more Scottish consumers want to know where the meat they eat was produced and to be able to talk to the farmer about how the animals were raised and fed.</p><p>It is sad that there no longer seem to be seasons for our food. Raspberries are now an all-year-round fruit, as are strawberries and blueberries. Fruit often lacks flavour because it has ripened en route to the supermarket in darkness, rather than in sunshine. That was brought home to me when I was on holiday in Cyprus: the locally grown oranges tasted quite different from those that we buy here&#8212;the same thing applies to our home-grown crops when they are eaten in season.</p><p>I recently visited Milton of Lesmore farm shop, near Rhynie in Aberdeenshire, to see at first hand the field-to-plate success that takes our food supply back to basics. The farmer, Michael Williamson, is passionate about producing the best beef possible by breeding and rearing his beasts on the farm, taking them individually to the abattoir to avoid stressing them, and investing in on-site processing facilities. He sells the meat from the farm shop or at local farmers markets, so there are almost no food miles to calculate. Members should believe me when I say that the food tastes fantastic.</p><p>The decisions of Scottish consumers will play a vital role in the growth of a sustainable local food network. It is apparent that Scottish consumers want to give active support to Scottish farmers. We need to change our habits and become a nation of shoppers who follow the simple rules suggested in the NFU Scotland campaign: shop locally, and buy seasonal produce grown in Scotland and the United Kingdom.

The best and most important way in which to achieve that is to change our behaviour so that we reduce our carbon footprint by whatever means we can, for example, by going back to eating local produce whenever we can, by using public transport rather than cars more often, by keeping air travel to a minimum and by cutting the amount of gas and electricity that we use. We all know what needs doing to cut carbon emissions, but we do not live a utopian existence and inevitably will continue to produce the pollutants that contribute to global warming, albeit, I hope, on a lesser scale. Of course, that applies to businesses and Government as well as to individuals.</p><p>Carbon offsetting is a reasonable way in which to help compensate for our lifestyles and contribute to the battle against climate change. However, although it undoubtedly has a part to play, it should not be at the expense of the required change in behaviour. From what has been said, no one here disagrees with that. We understand the concerns about the viability of many of the offsetting schemes that are in operation. Serious issues arise about the environmental credibility of many of the available carbon credit schemes, with allegations that consumers are being ripped off by paying for projects that already exist or that make no contribution to reducing carbon emissions. It is difficult to verify the real value of most offsetting schemes but, as the motion suggests, we need rigorous independent assessment of each project's direct and indirect carbon impact and its associated offset. Our amendment is important too, because it is only right that the taxpayer should know just what the Government spends on such schemes.<place-holder colnum=\"748\"/></p><p>Because of the serious concerns about the worth of some offsetting projects, we support the proposed gold standard that is being developed south of the border by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, as Alex Johnstone said, we feel that the criteria should be broadened to include voluntary schemes that are not Kyoto-approved projects, which are the only ones that DEFRA will currently agree to include, despite the fact that some of the voluntary schemes save more carbon than the Kyoto-registered ones. Because deforestation contributes 20 per cent of worldwide carbon emissions, which is more than transport contributes, we want avoided deforestation credits to be adopted in the Kyoto process, to acknowledge the importance of preserving existing trees and forests, which absorb more carbon than new forests do.</p><p>The gold-standard code of practice that is being developed at Westminster may or may not cover all of the UK. We would like to know whether the SNP Government wishes to adopt that standard or would rather develop a separate scheme for Scotland.</p><p>We would also like to know which offset scheme the SNP intends to use in fulfilling its manifesto pledge to offset Government-induced emissions. Whichever scheme it selects should have the highest proven carbon reductions, even if they come from a voluntary project rather than a Kyoto-registered one.</p><p>Finally, we think it hugely important that, before it considers offsetting, the Government commits to emissions reductions&#8212;for example, by investing in better energy efficiency and in renewable energy in publicly owned buildings.</p><p>This has by and large been a consensual debate on an important issue.

Accordingly, we look forward to the cabinet secretary's statement on climate change next week.

For most of my adult life, I have been involved with medical matters. For the past four years in the Parliament, I held the all-absorbing health portfolio, so I am now well out of my comfort zone and am faced with learning the complexities of agriculture and the language that goes with it. I know about the SEERAD, and I am familiar with LFAs. I know the issues that face nitrate vulnerable zones. LEADER is more complicated. LMCs are no longer local medical committees, or even local management councils. If I were to hazard a guess about what LAGs are, I know that I would be wrong. Despite frequent contact with farmers in the north-east, I still have a lot to learn about the intricacies of agriculture, but I can already see that, when it comes to bureaucracy, the national health service does not get a look-in.</p><p>I congratulate the cabinet secretary on his new position. I am looking forward to shadowing the Minister for Environment, once I know the details of his role. I will co-operate with him where possible, and agree to differ where not. I got to know the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment during my first three years in the Parliament, as a fellow list member for North East Scotland, before he won the Moray by-election. I must now watch what I say to him, as my niece is one of his constituents; not only that, she is also his next-door neighbour. I am not sure whether that constitutes an interest, but it is worth flagging up.</p><p>My colleague John Scott spelled out our priorities for rural Scotland in the next few years <place-holder colnum=\"294\"/> and indicated the importance that we attach to maintaining and developing its primary industries of farming, fishing, forestry and tourism. He stressed the importance of attracting new blood into farming and the need to reduce, where possible, the burden of red tape that is increasingly crippling the industry and driving people away from it. He also dealt with the detail of funding for the rural development programme.</p><p>I reiterate that the cabinet secretary faces a crucial decision in the next couple of weeks, when he sets the voluntary modulation rate for Scotland. The levels that he has proposed today, which involve a gradual increase from 5 to 9 per cent over three years, will be an enormous disappointment to the farming community, much of which is already struggling to make ends meet. If he had kept voluntary modulation low&#8212;at the current 5 per cent level, which many consider to be enough to sustain our rural areas&#8212;he would have had the Conservatives' full support. However, as John Scott said, we welcome his scheme for new entrants to the industry.</p><p>I will dwell for a few moments on the importance of sustaining our indigenous food production&#8212;an issue on which John Scott touched. In the past few years, there have been enormous pressures on dairy farming in particular, with milk production running at an unsustainable loss while supermarkets increase their profits from its sale. Every week we hear of farmers selling their dairy herds, and before long we may depend on imported milk for our breakfast cereal and cups of tea. I worry that something similar may happen in other sectors, as farms amalgamate and diversify and farmers retire or leave the industry. When I first carried out a survey of Gordon farmers, in 2002, I wrote to more than 800 people. By 2006, that number had almost halved, to 450. That happened at a time when it was recognised that food production locally not only benefits producers but is good for our health and the environment. I heartily endorse the words of Aileen Campbell, who focused on that issue in her excellent maiden speech.</p><p>Freshly produced food that is not processed or full of chemicals to preserve it and extend its shelf-life is of known benefit to health. We know the importance to our health of eating plentiful fruit and vegetables and we know how much better they taste when eaten fresh. We live in an age of serious health problems resulting from obesity that is due to bad eating habits. Type 2 diabetes is affecting more and more people at a young age and increasingly is costing the health service dear, as it faces the consequences. It has never been more important to get more local food into our schools and other institutions, such as hospitals, and even prisons, and to instil good eating habits in our children and young people.<place-holder colnum=\"295\"/></p><p>From an environmental standpoint, food grown locally means less transportation. Local produce that is eaten in season means fewer of the air miles that come from importing food, which helps to combat climate change and, at the same time, helps the local economy.</p><p>Although everyone recognises the importance of indigenous food production and the benefits of providing local food for our children and other sections of society, there is no co-ordinated plan to deliver that agenda. It is not part of the health or education remits and it is not covered by rural affairs. I suggest to ministers that joined-up thinking is needed. The Government should have responsibility for local food delivery, to bring all-round benefits to our health, the environment and our local economy. We are willing to sit down with ministers to discuss how to take forward that agenda and co-operate in trying to find a way to deliver local produce locally.</p><p>The debate has had to cover many complex issues. I for one would have benefited from having significantly more time than we were given to absorb the detail of the Government's proposals. On the whole, we have had a good debate on the rural development programme. There has been a good airing of the many issues that face our already hard-pressed farming communities, which are crucial to our rural economy and our health and well-being. I wish the new cabinet secretary and his team well in making the difficult decisions that they will have to make, but sadly I am not convinced that today's decision on voluntary modulation reflects the SNP's rural manifesto commitment to make it possible for farmers to make a living at the same time as delivering environmental enhancement by using voluntary modulation only</p><p class=\"indent\">\"where programmes cannot be funded from EU and Scottish government sources.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383803", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Development Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I rise with some trepidation to make my first speech in a debate on rural affairs and the environment.

All such conditions have a common thread&#8212;they are all relatively rare in population terms and they tend to be the Cinderellas of the NHS, because its focus is inevitably on the more <place-holder colnum=\"33614\"/> common diseases that affect the bulk of the population.</p><p>The needs of the groups of people who suffer from such conditions are similar. Medical research into the causes needs to be stepped up and better support services and equipment must be provided. Advice from specialist nurses and physiotherapists, adaptations to housing on the recommendation of occupational therapists and, in the case of DMD sufferers who also have learning difficulties, the support of specialist teaching staff can all make a tremendous difference to quality of life and, as the motion suggests, can enhance life expectancy.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I read the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's daily living factsheet, which made it clear that boys with DMD do best when they are educated in school and that, with careful planning, it is possible to ensure that a child's time at school can enhance his range of experiences and quality of life and provide opportunities to enjoy a wide variety of activities and develop friendships. Without that, life for these children can be very restricted and isolated.</p><p>Many boys with DMD have done very well at school, passing exams and even attaining university degrees. Some move on to jobs and many gain enormous pleasure from swimming, reading, painting, playing musical instruments or operating computers. However, such achievements are possible only if their talents and abilities are recognised and supported from an early age. Scotland is clearly some way behind other countries in that respect. As a result, the choice of school&#8212;mainstream or special needs, day school or boarding school&#8212;is important. The fact that pupils with DMD have different needs should be taken into account when their education is being planned, although it is reckoned that, with the right planning, most boys can be educated in a local mainstream school.</p><p>Future planning is also essential to ensure that, as the condition progresses, the necessary facilities, equipment and support are readily available. Regular reviews and assessments are therefore required and, as the children grow, there should be early transition planning for transfer between schools or to college. Moreover, children should not just become the passive recipients of care; they must be allowed to develop independence of thought and given the freedom to make choices.</p><p>Social integration is another essential ingredient of a happy, fulfilled life, and ensuring that that takes place will prove easier the earlier a child can be integrated into school. Although life can be very hard for sufferers, parents, teachers and friends, it is clear that with a positive attitude, appropriate training and proper support, most children will be <place-holder colnum=\"33615\"/> able to enjoy their time at school. They certainly deserve no less.</p><p>As most children with DMD will, by the age of 12, need to use a powered wheelchair at least some of the time, I want to touch on the issue of wheelchair supply. Although the minister's announcement this week of &#163;1 million of interim funding for the wheelchair service in Scotland was very welcome, if long overdue, I have been told by the NHS wheelchair steering group that that is not enough to satisfy demand and that a &#163;2.5 million shortfall in 2004-05 might rise to more than &#163;3 million this year. There is a fear that future upgrading of funding could now be put on the back burner, which will allow provision to slip again.</p><p>According to the steering group, wheelchair services must be considered in the forthcoming spending review and should be properly funded thereafter. I hope that the minister will give that commitment this evening in the interests not only of the DMD sufferers for whom I am principally speaking but of the many people with chronic neuromuscular conditions who might need appropriate modern wheelchairs to achieve mobility.</p><p>I thank Sylvia Jackson for initiating this debate and support her motion.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13382985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Chronic neuromuscular conditions often feature as subject matter for members' business debates, but this evening's debate is one of the few to highlight a condition that strikes in childhood and which predominantly affects young boys.

By taking forward the health-promoting schools concept that the World Health Organization has championed since the 1990s, the bill should help in the battle against obesity, which is increasingly crippling even young adults in Scotland with complications such as type 2 diabetes and its consequences.</p><p>By requiring all education authorities, schools, nurseries and grant-aided schools to be health promoting; by providing for the introduction by regulation of minimum nutrition standards in schools; by allowing education authorities, if they so wish, to provide free food and drink other than lunch; and by promoting an increased uptake of school meals, the bill will put healthy living at the heart of education from an early age and will help to instil in pupils the healthy lifestyle habits that should benefit them throughout their lives.<place-holder colnum=\"33120\"/></p><p>The Scottish Conservatives are not in favour of the state taking over our lives. As far as we are concerned, personal responsibility is the key to healthy living, and there can be a fine line between legislation of the sort that is proposed in the bill and nanny-state intervention. However, such is the current state of our nation's health that the provisions of the bill are an acceptable means of tackling the public health hurdles that we have to overcome. As Dave Petrie said, we do not see the universal availability of free school meals as either necessary or the best use of public money. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the need to ensure the anonymity of pupils who receive free school meals&#8212;an issue that Elaine Smith highlighted&#8212;so that they are not stigmatised.</p><p>We think that more children should be encouraged to eat meals in school. Apart from the good nutritional value of school meals, if children have the time to enjoy their meal times as an opportunity to relax and interact with their peers, that will benefit their social development alongside the academic development that they achieve in class. I have seen the hungry for success programme in action in schools across the north-east. Although some of the school cooks to whom I have spoken think that it is overprescriptive, it seems to be encouraging pupils to eat more healthily while they are in school.</p><p>There needs, however, to be real engagement with parents, too. In an age when fast food is becoming the norm, we should try to involve parents as much as possible in the promotion and provision of healthy food to their children. As the minister has said, it is hoped that children will increasingly demand healthy food from their parents. My grandchildren seem to thrive on olives, raw spinach and various things that I had probably never heard of when I was a child. However, there seems little point in schools giving pupils healthy food and promoting the benefits of a healthy lifestyle if they go home and stuff themselves with junk food and spend their leisure time in front of the television instead of taking physical activity.</p><p>As Dave Petrie said, we believe that more investment needs to be made in physical education teachers and that more time should be made available in schools for physical activity. We also support the promotion of extracurricular sporting activity, which not only helps physical development but encourages social interaction and team play.</p><p>We welcome John Home Robertson's amendments to encourage, under guidance, the use of local produce in the preparation of food for schoolchildren, and I am delighted that the whole Parliament accepted them. Not only will they help to ensure that the benefits of fresh produce are <place-holder colnum=\"33121\"/> enjoyed by our children but they will benefit the environment and local food producers.</p><p>We are happy to support the bill and will vote for it at decision time.

I learned that there was a higher incidence of the condition in the north of Scotland&#8212;particularly in Shetland, if I remember rightly&#8212;than in the rest of the country, and that the prevalence in Scotland was the highest in the world. The cause of the condition, although essentially unknown, was thought to be some sort of trigger event&#8212;perhaps environmental or viral&#8212;in a genetically predisposed individual. There was no cure. Forty years on, that remains the case, but in the past few years there have been significant advances in treatments that can delay the progress of MS and relieve its symptoms.</p><p>Early diagnosis before damage becomes irreversible, followed swiftly by the administration of beta interferon, has been of enormous benefit to many patients who could not previously be helped. The recent SMC decision not to approve beta interferon for patients with a single demyelinating event is disappointing. By reducing the incidence of relapse, beta interferon and glatiramer acetate can avoid the necessity to prescribe high doses of corticosteroids, with their consequent side-effects. For people with severe relapsing-remitting MS <place-holder colnum=\"32761\"/> who do not respond to those drugs or whose disease is rapidly progressive, there was no effective licensed treatment until Tysabri became available.</p><p>The SMC's decision not to recommend Tysabri for use in the NHS has come as a bitter blow to patients with the most aggressive form of the disease, who had looked forward to the possibility of slowing down the progression of their disability. Those patients are usually in the prime years of their lives, with young families and financial commitments. A drug such as Tysabri, which could allow them to continue to work or to live without the need for a wheelchair, would make a huge difference not only to their lives, but to the lives of their friends and families. To be denied the drug, which is the product of groundbreaking biotechnology, is even more upsetting when patients know that it is being prescribed in the United States, Ireland and Germany.</p><p>Tysabri's clinical efficacy is not in doubt, but it has clearly failed to meet the economic criteria that the SMC has to take into consideration when making a judgment. I would like to know more about those criteria. Do they take into account the cost of the consequences of appropriate patients not getting the drug, including loss of income, the need for state benefits, the effect on relatives&#8212;who may have to give up work to become carers&#8212;and the cost to the NHS and social services of supporting a person with increasing disability? Are those factors taken into consideration by the SMC when it makes its judgment? In the case of Tysabri, with its proven clinical efficacy, did the SMC consider a worst-case scenario as a basis for its recommendation?</p><p>At a cost of nearly &#163;15,000 a year, no one denies that it is an expensive treatment, but&#8212;as Tricia Marwick said&#8212;the number of people who would benefit is not large, and the cost would not be an enormous burden on the NHS, although obviously it would impact more on health boards where the incidence of MS is highest.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380671", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis (Tysabri)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Tricia Marwick on securing this debate on a matter that affects only a relatively small group of people but is nonetheless of major importance to their quality of life and to those who care for or depend on them.

We still await the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's decision on Tysabri, which I believe is due in a few months' time. If NICE approves the drug for national health service use in England, will the minister put pressure on NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and on the SMC to reverse its decision? In the meantime, will he encourage health boards to fund Tysabri in cases where a neurologist wants to prescribe it?

It is complementary to the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, and it should plug the gaps that have been identified in those acts.</p><p>Like others, I was at the outset rather sceptical about whether the bill was needed, but the evidence that was given to the Health Committee at stage 1 convinced me that it is necessary, so I supported the general principles of the bill at that time but shared the committee's concerns about many aspects of part 1. In such legislation, there is clearly a need to strike the right balance between the state's power to intervene in a person's life&#8212;as part of its duty to protect vulnerable people who are at risk&#8212;and the right of those people to their chosen lifestyle. As a result, the committee highlighted several areas in which changes were essential if the bill was to become acceptable and effective legislation.</p><p>I am grateful that the minister paid heed to the committee's concerns and, as he promised, lodged at stages 2 and 3 acceptable amendments to take account of most of those concerns. In particular, he has tightened up the definition of an adult at risk of harm; that has been done in response to the concern that was expressed by representatives of people with disabilities that the proposed legislation could threaten the autonomy of people who have fought hard for their independence and who fear losing it if it is perceived that they are unable to cope. Enable Scotland does not think that the minister has gone far enough in tightening up the definition, but I am satisfied that it is unlikely that the amended bill will compromise the autonomy of people with <place-holder colnum=\"32226\"/> disabilities who live independently. I am also pleased that the amended bill will not allow the definition to be amended by subordinate legislation.</p><p>The replacement of the word \"abuse\" by the word \"harm\", the inclusion of the same right to advocacy services that exists under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, the tightening up of the definition of a council officer who can gain entry to premises and the clarification that granting an order against the consent of an adult at risk is indeed a last resort, have all dealt with the committee's concerns and made the proposed legislation acceptable. One of my remaining concerns is that the minister has not so far responded to the Health Committee's recommendation that no one should be removed from their home without appropriate care and accommodation being available. I would welcome his responding to the effect that he will deal with that matter outwith the primary legislation.</p><p>Parts 2 and 3 will simplify and streamline the protection of adults with incapacity in respect of welfare and of management of their finances and property. The bill will significantly benefit that group of vulnerable people.</p><p>All in all, I am satisfied that the bill will enhance the protection of a particularly vulnerable section of society and that the amendments to section 1 will protect adults at risk of harm from overintrusion by the state. Nobody wants their privacy to be invaded against their will, or to be removed from their home without their consent, so the safeguards that have been introduced should ensure that the power to override an adult's consent will be used as the last resort only after all other options have been tried and it is necessary to avoid immediate harm. As Shona Robison said, we will, of course, have to see what happens in practice and ensure that systems are in place to cope. However, it is unlikely that the power to override an adult's consent will be needed often. I hope that when its use is necessary, the adult at risk will be treated with respect and sensitivity.</p><p>The Health Committee has had to deal with a complex bill, but I am now satisfied that it will fill a gap in previous legislation and protect a group of vulnerable adults who have hitherto been at risk of harm&#8212;indeed, some of them have been harmed. During its campaign to expose elder abuse, Age Concern Scotland said that many more elderly people may have been harmed by relatives and carers than is generally realised. The bill should give those elderly people the support and protection that they deserve. It will also allow support services to be made available to those who are at risk of harm through self-neglect or through their inability to cope with the practicalities of daily living. It should give them the help that <place-holder colnum=\"32227\"/> they need to continue to live safely in their own homes.</p><p>In conclusion, I welcome the bill, although its implementation will have to be carefully monitored.

It is a long time since I saw such an array of exotic fruit so early in the day.</p><p>I first became really aware of the practicalities of coeliac disease about 20 years ago, when my late sister-in-law was put on a gluten-free diet. At that time, there was little awareness of the condition and gluten-free products had to be carefully searched out. I remember studying labels on tins and packets&#8212;sometimes in vain&#8212;for an indication that there was gluten in the contents, and puzzling over what I would give her to eat when she came for coffee or a meal. She was sometimes regarded as being a little bit of a food freak because there was scant understanding of her condition.<place-holder colnum=\"32104\"/></p><p>I do not often welcome European directives, but the ones that came into force in November 2005 that made it obligatory to list all ingredients of packaged food must be good news for people with coeliac disease, because that makes it easier for sufferers to be sure of what they are eating. However, it is a great pity that, as Christine Grahame pointed out, gluten-free foods are expensive.</p><p>To think that there are probably 43,000 people in Scotland today who have undiagnosed coeliac disease is quite frightening, considering the long-term health risks of osteoporosis, bowel cancer and infertility to which it can lead. I confess, rusty as my medical knowledge is, that I was not aware of those risks until today, but I sincerely doubt whether a high percentage of medical graduates know about them. There is clearly a need to inform people about that hidden threat to health and to educate GPs about it so that they learn to keep it in mind when treating patients who present with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, anaemia, weight loss and the many other symptoms that can be manifestations of this autoimmune system disease.</p><p>All of us who were at the breakfast meeting today were touched by Yvonne Murray's moving account of the time it took to achieve her daughter's diagnosis. Gordon Banks MP is typical of the many sufferers who are not diagnosed until middle life. Such well-known people are to be congratulated on going public with their stories and are to be admired for doing that. Personal experience is much more effective in spreading information than leaflets or other advertising materials.</p><p>I commend Coeliac UK for its continuing campaigns to raise awareness and encourage early diagnosis of coeliac disease, for its commitment to helping people who have the condition by providing support and information, and for backing research into new treatments and the possibility of a cure.</p><p>Coeliac UK's campaigns this year for better hospital food and better training for chefs, and its excellent efforts to raise awareness at Holyrood&#8212;it even managed to get the Minister for Health and Community Care to come to the breakfast meeting&#8212;demonstrate the worth of the charity and its members.

The focus on community provision is welcome, but it is important to retain a sustainable number of local acute beds and services. Often, doctors and residents are not convinced that that is being done.</p><p>The recent BMA survey of doctors showed that there is consensus that local services should be tailored to local need and that if real benefits are to be delivered to patient care there must be engagement with clinicians in both primary and secondary care sectors. The efforts of community <place-holder colnum=\"32056\"/> health partnerships to create joint working between health and social care are progressing well but, so far, according to doctors, they have failed to engage effectively with clinical staff, which is not helping to achieve a smooth transition between hospital and community-based care. There must be collaboration between the primary and secondary care sectors. That will be achieved only if service redesign is clinician led and the focus is on improving patient care.</p><p>Other significant barriers to shifting the balance of care to local communities are inadequate infrastructure and insufficient human resource. For all that there has been</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unprecedented investment in primary and community care premises\",</p><p>in three out of four practices premises are still not suitable for future needs. Many health centres, such as one that I visited recently in Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, cannot absorb any further work simply because they lack the rooms and space to allow them to expand their activities. That problem must be addressed if a transfer of care from hospitals to the community is to be achieved successfully.</p><p>Furthermore, primary care teams are already fully stretched, without the added work that a community focus will place on them. The Royal College of General Practitioners tells us that one in three GPs will retire in the next few years, with a projected deficit of 500 in Scotland by 2012. The Royal College of Nursing warns of the need to retain the experience of its aging workforce, and to recruit for expansion, not just replacement. Many new entrants to primary care&#8212;of both sexes&#8212;do not see it as a full-time occupation and branch out into other medical or non-medical pursuits. At the moment, the system is propped up by locum GPs, many of whom are several years beyond retirement. According to Audit Scotland, nurse staffing levels are insufficient to cope with sickness and absence or to allow for the development of leadership skills.</p><p>There are huge positives in Scotland's NHS, thanks to a dedicated workforce that punches well above its weight. The Scottish centre for telehealth in Grampian has pioneered some groundbreaking work in bringing specialist advice to remote and rural areas and has let many patients remain in their local communities when previously they would have had to travel long distances to a hospital. The provision of treatments such as dialysis and chemotherapy in cottage hospitals makes a huge difference to the quality of life for patients. Of course, health promotion is essential if we are to overcome the major risks to our population from obesity, lack of exercise, smoking and all the ills that we know currently beset our society.<place-holder colnum=\"32057\"/></p><p>We agree with the Executive that health inequalities have to be addressed with some urgency, and we hope that the keep well initiative will have the successful outcomes the minister has predicted, but we do not think that the current top-down, tight political control of the NHS is the best way ahead. We agree with the BMA that, for the health service to be truly effective, it needs to be driven by clinical need rather than by the need to respond to centrally imposed targets.</p><p>It is right that, in the light of changing patient needs and an aging population, we should focus on shifting the balance of care, but any changes to the delivery of care must be planned and sustainable, must involve professionals and the public, and must be in response to clinical need rather than to political control. I am confident that, with empowered patients and their GPs at the centre of the NHS, services would develop to meet their needs.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-5572.3, to leave out from \"congratulates\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"however recognises the importance of retaining a sustainable number of acute sector beds and services and recognises continuing public concern over the extent of proposed centralisation of hospital services; congratulates the NHS where it has established innovative approaches to meeting modern day demands such as the use of tele-medicine in Grampian and Orkney and the shift of chemotherapy and dialysis to the local community; recognises the increase in funding for the NHS however notes that despite this substantial increase there are still many issues to address; supports the Scottish Executive's focus on health promotion and reducing inequalities between those with the best and worst health however believes that patient need would be best met with more purchasing power being placed in the hands of patients and GPs so that their choices determine the development of the service, and also seeks to develop a health service driven by clinical need rather than responding to centrally imposed targets.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13378809", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Making the National Health Service Local"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I must make some progress.

His response was very like the motion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"since 2001 seat belt installation has been a requirement in all NEW minibuses, coaches, and buses apart from those specifically designed for urban use with standing passengers ... we aim to bring regulations into force during September 2006 that will require seat belt wearing by seated passengers aged 3 years and above where seat belts are installed\".</p><p>That provision is now in force and I welcome it as a step forward, but the UK Government has not addressed the safety of children, mostly in rural areas, who travel in older buses along some of Scotland's most dangerous roads&#8212;including the A96 in central Aberdeenshire and the adjacent narrower rural roads. Many parents are extremely concerned for their children's safety on those roads, particularly in wintry weather such as we have experienced this week. Indeed, I have received representations from parents from the Insch area and Gartly, whose children travel without seat belts in double-decker buses along those dangerous roads to the Gordon Schools in Huntly.</p><p>In light of the recent tightening of the seat belt laws as highlighted by Maureen Watt, the UK Government should also examine the safety of buses that carry schoolchildren and require seat belts to be provided on such vehicles.</p><p>Another problem is behaviour on school buses, which David Davidson mentioned. Many parents and teachers think that behaviour would be improved by the use of seat belts. Many bus drivers have complained that children who travel on buses without seat belts often move around the bus in transit, which puts their own safety at risk and distracts the driver.</p><p>In the absence of legislation to make seat belts compulsory on all buses, I would like local authorities to progress the matter and take more <place-holder colnum=\"32023\"/> responsibility for pupils' safety on school buses. Moray Council did so some four and a half years ago, when it decided to make seat belts a requirement on all its school buses. I commend it for taking such a responsible initiative.</p><p>It is time to put our children's safety first by bringing school buses into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As we approach the five-year tendering cycle, I would like all of Scotland's local authorities to take a leaf out of Moray Council's book and put out tender documents that state that seat belts are a requirement in all their school buses. I ask the Executive to encourage that approach and to put pressure on the UK Government to update the seat belt legislation by making the installation of seat belts compulsory on all buses that are likely to have children as passengers.</p><p>In recent years, much has been done in various ways to improve the safety of our children.

I also helped with trials of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer, so I have seen at first hand the anxiety and pain that the disease can cause when it is not picked up early.</p><p>My medical education and career were both in Aberdeen, and I am proud that the early diagnosis of cervical cancer was pioneered in that city by the late Dr Betty Macgregor, who set up the cervical cytology screening service that has saved so many lives since the 1960s. She and her colleagues were meticulous and skilled in their work, and I was privileged to know them.</p><p>We are at an extremely exciting, pioneering time in the history of cervical and related cancers.

As Christine Grahame said, it is encouraging that parental surveys show that there is ready support for such a programme. However, it will be vital to continue with the screening programme in the intervening years and to stress to women that it is important that they attend for cervical smear tests regularly. It is worrying that attendance in Scotland has fallen off in recent years, particularly among young women, most of whom are sexually active from an early age nowadays.</p><p>Tonight's debate will help to raise awareness of what is a fairly common disease that is readily curable provided that it is picked up early&#8212;ideally, in the pre-cancerous phase. We must continue to keep it in the public eye.</p><p>I fully endorse the motion's praise for the charities Jo's Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, which play a vital role in flagging up the importance of early diagnosis during the pre-malignant and totally curable phase of the disease. I also commend the charities' work to support patients who have clinical cervical cancer and their families.<place-holder colnum=\"31807\"/></p><p>It is important that a vaccination programme is put in place at the earliest opportunity. I hope that the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care will be able to tell us when that is likely to happen, assuming that the JCVI gives approval on 14 February. I hope that he will do all that he can to keep cervical cancer in the public eye and to encourage young women to take part in the potentially life-saving screening programme that is readily available to them.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13378103", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cervical Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will be fairly brief because a lot of what I was going to say has already been said.

Food shortage is not a national issue. Thankfully, the malnutrition of the modern western world is rarely of the type that we see in emaciated and starving youngsters in third-world countries, who tear at our heartstrings when we see them on television; our malnutrition is largely the result of excess calorie intake compared with energy expenditure and because our diet often consists of processed food that contains more fat and salt than is good for us. <place-holder colnum=\"31366\"/></p><p>However, it tastes good and stimulates our palate more than the simple and relatively bland food that my generation experienced in childhood.</p><p>The frightening statistics about overweight and obese young children and the emergence of type 2 diabetes in teenagers must be addressed. Many of the measures that are proposed in the bill will, I hope, assist in that process. The provision of healthy food in schools will give choice to many pupils who do not have that option at home. Charlie Gordon's words about children learning to cook food at school were timely and I would like that to be encouraged.</p><p>I have concerns about how effective the bill will be in practice. Prescribed nutritional standards will ensure that the meals that are on offer in our schools are uniformly nourishing, but the challenge will be to persuade children, especially teenagers, to eat them.</p><p>My local primary and secondary schools already serve excellent school lunches. By and large, the primary school children eat them, because they are kept in school, but once they graduate to the academy they swarm down the road to the local supermarket and chipper, where they buy pies, crisps, chips, chocolates and all the other tasty items that they will not get as part of a healthy school meal.</p><p>As Dave Petrie said, there are some young people who just want a break from school, who buy fruit and other healthy food for their lunch, but too many go for the junk food option. I agree with Dave Petrie that we need initiatives to encourage the take-up of school meals. His suggestion that lunchtime activities at school could be the key to keeping pupils in school premises&#8212;which would ensure that they eat a school lunch&#8212;is worthy of consideration.</p><p>I disagree with those who promote free school meals for all. I agree with the majority committee opinion that there is no need for a universal element to the provision of free school meals&#8212;a majority of people can afford to pay for them. I would prefer resources to be focused on finding out why many children who are entitled to free school meals do not take them up. We must encourage them to do so, not least by seeking a sensitive way to overcome the stigma issue.</p><p>Eating habits are established early. I agree with the committee's view that health promotion provision should be extended to pre-school children, but I hope that parents will not be left out of the equation and that health promotion in schools will include families and will help to educate parents who, through no fault of their own, lack an understanding of what is best for their children's health and nourishment. I would like menu planning and cooking lessons to be <place-holder colnum=\"31367\"/> made available for such parents if they want them, alongside the education of their children about the origins of the food they eat and the opportunity for some basic gardening, which was mentioned a minute ago.</p><p>Only with family involvement will we achieve a cultural change in the public's understanding of nutrition and health issues. Of course, some good work is already taking place in that sphere and many parents have learned the healthy message. I see in my grandchildren an awareness of health issues that was absent in my children. My children wanted sugar-sweetened orange juice or Ribena, but my grandchildren generally settle for water, with juice or sweet fizzy drinks being looked on as an occasional treat. They are also more likely to snack on grapes and olives rather than crisps and biscuits.</p><p>I agree with Jamie Stone's words about the importance of the availability of fresh water in schools.</p><p>As David Davidson said, if good eating habits are to endure, they have to start at home and be reinforced at nursery and in school. Only when we can achieve a continuum of healthy and sensible eating can we hope to reverse the current trend of increasing obesity in our population.</p><p>Energy output is as important as intake, and nutritional provision and education have to be accompanied by adequate activity and advice on the importance of exercise, as was highlighted by Shona Robison.</p><p>Although I agree with the proposal to place a duty on education authorities to ensure that school meals meet required nutritional standards and that local authority schools are health promoting, and with the requirement to promote the uptake of school meals and eradicate the stigma surrounding free school meals, I share some of the reservations about the bill that have been expressed. I am concerned that it does not stipulate that children and young people should be involved in decision making on nutrition or should participate in the implementation of health promotion, and that it does not provide for the inclusion of parents, whom I regard as vital participants in the process.

It has been described as complementary to both the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, plugging gaps in that existing legislation.</p><p>I admit to having been somewhat sceptical about the need for the bill when first presented with it. I wondered whether its laudable goals could not have been achieved by enforcing or amending the legislation that is already in place and ensuring that people do their jobs properly. Parts 2 and 3 do just that, proposing changes that will simplify and streamline the protection of adults with incapacity in their welfare and the management of their finances and property. Those measures have been generally welcomed as beneficial to that group of vulnerable people.</p><p>The controversial provisions in the bill are in part 1. Although 28 of the 33 organisations and individuals who commented on it were generally supportive, several submissions from bodies representing groups whom the bill is designed to protect were against key elements of part 1. They expressed concern that the bill could be seen as a <place-holder colnum=\"29684\"/> threat to the autonomy of people with disabilities and, moreover, could create barriers to the reporting of abuse by people who are fiercely protective of their independence and fearful of being perceived as unable to cope.</p><p>The majority who were firmly in favour of the proposals in part 1 include those representing the elderly, such as Age Concern Scotland. That group has fought hard to expose elder abuse, which it says is much more prevalent than is generally realised. The Association of Directors of Social Work cited problems in the existing legislative framework of gaining access to individuals when there is evidence or suspicion that an adult is at risk. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland was in no doubt that the bill would enhance the protection of adults who may be seen to be vulnerable. Given that balance of evidence, I am prepared to accept that there is a clear need for the bill.</p><p>However, the bill as introduced has given rise to some serious concerns, which the Health Committee flagged up in its stage 1 report. Those concerns raise fundamental issues about the balance between the reach of the state in its duty to protect and the right of an individual to the lifestyle of their choice. The committee recommended several changes that are necessary if the bill is to be accepted as a useful and effective piece of legislation. I completely agree with the committee's recommendations.</p><p>In the bill as introduced, the definition of adult at risk could encompass potentially any adult in the population. The definition needs to be narrower and less discriminatory towards those who have disabilities. The use of the term \"abuse\" is unacceptable and could alienate well-meaning and caring people who have been guilty of unintentional neglect rather than deliberate abuse. The bill's use of such terms could lead to an unwillingness to seek or accept help to improve the circumstances of an individual at risk for fear of being labelled as an abuser. As Shona Robison mentioned, we need a less pejorative description such as adult at risk of serious harm, which sounds far less threatening to carers and to the vulnerable adults involved.</p><p>Another concern is that the bill as introduced could override rights that were established under other pieces of legislation, notably the right to advocacy and the right to make an advance statement that were provided for in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. The fact that the bill provides for no right of appeal against removal orders could, it is thought, be challenged under the European convention on human rights. The bill needs to be amended to take account of those concerns.</p><p>The most controversial element in the bill is <place-holder colnum=\"29685\"/> undoubtedly the provision of powers that, in certain circumstances, will allow protection orders such as removal orders to be put in place against the wishes of the adult at risk. Clearly, only in exceptional circumstances should an adult with capacity have their privacy invaded or be removed from their home without consent. The power to override an adult's consent should be used only as a last resort after all other options have been tried and when it is necessary to avoid immediate harm. Surely there must be a requirement that, before a sheriff can make a protection order against the wishes of a capable adult at risk, the local authority must demonstrate that it has tried all other options before seeking to override the adult's consent.</p><p>Sufficient resources must be put in place to ensure that adults who are subject to protection orders can be accommodated. The bill should make it clear that no one can be removed from home without appropriate care and accommodation being available to them.</p><p>The definition of the council officer that is referred to in section 7(1) needs to be tightened so that the power to enter a person's place of residence is given only to an appropriately qualified and experienced individual. That should be made explicit.</p><p>I support the provision that each local authority must set up an adult protection committee to take a strategic overview in jointly managing adult protection policies, systems and procedures at local level. I agree with the Health Committee's view that the voluntary sector should be represented on those committees.</p><p>Taking into consideration the fact that the balance of evidence indicates that the bill is necessary to enhance the protection of a particularly vulnerable section of society, and given the minister's willingness to amend the bill to take account of most of the concerns that I have expressed&#8212;in particular, the need to strike the right balance between upholding a person's right to the lifestyle of their choice and ensuring that public authorities can intervene when there is thought to be a risk of serious harm&#8212;my Conservative colleagues and I are content to support the general principles of the bill at stage 1.

I welcome the motion's recognition of independent and voluntary sector organisations, which are often somewhat overlooked by Government and whose work in providing services is essential in addressing health inequalities in our society. I also congratulate the Edinburgh Community Food Initiative on its 10 years of work throughout the Lothians, and especially on its efforts to improve the diet of many local people.</p><p>In north-east Scotland, which I represent, similar organisations, such as Gordon Rural Action, for which I will be sponsoring an exhibition in the garden lobby next week, are working to support and promote local voluntary action and services in central Aberdeenshire, including the provision of access to a wide range of community and self-help groups. I recently went along to one of Gordon Rural Action's drop-in days in Inverurie to see for myself the services that are on offer, which include not only information on health matters but access to money and debt advice, and to rural housing and local employment services. We must encourage such innovative and effective organisations and we must work to reduce and remove the barriers and red tape that often prevent community groups from starting out in the first place.</p><p>Often, the personal contact that comes with community, independent and voluntary services is as valuable as the service that they provide. I cite the example of the WRVS meals on wheels service. It provides our old folks&#8212;although not only old folks&#8212;with a healthy hot meal each day, but it also provides human contact. Many older people who live on their own, and adults who have mental-health problems or physical, sensory or learning disabilities might lack that human contact. I suggest to the minister that it cannot be provided through weekly delivery of frozen ready meals which, I am sorry to say, many local authorities are moving towards.</p><p>Community based and focused groups provide invaluable assets but, as we have heard repeatedly this evening, many of them are bedevilled by the problem of future funding. Voluntary organisations throughout Scotland increasingly operate in what can be described only <place-holder colnum=\"29013\"/> as a guillotine situation, in which they never know when vital funding will be cut off.</p><p>I know from my involvement over the years with different groups in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire that day-to-day costs, or working capital, is a pressing issue.

The difficulty in identifying and securing continued long-term funding and funding for existing services must be addressed so that the great work that we have heard much about this afternoon can continue and expand to reach more of our communities.</p><p>We need to develop and build a confident and well-informed society, which will help Scotland's parents to make the health choices that will enable their children to become healthy, well-educated and passionate young Scots. We must continue to educate community groups on health matters, promote good health and encourage individuals and communities to share health-improvement responsibilities and activities. To do that, community based and focused voluntary groups need to be free of Government interference, but financially secure.

As we have heard, the ITI for energy is situated in the city, and Renewables UK is based in the DTI's Aberdeen <place-holder colnum=\"28672\"/> office, clearly indicating the links between renewables and the oil and gas sectors.</p><p>Technology developed by the North sea oil industry is being put to use in the developing Moray firth wind farm project, Pelamis was developed in Scotland, biomass is increasingly contributing as a source of energy in the north-east, and hydrogen capture techniques are being developed nearby.</p><p>The energy sector in Aberdeen is a major contributor to the country's economy. To put it into context, an industrial sector that employs around 40,000 people in Aberdeen is equivalent to one that employs 630,000 people in the London area&#8212;the equivalent, I am told, of nine Heathrow airports. Furthermore, this year's business gateway international study has shown that 41 per cent of exporters in the North sea oil and gas sector have international activities valued at more than &#163;1 million and that international business accounts for at least a third of their turnover.</p><p>Getting the energy technologies institute into Scotland would provide an unparalleled opportunity for our country. Richard Baker has clearly laid out the compelling reasons why it should be situated in Aberdeen. I am delighted that his words were endorsed earlier this week by CBI Scotland, which gave its unequivocal support to Aberdeen's case when it appealed to politicians at Westminster to support the city and help it to secure its position as Europe's energy capital.</p><p>Work on preparing Scotland's final bid for the institute is well advanced. I hope that the minister will agree that there are compelling reasons for considering Aberdeen as its location. I hope that he will add his support to Aberdeen's case, as have the CBI and other significant industrial and academic players in the energy sector.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13369526", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Technologies Institute"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Richard Baker is to be warmly congratulated on his timely introduction to the Scottish Parliament of a debate on a subject of immense importance to Scotland's future prosperity.

When older people reach the stage in life at which they need help, that help should be available to give them the dignity and security that they need and deserve.</p><p>The motion under debate highlights two of the main barriers that today's pensioners face in that respect. A reduction in the burden of council tax and proper implementation of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2003 would make an enormous difference to the lives of many people. Our proposal to introduce a 50 per cent council tax discount for all pensioner households would lift a huge burden from people who are faced with an ever-increasing erosion of the value of their pensions, especially with many of them finding that more than 10 per cent of their gross income is going on council tax bills. The poorest, who should be in receipt of council tax benefit, are put off by the complexity of the application forms and the take-up rates are far too low. Our proposed discount is a simple, straightforward way of relieving a financial burden that threatens the security of a large number of today's pensioners.</p><p>I remind those in the Labour and Lib Dem parties who are critical of our proposals on the pretext that they are uncosted that, unlike the SNP, which promises utopia for all, the Conservative party has a great deal of experience in Government and knows better than to issue policy proposals that have not been costed.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368423", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Senior Citizens"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On the whole, the debate has been interesting and has highlighted a number of issues of great importance to an increasing number of people in Scotland as more and more of us live into and face the challenges of old age.

To clarify matters for Elaine Murray, I can confirm that our discount would be on top of the existing discount for single pensioner households.</p><p>As for the derogatory attitude of Malcolm Chisholm, Pauline McNeill, Bristow Muldoon and Elaine Murray to our proposals to mutualise Scottish Water, why do not they listen to their own Sam Galbraith, who has said that the public model is not working? Why do not they listen to Jo Armstrong, a former adviser to the First Minister, who has concluded that the current state-owned model must end and that privatisation or mutualisation is the correct way forward? Their own people are advising them to go for mutualisation or privatisation.</p><p>With regard to the Parliament's flagship policy of free personal care, we know from the Health Committee's recent care inquiry report just how patchy delivery of that policy is across the country, with three quarters of Scotland's councils failing to provide an appropriate care package based on assessed need as and when it is required by their clients. The on-going blame game between councils and the Executive is doing no good to those people who need help. There is a legal right to free personal care and the Executive must ensure provision where and when it is required. Whatever the Lib-Lab Executive says about free personal care being fully funded, we have heard from John Scott about the problems in South Ayrshire. Other councils, such as Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council, are spending double the resource that was allocated to them for that service. The outcome of the Executive's review of the funding for free personal care cannot come too soon, because it is clear that either the funding available is too little or its allocation is inequitable across councils.</p><p>It is alarming that some councils are still wrongly charging their clients for food preparation. David McLetchie highlighted that issue today, using examples from his Edinburgh Pentlands constituency; he is to be commended for the work that he has done to ensure that his constituents are refunded the charges that have been wrongly levied in the past. In the interests of fairness, charging for food preparation should cease immediately across Scotland. All cases in which <place-holder colnum=\"28256\"/> charges may have been wrongly levied should be reviewed and, where appropriate, full refunds should be made, regardless of how much that would cost. It is simply not acceptable to confer a right with one hand and take it away with the other.</p><p>Christine Grahame gave a vivid description of fuel poverty among pensioners, which is a real issue. The Executive's central heating programme has much to commend it, and we support it, but it is clear from the number of complaints that have been made over the past five years that its management has been less than perfect, and it has failed many older people. It is to be hoped that the Executive will ensure that Scottish Gas succeeds in delivering the effective service that our pensioner households deserve. Time will tell.</p><p>I have two brief things to say on the national concessionary fares scheme, but first I must declare an interest: like Robin Harper, I am the holder of a bus pass. First, many pensioners in rural areas, such as parts of rural Aberdeenshire, cannot take advantage of the scheme, because there simply is no bus service for them to use; many of them would dearly like to have that opportunity. Secondly, I trust that the Executive has taken note of Audit Scotland's comment that higher-than-expected usage of free travel may exhaust the new scheme's budget. I hope that that will not result in the same sort of problems that are besetting the free personal care policy. If the fares scheme ran into trouble, many pensioners throughout the country would be deeply disappointed.</p><p>We have had a good, wide-ranging discussion about issues that are of major concern to our elderly population, and I am happy to commend to the Parliament the motion in Annabel Goldie's name.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368423", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Senior Citizens"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have no time.

They know that their days are numbered, that they may face severe pain as the disease spreads beyond the pleura and that they are likely to become increasingly breathless as a result of pleural effusions.</p><p>Prior to the development of Alimta, no product was licensed in the UK for the treatment of mesothelioma. Its statistically proven efficacy, in combination with cisplatin, in increasing survival time up to 40 per cent beyond what cisplatin can achieve as a single agent means that there is a ray of hope for terminally ill patients. There is hope for them to have a few more months with their families and friends, and hope for a reduction in their symptoms.</p><p>Other treatments have been tried, but there is no standard of care for mesothelioma in the UK, so comparisons between treatment regimes are not easy. However, as we have heard, the Scottish medicines consortium gave its approval for the use of combined Alimta-cisplatin therapy for patients who have not had any cancer treatment and who have spreading and inoperable mesothelioma.</p><p>During the past year, that therapy has indeed improved the quality of life for patients who have been treated with it in Scotland and in the parts of England where it has been approved. Indeed, I heard just this afternoon of a patient in Manchester whose tumour growth is static a full year after he was given a course of Alimta. It now very likely that he will see the birth of his first grandchild, which he could not have contemplated a year ago.</p><p>Naturally, the NICE provisional guidance that was issued in June this year came as a body blow to patients who hoped to be eligible for treatment with Alimta. As we know, NICE guidelines are usually adopted by NHS QIS and implemented by the SMC. However, the latter organisation can, in fact, maintain its current position whatever NICE's final guidance. The Clydeside Action on Asbestos charity is, rightly, urging us to reinforce to the minister that that option is available.</p><p>NICE does more detailed work on the cost effectiveness of drugs than the SMC does, which brings out its guidance well in advance of NICE. I, and I am sure most of us, would be happy to accept NICE's recommendations without question, in most cases. However, in this case, in which no other option of effective treatment is available and Alimta's manufacturer has challenged the provisional guidance on the grounds that all the <place-holder colnum=\"28116\"/> evidence available to the appraisal committee was not appropriately taken into account and the summaries of cost and clinical effectiveness are not reasonable interpretations of the evidence, I am happy to endorse the call for the Executive to guarantee the availability of Alimta to existing and future sufferers of mesothelioma in Scotland who qualify for it, particularly given its satisfactory results over the past year.</p><p>The patients who will be affected by the decision are ill through no fault of their own. They and their families have little to look forward to. However, Alimta gives such patients the hope of a better quality of life in the latter stages of their illness and the prospect of more precious time with their loved ones.

As medical techniques and treatments increased in complexity, more and more services were centralised in major and teaching hospitals and cottage hospitals began to lose beds or close. The Kerr report and the strategy that followed it, \"Delivering for Health\", have brought back a welcome focus on the community and include proposals to deal with as <place-holder colnum=\"27704\"/> many health needs as possible locally and to use district hospitals to deal with more highly specialised needs.</p><p>NHS Grampian's health plan fits well with \"Delivering for Health\" and the public warmly welcomed many of the board's proposals during the extensive consultation that was carried out in the past year. There are welcome advances to do with access to diagnostic tests on one's doorstep, the availability of minor surgery or chemotherapy close to home and the availability of renal dialysis in Inverurie. The only contentious area has been planning for maternity services.</p><p>Fashions in midwifery change. At one time, home births were more popular. Later, mums were more likely to use Aberdeen maternity hospital and then midwife-led units began to thrive. As birth rates have fallen, early discharge from hospital has become the norm and it has become more usual for older women to have babies, sadly many smaller units have been forced to close, because there are not enough births to enable midwives to retain their skills.</p><p>We witnessed such change in central Aberdeenshire. Despite a major campaign, the unit at Insch war memorial hospital closed. The midwife-led unit in Huntly remained, but the number of births fell off until the unit became unviable&#8212;it was unlikely that it would reopen. However, pregnant mums in central Aberdeenshire will have a choice, because they can go to Dr Gray's hospital in Elgin if they do not want a home birth or to go to Aberdeen. The situation further north is similar. Although I have great sympathy for people in Banff and Fraserburgh, at least they can go to Peterhead as well as Aberdeen if the units in Banff and Fraserburgh close. However, if the unit in Aboyne closes, people in west Aberdeenshire will be able to choose only between giving birth at home and giving birth in Aberdeen.</p><p>People in the area say that NHS Grampian has done little to promote the Aboyne unit. Indeed, many people think that the board has discouraged use of the unit. Women who have given birth in Aboyne or had post-natal care there are enthusiastic about their experiences and the help that they received in establishing breastfeeding and bonding with their babies in the early days of motherhood. They are keen to promote the unit to others, citing as their example the thriving unit in Montrose, which only four years ago was in the same position as Aboyne is in now.</p><p>The campaign to save and promote the Aboyne maternity unit has involved people of all ages, throughout the community. It has the backing of Aberdeenshire Council and it has been supported by MPs and MSPs across the political spectrum. <place-holder colnum=\"27705\"/></p><p>However, instead of heeding local opinion, the health board has recommended closure.</p><p>As I said in last week's debate on accident and emergency services in Lanarkshire, if it becomes clear after protracted and widespread consultation that public opinion is solidly against a proposal, and if that view is backed by elected representatives from across the political divide, ministers should be wary of ignoring the weight of that opinion.

The committee considered free personal care, the work of the care commission and the use of direct payments for care.</p><p>The introduction of free personal care for the elderly in 2003 has been one of the Parliament's most important achievements. Such care has made it possible for people to continue to live at home when they would previously have had to go into long-term residential care. The policy has provided greater security and dignity for many elderly people and support for their carers, and it has had a significant impact on delayed discharges from hospitals. However, the problems that the care inquiry has uncovered have significant implications for the sustainability of the policy, and they must be addressed by the Executive without delay.</p><p>The two major issues that are threatening to undermine the policy are the operation of waiting lists by three quarters of Scotland's local authorities and the charging for assistance with food preparation by nearly half of them. It is clear that there are problems with funding free personal care, with demand greatly outstripping the available resources in many instances. Aberdeen City Council, which is Lewis Macdonald's and my local council, is the lowest-funded council in Scotland per head of population. In the 2005-06 financial year, it received &#163;6 million from the Scottish Executive to support free personal care, but the estimated expenditure of &#163;12.1 million was more than double that figure. Moray Council received less than &#163;2.5 million, but its estimated spend was &#163;5.5 million. North Lanarkshire Council has spent nearly three times its allocation and South Lanarkshire Council has spent almost double its allocation. That is simply not sustainable; the result is the waiting lists in many council areas.<place-holder colnum=\"27655\"/></p><p>The Executive has said that councils have been adequately funded according to their predicted needs. The reality is that the funding that has been made available has been insufficient or its distribution across councils has been inequitable. Where the fault lies does not matter to the many elderly people throughout Scotland who are awaiting assessment or the care package that they have been assessed as requiring. They are not interested in squabbles between councils and the Executive.

I trust that the review that is being undertaken in response to the Health Committee's report will be speedy and will result in a properly funded system that will remove the postcode lottery of care that is currently experienced by Scotland's elderly population. If the Executive can bail out Scottish Enterprise to the tune of &#163;45 million, surely it can step in to ensure that councils can fulfil the free personal care obligation that is placed on them, especially as the knock-on effect of hospital beds being blocked by elderly people who are awaiting care packages is costing the health service dearly in relation to financial costs and waiting times.</p><p>Another concern for many people is the failure to index link the funding provision for free personal care. The personal care allowance has remained static since its introduction, although inflation has moved on. Many self-funded residents in care homes have faced large increases in home charges while their personal care allowance has remained unchanged. Again, action needs to be taken if the policy is not to be undermined.</p><p>The other major problem that was exposed by the care inquiry is the on-going confusion as to whether assistance with food preparation is a chargeable activity. The act is a part of free personal care and should not be charged for, but misleading guidance has resulted in nearly half of Scotland's councils charging clients for that assistance. There was an attempt to clarify matters in 2004, when councils were told that the guidance was inconsistent with the terms of the <place-holder colnum=\"27656\"/> legislation, which must take precedence and be observed. However, as recently as March, research by Alzheimer Scotland and Age Concern Scotland found that 13 local authorities were still charging for assistance with food preparation. That must stop, and in all cases in which charges have been wrongly levied in the past, a full refund should be made to the people concerned. That is happening in some, but by no means all, councils, which is unfair. The cost of refunds may well be high but, in fairness, they must be made. The Executive cannot confer a right with one hand and remove it with the other; it must sort that out without further delay.</p><p>The part of the inquiry that looked into the regulation of care identified problems of duplication, overlap and poor co-operation between councils and the care commission. It recommended that there should be a mandatory requirement for sharing information and for agreements over the inspection and monitoring of care services. The care commission should look to streamline its registration systems to reduce the number of multiple registrations for single services, and it should publicise more widely&#8212;for example, to care home residents&#8212;the outcomes of inquiries into complaints that have been upheld.</p><p>The Executive's requirement for the care commission to be self-funding has put an enormous burden on the care sector&#8212;particularly on smaller independent care homes, a number of which have faced closure as the escalating cost of fees for regulation has made them unviable. A strong feeling is emerging&#8212;which we share&#8212;that the care commission should not be funded by the elderly care services that it regulates. The cost of regulation of young people's services is met from the public purse. I urge the Executive to review its policy on services for the elderly before more care facilities go to the wall.</p><p>Finally, the take-up of direct payments for care is patchy across Scotland and could be significantly higher. Some local authorities are more enthusiastic about the policy than others, and take-up is much higher in councils where senior officials are committed to the policy. In others, it appears that officers are unwilling to put the control of services into the hands of service users and, therefore, do not promote the uptake of direct payments. The system gives much more choice and flexibility to users who wish to organise their own support measures, and the opportunity to use it must be made available by all local authorities.</p><p>The care inquiry has been thorough. It has shown the benefits that the legislation can bring to Scotland's elderly population, but it has exposed serious difficulties with the implementation of free personal care. It has shown where improvements could be made with regard to the operation and <place-holder colnum=\"27657\"/> funding of the care commission, and it has highlighted the benefits of direct payments for service users and the need to increase their uptake. The Health Committee, its clerks and the many witnesses who gave evidence to the committee have worked extremely hard on the inquiry.

Communities throughout Scotland face major changes in provision, some of which are welcome and others of which provoke sustained anger and opposition of the kind that we have witnessed on the proposed closure of the accident and emergency unit at Monklands.</p><p>As a North East Scotland member, I am not familiar with the detailed geography of Lanarkshire, so I intend to speak in more general terms and leave the detail to my colleagues. Some months ago, I took part briefly in the debate on the Lanarkshire united health for all campaign, which was brought to the chamber by Carolyn Leckie. During that debate, it became clear not only that there was concern about the proposals to close the busiest accident and emergency unit in the most deprived part of Lanarkshire, but that there was fury that the consultation that was under way at the time did not even allow consideration of the status quo.</p><p>At that time, there was cross-party support from local members&#8212;Elaine Smith, Cathie Craigie, Karen Whitefield, Margaret Mitchell, Carolyn Leckie and Alex Neil&#8212;who all made their concerns and opposition to the closure of the Monklands accident and emergency unit clear to the minister. They did not do that lightly and they had significant backing from medical opinion in the area. Then the announcement came that the Monklands unit was to close.</p><p>More recently, I sat in on a similar debate about NHS hospital provision in the Borders. Again, there was cross-party support that was backed up by medical opinion and a strong case for the retention of services was put to the minister. The announcement that Coldstream and Jedburgh cottage hospitals face closure came weeks later.</p><p>In Grampian, we have a continuing campaign against the health board's decision to close the <place-holder colnum=\"27484\"/> midwife-led maternity units in Fraserburgh and Aboyne and to focus instead on community midwifery. Again, there has been major community involvement and cross-party support and, next week, there will be a debate on the subject in the name of Mike Rumbles. In that case, campaigners felt that the consultation process was merely cosmetic and, in their support, the Scottish health council initiated further consultation. NHS Grampian's proposals are currently with the minister, and we await the outcome with interest.</p><p>There is also massive opposition to proposed changes in the accident and emergency services in Ayrshire. I have no doubt that John Scott will deal with that when he speaks later on.</p><p>There clearly have to be changes in NHS provision to meet the demands of modern health care, and health boards throughout the country are having to redefine their services. Some older and cherished hospital buildings may have to go because they are no longer fit for purpose, and people will mourn their loss. However, if there is serious concern about proposed changes, if whole communities genuinely feel that consultation is not meaningful and if responsible elected members across the parties are totally supportive of local opinion, ministers must be wary of taking decisions that go against that opinion.</p><p>Consultation is all very well but, if the weight of public opinion is set aside at the end of it, the public will rapidly become even more cynical and disillusioned than they are at present. The public perception of the health service is that it is becoming far too centralised. People are extremely worried about the loss of facilities close to home and, far from feeling that they are involved in service redesign, they feel that they are simply being ignored and brushed aside. Monklands seems to me to be a classic example of that and, to use the terms of the motion, I urge the Scottish Executive to re-examine its decision to approve that closure.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366607", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The fact that I speak in support of the SNP's motion is a clear indication of concern across the parties about the continuing reconfiguration of NHS services in Scotland.

They felt that Westminster did not understand the needs of Scotland and that, if only major issues of responsibility could be transferred to government within Scotland, many of our frustrations and disadvantages would be overcome. Where devolution so far has disappointed many people, particularly in the more peripheral parts of the country, is that Holyrood seems as remote as Westminster, with an Executive that controls our lives from Edinburgh and gives insufficient local freedom in the running of key public services.</p><p>Nowhere is that seen more clearly than in the health service, where the Minister for Health and Community Care holds a tight rein over health boards, which are obliged to respond to the many targets set by the Executive and, in turn, control the health professionals in their employment, thus limiting professional freedom and resulting in a growing resentment against a centrally directed bureaucracy that dictates the priorities that should instead be decided according to clinical need.</p><p>No one can deny that the Government has invested heavily in the national health service in Scotland, with spending doubled since 1997, and up 81 per cent since 1999 under the Scottish Executive. New contracts are in place for general practitioners and consultants, and other health professionals have seen major improvements in their pay structures, but it is still rare to find a doctor over the age of 55 working in the NHS, and nursing recruitment, although increasing, still goes largely towards replacing those leaving the <place-holder colnum=\"27177\"/> service, rather than expanding the workforce to meet the growing demands placed upon it.</p><p>Our NHS professionals, at whatever level, work very hard and do a great job. Many are highly skilled and operate technology that was undreamed of in my younger days in the service. Diagnostics have been revolutionised by magnetic resonance image scanning and by advances in biomedical science, and we remain at the forefront of medical research and its applications, with treatments available and under development for many conditions that were previously untreatable. However, people in Scotland still have to wait far too long to access the diagnostics and treatments that are available. Resources targeted at waiting list initiatives mean that, while targeted conditions are dealt with quickly, others have to wait, and doctors are frustrated by not being able to respond to the clinical needs of their patients.</p><p>I am sorry that the Minister for Health and Community Care has left the chamber. He does not like it when I quote anecdotal evidence, but if he spoke to some of the medical staff that I hear from he would know that it is common practice for operating lists to be altered by management so that targets can be met, to the outrage of clinicians, who have made up their lists according to clinical need and are then faced with telling their patients that the operations that they are prepared for will have to be delayed. If the minister mixed in the medical circles where I move, the commonest thing that he would hear is the question, \"Why on earth can't Government just drop all these targets and let us get on with our jobs?\" That resentment about the loss of professional freedom, which is driven by concern that patient care is being compromised because of politically set targets, has been bubbling away under the surface for a considerable time. It came as no surprise to me that the British Medical Association called on the Executive to scrap its hospital waiting times targets. Not only the BMA, but the Royal College of Nursing and patient groups now say that targeting is damaging patient care. As Jane McCready of the RCN told <em>Scotland on Sunday </em>this week:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Frontline nursing staff tell us that they believe there is currently too much focus on hospital waiting times.

As Roseanna Cunningham said, many of those unpaid carers do not recognise their roles as carers; they think of themselves as helping out friends or loved ones. Some have done it all their lives, some are dealing with the aftermath of illness or an accident and many care for more than one person.</p><p>Sometimes, carers suffer damage to their own physical and/or mental health as a result of their caring roles. A carers and health survey that was carried out in Aberdeen two years ago found that 94 per cent of the city's carers are under stress. The survey's conclusion states a point that is not often considered:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"carers are a workforce, albeit a hidden workforce, one which cannot take time off sick from their job or leave their stress behind at 5 o'clock. If 94% of any employer's workforce were found to be under stress, there would surely be an investigation into finding some means of reducing that stress.\"</p><p>It is obvious from that survey that carers need to be identified and properly supported if they are to carry out their caring roles without serious detriment to their own health. That is why the network of carers centres throughout the country performs an invaluable role. The Voluntary Service Aberdeen carers centre, which is part of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers network, has been in operation for 12 years now. When I visit the centre, I always meet carers who tell me that it is their lifeline. There, they can meet other carers, compare notes, help one another, work at their hobbies and get a little break from their caring duties. They can also get advice about and help with access to benefits, adaptations and activities that can help them and those for whom they care.</p><p>Many carers are in employment and find it difficult to meet the demands of what can amount to two full-time jobs. They often feel that they are unable to give their best to their work while feeling guilty about leaving the person for whom they care at home. That may leave them feeling tired and listless and eventually may lead to them giving up their paid employment to focus solely on caring. That decision can result in feelings of resentment <place-holder colnum=\"26711\"/> and contribute to the stresses of their caring role, as they face a loss of income and social contact, which can destroy their happiness and that of the cared-for person.</p><p>With appropriate support, it might not be necessary for a carer to give up their paid employment entirely. If more employers were to adopt policies to support carers, many more would be able to cope with a dual role. Part-time working, flexible working time and irregular hours could be possible and could allow the possibility of a return to full-time employment should the caring responsibilities change or cease. Temporary unpaid leave at times of crisis could also be of immense help to carers and allow them to return to work once a crisis is over. Employers of all kinds need to be more aware that they are likely to have unpaid carers among their employees and that they have a role in and responsibility for helping such people to balance work with their caring commitments.</p><p>The United Kingdom Government's Work and Families Bill introduces measures to help carers to access flexible working arrangements, and the action for carers and employment project to promote good practice among Scottish employers is to be welcomed. The Scottish Executive's policy of providing support structures for its staff, including flexible hours, part-time working, career breaks and special leave for family emergencies, sets a good example, which I hope will be followed by an increasing number of public and private sector employers.</p><p>Unpaid carers make an enormous contribution to the well-being of the country, both socially and economically. That contribution will increase as the population ages. Those carers deserve public recognition for their work and all the support and help that they need to cope with their responsibilities without damaging their own health and welfare.

It highlights the difficulties faced by a small but nonetheless important minority of people in Scotland. In an age in which inclusiveness is the norm, and in which it is the intention of the Scottish Parliament to treat all sections of society equally, it is right that we should know about the inequalities that still exist. We should put pressure on the Executive to deal with those inequalities.</p><p>As members of this Parliament, we are lobbied regularly by minority groups with diverse physical and chronic health problems. Today we are hearing about muscular dystrophy; yesterday it was mental illness and deafblindness; and previously we have heard about multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and autism, to name but a few. The common thread linking all those conditions is the variable provision that patients experience when seeking the help that they need to lead as normal a life as possible within their physical limitations.</p><p>The problems faced by many of the groups are similar; the solutions often do not cost a lot of money, but they make a huge difference to the quality of life of those affected and their families and carers.</p><p>I received an e-mail the other day from a constituent in Aberdeen. He is a senior academic who suffers from a mild form of muscular dystrophy, and he said:<place-holder colnum=\"26610\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have found that quite simple and basic changes have allowed me to continue a full and productive life. There is no doubt in my mind that elimination of the current variation in services and provision of specialist support, such as optimal wheelchair allocation, would make a huge difference to the quality of life of an important population group within Scotland.\"</p><p>Wheelchair provision is probably one of the commonest concerns among the disability groups we hear from. Although there are many positive aspects to the wheelchair service, there are undoubtedly challenges too. A recent review of the service&#8212;at the end of 2005&#8212;found general agreement among users about the nature of those challenges. Waiting times for assessment are often too long; provision of equipment and repairs is delayed because of staffing problems; there is insufficient funding; and there is a failure to integrate facilities. All those problems are causing concern.</p><p>Some centres have very reasonable waiting times but others do not&#8212;especially for particularly dependent people who need specialised power chairs with special seating. I have seen quoted and know of a case in Aberdeenshire in which a child was assessed and measured for a wheelchair but, by the time it had arrived, he had outgrown it. That is not good enough. Such delays are not only a major blow for the service user, but wasteful of the valuable time of experienced staff, technical expertise and highly specialised equipment.</p><p>Patients feel that they are assessed according to what equipment is available rather than on the basis of what their requirements are, that there is limited choice of equipment and that when it is provided, it is generally of basic quality. The provision of follow-up services such as maintenance is often lacking&#8212;there are no routine follow-up, assessment or maintenance programmes. The location of service centres can result in people whose mobility is severely restricted repeatedly having to make long journeys, which they find extremely difficult. Moreover, there is no out-of-hours cover for repairs.</p><p>The time has come to bring together representatives from all the groups that seek our help to get them the aids and adaptations that they need to allow them to have the best quality of life that they can achieve. We must build up a detailed inventory of their common needs and try to co-ordinate the assessment of those needs and the provision and maintenance of the required equipment.</p><p>At a time when unprecedented sums of money are being poured into the health service, it is not acceptable that minority groups of citizens such as those with muscular dystrophy must lobby Parliament constantly simply to get the national <place-holder colnum=\"26611\"/> health service provision that they need and to which they are entitled. In NHS budgetary terms, we are not talking big money. Co-ordination, integration and some joined-up thinking could make an enormous difference to the lives of many people in Scotland who are living with disability.</p><p>I am more than happy to support Cathie Craigie's motion and the my life campaign, but I would like to extend my support to all the disability groups who seek our help.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Muscular Dystrophy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Cathie Craigie on bringing this motion to the Parliament.

I did not realise that I <place-holder colnum=\"26450\"/> had my mobile phone with me. That group of people forms a small proportion of the population.

The increasing deafness and visual impairment that often come with old age can lead to people becoming isolated, depressed and unhappy at being unable to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a world that seems to be passing them by. I had an uncle who became increasingly hard of hearing in his 80s. In his early 90s, he rapidly lost his eyesight due to age-related macular degeneration. Until then, he had played golf and bowls and had been able to drive. Mentally, he was as bright as a button but, because of his communication problems, he found it extremely difficult and depressing to keep up with what was going on around him. Indeed, he was depressed in the end. That was not helped by repeated delays in getting his hearing aids fixed when they went wrong. The pressurised audiology service was a major contributor to his frustrations and difficulties. That needs to be addressed.</p><p>I first encountered deafblind resources manager Drena O'Malley when I attended an event in Glasgow at the start of the Equal Opportunities Committee's inquiry on disability. I vividly remember the admiration and amazement that I felt at the communication skills that she displayed with the deafblind person to whom she introduced me. Such skills are rarely found. They can make such a difference to people with dual sensory impairment. Without the services of a trained guide communicator, I do not see how a deafblind person could possibly communicate with health service personnel at all, let alone if they were trying to get help with a mental health problem, when one-to-one dialogue can be all important.</p><p>I can be persuaded of the need for a specialist centre in Scotland, where staff have the skills to deal with deaf and deafblind patients who are also mentally ill. I also see a need for more guide communicators at a local level. The availability of staff with special communications skills is important for local psychiatric services, as the ability to access mainstream services in the community is key to the effective diagnosis and appropriate treatment of deaf and deafblind people.</p><p>We need an outreach service to help people.

Primary care services should supply the care and support needed to enable patients to cope with their chronic health problems at home or in their local communities and should encourage them to take responsibility for their own health. Such an approach reduces demand for secondary care and relieves pressure on hospital and specialist services.</p><p>Most people want the focus to be on local care. It is accepted that there are compelling arguments for highly specialised services to be available in a few centres of excellence, but there is a clear demand for as much health care as is reasonably practical to be provided locally.</p><p>However, if local delivery is to work, it will involve a great deal of workforce planning. People will have to get used to being seen by the practice team and not only by their GP; many allied health professionals may be involved in the care of a patient.</p><p>Recruitment is already a problem. GPs are hard to come by in some parts of Scotland. There are global shortages of specialists in a number of clinical areas, and there will be an escalating need for already scarce specialist nurses and various allied health professionals. There will be a need to <place-holder colnum=\"25750\"/> train generalists as well as specialists and GPs are being encouraged to develop special skills, for example in orthopaedics, dermatology and minor surgery.</p><p>Health boards are taking their first steps towards change. They are not all doing it at the same pace or in the same way. There are tensions between boards that are trying to rationalise services through amalgamation and centralisation and patients who want to retain their familiar local facilities.</p><p>Kerr says that the NHS in Scotland can meet the challenge of change by building a new relationship of partnership and trust with the public, but that is already being threatened by the proposed closure or downgrading of local hospitals. People do not accept that having to travel to a distant accident and emergency department because their local facility has gone represents progress.</p><p>The mums in Aboyne in Aberdeenshire will fight to the end to keep their midwife-run maternity unit, because they value the care that they receive in their community. Rather than accept closure because the local delivery rate is low, they want actively to promote their unit, as was done successfully at the Montrose unit in Angus, which is now a thriving unit that nobody would dream of closing. People want the local hospital to diversify and perhaps to provide chemotherapy, care for the elderly or minor surgery, but not at the cost of losing the maternity unit.</p><p>Compromises must be made. Not every facility can be available everywhere, but local input and co-operation are vital if Kerr's proposals are to be implemented successfully.</p><p>There is not time in such a short debate to deal with all the current issues of concern. The establishment and operation of the new community health partnerships seem to be variable, according to anecdotal evidence. Some CHPs appear to be working better than others. I would welcome an update on the matter from the minister.</p><p>There are still concerns that, whatever the minister has said to the contrary, the centralisation of specialist services will lead to the downgrading of units such as Aberdeen's neurosurgical unit.</p><p>As John Swinney said, in many areas there are serious problems with out-of-hours provision of primary care. The care that patients desire is often not available. Workforce issues are far from being resolved.</p><p>I want a health service in Scotland that is clearly focused on the needs of patients and is accountable to them, in which the primary care team, led by GPs&#8212;who are best placed to advise patients&#8212;determines, in conjunction with patients, <place-holder colnum=\"25751\"/> their journey of care within the NHS. The service would cease to be a monopoly provider, which is centrally driven and developed according to directives and targets. Instead, it would become a service that reacts to the needs and demands of its patients.

At a time when most of the publicity is about the Aberdeen western peripheral route, it is appropriate that we should discuss another part of the infrastructure.</p><p>If the debate receives the coverage that it deserves in our local north-east newspapers, it should highlight to those many citizens who seem to be unaware of it that the western peripheral route fits into an overall plan to ease congestion and speed up traffic flow in and around Aberdeen, to the ultimate benefit of the economy of the entire north and north-east of Scotland.</p><p>I will focus briefly and solely on the proposed new station at Kintore because I have had several representations on the matter in the past few weeks from people who have recently moved to Kintore or who are considering buying a house there. Kintore must surely be one of the fastest growing villages in Aberdeenshire. In just five years, its population has grown from just over 1,600 to over 2,500 and the village has completely changed its character from a traditional north-east village to an urban satellite of Aberdeen, with tightly packed streets of modern houses clustered round the historic village centre.</p><p>I had a look round the new developments last weekend and I saw at least two cars parked <place-holder colnum=\"25740\"/> outside nearly every house. Indeed, most of the houses have been built with double garages. Many of the owners commute daily to Aberdeen. Members should think of the effect of such traffic on the back road to Newhills, the Haudagain roundabout and Anderson Drive and consider the advantages to the environment if even half the cars from Kintore were left at home while their owners commuted by train. As Maureen Watt said, train travel is increasingly favoured by residents of Inverurie and Dyce, and Kintore people, too, want access to the train.</p><p>Surely it should be a priority to build a new station at Kintore and relieve pinchpoints on the outskirts of the city. A new station could be costly, because a passing loop of track would have to be installed alongside the existing railway line. However, I am pleased to see from the helpful NESTRANS briefing that NESTRANS classes the opening of Kintore station as a medium-term objective, which could be achieved by 2009&#8212;just three years from now&#8212;provided that resources are committed to the development.</p><p>When feasibility studies have been completed and NESTRANS has made the case for Scottish Executive investment to enable its proposed improvements to be implemented, I hope that Aberdeen crossrail will feature prominently in the Executive's proposed strategic projects review and that the Executive will approve the proposal. I hope that a station at Kintore will be an integral part of the project.</p><p>The benefits for local people and businesses, the easing of congestion in the city and the benefits to the environment would be significant.

I have many contemporaries who hold down responsible jobs, care for older relatives or young grandchildren and do myriad voluntary activities, such as delivering meals on wheels, staffing citizens advice bureaux and carers centres or going abroad to underdeveloped countries to provide vision or other aid. Some do university degrees and others enthusiastically pursue outdoor activities such as hill walking, sailing and golf&#8212;I am proud that I qualify for my half-price senior ski pass when I visit the Alps.</p><p>People in my age group and older have a lot to offer, but there are increasing numbers of us and, as we get older, more of us will develop chronic health problems such as high blood pressure, arthritis or macular degeneration. We are likely to live independently for far longer than previous generations and, by the time we need care, we will be very frail indeed in body and/or mind. There is a need to plan ahead for that increase in the elderly population and to change the nation's mindset from one that regards older age as a burden on society to one that recognises and seizes the contribution that older people can make. We are all individuals and we have to be treated as such, not lumped together as older people, pensioners, senior citizens or whatever else others may care to describe us as.</p><p>At the previous meeting of the cross-party group on age and aging, I listened to Jess Barrow, who is on secondment from Age Concern Scotland to the Executive to work on the strategy for an aging Scotland. She is putting huge effort into reaching as many older people throughout Scotland as possible and listening to their wide-ranging viewpoints. I hope that she will heed what they say. A successful strategy will result in older people becoming part of the mainstream of society and participating actively at all levels. I hope that the strategy will be effective and practical, not just another glossy publication that is produced in a blaze of glory and left to gather dust on a shelf. To be frank, we are too driven by strategies and targets but, if the strategy leads to more respect for older people, the removal of barriers to their participation in society and better-integrated services for them, it will be a good thing.</p><p>Not everyone, I am sad to say, is fit in older age. I will say a little about the many people who <place-holder colnum=\"24383\"/> develop a communication disability as a result of illnesses that hit them in later life and who need support services, which currently are inadequate&#8212;particularly those that are based in the community. In Scotland, 10,000 people a year suffer strokes, and 5,000 of them are left with impaired communication&#8212;including 1,000 who will have lifelong communication support needs&#8212;while there is virtually no communication support for the 60,000 people who have dementia. Many others have progressive neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, which add to the challenges of the normal aging process. Those are current figures, but they will rise as the population ages and as medical improvements lead to higher survival rates among people with chronic conditions.</p><p>The new strategy needs to contain the key objective of developing a strong, sustainable communication infrastructure for older people with communication support needs. That infrastructure should include speech and language therapy and communication-accessible leisure and transport. To assess what is needed, it would be extremely useful if today's older people with impaired communication could be involved as a group in the current consultation process. Untold benefits to the quality of life of such people in the future could be delivered if their opinions could inform the strategy. I am pleased that, together with the communication impairment action group, the Minister for Health and Community Care has initiated research in that area. I look forward to the results of that research in due course.</p><p>There are some issues relating to care packages for the elderly that need attention urgently. Councils that charge older people who have been assessed as requiring free personal care for the preparation of food are going against the intention of the law that that should form part of free personal care. We have been assured by the First Minister that the people concerned have a right to free personal care as soon as they are assessed, so councils must be stopped from charging for that. A delay in carrying out needs assessments before providing the appropriate care package as a result of insufficient funding is common in councils across Scotland. That needs to be addressed, perhaps by moving to one unified budget to deliver seamless, effective and appropriate delivery of health care.</p><p>Fuel poverty, pensions, council tax and transport: there are far too many issues to deal with in a short speech, but they all have a huge impact on the lives of older people, and they all need to be addressed. The challenges before us are great, but I hope that the strategy, when it is developed, will go some way towards enabling people in Scotland to grow old both happy and fulfilled.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13358698", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aging Population Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My parents, who were nearly 40 when I   was born, brought me up on the maxim that age is an attitude of mind, which is quite relevant to the debate.

The outcome at the end of the day might or might not be what those people want, but at least the board is listening to their point of view and debating the issues in a transparent manner. That is what appears to be lacking in Lanarkshire, where the board has unilaterally dismissed the status quo as an option without consulting the public.

Whether as a result of natural disaster, conflict or corrupt government, there are still huge numbers of people suffering from severe malnutrition. Maternal, infant and child mortality rates are unacceptably high in many countries, and life expectancy is very short in much of sub-Saharan Africa as a result of the modern scourge of HIV/AIDS.</p><p>Scotland's involvement with Malawi has brought home to us the seriousness of the health problems that face such impoverished countries. With more than 65 per cent of its people living in poverty, and a further 27 per cent in extreme poverty, Malawi is among the 10 poorest countries in the world. Almost unbelievably, life expectancy there has fallen by 10 years since 1990&#8212;from 48 down to 38&#8212;due to causes that are largely preventable. Maternal mortality in Malawi is the third highest in the world and cultural behaviour, coupled with a lack of resources and economic opportunity, makes women particularly susceptible to poor health.</p><p>An annual population increase of 2 per cent in a country that is short of midwives, obstetricians and equipment has resulted in an infant and child mortality rate that our society can scarcely comprehend. The steps that the Scottish Executive has taken in recent months, following last year's launch of the Scottish Malawi appeal fund, are to be commended, but there is still a long way to go.</p><p>The improvement of maternal health is a millennium development goal of the United Nations, which aims to reduce maternal mortality by 75 per cent between 1990 and 2015, but huge effort is still required if that is to be achieved. It is estimated that reproductive health care is needed for 200 million women worldwide who have no access to safe contraception, and more resources and trained medical staff are badly needed in many developing countries. The necessary services will not be provided without significant help from the world's developed nations and it is our moral duty to provide at least some of the help that is required.</p><p>As we have heard, poverty is not confined to third-world countries. Even in Scotland, the impact of poverty&#8212;albeit relative&#8212;on our nation's health can be observed. We can all point to areas of deprivation in Scotland today and we know that there are pockets of severe deprivation in rural and even in affluent communities. It is shocking that eight out of the 10 authorities in the United <place-holder colnum=\"24085\"/> Kingdom with the lowest male life expectancy are here in Scotland. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation report \"Monitoring poverty and social exclusion 2003\" showed that, proportionately, there are more premature deaths in Scotland than there are in the rest of Britain; that mortality rates among the under-65s in Scotland's most deprived districts are twice as high as they are in the least deprived districts; and that, at the other end of the age spectrum, Scottish five-year-olds have an average of two and a half missing, decayed or filled teeth, whereas children in the south-east and the west midlands have just one such tooth.</p><p>Everyone was quite shocked by the map that was published last month that showed the postcode differences in the incidence of cancer in Scotland. Men in some areas are almost three times more likely to develop lung cancer than those who live in other parts of the country. The rate in Glasgow, where 145 out of every 100,000 men have lung cancer, is the highest, whereas the rate in Shetland is just 54 per 100,000. Those figures&#8212;it is clear that they are related to the high prevalence of smoking in deprived areas&#8212;are a stark example of the need to encourage lifestyle changes in today's Scotland. Thankfully, we do not have the problems of extreme poverty that are found in third-world countries, but we still have a long way to go in tackling the health inequalities that prevail in early 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13357904", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Make Poverty History"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It must be a matter of concern to any civilised society that poverty is still a global problem in the 21 st century, and I would like to touch briefly on a few of the health problems that arise from it.

It must have caused quite a stir. I can imagine my granny&#8212;if she was aware of it&#8212;being quite shocked that women could promote themselves in such a way, when they normally got on quietly with doing the bidding of their men.</p><p>My granny's life was fairly typical for the Scotland of her time. She was widowed early, lost a child in infancy and reared the other nine in a two-bedroom flat with no bath, a toilet halfway down the stairs that was shared with neighbours, and a wash-house with a stone boiler, scrubbing board and mangle. The fire was always lit, the grate was black-leaded every day, and there was always a pot of soup on the hob. Hers was a hard life that none of us would care to emulate.</p><p>My mother&#8212;a highly intelligent woman whose nose was forever in a book&#8212;had no formal education after the age of 14, when she began working to help to support her younger siblings. She and my dad skimped and saved all their married life to ensure that I got a proper education, achieved my intellectual potential and could, therefore, expect to enjoy a more comfortable and prosperous life than they did. When my children were very young, my mum looked after them regularly for me, so that I could fulfil the part-time medical career for which I opted.</p><p>What a difference in a couple of generations. However, we all know that there is still a long way to go if the women of today are to achieve parity with their male counterparts in many spheres of life and in many parts of the world. In this country, if today's young mums want to work, they often have to juggle cr&#232;ches and childminders because the grannies&#8212;women like me&#8212;are also working, and much of their salary goes to pay for the child care that they need. Many women today have had a good education, are well qualified academically and have well-paid employment that they thoroughly enjoy. They are highly skilled <place-holder colnum=\"23754\"/> managers, interweaving their professional lives with the responsibilities of running a home and rearing their children.</p><p>However, many other women work in poorly paid jobs, not because they want to but because they have to, either because they are lone parents or because of financial commitments that are too great for one wage to cover. Some are overqualified for the work that they do, perhaps because low-waged part-time work is all that they can get to fit in with their domestic commitments. Others have simply not achieved their educational potential, either through lack of ambition or through missed opportunity.</p><p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it is simply not acceptable that those women are not achieving their potential; nor is it right that the average female weekly wage is only 88 per cent of the average male weekly wage. When we hear that the gender pay gap in the civil service has increased in recent years by 3 per cent to 25 per cent, it is high time that action was taken.</p><p>The professions of law, medicine, dentistry and the like have many well-qualified women in their midst; indeed, women now comprise more than 50 per cent of graduates. That brings its own problems for workforce planning because, rightly, women want to combine their professional careers with bringing up a family, and they want career breaks or part-time work to achieve a satisfactory work-life balance.</p><p>There are many other areas of employment in which women could have extremely successful careers if they thought about it. For instance, there is an enormous lack of qualified engineers in the North sea oil industry, in which the average age of the workforce is over 50 and not enough young people are coming forward to replace those who are retiring. Very few girls see that as a career possibility, because the stereotypical engineer worked in heavy industry, in a dirty and rough environment. However, many engineering jobs today involve the use of computer skills and high technology in a clean and pleasant environment, and they are highly paid. I know two girls who have trained as a plumber and an electrician. They are highly regarded by their customers and are in great demand. They take enormous pride in their work.</p><p>The multiple skills that women develop through running a home and rearing children make them excellent organisers and well positioned to set up their own businesses, which are increasingly run from home with the help of modern technology. More women should be encouraged along that route. There are great employment opportunities for women today, but if they are to be seized, girls must be made aware of them early in their schooldays and grow up confident in the <place-holder colnum=\"23755\"/> knowledge that gender stereotyping is no longer acceptable in the working world.</p><p>Of course, not every woman wants to work. No mum should feel guilty if she would rather be at home with her children. The early years are short and precious, and I am very glad that I was able to share them with my children through a combination of career break and part-time work. Families must be given support to lead the lifestyle of their choice. In the words of the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, we should be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Providing financial support for families who use childcare\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Increasing the choice of childcare available to parents.\"</p><p>Parental leave, too, is important for today's often isolated families, although it is costly to employers&#8212;especially those who run small or medium-sized businesses. I am sorry that the Conservative amendment to the Work and Families Bill at Westminster was defeated, as it would have ensured that the Government would cover the cost of statutory parental leave for businesses with fewer than 50 employees.</p><p>In today's world we must strive to ensure that everyone&#8212;male or female&#8212;can achieve their potential. We cannot allow the continuation of a pay gap between men and women who do equivalent work and we must make girls aware, from an early age, of the many opportunities that are open to them.

Following this morning's self-congratulatory press conference, it is no surprise that the minister is in good fettle this afternoon. After the previous two speeches, my head is reeling with confusing statistics.</p><p>To be fair to the Executive, there have been significant achievements in the NHS. Over the past decade, there has been a 38 per cent drop in premature deaths from coronary heart disease. Cancer deaths are down by 8.5 per cent, with an improved prognosis for most types of cancer. By next year, spending levels in the NHS will be up by 89 per cent since 1997&#8212;a huge financial investment by any standards. Of course, that trend was started by the previous Conservative Government, which put major investment into human resources in the NHS and into hospital <place-holder colnum=\"23526\"/> building. I hope that the minister will be gracious enough to acknowledge that.</p><p>Despite today's encouraging figures, all is not well in the NHS. There are stark health inequalities between the rich and the poor. Although most patients with waiting time guarantees are now being treated within target times, there are still&#8212;as we have just heard&#8212;more than 35,000 patients without such guarantees, most of whom have been waiting for more than six months. According to Audit Scotland, the total number of people who are waiting for in-patient or day-case treatment has changed little.</p><p>We all know of local NHS facilities that are being closed or threatened with closure, against the wishes of local people who are vociferous in their opposition to what they see as centralisation of services that they hold dear.</p><p>By no means are all the Executive's targets being met. According to recent figures, only three quarters of cancer cases are being treated within the target of two months. That results in great anguish and worry for the remaining 25 per cent of patients.</p><p>Despite a target of reducing excessive alcohol intake, recent figures have shown that alcohol-related deaths have gone up by 21 per cent in the past five years and there has been a huge increase in emergency admissions for chronic liver disease and its complications.</p><p>Delayed discharge from hospital is still a problem because many councils do not have enough funding to provide care packages for the elderly patients who need them. That is despite the pledge that by 2005 all those with unmet need for free personal care should be identified and receiving the services that they need.</p><p>I am told that nurse recruitment is on target to bring 12,000 new nurses and midwives into the service by 2007, but that will only replace the nurses leaving the NHS and will not allow for the expansion in the nursing workforce that is needed if the delivering for health programme is to be achieved. That is a matter of great concern to the Royal College of Nursing.</p><p>There is a significant shortfall of capacity within Scotland's NHS. Admittedly, the Executive has begun to tackle that by entering into partnerships with the independent sector, but it has done so only in the past year or so. It has taken all this time to get back to where the Conservative Government was in the late 1980s when we started to use spare capacity in the private sector to treat NHS patients&#8212;and we were not half lambasted for that by the Labour Party of the day, which continually accused us of privatising the NHS, just as the Scottish National Party and <place-holder colnum=\"23527\"/> Scottish Socialist Party accuse the minister of that today.</p><p>According to Audit Scotland, the Golden Jubilee national hospital is still not being used efficiently. There are marked geographical variations in its usage, not because patients do not want to travel there&#8212;50 to 60 per cent of patients who were surveyed by Audit Scotland said that they would be willing to travel for treatment&#8212;but, as we know, because some health boards do not encourage their patients to go there. I was pleased to hear the minister's response to Mary Scanlon when she intervened on that point. Why did it take from 1999 to 2002 for the hospital to be used for NHS patients at all? Why did the hospital have to be bought at a cost to the taxpayer of many millions of pounds before the Executive would even consider using it for NHS patients? That money could have been used for patient treatment.</p><p>Short-term measures that were put in place under the Executive's waiting times initiative have been successful in helping to meet targets and to clear the backlog of patients who have been waiting a long time. However, as Audit Scotland stated,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Over-reliance on short-term measures, such as staff working in the evenings and at weekends, can be expensive\"</p><p>and does not address the balance between demand and capacity.</p><p>What about NHS staff, who nearly all work flat out to try to meet patients' needs and to deliver a good service? By and large, the people to whom I speak are fed up with having to work under pressure to meet targets set by central Government that often get in the way of their professional judgment. Every time that I visit a hospital or meet a doctor or nurse, I am asked, \"Why don't they lay off? Why don't they get rid of these targets and let us get on with our jobs?\" I am convinced that until patients are given more choice and control over their care and until health professionals are allowed to plan their work according to clinical priority rather than to satisfy Government targets, morale will remain low; recruitment and retention will continue to be a problem; and patients will continue to wait unnecessarily for appropriate treatment when it is required.</p><p>The minister has certainly achieved some good results, but to do better he will have to loosen the reins.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"You have to move faster in reforming public services, as the Prime Minister has done in England. You have to crack down on failing services, work even more closely with the independent sector, and extend choice in a much more ambitious way. Trust people, and drop the paternalistic idea that the state should provide a gradually improving uniformity\".<place-holder colnum=\"23528\"/></p><p>Those are the words of the minister's colleague Jim Murphy MP, not mine.</p><p>The NHS is a mighty animal, but it would be better controlled and developed by the light hand of professionals rather than the heavy hand of politicians.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-3990.1, to leave out from \"welcomes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the progress in eliminating the longest waits; is concerned, however, at the corresponding rise in patients with Availability Status Codes who are not guaranteed treatment within the waiting times target; notes that the extra money going into the health service has not been matched by corresponding increases in productivity; further notes that, despite the efforts and hard work of the NHS staff, patients are not receiving the level of service they demand and deserve because of insufficient capacity to meet demand; is concerned by the stark health inequalities existing between each end of the social deprivation scale, local health service facilities being closed against the wishes of local communities and a slow adoption of new drugs and technologies, and believes that Scotland needs to move to a system with greater responsiveness to the needs of individual patients and communities, put power back in the hands of professionals to prioritise treatment by clinical need and increase the capacity available to treat NHS patients by extending the use of the independent sector.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356643", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has been quite a build-up to today's debate.

As the motion suggests, we are sitting on a time bomb. I have not signed the motion, not because I disagree at all with its general content, but because I would prefer to see in it a greater emphasis on parental responsibility.</p><p>As our society has changed, we have all become used to eating more fast food. Parents and children have less time together. These days, many do not sit down to eat together, and it is all too easy to pick up takeaways or ready meals to put in the microwave. Children, as well as adults, lead fairly sedentary lives in front of computers and television screens, and parents are afraid to let their children walk to school because of traffic dangers or to play outside for fear of abuse by strangers. As a result, over the past 20 years, the <place-holder colnum=\"23097\"/> number of overweight and obese children in the UK has risen steadily.</p><p>The shocking truth in today's Scotland is that obesity now affects children as young as three and a half. As Elaine Smith said, a third of 12-year-olds are classed as overweight, with 19.4 per cent deemed obese and 11.2 per cent deemed severely obese. Those figures are appalling. Scotland is recording rates that are twice, four times and five times higher than the projected UK average.</p><p>As we know, children who are overweight tend to become overweight adults and have a higher risk of developing serious health problems in later life. With type 2 diabetes now appearing in teenagers, we face a very serious problem.</p><p>There needs to be an awareness of the damaging effects of poor diet and insufficient exercise. In my opinion, it is the responsibility of parents to provide balanced, nutritious meals for their children and to encourage an active lifestyle. I believe that a more wide-ranging education programme needs to be more readily available to parents before a child is born.</p><p>I totally agree that breastfeeding gets children off to the best possible start and should be encouraged wherever possible. Public health nurses, midwives and other nursing staff are well placed to offer advice and information to parents and their children on how to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Good food need not be expensive to provide, if people know how to budget and cook. Parents need to be shown how to do that.</p><p>My granny used to buy a cheap cut of meat, to boil it in a pan to make soup, to serve it cold for two days and to make stovies on the final day. That sort of thing did not cost a lot of money and she brought up a family of 10 healthily on it. Young mums do not know how to do that. Perhaps we should show them how.</p><p>Supporting families and communities to live in a healthier way requires a community development approach and it can take time to succeed. Schools, too, have a part to play in reinforcing the healthy message. However, I do not think that that should be done through Government direction. Schools, with the agreement of parents, should be free to choose how best to deal with the issue, which might be by banning vending machines that sell junk food or by increasing the amount of physical activity for each child and employing more sports and PE teachers.</p><p>The role of school nurses should be supported further, so that they can give effective advice on public health issues. The Royal College of Nursing's school nursing survey found that nine out of 10 school nurses do not have the time to do the amount of health education with children that <place-holder colnum=\"23098\"/> they wish to do. That problem must be addressed. Primary care health professionals also need more time and motivation to deal with the obesity problem in children.</p><p>The alarming increase in childhood obesity that is now apparent&#8212;some children who are not even old enough for school are obese&#8212;means that there must be a greater drive to educate those who are responsible for children, particularly parents, at the earliest possible opportunity. It takes time for cultural change to develop, but I agree with Elaine Smith that in Scotland today we have no time to lose.

The Conservatives welcome this complex and important bill, with its separate provision for, first, organ and tissue donation and, secondly, the retention of organs and tissues at post mortem.</p><p>The new framework for organ donation and transplantation at post-mortem examinations and the associated removal, retention and use of body parts should go a long way to ensuring that the wishes of the deceased and their families are respected. It should in future spare bereaved families the distress that was caused to relatives in the past by the discovery that their loved ones' organs had been removed at post mortem and retained without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>The updating of the provisions in the Anatomy Act 1984 on anatomical examination and the public display of bodies and body parts is welcome, too. We had concerns about the lack of clarity of the bill as introduced on biomedical <place-holder colnum=\"22993\"/> research and its proposal of an overly restrictive licensing system to control public display. However, the Executive dealt with those worries at stage 2 and we are happy with its amendments. We are satisfied that the Executive has gone a considerable way to acknowledging the need for clear definitions of \"tissue\", \"organs\" and \"body parts\", so that people who sign authorisation forms are sure about exactly what they are authorising. That is an important part of fostering trust between the medical profession and the public and we welcome the minister's response to the concerns that were raised.</p><p>With regard to organ donation and transplantation, we are pleased that authorisation by a potential donor cannot be overruled by relatives after the person's death because we feel that it is important that the informed consent of a donor is respected. The strengthening of the opt-in system, coupled with the intention to promote, support and develop programmes of transplantation that is clearly expressed in the bill, should help to increase the level of organ donation, without progressing us to the point&#8212;at this time&#8212;of having the opt-out policy that exists in Spain, which was promoted in some of the amendments that we considered earlier. As I have said on previous occasions, even in Spain it is acknowledged that the most important factor for the identification of donors is not the opt-out system but the availability of staff in hospitals who are responsible for identifying possible donors.</p><p>Valid concerns have been expressed to me that the bill does not provide a fail-safe mechanism for ensuring that the wishes of those people who object to donation are respected. In cases in which the deceased person has not made known their wishes prior to death, the bill allows for a soft form of presumed consent; in other words, it provides for an opt-out system that is similar to the one that is used in Spain. The fact that it does not make provision for people who object to donation in general or to the donation of specific organs is of serious concern to some people who do not know their nearest relatives or who do not trust them to respect their wishes.</p><p>As I said during our consideration of amendments, the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics has stated that it is aware of a number of single people who are considering taking their names off the national health service organ donor register&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355347", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank all those who   gave evidence to the Health Committee.

They would give the choice actively to prohibit the removal of a body part as well as actively to authorise it. They address the potential problem that would face a person who does not know his nearest relatives and so cannot make his wishes known to them, or who does not trust them to act on his wishes. Without the amendments, such a person could not prevent unknown or unreliable relatives from making the decision to have body parts used after death against the person's wishes.</p><p>We feel that the absence of a fail-safe mechanism to allow people to record their wishes, whether positive or negative, is a cause for concern. The amendments would allow for everyone's wish to be respected and accepted, and would prevent an unethical situation arising should a decision go against the real wishes of a deceased person.</p><p>Apart from amendment 17, the amendments in the group are consequential on amendment 15. <place-holder colnum=\"22975\"/></p><p>They mirror the structure of the bill, so that each time the authorisation process is mentioned, the choice of prohibiting authorisation will also be mentioned.</p><p>The amendments do not apply to children who are under the age of 12, but they do apply to those who are aged between 12 and 16.

It makes it clear that the terms of the later authorisation should be followed. For example, if the first mandate stated that all organs could be donated following death, and then another was drawn up afterwards that stated that all organs could be donated apart from the corneas, the latter would be acted upon as reflecting the true wishes of the deceased person.</p><p>The amendments do not seek to introduce a register for prohibition because, as was made clear in evidence to the Health Committee, there are many ways of registering authorisation, whether through the donor register, verbally or in writing; therefore, neither should notice of prohibition be limited to a register.

If those over-the-counter preparations became free on prescription, the increased demand&#8212;estimated to be at least 22 per cent&#8212;would have a significant effect on GPs' workload.</p><p>The implications of abolition or substantial reform of the system are considerable. In particular, any NHS income that was lost would have to be replaced from other sources or made up from savings elsewhere. Removal or reduction of the price barrier would lead to the greater uptake of prescriptions and greater claims on the time of GPs and other professionals. There would also be a significant impact on the delivery of the minor ailment schemes that are being rolled out throughout Scotland.</p><p>Prescription charging has been a feature of the NHS throughout most of its existence. The Labour Government that removed charges in 1965 reintroduced them three years later due to financial pressure. The National Assembly for Wales's move towards phased abolition, which is based purely on a political decision, is as yet unjudged. I am told that the Italian Government is considering the reintroduction of charges.</p><p>The abolition of prescription charges is not the panacea that it may seem to be. We cannot support Colin Fox's bill, but neither do we regard the status quo as tenable. We will seriously consider the Executive's alternative options before we draw our conclusions on the best way to ensure equity of access to NHS prescription drugs for patients in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13354376", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abolition of NHS Prescription Charges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. I will not take any more interventions.

I also acknowledge the drive and enthusiasm of Kim Hartley and her colleagues in the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, as they doggedly strive to improve life for all those who have communication support needs. Kim is in the public gallery along with some of her colleagues. With the permission of the Presiding Officer, I extend a warm welcome to them.</p><p>Many people in Scotland suffer from impaired communication; there are probably around a quarter of a million of them, although there are no accurate figures, because many have not been identified. If the estimated numbers are right, the average Scottish constituency will have about 3,000 affected people.</p><p>People with CI have difficulty understanding the spoken and/or the written word and/or other non-verbal means of communication. They find it hard to express themselves and to find the language to communicate in a meaningful, appropriate or socially acceptable way. Of course, that affects their ability to interact with other people.</p><p>The number of people with hearing and visual impairment and their needs are quite well known, but there are many more with communication support needs, which arise from a wide variety of medical and physical conditions, such as strokes, head injuries, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions, autistic spectrum disorder, dementia, mental <place-holder colnum=\"22636\"/> illness, cerebral palsy, stammering and some cancers. All those conditions and more can result in communication difficulties to a greater or lesser degree.</p><p>Sufferers often feel discriminated against. Service providers and others who do not understand their difficulties might react with anger or scorn, or might ignore them altogether. They find it difficult to ask for help and are sometimes looked on as being incapable. They face discrimination by employers, who often have no understanding of CI or how people can be supported to cope with it and find it easier not to employ people with problems in the first place or to pass them over for promotion when they are employed. If an employee has a stroke that leaves even a mild speech impairment, it is often easier to write him off, rather than cope with his needs. As a result, many people with CI do not achieve their potential either in education or employment and have varying degrees of difficulty accessing and benefiting from services.</p><p>Most services are delivered through speech or the written word, including helplines and online services. Staff are not trained in alternative methods of communication and exclusion is the result for people who need them. There is a lack of awareness and understanding and little support is on offer, other than to those who are visually impaired or hard of hearing.</p><p>My encounter a couple of years ago with a constituent who has severe dyslexia first opened my eyes to the problems that people with CI experience. That man, who is now in his 40s, has had difficulty with communication for most of his life, but his condition went undiagnosed until seven years ago. Prior to that he found it hard to get employment and, as a result, experienced significant bouts of depression, which badly affected his lifestyle.</p><p>He came to see me because of on-going problems in accessing public services because of his inability to read and write. Council, national health service and Government offices all tried to communicate with him by letter and he, in common with many people in the same boat, simply cannot cope with that. Only last week he spoke to the local press in Aberdeen to highlight his problems. Now a cancer patient, he missed a recent hospital check-up, because he could not read the reminder about his appointment. He lives alone and, naturally, does not want strangers to see his medical correspondence, but he says that his repeated requests for voice messages have been ignored.</p><p>Public bodies such as the NHS know that they have a duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to contact patients by alternative means if they are known to have conditions such as <place-holder colnum=\"22637\"/> dyslexia, but that message does not always get through to those who work with patients. Raising awareness among staff is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>How can we help these people? Many resources are available to assist communication, but awareness and use of them is patchy. That must be improved. There is a need for good practice guidance on dealing with communication impairment for health, social care and other staff.</p><p>Although CI is common among all priority health care groups, there has been no attempt to generate a comprehensive, inclusive approach to identifying, prioritising or delivering the communication support that is needed.</p><p>The Scottish Executive has made significant financial investment in British Sign Language and English interpreters and, recently, in creating accessible general practitioner services for people with hearing difficulties, but there has been no investment in support or research for other groups with communication support needs.</p><p>Comprehensive research is needed to identify the number of people with CI and to find out from them what they regard as the priorities for change. There is a need for a Scotland-wide communication strategy to deliver appropriate support to everyone with impaired communication, so that they have the same opportunity as others to enjoy a good quality of life.</p><p>The CI action group presented a research proposal to the minister last August, which he welcomed enthusiastically before passing it on to the social research unit. However, five months later, there has been no response from the unit. I urge the minister to press the SRU for some concrete proposals regarding this important issue.</p><p>I hope that the debate will help to put CI on the map, will highlight the exclusion that is experienced by people who suffer from it and will lead to a better understanding of their needs.</p><p>Kim Hartley and her colleagues are doing their very best. The CI working group is giving what support it can. We now await the minister's response and look to him to ensure that the necessary research is supported in order to develop a proper strategy for action on communication impairment.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13354355", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Communication Impairment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have brought the motion before the Parliament on behalf of the short-life working group on communication impairment, or CI, as communication impairment is also known.

I was involved in the launch last year of the Scotland supporting the choice to die at home campaign, but I confess that until I picked up on Shona's motion, I knew little about the delivering choice programme in Lincolnshire or Tayside. The project is extremely important and could make an enormous difference to the terminal care of many people if and when it is rolled out throughout the country.</p><p>As Shona Robison said, death is an inescapable part of life. It is just as important to give people the best possible care through the process of dying as it is through the rest of their lives. By relieving pain and suffering and giving the terminally ill a sense of worth and well-being, good palliative care not only helps the patient to face up to the inevitability of death without fear, but helps relatives and carers to cope with the impending loss of a loved one and to be comforted in their eventual bereavement by knowing that death was made as comfortable as possible. If death can occur in the setting of the dying person's choice, that is of even greater comfort to those who are involved and looking on.</p><p>Before speaking to Susan Munroe of Marie Curie last summer, I confess that I had not realised that a very high percentage of people wish to die at home or that few of them achieve their wish. If the work that is under way results in many more people being granted their dying wish, that will be a wonderful outcome.</p><p>By aiming to develop round-the-clock models of patient-focused service that satisfies local needs <place-holder colnum=\"22398\"/> and gives patients and their carers the best possible care and support, and by providing a choice of place of death and good co-ordination of the agencies that are involved in terminal care, the delivering choice programme could become a role model that has an enormous impact on terminal care services and, in time, leads to patients fearing much less the process of dying, which I hope would allow the population to become less afraid of talking about death. Again, I agree with Shona Robison that we do not discuss the issue often enough.</p><p>The thought that has gone into organising the project's three phases is impressive. The development of models of service and their incorporation into local provision following a proper assessment of local needs and of the current state of services and then the testing and evaluating of those before the project is handed over and the findings are disseminated should contribute in a unique way to palliative care throughout Scotland and, in due course, should benefit people throughout the country.</p><p>I have seen at first hand the wonderful work that is being done in Dundee's Roxburghe House, Aberdeen's Roxburghe House and the children's hospice in Kinross. Those hospices and the other existing and planned palliative care services in Tayside can only benefit from the collaborative work that is being undertaken by Marie Curie Cancer Care, NHS Tayside, the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Tayside councils.</p><p>Marie Curie Cancer Care is to be congratulated on its innovative approach to improving the well-being of the terminally ill and their carers. I look forward to hearing about the success of the project in due course and&#8212;I hope&#8212;of its roll-out not only to my home area of Grampian, but throughout the country.

The Health Committee has, over the years, considered petitions and heard a huge <place-holder colnum=\"22047\"/> amount of evidence, most of it before either Carolyn Leckie or I became members of the Scottish Parliament. The result of the committee's deliberations from as far back as 2001 was that there was no case for a further independent inquiry that would focus mainly on exploring questions of alleged fault. The committee judged that such an inquiry would only delay consideration of whether and how financial and practical help could be provided to sufferers. The recommendation was made that such help should be awarded on a no-fault basis.</p><p>It took until last year for that to happen. As we know, however, on 5 July 2004 the Skipton Fund started processing claims from hepatitis C sufferers who had been infected by contaminated blood product transfusions&#8212;apart, of course, from those who would have been included but for the antics of the SSP.</p><p>This year, documents that came into the public domain show that there was a significant time lag between concerns being raised that potentially infected blood from American prisoners was being used and the cessation of the practice of taking blood from those people. Effective heat treatment to kill both the hepatitis C and HIV viruses was not available until 1987&#8212;three years after donations from prisoners were stopped.</p><p>In February of this year, the Minister for Health and Community Care offered to release all information that was held on file on hepatitis C. The minister stated that there was no new evidence in the files, that their contents had always been available to officials and ministers, and that all that was new was their release to the public.</p><p>As we know, the Executive still does not see the need for a public inquiry, on the basis that treatment was provided in good faith by health professionals at the time and that the ex gratia payments that are being offered to victims and their families fulfil the moral obligation to help them. Despite that, it is the Health Committee's intention, in response to pleas from campaigners, to hold an evidence session with the Scottish haemophilia forum and the Minister for Health and Community Care.</p><p>Unfortunately, this year the Department of Health in England admitted that relevant files had been destroyed. Of course, that led to the suspicion that there had been a cover-up to avoid the risk of large compensation payouts.</p><p>We on this side of the chamber are fully in sympathy with the affected patients and their families, and we understand why they continue to campaign vigorously for an independent public inquiry. However, as things stand, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party feels that the <place-holder colnum=\"22048\"/> speediest and best way of getting the answers that are needed would be for the campaigners to bring a test case to the courts. Indeed, if there is a case of suppression of information to be answered, it should be brought to law as soon as possible.</p><p>The costs of such a case would be considerable, but there is a parallel to the case that Mrs Margaret McTear brought in her bid to sue Imperial Tobacco over her husband's death from lung cancer. Her case was dealt with by a legal team on a no-win, no-fee basis, which overcame the issue of costly fees. We feel that a similar arrangement could be arrived at on a contaminated blood products case. We feel, too, that a court case would reach a clear decision in a relatively short time whereas a public inquiry would be likely to be very protracted and to lead to a series of recommendations that could take many years to work through.</p><p>Although we sympathise fully with the campaigners, we feel that a public inquiry is not the best option for the victims of hepatitis C caused by infected blood products.

However, I share the concern of a number of witnesses that the requirements for authorisation in the bill differ depending on the activity being undertaken. As the British Medical Association has pointed out, it is absolutely essential that doctors are clear about the requirements.

I hope that the Executive will accept that and will draw up separate forms for those aged under 12 and those aged over 12, for the benefit of those who are being asked to give authorisation. It is also important that appropriate information, guidance and support are available for bereaved families who are facing the decision on whether to authorise procedures in respect of their deceased child. I trust that the Executive will ensure that that happens in practice.</p><p>On organ donation and transplantation, I commend the bill's intention to promote, support and develop programmes of transplantation. I also note that the director of Spain's national transplant organisation has said that the most important factor in identifying organ donors is not having an opt-out system but having a person in hospitals who is responsible for identifying possible donors. With the legislative changes that the bill proposes and appropriate public awareness-raising campaigns, I would hope that the rate of organ donation in this country would increase without the need for an opt-out policy such as exists in Spain and some other European countries.</p><p>The bill's intention is that, if an individual carries an organ donor card or is on the NHS organ donor register, that will be regarded as authorisation and relatives will not be able to veto their intentions. Self-authorisation can be written, verbal or electronic and I am pleased that work is being done to put in place the necessary safeguards to enable us to ensure that the registrations are authentic.</p><p>Committee witnesses have expressed concern about people who object to organ donation or hospital post-mortem examination and about the fact that there is no adequate means of ensuring that their wishes are respected. That also applies to people who are willing to donate some organs for transplantation but not others, such as corneas, which quite a lot of people are reluctant to donate.</p><p>I agree with the committee that the absence of failsafe mechanisms to allow people to record their wishes, be they positive or negative, is a cause for concern that the Executive should consider. In particular, the bill should make reference to the NHS organ donation register, and consideration should be given to establishing a register of <place-holder colnum=\"21242\"/> people who specifically do not wish to be organ donors.</p><p>On transplants involving live donors, it is important to safeguard against coercion, particularly with regard to vulnerable people, such as children and adults with incapacity. Therefore, I am in agreement with the bill's prohibition of living donation by children under the age of 16, except in relation to regenerative tissue. I also agree with the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics that the provision should apply to adults with incapacity who have never had capacity. I was pleased to hear that the Executive will take into consideration the prohibition's impact on domino transplants involving children under 16 because, as it stands, the bill could result in a healthy organ, such as a heart from a child who has received a heart and lung transplant, being wasted.</p><p>The bill's provision to allow mature children over the age of 12 to authorise organ donation for transplant after their death or to give advance authorisation for a hospital post-mortem examination was generally supported by witnesses, provided that the children are given adequate information and support when they make such decisions. I hope that the minister will commit the Executive to giving specific guidance and training to the relevant medical professionals on that sensitive issue.</p><p>It is extremely important that the public be made aware of any new systems that are put in place. There will have to be an adequate public awareness programme, coupled with professional training for those who are involved in the system. Such public awareness raising will have to be done on an on-going basis, even though that will be costly, with repeated campaigns over time to ensure that successive organisations understand the systems that are in place for organ donation and post-mortem examination. Such things can be forgotten as time passes.</p><p>On the updating of the Anatomy Act 1984, in respect of anatomical examination and the public display of anatomical specimens, the minister's commitment to amend the bill to take note of the concerns of bona fide museums is welcome. I hope that the Executive will acknowledge the need to collaborate with the museums and other relevant institutions to further clarify the practical implications of the bill.</p><p>There are some other concerns that I share with the committee, but suffice it to say that given that those that I have not mentioned, as well as those that I have, will be considered and, I hope, dealt with during the later stages, I am happy to accept the general principles of the bill on behalf of the Conservative party and to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13350960", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Together with my fellow members of the Health Committee and everyone who gave evidence to us, I welcome the bill and support its general principles, particularly the provision of separate legislation governing organ donation and the retention of organs and tissue at post mortem, as recommended by the Scottish transplant group and the review group on the retention of organs at post mortem.

I was impressed by the large turnout and by the enthusiasm that exists throughout the community for the service, and by the obvious determination to convince Grampian NHS Board that the service must be continued.</p><p>It is important for women to be able to choose&#8212;within the limits of what is safe for them and their babies&#8212;where to have their babies. Clearly, there is a wish among west Aberdeenshire mums to have choice available in the form of local maternity services, which allows them to deliver close to home and to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of a small unit where they can get to know their new babies and receive one-to-one encouragement and support in establishing the breastfeeding routine that we all know gives babies the best start in life. In a small local unit, close relatives, other children and friends have the freedom to visit at less regulated times than those that apply in a big, bustling hospital unit. Furthermore, mother and baby are less likely to be exposed to the serious infections that, sadly, prevail in our larger hospitals.</p><p>Unfortunately, mums in other parts of Aberdeenshire no longer have that choice. A few years ago, it was decided that there were not enough births to support the retention of two units in central Aberdeenshire. After a big campaign, the Insch unit was closed and patients were directed to the Jubilee hospital in Huntly. That unit survived for a couple of years but, sadly, the birth rate there fell too, and reached a level at which the midwives did not feel that they were getting enough experience to maintain their skills. That unit withered on the vine and remains closed.<place-holder colnum=\"20946\"/></p><p>Aboyne is not like that; the birth rate there has been steadily increasing for the past year or two. It is no wonder that it has been, because there are many new houses in the area and young people are moving in from far and wide. The hospital, as we have heard, was totally refurbished a couple of years ago and is a modern and attractive facility in which mums feel welcome and well cared for.</p><p>Aboyne maternity unit is not only a good facility. As Mike Rumbles said, it is well placed to serve the needs of a fairly scattered and remote population in a part of the world where transport can be slow and hazardous, particularly in the severe winter conditions that can prevail in Braemar and beyond. It would be wrong for a thriving unit in such a situation to face closure, so I endorse fully the pressure that is being put on Grampian NHS Board to retain the unit. I hope that the minister will apply pressure, too.</p><p>I encourage former patients of the unit to spread the word to other mums and possible future mums so that people from upper Deeside and beyond have choice in where to give birth, which is no longer available to women in central Aberdeenshire.</p><p>I congratulate the save Aboyne maternity unit campaign on its magnificent efforts and I wish it well in its progress to what I hope will be a successful result.

The needs of an aging population, the growing instance of chronic disease, workforce planning issues brought about by demographic changes, the European working time directive, and public health issues such as our lifestyle and deprivation mean that the status quo is no longer an option and change is unavoidable.</p><p>The Kerr report, which looks to set the agenda in Scotland for the next 20 years, addresses the most fundamental issues that face the NHS today. We, like the Executive, are very positive about much of the report. We welcome its focus on primary care services, its recommendation that patients' health needs should be met as close to home as possible and its emphasis on the self-management of chronic disease. All those should decrease the need for secondary care and free up acute hospital services for those who are really in need of them.</p><p>It is much better for our many frail and elderly people to access health care in their communities close to home, to keep out of hospital and remain close by their friends and, in that way, to avoid the serious infections that are now, sadly, prevalent in many of our secondary care hospitals.</p><p>The proposal for rural general hospitals that are modelled on good practice&#8212;the Belford hospital in Fort William is an example&#8212;and the proposal for generalist and specialist training for health service staff are what people want to hear.

However, I would be very concerned indeed if Aberdeen were to lose its excellent unit. A significant <place-holder colnum=\"20040\"/> population north of Aberdeen as well as south of it depends on the unit for treatment.</p><p>To downgrade such a unit, as Kerr suggests, would have serious repercussions for local patients and for medical recruitment and training. Aberdeen has a very good medical school that I would not like to see undermined in any way. That is only one example; other specialties could be similarly affected.</p><p>Kerr's promotion of information technology and his recognition of the role that the independent sector can play are welcome. We are pleased with the Executive's stated intention to accept those proposals. We are concerned, however, about the implementation of Kerr's recommendations. A huge amount of workforce planning will be needed if the local delivery of health care is to be effective. Anticipatory care that reaches out to those who do not take care of their health has merit, but I hope that people will be encouraged to look after their health through education and that no coercion will be involved. Lifestyles will not change overnight and patients will have to learn gradually to take responsibility for their health and well-being.</p><p>People will have to adapt to major changes in service provision. They will have to get used to dealing with teams of health professionals instead of the general practitioner or consultant whom they routinely expect to see. Major publicity campaigns and education will be necessary before such changes become generally acceptable. The Executive let us down over NHS 24 and the GP out-of-hours services by not publicising them adequately before they were set up.</p><p>There must be enough NHS beds to cope with emergencies. Expensive new technologies will be required at community level if high standards of care are to be achieved locally. I do not imagine that the Kerr recommendations will be cost neutral.</p><p>Community health partnerships are not yet properly up and running across Scotland, and GPs and consultants will have to be encouraged to participate actively in them if they are to be effective. Problems with NHS 24 and the GP out-of-hours services are, as we all know, serious and will have to be overcome.</p><p>If patients have to travel to highly specialised units for diagnosis and treatment, it is essential that proper care and facilities are in place for their close relatives. I make that point on behalf of a constituent&#8212;a nurse in Aberdeen&#8212;whose son became paraplegic last year as the result of a motorcycle accident. The two-page account that she gave me of her bad experiences in the spinal unit where her son spent several months after his accident told of agency nurses in the unit who did not understand her son's condition; no adequate <place-holder colnum=\"20041\"/> accommodation for relatives near the hospital; no help with expenses, although both parents gave up work to be with their son; little communication or support from staff; no hospital shop; and poor-quality food for the patients in a run-down, dirty-looking building. I can let the minister see the account later. Her son, flat on his back immediately after surgery, was forced to try to get food into his mouth with the help only of a mirror placed above his head. All in all, it was a miserable, unacceptable experience for that family.</p><p>Close to tears, my constituent asked me whether I would quote her case today. She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Coping with my son's accident, injuries and paralysis was difficult enough, without all the travelling to and fro, and the problems we encountered. It was horrendous for us, and I would hate anyone else to have to go through what we did. Our son didn't have brain damage, but I cannot think how anyone could cope down there with that sort of injury.\"</p><p>That is the impact of centralisation on families of seriously ill people. It is difficult for such families to cope with. Where centralisation is unavoidable, proper support for patients and families must be provided. I ask the minister to take that on board.</p><p>The Conservatives have significant concerns about the implementation of the Kerr report, although we agree with much of it. It will come as no surprise that where we differ fundamentally from the Executive is that we do not think that Kerr's recommendations will solve the basic problems in today's NHS, which remains largely a monopoly provider. Decisions are made centrally by Government and the service develops according to directives and targets that are set by politicians. What I have seen of the Executive's response to Kerr gives me no comfort that that will change.</p><p>The Conservatives believe that the top-down approach must be overturned because, rather than improving performance, it has resulted in rigidity of the system and inefficiencies leading to low staff morale and dissatisfaction with the service. Patients need to be the driving force for the development of NHS services. They need to be given the resources to achieve that, and health care professionals need to be given far greater freedom to respond to patients' needs and wishes. That is why we support the development of foundation hospitals in the NHS. We firmly believe that such a change of direction, coupled with many of the Kerr recommendations, would result in the services that patients need, where they need them, and would in time result in a health service fit for the future, which is what we would all wish to achieve.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-3468.1, to leave out from \"of NHS boards\" to end and insert:<place-holder colnum=\"20042\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"to discuss the future structure of the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the report's emphasis on shifting the balance of care to provide more safe and sustainable local services, including intensive case management in the community for the most vulnerable; welcomes the commitment to tackle health inequalities by developing anticipatory care in our most deprived communities and applying the approach to benefit people wherever they live; however notes that, despite higher funding for the NHS in Scotland, too many patients are still having to wait too long for treatment; believes that a truly patient-centred NHS will only be possible if professionals are given the freedom to prioritise treatment by clinical need rather than by government targets and if purchasing power is put in the hands of patients so that their choices determine the development of the service, and, to that end, calls for the establishment of foundation hospitals within NHS Scotland and for continuing increase in the capacity available to treat NHS patients by extending the use of the independent sector.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347578", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I had not reached that part of the report for the reasons that I gave earlier.

I was also not aware of the close personal liaison between the staff and the companies&#8212;such as companies in the oil industry and marine sectors&#8212;for which they provide forecasts.</p><p>Now that I have been to the office, I fully understand the dismay in it that followed the Met Office board's recommendation early this summer to close the Aberdeen weather centre and to centralise the forecast production programme in Exeter. Met Office management contends that the forecasting process is becoming less dependent on human input and that it can therefore be centralised appropriately, with forecasters becoming more involved in service provision and helping users and customers to make the best use of the information that is provided. However, there is legitimate concern among staff that the closure of the Aberdeen weather centre will result in the removal from Scotland of the necessary skills and competence that are required to provide high-quality weather intelligence in this country for customers and stakeholders such as public utilities, local authorities, SEPA and BBC Scotland, not to mention the loss of the benefit to the public of severe weather warnings and accurate local weather predictions, which are important for the marine interests in the seas around Aberdeen.</p><p>The shipping forecasts, gale warnings and services for the fishing fleet that are currently performed in Aberdeen benefit from the significant marine expertise that has been built up by the forecast team in Aberdeen. It is hard to understand why there has been a proposal to close the Aberdeen centre only a year after those services were transferred from the Met Office's headquarters and were successfully absorbed by the Aberdeen team without staff increases. As we <place-holder colnum=\"19768\"/> have heard, that also resulted in increased accuracy in the gale warning service.</p><p>Of course, the Met Office has to keep its production costs under control, but many of those costs appear to be the result of central overheads, and the staff do not believe that closing the Aberdeen centre will reduce them. Indeed, they feel that a vibrant office such as that in Aberdeen can help to secure the future of the Met Office and its corporate aspirations. It is already profiting from commercial contracts with both offshore and Scottish businesses, which is helping to offset the cost to the taxpayer of weather services. The staff are convinced that direct investment in the Met Office's forecasting capability in Scotland would ensure the highest level of service and give the organisation the best financial returns.</p><p>The staff were also unhappy with the timing of the centralisation proposals; therefore, it is good that proper consultation was finally agreed and is on going. However, although the Met Office is revising its business case, its centralisation of services agenda seems unchanged.</p><p>I spoke to a Met Office representative at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool, from which I have just returned. I was heartened to be told by him that Don Touhig has, at this moment, a completely open mind and wants to hear the views of as many people as possible. My contact stressed the importance of receiving submissions from all interested parties by 20 October. I reiterate what Brian Adam said and urge anyone who has relevant input and has not yet responded to the consultation to do so as soon as possible.</p><p>I am glad that this debate is taking place, and I thank Brian Adam for securing it. I hope that we get the response that we want from the minister when he concludes the debate.

It was as if, through the investment of record sums of money in the NHS&#8212;which no one denies is happening&#8212;the setting of priorities and targets for delivery and legislation to ban smoking in enclosed public places, most of our health problems were nearly solved, and the promotion of healthy eating and lifestyles remained as the Executive's unfinished business. As David <place-holder colnum=\"18888\"/> McLetchie said in his response to the First Minister, the Executive gives the impression that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"passing a piece of legislation is tantamount to solving a problem.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2005-09-06.18810.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 6 September 2005; c 18810.]</citation></p><p>There is no doubt that introducing our young people to a healthy lifestyle should result in long-term health benefits, but that will not come about by an act of Parliament. As the First Minister said, schools are already taking action to ensure that healthy foods are available in canteens and tuck shops. Many are providing fresh fruit and chilled drinking water, which is how things should be.</p><p>The aims of the hungry for success programme, which is to receive further investment, are laudable. The programme aims to ensure that children are provided with healthy school meals, but I sound a note of caution that is based on a visit that I made to a rural school during the recess. There was concern there about the implementation of the project. The menus are set centrally, the purchasing of ingredients is closely monitored and the cooks find that there is little scope for them to give a little extra food to very hungry children or to provide an occasional little treat for a special occasion. We all know that children's appetites vary and that a hungry child is not necessarily an obese child. I am concerned that if children are left hungry after their school lunch, they will top up later with crisps, sweets or whatever unhealthy option will satisfy their hunger. The school cooks to whom I spoke were experienced and the food that they produced was tasty, but they were not happy with the rigid controls that were being placed on them. It is clear that they were losing some of their job satisfaction as a result.</p><p>For years now, we have said that top-down control is not the answer. Government at all levels should set policy and leave its implementation to people who understand the practicalities. The centralised, target-driven control of the health service in recent years has spawned more than 1,100 more senior NHS bureaucrats than there were in 1999&#8212;according to figures from the information and statistics division&#8212;and they must be absorbing a significant proportion of the resources invested in the system. Despite that, the ISD figures show that there are nearly 7,000 more out-patients waiting more than a year for treatment, with waiting lists and median waiting times for out-patients and in-patients all up significantly.</p><p>I speak to many health service professionals who are desperate to be released from targets and management. Patients want to retain their local services. They want to be confident of receiving help if they are struck down with pain or sickness out of hours, not to have to endure hours of waiting for a response from NHS 24. It is not right <place-holder colnum=\"18889\"/> that my friend's sister had to endure the agonies of renal colic throughout the night until the right medical help was directed to her the next day. It is not right that a surgeon's operating list is scrutinised by a manager who removes a major case from the list and replaces it with three or four minor ones to improve waiting list figures; the surgeon's clinical judgment is overturned and the patient's major operation is delayed for reasons of expediency.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13344754", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday morning, I sat with my pencil poised during the health section of the First Minister's statement.

If Government were prepared to let go of the reins and put patients and primary care advisers at the heart of the NHS, as the Kerr report advises, and if it let the service develop in response to patient choice, as we have consistently advocated, with professionals free to exercise their professional judgment, I have no doubt that we would see a more responsive and more efficient health service that people were eager to work in. Change in the system would be evolutionary and would avoid the regular disruptions that are caused by tight political control from the centre.</p><p>To be fair, the Executive has recently moved some way towards that by allowing cross-border movement of patients between health boards, by at last looking to use non-NHS facilities to deal with NHS patients who are waiting too long for treatment, and by promising to introduce diagnostic and treatment centres. However, there is still a long way to go. There are major problems with NHS 24, with out-of-hours provision, particularly in remote and rural areas, and with recruitment and retention of medical, nursing and allied professional staff, not to mention dentists. Although the establishment of community health partnerships is progressing well in some health board areas, I am told that it is not happening so well in other areas. Of course, we still await the Executive's response to the Kerr report.</p><p>With all those major health issues facing the Executive today, I am amazed that the First Minister did not say more about health yesterday. Could it possibly be that he is listening to us, and that we will eventually get a health service that is run by professionals instead of Government, that he will do a U-turn like the one on business rates that was announced yesterday, and that he will <place-holder colnum=\"18890\"/> release the NHS into the hands of patients and their advisers?

However, in the past two years or so, I have learned a great deal from the parents of affected children and others who care for them, such as the highly trained teachers at St Andrew's special school in Inverurie in Aberdeenshire and the dedicated staff at Camphill, which is near my home on the outskirts of Aberdeen.</p><p>People on the autistic spectrum vary enormously. They include not only those who have very minor communication difficulties and the often highly intelligent individuals with Asperger's syndrome&#8212;who may be seen as somewhat eccentric and obsessional but are otherwise quite normal&#8212;but those who are very severely affected, with extremely complex needs. Such people require highly specialist handling, peaceful surroundings and well-established routines if they are to have any hope of thriving and of reaching their potential, however limited that may be.</p><p>However, those are also the sort of people whose lives are threatened by the possibility of Aberdeen's western peripheral road passing close to their homes at Camphill. I am delighted that a delegation from Camphill will come to Holyrood once more tomorrow to put their case to MSPs and to gain further publicity for their campaign to have the proposed road rerouted. The western peripheral road is desperately needed, but it should not use a route that would so disrupt the lives of the very vulnerable folks who know no other home than the peaceful retreat of Camphill village. I realise that I am digressing a little from the motion, but tranquil surroundings are part of the package that is required to fulfil the needs of the people that I have described.</p><p>Speech and language therapy, and the diverse other therapies that are provided by a range of associated health professionals, are also required by such children. However, in the north-east at least, such therapists are in short supply and their lack puts added strain on parents and carers who are coping with tremendous problems every day of their lives as they struggle to do what is best for their children.</p><p>On top of that, many are faced with uncertainty of school provision, given the current climate in which mainstream education for all is often overzealously promoted. Having spoken to many concerned parents and teachers, I have no doubt in my mind that mainstream education is not the answer for all autistic children. Some cope well and can move successfully from special educational needs to mainstream provision and others benefit from attending an SEN unit that is attached to a mainstream school&#8212;as I have seen in north Aberdeenshire&#8212;but there are, undoubtedly, significant and growing numbers of <place-holder colnum=\"18869\"/> autistic children who need special schooling if they are to have any hope of achieving their educational potential. I hope that authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council that have sought to close such schools and replace them with SEN bases that are attached to mainstream schools will think again before it is too late.</p><p>The wide diversity of ability in children with autistic spectrum disorders makes diversity of provision a necessity.

We hope that the Executive's reassurance that the new services will be at least as good as, if not better than, the present service will be justified in practice. Patients and stoma nurses are certainly not convinced that that will be the case.</p><p>We are very disappointed that the bill has not been amended to extend eligibility for ex gratia payments from the Skipton Fund to families of the victims of blood-product induced hepatitis C who died before 29 August 2003. That measure would have removed an obvious inequity, and the lack of any such amendment is a slap in the faces of the many people who have campaigned so tirelessly on the issue.</p><p>We cannot support the part 2 provisions on free dental checks and eye examinations. The most vulnerable people are already eligible for free checks; the problem is that many of them are the <place-holder colnum=\"18722\"/> very people who are not having them carried out. Instead of wasting valuable and scarce resources on people who are perfectly capable of taking personal responsibility for their own dental and eye health, we need to ensure that vulnerable people access the services that they need. Eyesight problems in children must be diagnosed and dealt with early. In accepting Duncan McNeil's amendment 64, which places a duty on ministers to provide for such diagnosis and treatment, and given the minister's reassurances, we are satisfied that the national screening committee's present and future recommendations will be implemented.</p><p>As for free dental checks, there seems to be little point in passing such legislation at a time when the NHS does not have enough dentists to carry out the checks or to provide the necessary treatment thereafter. Given dentists' lukewarm response to the Executive's recently proposed changes to the dental service in Scotland, it does not seem that the problem is any closer to being resolved.</p><p>On part 1, we are disappointed that the Executive has not taken a more reasoned approach to smoking in enclosed public places. In recent years, there have been great strides towards smoke-free provision. For example, buses, trains, airlines, many public buildings, workplaces and restaurants are now smoke free and pubs are beginning to follow suit. I have no doubt that that trend would, without legislation, have increased anyway in response to public demand.</p><p>During the bill's passage, there has been much discussion about the inability of ventilation systems to remove carcinogens from the air in establishments that allow smoking.

It is well known that the Conservative group considered that to provide free eye and dental checks for everyone by 2007 would not be the best use of public resources. Free checks are already available for people who need them and the difficulty lies in persuading those who are eligible to come forward and, in the case of dentistry, in finding sufficient national health service dentists to carry out checks.</p><p>With regard to amendments 63 and 64, no one could deny that it is important to pick up eye problems in children as early as possible. That is why I previously indicated my support for the screening of schoolchildren at primary and secondary levels. Since then, however, I have looked at the matter in some detail and have found that the situation is more complex than I had thought. There is little doubt that screening at age four to five is desirable, and I am glad that that will be carried out, but more research is probably needed before sensible recommendations can be made about screening for impaired visual acuity at secondary school level. As Duncan McNeil said, according to professional advice, the optimal age for screening, the most appropriate technique and the most suitable personnel to undertake it, as well as other factors, must all be investigated before a screening programme can be recommended by the national screening committee. However, I have a great deal of sympathy with Kate Maclean's amendment 63, and I share her concern that sight testing is apparently not currently taken into consideration in the medical model that influences the national screening committee. Duncan McNeil's amendment 64 to place a duty on ministers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to provide for the detection of vision problems in children\"</p><p>should ensure that future recommendations made as a result of research will be carried out.

It is still, largely, a monopoly <place-holder colnum=\"17781\"/> provider of health care, with decisions made by the Executive at the centre and services developing in response to directive and targets that are set by politicians rather than in response to the demands and needs of patients. Until that situation is reversed and patients, together with their GPs, are given the means to purchase their care where they choose to receive it, the Kerr proposals will be difficult to implement because the capacity in the system is not always where it is wanted and needed.</p><p>We have concerns about the report's implementation for several reasons. Current staffing problems are a major worry and will, at best, take many years to correct. Without local teams of health care professionals, local services simply will not be available. We are also concerned that the deficiencies in the NHS 24 service are putting patients at risk and causing them a significant amount of distress at times when they are vulnerable&#8212;not because of the staff who are operating the system, who are an extremely dedicated group of health professionals who are doing their best with inadequate resources, but because the system was not tried and tested adequately before it was rolled out. It has been unable to cope with the pressures that have been put on it as a result of the new GP contract and receives far more out-of-hours calls than it can deal with. That has resulted in long delays and call-backs for patients who seek medical help. The situation must be addressed at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Patients in many areas&#8212;especially rural areas&#8212;are unhappy with the new out-of-hours arrangements and do not understand why the changes were made or why the new GP contract has come about. When the GP contract was debated, I warned the then minister that it would be essential to explain the out-of-hours system to patients via a major public awareness and information campaign. However, he did not listen and left it to the health boards to do that job. That clearly has not worked.</p><p>We are also concerned that the technology and equipment for carrying out diagnostic tests in community hospitals and health centres may not materialise&#8212;especially given how, for example, Greater Glasgow NHS Board has struggled to replace its out-of-date computed tomography scanners despite ministerial pledges that that would be done. We also have serious concerns that care for the elderly in our communities will not be adequate unless and until the Scottish Executive allocates sufficient funding to allow independent care homes to expand their capacity or even just to stay open. The situation is already at crisis point and it will not improve until the Executive accepts the case for providing funding that matches the cost of care.<place-holder colnum=\"17782\"/></p><p>Although we are happy with much of what Professor Kerr recommends for the NHS of the future and are pleased that the Executive is, at last, abandoning its ideology and looking to the independent sector to expand health care facilities for NHS patients, we remain convinced that money that is poured into an unreformed NHS in Scotland will never produce the results that people expect and deserve. As long as everything flows from the top down, the service will be incapable of autonomous development. Centralised planning and micromanagement through targets and directives, in an attempt to improve performance, results in rigidity of the system, inefficiency and waste. Managers spend their time trying to deliver the centrally imposed targets on which they are judged and are accountable to their political masters rather than to their patients and the professionals who look after them. That leads to low morale among staff and dissatisfaction with the service.</p><p>That is not what patients want, and they are saying that loud and clear throughout the land. They must be the driving force for the development of services within the NHS. They must be given the resources to achieve that, and health care providers must be given far greater freedom to respond to patients' needs.

Several of those pupils went to St Andrew's from mainstream schools in which they had failed to cope. All their parents are full of praise for the progress that they have made at the school. Those parents are aghast at the prospect of the free-standing St Andrew's School's being replaced by support-for-learner bases that are collocated with mainstream schools, even if the bases are modern state-of-the-art units such as that which is attached to Banff Primary School or that incorporated in Banff Academy. Those bases are impressive and successful, but none of the pupils whom I saw at them has the complexity of disability that I have seen in St Andrew's and none has such severe autism. St Andrew's caters for children who meet the criteria for exceptions to mainstream education that are included in the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000 because such education would not suit their disabilities and aptitudes.</p><p>Other local authorities are building new stand-alone facilities.

Although the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 will not affect many people in this country, it will give to a small number of very vulnerable women and girls protection from an horrific practice that is endemic in some ethnic communities.</p><p>The procedures that constitute FGM were first outlawed by the Conservative Government in the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985. Essentially, part 1 of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill restates the provisions of the 1985 act but&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;replaces the euphemistic term \"circumcision\" with \"mutilation\", which describes much more accurately the barbaric practices that the bill will outlaw.</p><p>The creation of extraterritorial offences, which will make it unlawful to send someone abroad to have FGM carried out or for a United Kingdom national to perform FGM outside the UK, and the increased penalties for committing those offences should&#8212;coupled with the education of the communities concerned&#8212;lead eventually to eradication of the mutilating practices that are endured by girls and young women within those communities.</p><p>At stage 1, when I was still a member of the committee, the Equal Opportunities Committee expressed the concern, which I share, that a restriction in section 2(2)(a) of the bill made it an offence to aid and abet FGM overseas only if the victim was a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"United Kingdom national or permanent United Kingdom resident\".</p><p>Our concern was that many of the girls in this country who are most at risk of FGM would not be protected against being taken abroad to have the <place-holder colnum=\"17332\"/> practice done because they do not have indefinite permission to remain in the UK and would therefore not be covered by the definition of being a permanent UK resident. Such people obviously include the daughters of asylum seekers and students who are studying in this country. I am pleased that the minister managed to overcome the legal complexities that are involved in taking extraterritorial jurisdiction and agreed to remove the restriction in section 2(2)(a) so that those vulnerable people will be protected by law. That amendment to the bill is hugely significant, and is a great step towards protecting all girls from being taken abroad to be mutilated.</p><p>FGM is a deep-seated cultural practice in several African countries, the middle east and Asia. Its increasing appearance in the western world is usually among immigrant and refugee populations. As a rite of passage to womanhood and a requirement for marriageability, the horrendous practice of FGM is frequently performed at the hands of older women in the community who have themselves undergone FGM. To them, it is a necessary ritual that is perpetrated as an act of love to ensure the best future for their daughters and granddaughters. It will probably take generations to eradicate FGM, and it will require education that is reinforced by law to overcome such an entrenched custom.</p><p>There is broad consensus that FGM is a form of violence against women and children that should be eradicated internationally. Its health consequences are well documented, and the women who are affected suffer from many long-term health problems, as well as the immediate trauma that is experienced when FGM is performed. We all heard the minister at stage 1 quote the experiences of a victim who was put through the ritual by her loving mother. I have rarely been so moved or appalled by anything I have heard. The chamber was stunned into absolute silence that afternoon by the portrayal of such an horrific act of violence.</p><p>The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 that was approved by the UK Government gave protection against FGM to people who are resident elsewhere in the UK. The policy intention of our bill is to ensure that equal legal protection is afforded in Scotland. Thanks to the stage 2 amendments that were accepted by the minister, the bill will go further than the UK act to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, which is due in no small measure to the perseverance of the Equal Opportunities Committee in seeking to protect people who seek asylum within our shores.</p><p>I am happy, on behalf of the Conservative party, to give my full support to the bill, which will assist in the eventual eradication of a brutal act of violence that has for many generations blighted <place-holder colnum=\"17333\"/> the lives of girls and women in communities that have accepted it as part of their culture and heritage.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340966", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased that this important bill, which has attracted cross-party support throughout its parliamentary progress, has now reached the stage when it will soon become law.

The NHS of the future is going to have to cope with a greatly increased number of elderly people, many of whom will be very elderly and frail. From 17.9 per cent in 1998, the elderly are expected to make up 24 per cent of <place-holder colnum=\"17264\"/> the population by 2036. Several of us here, myself included, will be in that group. People are now living longer than at any other time in history. Many are healthy and active well into their eighth or ninth decade and many more are looked after with varying amounts of support in their local communities. By the time that they reach hospital, they tend to be very frail, with the complications of longevity, such as thin bones and dementia.</p><p>The people in that section of society, more than in any other, rely on appropriate and accessible health care. However, we know that older people have encountered significant problems with hospital care that range from delays in admission, poorly planned discharge and poor nutrition and hygiene care to the negative attitudes of or poor communication from hospital staff. We have also heard of incidents of abuse of the elderly, which can be physical or verbal or simply a case of failing to treat older people with the dignity and respect that they deserve.</p><p>Although the situation in some hospital wards is excellent, that is unfortunately not always the case. Various recent press stories have highlighted examples of the bad situations. I realise that the quality of care for older people in hospital is variable and that problems can occur in almost every aspect of a hospital stay, but patients and their relatives have highlighted several problems again and again. There is often a lack of assistance with eating and drinking. Young and even older members of staff can be abrupt or rude and, in the worst cases, patients' needs are ignored. Particularly vulnerable people such as those with dementia or those from ethnic minorities sometimes receive scant understanding of their needs. Older people often feel that, when decisions are taken about their care or treatment, their opinions are ignored or are not sought. It is all too easy for busy hospital staff to talk over or talk down to a frail elderly patient who might be visually impaired or hard of hearing.</p><p>Indeed, I have personal family experience of those problems. My elderly uncle was admitted to hospital for the flimsiest of reasons and was then moved from ward to ward as his bed was required for other patients. He became immobile and picked up MRSA and his discharge was delayed for more than a year. During that time, his wife, who fell and broke her hip when she was visiting the hospital, also had a prolonged hospital stay and, sadly, died very suddenly of an unrelated problem on the day that she was due to be discharged. My uncle eventually settled into a nursing home for a short time; however, he fell there and broke his hip. Because of a delay in treating the fracture, he died of pneumonia.

The author, Nicola Barry, vividly describes her experience of contact dermatitis and graphically portrays the commonest irritants that cause it. The article even includes a photograph of Helen Eadie. It is quite a coup for the member for Dunfermline East to feature in the Aberdeen <em>Press and Journal</em>.</p><p>The article highlighted what many people in Scotland experience on a daily basis. I will quote directly from the introductory part of the article. Nicola Barry says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Which part of your body would you least like to lose? Probably your hands. If you think about it, you use your hands for everything - washing, dressing, going to the loo, cooking, eating, typing, reading, writing, sewing. The list goes on and on. The fact is life without the use of your hands doesn't bear thinking about. I know. I've tried it.</p><p>At first the skin on my hands was just dry, a few cracks. I slathered on the moisturiser but the cracks still didn't go away. They felt itchy, raw, the skin broken and weepy ... I carried on using moisturiser, to no avail.</p><p class=\"indent\">There were other remedies, none very successful ... Every night I sat with plastic or cotton gloves filled with an assortment of moisturisers. It was distressing to say the least. To confound the problem, the cream went everywhere: on the sofa, all over the chairs, on every door handle, all over my clothes ... I started having trouble carrying things. It hurt ... I mean really hurt.\"</p><p>When out shopping,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I'd go into a dressing room to try on something, only to notice blood on the clothing. I felt like a freak.\"</p><p>That is a vivid description of one individual's personal experience of a problem that took months of GP visits and eventual specialist dermatological care to solve. The problem is multiplied throughout the country. Scotland has 80,000 new dermatology out-patients per year.</p><p>The common chronic skin diseases such as contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis and alopecia cause many thousands of people untold stress and misery. Skin Care Campaign Scotland has highlighted many of the problems that face those patients. Because skin disease is not classified as a chronic or long-term condition, it is not a priority in the new GP contract. GPs are concentrating on meeting targets on other diseases, to the relative neglect of skin conditions. Their training in dermatology is minimal&#8212;I remember that from <place-holder colnum=\"17225\"/> when I was a medical student&#8212;and only 1 per cent develops a special interest in the subject.</p><p>Prescription costs are prohibitive and the campaign is pushing for patients with chronic skin disease to be exempt from prescription charges. The long-promised review of prescription charging will have to consider many legitimate claims from chronic disease groups, but I hope that a system of exemptions will be devised that does not disadvantage such people, who require lifelong medication.</p><p>Patients with chronic skin disease need support and accessible services to help them to manage their disease. Trained specialist dermatology nurses are ideally suited to that role. At present, not enough of those nurses are available&#8212;indeed, many fields of medicine do not have enough specialist nurses. I fully support the Royal College of Nursing Scotland's right for nurses, right for patients campaign, which highlights the need for more specialist nurses to provide the service standards that patients deserve.</p><p>NHS funding has many competing demands, but chronic skin disease is so common that it deserves much more than the Cinderella status that it has had until now. I commend all those who are working to raise the profile of skin disease in the Parliament and I have no doubt that the campaign will continue until a better deal is struck for the many patients who struggle with this widespread problem.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340637", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skin Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Ken Macintosh on securing the debate.

It is five years, almost to the day, since my colleague David Davidson secured the Parliament's second members' business debate on the subject&#8212;five years during which north-east MSPs from across the political spectrum have raised the issue with ministers; five years of increasing traffic flow; five years of injuries due to road accidents; and five years of failure by the Scottish Executive to resolve the problem.</p><p>I fully agree with all those who seek a dual carriageway road all the way from Aberdeen to Peterhead, but I decided to focus on the stretch between Balmedie and Tipperty because of the increasing frustration and anger that is expressed by users of that stretch of road as they travel each day between Aberdeen and Ellon and beyond and because of the urgent need for an upgrade of the road to dual carriageway standard.</p><p>An electronic petition by Iain McDonald of Ellon attracted 2,606 signatures in the two months between 28 February and 30 April. That is by far the largest number of signatures that any e-petition to the Parliament has attracted to date. Anyone who has read the comments that the petitioners have added will know that the local community is incensed by the everyday hold-ups and delays that are caused by the stretch of road and is concerned about the regular toll of accidents and the near misses that are a daily occurrence. In the past 10 years, there have been about 100 accidents that have resulted in injury, which must surely give the Minister for Transport cause for concern.<place-holder colnum=\"16753\"/></p><p>As was pointed out in the previous debate on the issue, the Tipperty to Balmedie stretch of the A90 remains the only length of single carriageway between Ellon and Dundee, excluding the part of the road that goes through the city of Aberdeen. Cars and buses remain the only form of transport in that corner of Scotland. Park-and-ride schemes are gaining popularity, but buses, too, are held up on the single carriageway part of the road. The delays inevitably lead to driver frustration and risky overtaking. Accidents are a common result. Environmental concerns arise, because exhausts from idling engines pollute the atmosphere at congested peak times.</p><p>It is now fully three years since the Scottish Executive agreed to fund a Scottish transport appraisal guidance multimodal assessment of the Balmedie to Tipperty section of the A90, to consider options for upgrading the route. I understand that the findings of that report went to the north-east Scotland transport partnership on 3 February this year and that NESTRANS promised to respond formally by the end of February, following which the minister's decision was expected. It is three months since then, and still we have no decision.</p><p>It is small wonder that the road's users are furious. Every month of delay brings more frustration and accidents. The traffic flow, which has increased by 30 per cent since 1992, continues to increase as a result of major housing developments in Ellon, Newburgh, Balmedie and other settlements in that part of Gordon and Buchan.</p><p>I hope and expect that the minister will say today that action will be taken in the very near future. If that action is not dualling the road, public anger will be enormous.

We don't want to wait another 5 years before this road is upgraded.\"</p><p>As the minister prepares to move on to higher things, I hope that he will approve a dual carriageway from Balmedie to Tipperty as a tangible legacy to the north-east of his tenure as Minister for Transport.

It is up to them whether to work for the NHS or opt to go private&#8212;that has been a long-standing situation. If it were to change, getting dentists into the NHS would be even more difficult.</p><p>The report that was commissioned by the Health Committee revealed an astonishing lack of data at health board level on adult oral health, the recruitment and retention of staff, the demand for general, community and hospital dental services and other matters. Without such basic information, it is hard to see how supply and demand issues for NHS dental services&#8212;particularly for general dental services&#8212;can be properly addressed.</p><p>The report confirmed that there are particular problems with accessing NHS dentistry in rural areas; that only 3.5 per cent of primary care dentists intend to increase their NHS commitment over the next two years; that there is a problem with retaining dental nurses; and that 62 per cent of retired dentists&#8212;many of whom have retired early&#8212;could see no incentive that would induce them to return to providing NHS Scotland dental services. Furthermore, the rising proportion of women in the profession, with their desire for career breaks and shorter working hours, is an increasingly important consideration in service planning and delivery.</p><p>On top of an increasingly female workforce and the pressures of early retirement, too many dental graduates still leave Scotland once their training is complete. In addition, the current complex system of charging certainly needs to be replaced by a new system that is easy to operate, transparent, easy to understand and less bureaucratic. The short-term measures that the Executive has introduced recently to try to alleviate the current crisis have not solved the problem. Urgent measures are needed if NHS dentistry is to survive in Scotland.</p><p>The Executive's pledge to provide free dental checks for everyone by 2007 sounds attractive, but it is generally accepted that the pledge is <place-holder colnum=\"16245\"/> unlikely to be met by the dental workforce that is currently available. Modern dentistry&#8212;which goes far beyond the identification and repair of holes in teeth to include lifestyle and preventive advice and the needs of the patient as a whole&#8212;is time consuming, and that time has not been funded by the NHS.</p><p>The aims of the dental action plan, which were announced by the minister in March, are admirable and try to address issues that are raised in the report. By March 2008, every child in Scotland is to have access to dental care when they start nursery&#8212;that means an extra 50,000 children every year. The aim is to have the largest supervised toothbrushing programme in Europe, which is fair enough; 200 more dentists by 2008; and 400,000 more people&#8212;that is, nearly half a million people&#8212;registered with an NHS dentist by March 2008. Red tape is to be slashed in general practice, with hugely simplified item of service fees for dentists. There should be more professionals complementary to dentistry, a new form of remuneration for dentists and improved practice allowances.</p><p>Some &#163;150 million of extra funding over three years for NHS dentistry in Scotland has been promised. That is a large sum of money, but I say to the minister that it is just around half of what the profession considers to be necessary to put things right. The action plan was described by Dr Lamb of the British Dental Association as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a patchwork of measures which lacks clarity\".</p><p>He also said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is difficult to see at this stage how the Executive's admirable aims will be achieved.\"</p><p>Many other dentists have said that there has been too little, too late and that what has been done will not resolve the crisis in the service. Dr Lamb has requested answers from the Executive with regard to concerns about funding for training dentists and about how the immediate shortage of dentists will be solved.</p><p>Are enough trained staff available in the colleges to provide the training for the significantly greater number of dentists and professionals complementary to dentistry that the Executive has identified as required? I asked that question on the day that the minister announced her action plan and Mary Scanlon repeated it. Why did we not receive an answer? Furthermore, given the recently identified lack of sufficient patients for current dental students to train with, where will the Executive find patients for the extra dental students and therapists that it has promised?

I acknowledge the valuable work that has been done by that committee in the interests of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p><p>The procedures that come under female genital mutilation were outlawed in this country by the most recent Conservative Government in 1985, and my party is fully in support of the measures that are proposed in the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill, which will reinforce and extend the scope of the earlier legislation. The Conservatives share the concerns that have been expressed by the committee in its stage 1 report, but overall we welcome the bill and will support its progress through Parliament.</p><p>Initially, I was disappointed that because of the pre-election dissolution of Parliament, the legislation was not enacted at the same time as the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 in the rest of the United Kingdom. However, as we have heard, our pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed legislation has led to a few recommendations from the committee which, if they are accepted, will in my opinion lead to an improved version of the 2003 act. What is important, however, is that the legal protection that is offered south of the border becomes available in Scotland with the minimum delay.</p><p>Although section 1 of the bill is, in effect, a restatement of the provisions of the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, in that it states that anyone who carries out FGM in Scotland commits an offence, the replacement of the euphemistic term \"circumcision\" with \"female genital mutilation\"&#8212;which much more accurately describes the barbaric procedures that are being outlawed&#8212;is to be welcomed. The creation of extraterritorial offences that will make it unlawful to send someone abroad to have FGM carried out, or for a UK national to perform FGM outside the United Kingdom, together with increased penalties for committing those offences will&#8212;we hope&#8212;help in the long term to eradicate the mutilating practices on girls and young women that are expected within some ethnic communities.<place-holder colnum=\"15038\"/></p><p>The practice of FGM has been established for very many years in several African countries, as well as in the middle east and Asia, and it is increasingly found in the western world, usually among immigrant and refugee populations. It is deeply embedded in the cultures of practising communities not because of religion&#8212;it is not a requirement of any religion&#8212;but it is a rite of passage to womanhood and a requirement for acceptability as a wife. The custom is frequently perpetuated by the older women in a community, who have undergone FGM themselves and see it as a necessary&#8212;indeed, a loving&#8212;ritual that will secure the best future for their daughters and granddaughters. Such deep-seated cultural practice can be eradicated only by education and reinforced by law, probably over generations.</p><p>The practice is kept very private within communities, and because relatives are often involved, statistics are hard to come by. Since 1985, there have been no prosecutions in the UK. It is unlikely that the new law will lead to many prosecutions, but it should raise awareness in the communities that are affected. Coupled with education in those communities and among health, education and social work professionals, FGM may be recognised more widely than it is at present and the perpetrators dealt with accordingly.</p><p>FGM can be described only as an act of violence against women and children. As we have heard movingly and graphically from the minister, it is often performed without anaesthetic and with dirty, makeshift and shared implements. It can lead to immediate and long-term health consequences. The severe shock, pain and bleeding can be fatal and urine retention and localised infection are common. Long-term obstetric and gynaecological problems, urinary tract infections and incontinence also cause suffering and the psychological consequences ruin the lives of many victims.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill covers three types of FGM, ranging from excision of the prepuce or clitoris, with or without excision of the labia minora, right through to infibulation, which means excision of part or all of the external genitalia and narrowing of the vaginal orifice. It excludes type IV in the World Health Organisation's classification, which is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"pricking, piercing or incising of the clitoris and/or labia; stretching of the clitoris and/or labia\"</p><p>and other acts of cutting, cautery or corrosion around the vaginal orifice. I agree with the committee's recommendation that the entire WHO classification is used to specify procedures that are unlawful under the legislation.<place-holder colnum=\"15039\"/></p><p>There could be some doubt about whether certain cosmetic procedures, which are increasingly common in this country, constitute FGM. In the interest of clarity, it is appropriate for the bill to specify which procedures remain outwith the scope of the legislation, such as decorative piercing and tattooing. It is clear that certain procedures that are recommended for medical reasons should also be exempt from the legislation. However, the committee thinks&#8212;again, I agree&#8212;that it is appropriate to require the consent of two medical practitioners to such procedures, as is the case in abortion law, rather than just one, as is proposed in the bill.</p><p>The issues that I have touched on will be debated further at stages 2 and 3 of the parliamentary process, but there is no disagreement in this part of the chamber about the general principles of the bill. I hope that the bill will be enacted speedily so that the small number of vulnerable people in some of Scotland's ethnic communities who are at risk of FGM receive the protection that they deserve under the law of our land.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak in the debate, having left the Equal Opportunities Committee just as it finished taking evidence on the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill.

During Karen Whitefield's members' business debate on the Lanarkshire initiative between the CABx and Macmillan, I remember being extremely impressed by the clear and obvious benefit to ill patients of receiving welfare benefit advice and other financial information early in their illness. Such a service would benefit any sick patient, but it is particularly valuable for people who are diagnosed with cancer, who are hit with more than the physical and emotional bombshell that the big C always generates. They are also hit with: loss of earnings; frequent travel costs for hospital visits; the cost of wigs and necessary clothing to cope with hair and weight loss; added food costs; extra heating costs, because they are confined to the house more than usual; and various other added costs. The stress of wondering how to cope with all those added financial pressures, when people are often totally ignorant of the benefits and help available, does recovery and prognosis no good at all. To have those worries lifted by an initiative such as the Macmillan better deal must be like a gift from heaven to those people.</p><p>When the former Minister for Health and Community Care suggested in 2003 that Macmillan should progress the issue of welfare benefits through the joint futures agenda, it looked hopeful that initiatives to help patients living with cancer would soon be rolled out throughout the country. Sadly, as Eleanor Scott mentioned, that has not happened. The management of welfare benefits is a mishmash in councils throughout the country. Sometimes it is dealt with by social work and sometimes by trading standards or the chief executive's department. In my city of Aberdeen, it is split between social work and housing. Joint futures representatives often have nothing to do with welfare benefits. How can a voluntary organisation such as Macmillan possibly operate nationally through joint futures if its representatives do not even know about the issue? It is small wonder that little progress has been made since 2003.</p><p>However, I was pleased to learn recently that Aberdeen is piloting a partnership between the pension service, Macmillan and Citizens Advice Scotland, with the citizens advice bureau acting as the hub and the pension service giving much of the advice and help to the over-60s in the city. It is not fair that patients and carers who shoulder the <place-holder colnum=\"14588\"/> burden of cancer should depend on a postcode lottery for financial advice and help. If the proposed new service in my area gets off the ground later this year, I hope that other parts of Scotland that currently have no scheme for helping patients to deal with cancer will soon follow suit. For that to happen, the Executive and the Westminster Government will clearly need to facilitate matters in the way that the motion suggests. Co-operation and discussion with Macmillan would be a good way forward.</p><p>I warmly congratulate Macmillan on uncovering the huge unmet need of such vulnerable patients through its better deal campaign.

As society has evolved, medicine has advanced and people live healthily for longer. The liberated younger generation produces fewer children and the whole balance of the population has moved. The so-called elderly now form nearly 20 per cent of our modern society and many of them are physically and mentally very active. Like Christine Grahame and others, I qualify for my bus pass, but I am much prouder of the fact that I get a senior citizen's discount on my ski pass when I visit the French Alps.</p><p>As several members have said, today's generation of older people makes an enormous contribution to society. After retirement, many pensioners continue to work either at their previous employment in a part-time capacity or in a new role&#8212;sometimes paid although often voluntary. Many older people continue with education and learn new skills or study subjects that they did not have the time to pursue during their paid employment. Some of them tour the world and others devote their time to playing golf or looking after grandchildren. Whatever they choose to do, many senior citizens are major contributors to our communities long after the official retirement age.</p><p>Sadly, all of us are mortal, and sooner or later we may become dependent on other people and services to meet our needs. Most people want to be independent for as long as possible. If they need care, they want to have it in their own homes for as long as they wish to stay in them. Services should be geared up to look after people in their own communities and to avoid unnecessary admissions to hospital and the bedblocking that often ensues.</p><p>Last year, I lost my last remaining aunt and uncle. Their story is not unusual. Both had passed their 90<sup>th</sup> birthday but were still coping independently&#8212;just&#8212;in their own home and were determined to stay there. My uncle developed a sore back&#8212;probably the result of an athletic youth&#8212;and was admitted to hospital for investigation. While in hospital, he developed an infection that kept him there beyond the few days that were initially anticipated. On her way to the hospital, my aunt fell and broke her hip.</p><p>After various complications and eventual rehabilitation, and after adaptations had been made to her house, my aunt was finally ready for discharge about six months later, but she died suddenly, from an unrelated condition, on the very day that she was due to go home. Getting my uncle ready for discharge took another six months, during which time he became one of those to whom David Davison referred, as he fell victim to <place-holder colnum=\"13881\"/> MRSA and other infections. Sad to say, having blocked a bed for nigh on a year, he too broke his hip shortly after he had settled into the nursing home place that he eventually occupied. He died from pneumonia three days later.</p><p>That is a fairly typical tale of what can happen to elderly people who end up in hospital because community services cannot give them adequate support at home or provide an appropriate residential nursing home place. As David Davidson pointed out, the situation is bound to get worse if the Scottish Executive persists in presiding over the underfunding of independent care homes. The Executive's position is already resulting in the closure of many such homes at a time when more places are urgently needed.</p><p>The Tory party is sympathetic to Help the Aged's new year resolutions, which Mary Scanlon said I would deal with. We all want to eradicate excess winter deaths, so we welcome campaigns such as the one that was launched this week by energywatch Scotland. With the backing of Age Concern, the campaign encourages elderly people to sign up for free energy services and publicises the schemes that are currently operated by gas and electricity suppliers. Of course we encourage pensioners to make full use of the benefits that are available to them. We would also keep the winter fuel allowance and the free television licence for those over 75.</p><p>However, we do not like means testing. Like the SNP, we would prefer to lift people out of means testing by increasing the basic state pension and linking it to earnings. Unlike the SNP, however, my party will be able to implement the policy in government at Westminster.

What is that costing the NHS as a result of road accidents, not to mention the distress to the individuals concerned?</p><p>Why is the Executive not doing more to tackle bedblocking in the NHS? Care homes in the independent and voluntary sectors are closing by the week because they are not receiving enough money to cover the costs of looking after residents who are not self-funding. If those homes were to be given the realistic funding that they seek, many elderly patients who no longer need medical treatment could, as David Davidson said, be released from hospital and free up their beds for patients awaiting treatment.</p><p>Back in the early 1980s Margaret Thatcher, who I am proud to mention, was the first person to question how money was being spent in the bottomless pit of the NHS. After seeing research, she decided that the service should become patient focused with money following the patient through the system. However, because that was a Tory idea, the new Labour Government scrapped the policy and instead started throwing increasing amounts of money at the system with central <place-holder colnum=\"12936\"/> control of how it was spent. That clearly has not worked and it is time for reform. Patients' needs must be at the centre of the service. They should be given the choice to move anywhere within the NHS and we agree that its capacity should be supplemented, when necessary, through collaboration and partnership with the independent and voluntary sectors.</p><p>If health professionals and local managers were given the freedom locally to respond to patients' needs and the resources to commission their care, money would follow the patients and fund health care where and when the patient chose to go for it. The resultant reduction in bureaucracy, which inevitably surrounds a centrally targeted approach, would allow much more resource to be freed up for front-line care. That is the least that we can offer our dedicated and hard-working NHS staff and the long-suffering patients who wait for their care.

I have been extremely interested by schemes such as the \"Are You Cold?\" helpline, which I have read about. That scheme was set up by the west of Scotland seniors forum to inform people about free central heating, insulation and heating allowances and the advisory services that are available. I agree that there would be great merit in extending such a service throughout Scotland.</p><p>I also agree with Energy Action Scotland that better co-ordination of social, housing and health policies is needed. I hope that that will begin to happen under the new national health service system when its community health partnerships are properly functional. I would like health and social work to come together with a single budget, because I am convinced that that would significantly help in achieving appropriate services for vulnerable elderly people, particularly in finding suitable accommodation for those who can no longer look after themselves properly at home. Of course, that particularly applies in winter. That, together with a high uptake of flu vaccinations, dietary advice and the provision of regular hot meals for those who cannot cook for themselves will help to keep the elderly out of hospital during the winter. In turn, that will relieve the pressure on beds that is currently bedevilling the health service.</p><p>Older people often have difficulty adapting to change and, having lived in a cold house all their lives, do not really know how to use central heating when they get it. I visited a modern sheltered flat where the heating was shut off in the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom and the doors were all kept closed to keep up the heat in the sitting room.

I add my thanks to those organisations for the extremely valuable work that they do.<place-holder colnum=\"12221\"/></p><p>As we know, lung cancer is still a major killer in Scotland. It is indeed the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women, accounting for 30 per cent of all cancer deaths among men and 24 per cent of cancer deaths among women. Although male mortality rates have improved somewhat over the past 10 years, it is worrying that the rate is increasing for women, particularly as it is still fashionable among young women to smoke, either to be trendy or to keep their weight down.</p><p>Smoking is known to be the main aetiological factor in the development of lung cancer, and that sends out alarming signals for the future. As Christine Grahame and Eleanor Scott have pointed out, it is of concern that people in the most deprived areas are much more likely to develop lung cancer than those from the least deprived areas. They also have a significantly poorer prognosis. That combination in deprived areas of a higher incidence of lung cancer and a poorer outcome applies to most forms of cancer in Scotland, as those of us who attended Monday's Scotland against cancer conference learned from the excellent presentation by Michel Coleman. That is particularly noticeable in lung cancer.</p><p>Survival rates for lung cancer are significantly improved with early diagnosis. As much as possible must be done to make people, particularly smokers, aware of the risks that they face, so that they do not delay seeking help if there is any suspicion at all that they might be developing the disease. It is of the utmost importance to discourage people from smoking in the first place and to convince those who do smoke of the health benefits of giving up. Educational programmes, such as the one in Ayrshire that has been described, are clearly of value in alerting young people to the danger of smoking and in helping those who have started smoking to kick the habit. I commend those programmes, and I welcome the Scottish Executive's plans to increase its support for those who wish to stop smoking.</p><p>As a doctor who worked in a thoracic unit and as a lifelong non-smoker, I feel as strongly as anyone that people should have the choice of a smoke-free atmosphere when they are in enclosed public places such as restaurants, pubs, buses and aircraft. I am pleased that so many establishments and organisations now have no-smoking policies. However, I am not yet totally convinced about the likely efficacy of the Executive's proposed total ban on smoking in public places. If such a ban sends smokers home to satisfy their habit, accompanied by more alcohol from the off-licence than what they might normally buy in the pub, that would be a bad thing. If such a ban were to deter young people from picking up the habit, it would <place-holder colnum=\"12222\"/> clearly have merit. For me, the jury is out on both those counts.</p><p>I know that members of my profession are largely in support of the Executive's proposed ban, but I wonder whether they are being realistic about the effect that it will have. I wonder whether a stepped-up, enhanced campaign to convince proprietors to enforce a voluntary ban on their premises would not be more effective. Many people&#8212;both smokers and non-smokers&#8212;already appreciate the pleasant atmosphere in pubs and restaurants that do not allow smoking. I suspect that public demand will drive the situation forward quite quickly, as the habit is increasingly seen as antisocial. I feel instinctively that choice is better than coercion and I think that that may be the case with smoking in public places. Having said that, I look forward to studying in detail the Executive's proposals for legislation and listening carefully to the debate, which will no doubt be lively and heated.</p><p>There is no doubt that smoking is the most important cause of lung cancer and I fully support the efforts of Macmillan Cancer Relief and the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation to raise public awareness of this far-too-common killer disease.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327879", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lung Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Irene Oldfather on securing the debate, which highlights this month's campaign by Macmillan Cancer Relief and the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation and raises the public's awareness of lung cancer.

If unchecked, it will put enormous strain on the NHS, which will struggle to cope with the long-term complications. Diabetes is a serious medical condition&#8212;it is more serious than many people realise. It is the fourth leading cause of death in most developed countries, and the life expectancy of people who have type 2 diabetes is reduced by an average of 10 years.

Research data from Tayside suggests that the prevalence of diabetes is increasing by about 8 per cent per annum. We are facing a serious problem. If complications are to be prevented or delayed, it is crucial that diabetes is diagnosed early and that blood sugar levels are brought to, and kept within, normal levels. People must be encouraged to have their blood sugar checked at regular intervals, even if they are symptom free. I point out to Stewart Stevenson that the urine test is not as accurate as the blood test&#8212;it produces many false negatives.</p><p>I, too, have been impressed by the Lloyds group of community pharmacies, to which Mike Pringle referred. About six months ago, I visited a Lloyds Pharmacy project in Aberdeen as an MSP and found&#8212;somewhat to my surprise, even though I have family history of type 2 diabetes&#8212;that my fasting blood sugar was marginally raised. It was fortunate for me that a subsequent glucose-tolerance test ruled out overt diabetes, but I now know that I must watch my weight and lifestyle and have my blood sugar checked annually as a precautionary measure. The blood test is painless and takes only a couple of minutes of one's time. I take my hat off to Lloyds for instigating the service and, like Mike Pringle, encourage everyone to take advantage of it. It could save their lives.</p><p>Predisposing factors for type 2 diabetes include family history, gender, ethnic background, age and obesity. The last of those is the one factor on which we can act and it is also the main reason for the increasing numbers of young people who are developing the disease, as more and more of them become overweight and obese. One of the biggest public health challenges in Scotland today is to make people aware of the risks that are associated with excessive weight gain and to persuade them to adopt a healthier lifestyle, to eat sensibly, to control their alcohol consumption and to exercise regularly. If we could succeed in that, the incidence of type 2 diabetes would fall dramatically. Until then, we must ensure that it is picked up early and we must treat it before complications arise. It is vital that we raise awareness; as MSPs, we have a great role to play in that.

Death is a continuum of life, and the concept of a good death is as vital a part of health care as the care and treatment of patients throughout life. In common with the BMA, I cannot accept that deliberately causing an individual's death is a valid or essential part of that concept. I am, therefore, opposed to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and I do not wish there to be a change in the law to make that permissible. I can, however, accept the withholding or withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment from a terminally ill patient if the patient refuses such treatment or if it fails to be of benefit to the patient, even though death is known to be inevitable as a result. In my opinion, that is quite different from using medical skills actively to kill or to assist suicide and is, rather, an admission that medicine can do no more.</p><p>For me, a former health professional who is bound by the Hippocratic oath and trained to improve and prolong life where possible, the idea of actively and deliberately ending a human life is disturbing. I agree with the BMA that changing the law to permit assisted suicide would, in some cases, undermine patient trust in doctors and medical advice. A licence to kill or to assist in so doing would give the doctor a role that does not sit comfortably with that of healer and carer. In this country, especially after the notoriety of Dr Shipman, such a move would risk impairing the doctor-patient relationship, which is founded on trust.</p><p>I would far rather see palliative care stepped up and perfected in line with the gold standard framework, which, when implemented across the country, should allow patients in the final stages of life to live well and ultimately to have a good death that is physically free of symptoms, gives them a sense of safety, security and support and comes with care that responds to their needs. Such a framework will give support and information to carers and should boost staff confidence and aid communication between members of the health team.</p><p>Caring for palliative care patients and their families in such a special way will ensure that their issues are more likely to be dealt with properly and sensitively and that more people will be able to die in their place of choice. The gold standard framework already operates successfully in England and, thanks to generous funding from the New Opportunities Fund, Macmillan Cancer Relief and NHS Scotland, will soon be rolled out across Scotland. That is how we should improve palliative care and take the fear and pain out of death.

Much of what I planned to say has already been said.</p><p>I welcome today's debate, which provides us all with an opportunity to pay tribute to Scotland's many excellent foster carers, who have opened up their homes to some of our most vulnerable <place-holder colnum=\"11766\"/> children and who offer such children the love and support of a stable family life for as long as they need to be cared for.</p><p>Children need to be looked after outwith their parental home for a variety of reasons. The periods of care that such children require can vary, but they may require only a short period before they return, as the majority do, to their own families. Some children may move between residential and foster care, but there are now, thankfully, fewer and decreasing numbers of children in residential care. Others are fostered with a view to adoption in the longer term. As we have heard, today more of those children are younger and increasingly more of them have complex needs.</p><p>Whatever the reason that children require care outwith their families, foster care is nowadays the preferred type of accommodation for children under 12 for both long-term and short-term placements. Some 75 per cent of the children who are looked after in accommodation away from home are now in foster care. Given that significant growth in foster care in recent years, the Fostering Network has become an extremely important source of care and support for children and young people who need to find a stable home and the family support that will allow them to thrive and to have a chance to achieve their potential within the community.</p><p>As the minister and others have said, the poor educational achievement of looked-after children has been a concern in recent years. Many such children leave school at 16 or 17 with no qualifications and some of them are excluded from school. Others are not in education, employment or training when they leave care. Good foster carers will give the children in their care the support and love that they need to help them to overcome their difficulties and to leave care as more successful and more confident young adults.</p><p>The significant shortfall in foster carers that we face in Scotland makes it difficult to find suitable homes for children who need them. Every week that goes by without such a home can make a great difference to a child's prospects for a stable and rewarding childhood, so it is important that placements are made as soon as possible.</p><p>As members know, the Fostering Network has estimated that Scotland requires 700 more foster carers. That huge shortfall means that many children need either to move household several times during their time in care or to double up&#8212;as Scott Barrie reminded us. That cannot be in their best interests. Therefore, it is good news that the Executive has responded to the call to invest more resources in the fostering service, to increase the number of high-quality placements and to consider the training needs of foster carers.<place-holder colnum=\"11767\"/></p><p>It is important to recruit only good foster carers, so the assessment process is crucial in judging a person's suitability for fostering a child or particular categories of children. Assessment must be speedy, but it must also be rigorous.</p><p>Current financial support for foster carers is less than ideal and many families have ended up out of pocket under the present system. If people are to be attracted into providing foster care, it is important that they receive adequate allowances to cover their costs. Obviously, cash rewards should not become a reason for people to offer themselves as foster carers.</p><p>Major variations and inconsistencies exist in the allowances that Scotland's 32 local authorities provide for foster carers. Campaigners have demanded consistency of funding for all foster families. Therefore, the Executive's pledge to provide local authorities with the resources to set up a fair and consistent system of allowances for carers is a welcome step forward that I hope will assist in recruiting and retaining suitable people.</p><p>Government incentives are also a welcome step forward. For example, foster carers welcomed last year's introduction of tax relief on fostering income. Relief is now available on allowances and on up to, I think, &#163;10,000 of income. They also welcomed the introduction of home responsibility protection, which ensures that carers will not get a lower basic retirement pension because they stayed at home to look after children and were not able to pay national insurance contributions.</p><p>Let me say a brief word about kinship carers. Today, a significant number of children in Scotland are cared for by family members&#8212;often grandparents. Although most of them undertake their caring role for love and not for reward, it is important that they receive appropriate and consistent support in carrying out that role. As they are significant players in caring for their young relatives, a more rigorous approach needs to be taken in assessing, supporting and rewarding family carers throughout the country.</p><p>As fostering has become such an important part of caring for vulnerable youngsters away from home, the Executive's proposals are timely, welcome and necessary. It is important for our society that the best people come forward to provide the security and stability that looked-after children and young people need if they are to be happy and secure and achieve their potential. I commend the Executive's commitment to investing in the future of the fostering service and I look forward to hearing the detail of the proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13326832", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fostering"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that consensus makes for repetition.

The point that is at issue is whether that voluntary approach should be stepped up, alongside better education of children and young people on the risks of starting the smoking habit, until public demand results in the provision of smoke-free facilities in all sectors of Scottish business, or whether the state should legislate now to force smokers out of all enclosed public places.</p><p>We have had a good debate that aired issues on both sides of the argument.

I am also grateful for the notice that was given of the debate because it gave time for many young carers to make arrangements to visit the Parliament today.</p><p>I am particularly pleased that 11 of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire's almost 200 known carers are here with Mary Drever and Shona Cormack from the Young Carers Centre in Aberdeen that is run by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. Their support and enthusiasm is of immense value to the young people in helping to sort out their problems and ensuring that they get some relaxation and fun that they might otherwise miss.</p><p>Many young people look on themselves not as carers but merely as doing what needs to be done to help their loved ones at home. Many are reticent about their responsibilities and make light of what they do. They might face bullying at school from classmates who do not understand why they cannot always socialise. Teachers are often unaware of the situation and condemn absences, late arrival at school and failure to do homework. Life can sometimes get pretty miserable for young carers without a mediator such as Mary Drever or Shona Cormack to smooth the way.</p><p>Last night I spent a humbling few hours at the Aberdeen champions award ceremony, where local heroes who were nominated by friends and neighbours and voted for by readers of the <em>Evening Express</em> were awarded commendations or prizes under various categories. I was delighted that there was a carers category and even more delighted that a high commendation was awarded to a young Aberdeen carer&#8212;a 15-year-old boy who suffers from Crohn's disease and who looks after his mum and sister, who are both disabled, and who also cares for his baby brother. Such dedication deserves to be rewarded and people should know that we have some wonderfully caring young people in our communities.</p><p>Mary and Shona's young carers do not ask for a great deal, but they do appreciate the drop-in centre that they attend, where they can let their hair down, meet their friends and chat about their <place-holder colnum=\"11224\"/> problems and frustrations over a cup of tea or can of Coke. They can get peace to do their homework and, sometimes, even catch up on much-needed sleep. They need better facilities, bigger premises or, indeed, more small premises scattered around the area. Their lives would be easier if they all had personal computers to help them with their homework in the same way as most children have nowadays. They might not be able to afford them but they could be provided if people knew that there was a need.</p><p>Today's debate gives us the opportunity to highlight those issues, to stress the importance of advocates such as Mary and Shona, to ask for understanding from fellow pupils and teachers, and to give encouragement to the many young carers who soldier on unknown, because the young carers that we do know about are undoubtedly only the tip of the iceberg. We need to encourage the others to come forward, to share their burdens, to use the drop-in centres and to get help and support when they need them.</p><p>It is clear that there are not enough facilities; I will not elaborate on that in the interests of time. I simply say that I support John Swinney's motion and urge the minister to take heed of it.

The motion appears to be predicated on the assumption that all women have the ambition to pursue full-time careers, and I am inclined to differ on that point. Many women, and an increasing number of men, do not want to work full time and instead opt for part-time work and smaller earnings in exchange for what they see as a better quality of life for themselves and their children by spending more time at home&#8212;if of course they can afford to. Flexibility in working practices allows people to choose their working pattern to suit themselves.</p><p>My Conservative colleagues and I are committed to equality in the workplace and believe that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. However, we do not believe that parents of either sex should be forced into pursuing full-time careers in order to meet prescriptive targets.</p><p>Much Executive policy that relates to women has been created by powerful, ambitious and successful career women. Margaret Curran's strategic group on women comprises a university <place-holder colnum=\"10901\"/> vice-chancellor, a chief executive of a bank and a secretary of a trade union&#8212;hardly typical, even of career women. I know that at least some members of the group are mothers. Indeed, I know one of them quite well and she has done an excellent job of combining motherhood with a highly successful career, but she is far from the norm and I certainly would not have envied her lifestyle when her children were small.</p><p>Various reports have shown that women want to be able to choose whether to work. If they choose not to, they want motherhood to be valued and respected. I heartily agree with that, because the drive to have more and more women pursue careers can make non-working mums feel guilty. That is quite wrong, because one of the most rewarding careers of all must be the successful guiding of young children to becoming responsible and happy adults.</p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that 10 per cent of part-time working women were interested in increasing their working hours and only a quarter of non-working women wanted to return to work. Various studies indicate that many women do not really want to work.</p><p>My point is that women must be free to choose how they live, even if it means that there is a serious loss to the professions, including mine. Many women opt out of work when their children are young, as I did. That has a major effect on the health service. Fortunately for me, the rate of pay for doctors has always been the same for men and women.</p><p>It seems entirely reasonable to ask the Executive to investigate discrepancies in pay between men and women, if it is competent for it to do so, but if the conclusion is that women earn less because of differences in hours and working conditions, that should not automatically be taken as negative.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13324535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gender Pay Gap"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In that case, I am appalled by the figure.

That is the best way&#8212;indeed the only way&#8212;to get widespread access to transplantation, certain complex forms of neurosurgical or cardiac treatments and the like. However, people ought to be able to access routine surgical, accident and emergency and maternity services speedily, safely and reasonably close to home in acute general hospitals and they should still be able to get their minor surgical procedures or simple general medical care in their communities.</p><p>The fear of losing local services is the reason why people turn out in force at public meetings in the hope that they can influence decisions. Roseanna Cunningham made a valid point about such public consultation too often not being acted on&#8212;no wonder people are disillusioned. The public clearly does not want a centralised health service; it does not want to see the closure of perfectly good hospitals, many of which were built, modernised or planned under the Conservatives. People do not want to be forced to travel 100 miles from Wick to Inverness in the dead of winter to have their babies. I hope that it will not be long before Caithness hears the sort of good-news boost that the minister has given Glasgow today.</p><p>Patients throughout the country, including the north-east, are devastated by the prospect of the closure of in-patient beds at the Glasgow homeopathic hospital, which gives many people <place-holder colnum=\"10800\"/> their only respite from pain and is a lifeline for many others. In Fort William, consultants are rightly angry that their hospital might be downgraded when they have the capacity and expertise to provide an excellent service to people who live well beyond their boundaries. As Fergus Ewing said, those consultants have second-to-none experience of dealing with trauma.</p><p>A head of steam is building up throughout the country. People want the Executive to carry out its stated aim of providing a health service that is based on local need and which is safe and within easy reach of patients. To achieve what people want, there will have to be some imaginative thinking. Do we need to apply the working time directive so rigorously that enthusiastic trainees are not allowed even to enter their hospitals when off duty to tackle procedures under close supervision, or even to watch their seniors at work? Other European countries do not do that: why should we? What kind of consultants will we produce in the future if they have too little hands-on experience? I dread the day when some of us need expert care.</p><p>What about expanding the use of telemedicine and videolinking between local hospitals and centres of expertise? It already happens; so let us expand it. What about incentives for young staff, such as help with housing, flexibility of working hours and more job sharing and child care for those who need it? What about attractive retention packages for senior staff, whose expertise is commonly lost because of early retirement?</p><p>Many local solutions for local problems could be found if the service was truly based on local needs and not operating under the diktat of central Government and the targets that it imposes on health boards. That is, of course, where our proposals for patient passports and foundation hospitals come in. NHS foundation hospitals would be run locally by local directors and would have significant operational freedom that would allow them to develop according to local demand. Patients who chose to use them would bring funding with them, which would allow the development of well-run hospitals where they are needed and wanted by patients. That would be a genuine effort to localise services and it would not give unfair advantage to those who are well-off, as Carolyn Leckie and others asserted.</p><p>After hearing Tom McCabe's speech, I think that the Executive should perhaps take Robin Cook's advice and examine John Reid's strategy paper, which challenges many of the centralising assumptions that lie behind health policy in Scotland. That might help the Executive to sort out its problems.</p><p>Things cannot go on as they are. People have made it clear that they want speedy access to safe <place-holder colnum=\"10801\"/> health care, with most treatments being available within a reasonable distance from their homes. It is high time that politicians handed over the reins to patients and to professionals who know what is needed.

In Scotland, rates of breastfeeding have increased by 8 per cent since 1995, which is more than double the rate of the increase across the United Kingdom. <place-holder colnum=\"10612\"/></p><p>Even in areas of deprivation, the rate has increased by 7 per cent. We are moving in the right direction.</p><p>Public attitudes are changing. In recent surveys, a large majority of people said that they found discreet breastfeeding in public to be perfectly acceptable. That positive change in social attitudes to feeding infants in public is welcome and has come about without Government intervention.</p><p>An increasing number of establishments welcome breastfeeding and I firmly believe that encouragement without coercion would lead to that becoming the norm. In countries where there is already legislation on breastfeeding, it is hard to find any evidence of the effect of that legislation on rates of or attitudes towards breastfeeding and there seem to be few examples of such a law being enforced. As we have heard, it is unlikely that the police and procurators fiscal will be willing to undertake prosecutions under the bill given that they have such a large amount of serious criminal work to deal with. Furthermore, there is a concern, as voiced by ACPOS, that the use of criminal legislation could lead to a negative attitude towards breastfeeding.</p><p>This afternoon, Elaine Smith, Helen Eadie and others recounted some appalling examples of bigotry and maltreatment of nursing mothers who wish to breastfeed in public. I do not condone what happened in those examples. I listened to the BBC this morning and a number of the e-mails that had been sent in made it clear that many people in the country deplore those bigoted attitudes. The desired cultural change is already under way. Of course, we have not heard about any good examples today, but I suppose that that is the nature of a debate such as this.</p><p>I point out to Carolyn Leckie that the formula milk that is provided to third-world countries as state aid has saved the lives of many babies whose mothers are starving and unable to provide the milk that their babies need.

The news gave birth to the proposal for a regional multisport facility to be built adjacent to the University of Aberdeen with the university and the council as the main funding partners. Such a facility would fulfil a major unmet need for indoor sporting opportunities in Aberdeen, the most northerly of the big four Scottish cities, the climate of which often renders outdoor tracks and pitches unusable and unplayable.</p><p>Naturally, there was huge disappointment in the city when its funding bid was only partially accepted by the Scottish Executive. That was because a wide range of public and private sector organisations had been involved&#8212;with sportscotland&#8212;in putting the bid together. I was delighted and relieved, however, to learn that the partners have not been deterred by their setback. As Brian Adam said, even now they are working with sportscotland to review and revise the project in accordance with the financial allocation. They are determined to achieve their goal.</p><p>The proposed regional sports centre would allow local people of varying ages to have greatly improved access to and involvement in many popular activities such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and athletics. It would overcome the major disadvantage that promising young athletes&#8212;both locally and as far afield as Orkney and the minister's constituency of Shetland&#8212;experience at the moment.

Its proposed location in the northern part of the city, adjacent to the University of Aberdeen, would greatly assist the university in its competition to attract students as well as providing readily accessible activities for the local community in a relatively disadvantaged area.</p><p>It would fit with the Scottish Executive's policy aims for the improvement of the physical well-being and health of the nation through active participation in sport, strengthen the economy, boost tourism and attract students to further and higher education.</p><p>There is a degree of urgency in getting the project off the ground.

Members will have had experience of older relatives who needed extra help to stay at home; carers who needed support and respite; and people with disabilities who needed practical aids to help them to cope with the problems of day-to-day living. Also, in today's world in which substance abuse is rife, increasing numbers of children are in need of support and protection, either because their parents have a chaotic lifestyle or because they themselves are young carers. However, I will confine my remarks this morning to social care services for the elderly.</p><p>As a result of all of the social change, local authority social work departments have struggled over the past decade or so to cope with the ever-increasing demands that are placed on their services. Nowadays, no one would question the right of people to live at home&#8212;if they so wish&#8212;for as long as they are able to do so. That right comes at a price, however. Such support is often complex and resource-intensive, which means that is does not come cheap. For that support to work, close collaboration between councils and health services is needed. The joint future agenda is trying to move forward that collaboration by developing an integrated health and social care service that is built on the foundations of joint teams of health and social work staff who work together at the local level, sharing premises, equipment and budgets.</p><p>Progress is patchy across the country. There are major problems in moving forward with the joint future agenda, particularly in systems design and staff training. There are cultural barriers to information sharing between nurses and social workers. Information technology systems are not fully compatible yet, and that leads to a lack of accurate information on which to base the planning of services. Some areas have aligned their social work and health budgets and there seems little disagreement among professionals that it would be better to have a single unified budget that brings health and social care services under the same umbrella. That would ease the process of shared assessment of people's needs <place-holder colnum=\"9739\"/> and speed up the system. It would give faster access to community care services such as home helps and meals on wheels. It would also help to deal with the difficulties that are caused by inadequate local authority funding for nursing home places in the independent sector. The present two-tier system, under which those who are able to self-fund can access a nursing home place but those who are dependent on council funding cannot, is inequitable. The problem will be solved only when there are unified health and social care budgets.</p><p>My home area of Grampian has an agreed and fairly well-developed strategy for older people and services. Each council has a local action plan that is being taken forward by joint future operational teams. In Aberdeen, a multidisciplinary, rapid-response team is having some success in averting hospital admissions. The council has met the demand for free personal care but to do so it has had to vire resources from other budget areas such as training. The council has organised shopping and household maintenance via independent contractors and the voluntary sector and, working with housing associations, it is having some success in tackling the problem of delayed discharge from hospital by means of rehabilitation projects in very sheltered flats.</p><p>Aberdeenshire Council has developed 24 health and community care teams that are linked to general practitioner practices. The teams provide care services for older people, people with disabilities and people who need palliative care. The teams are well supported by local paired managers&#8212;one from health and the other from social work.</p><p>Both authorities involve service users and carers in the planning and evaluation of their services. In Aberdeen city, that has led to a number of service developments. A particularly useful&#8212;and simple&#8212;example is the training of home care staff in basic nail clipping. By undertaking simple foot care, home care staff are able to relieve the chiropody service. Aberdeenshire Council has developed six local carer drop-in centres and has 10 carer support workers, four of whom work with young carers.</p><p>It is good to see those positive developments on the ground. I am sure that there are similar examples across the country. That said, there is no room for complacency. Adequate funding and human resources are, of course, essential. Collaboration between health services, council social work departments, carers and voluntary and independent sector care providers is vital if clients' needs are to be adequately catered for. The challenges for the 21<sup>st</sup> century planners and providers of social care services are enormous.

In the 65 years since it was established, it has become a firmly-established part of the local community. For example, its long-established organic farm is worked by the residents and supplies the community; and its shop and cafe, which provide bread and crafts that are also made by the residents, are popular haunts for local people.</p><p>Newton Dee is a home, a work place and a peaceful haven for some very vulnerable people, from children through to elderly people.

Many of them cover health-related issues, often the cinderella diseases that do not grab public attention or hit the headlines but which, nonetheless, devastate the lives of those who are unfortunate enough to have to live with them and, sadly, die from them. I have been humbled by my relative ignorance of the impact of some of the diseases, and I have become increasingly concerned by the degree of unmet need&#8212;whether for information, counselling, specialist nursing or palliative care&#8212;that is experienced by those who are suffering from those diseases throughout Scotland. I hope that earlier diagnosis and better support services will be the end result of our raising awareness generally and highlighting the gaps in provision.</p><p>Today's debate is a case in point. When a motion is signed by more than third of all MSPs and when a health issue is the topic of a members' business debate for the third time in the first five years of the Parliament, there is clearly awareness and concern within this institution, and quite rightly so. What we are discussing is of extreme importance to the victims and their families.<place-holder colnum=\"8988\"/></p><p>Asbestos-related illnesses used to be looked on as a tragic legacy of Clydeside industry, and they were rarely encountered in my neck of the woods. Indeed, one of the only two people whom I have known to die of mesothelioma had spent most of his working life on the Clyde before he retired to the north-east of Scotland. However, we are now reaping the results&#8212;throughout the country, as Margaret Ewing said&#8212;of the popular use of asbestos in construction work in post-war Britain. Workers were exposed to its fibres at a time when the hazards were not fully appreciated. That risk of exposure continues today as many buildings from that era come to require renovation or demolition. Fortunately, the risks are now well known, and health and safety measures are in place to deal with them.</p><p>Nevertheless, the legacy is still there, and the number of people who are ending their days in pain or gasping for breath as a result of exposure to asbestos has, sadly, not yet reached its peak. People who have been exposed to it are sitting on a time bomb. People who are diagnosed with asbestosis, lung cancer or mesothelioma are, essentially, living with a death sentence. Anything that can be done to help them and their families to cope with that state of affairs should be done.</p><p>The second person whom I knew who had mesothelioma was a constituent of mine when I was an Aberdeen city councillor. I had known her for most of my life, and I have no idea when or how she was exposed to asbestos. She bravely accepted her death sentence, following diagnosis, and got on with her remaining life. Her main worry was that the cemetery in which she wished to be buried was nearly full. She was afraid that the new graves that were due to be created there by the council would not be ready in time. My contribution was small, but I was able to get reassurance for her that she would find her last resting place where she wanted it. I think that the peace of mind that that gave her helped her through her final few months as the disease took its unrelenting course.</p><p>It is extremely important that information, help and support, of whatever nature, is available to victims and their families. If today's comprehensive motion is acted upon, the lives of future sufferers of asbestos-related diseases could be made more bearable and their families and friends could be better prepared to cope with the diagnosis and its consequences.

They do a stalwart job under what are sometimes extremely difficult circumstances and we all have the greatest admiration for them. We want NHS staff to be more in control of their professional lives and of their patients' care.</p><p>I want to touch on the vexed issue of maternity services in Scotland, which is of concern to our constituents right across the country, as we all know from the correspondence that crosses our desks.</p><p>Women in 21<sup>st</sup> century Scotland have a right to expect safe child birth and their babies should have the appropriate neonatal care that will give them the best possible start in life. Quite rightly, however, mothers have come to expect to be able to choose where and how they will have their babies. Good antenatal care is key to a safe and healthy pregnancy. Part of the provision of that care is the planning for the individual needs and preferences of mothers. Good planning will ensure that giving birth is as natural and stress-free as possible while, at the same time, safeguarding the safety and well-being of the mother and baby. Most mums want to have their babies as close to home as possible; if not at home. They want to be near to their partners, families and support network at what is probably the most deeply emotional time of their entire lives.</p><p>Everyone accepts that safety is paramount and that, on occasion, if complications arise, their wishes will have to be sacrificed in the interests of their own and the baby's well-being. Thankfully, the incidence of maternal mortality is low in Scotland today. Good neonatal care has ensured <place-holder colnum=\"8441\"/> that infant mortality and morbidity also are at fairly minimal levels. Nobody wants to see that situation change for the worse, but there is a fear in many communities in Scotland that that is what is being faced, despite record financial investment in the NHS.</p><p>The falling birth rate in recent years, which of course might not be permanent, has led to problems in the functioning of maternity services, with some units operating below capacity. When one adds to that fact the shortage of trained obstetricians, anaesthetists and neonatal paediatricians, plus the new deal for junior hospital doctors, the effect of the European working time directive and the new consultants contract, it is not hard to see why maternity services are under threat.</p><p>That is no comfort to the mums in Wick. Despite the recent filling of locum vacancies, if the local unit in Wick is downgraded, as proposed, to a midwife-led service, those women could face a journey of over 100 miles to Inverness, over bad roads and in the winter time, if a complication meant that they needed consultant treatment.</p><p>Surely in this day and age it is not acceptable for an expectant mother to be advised to spend the five days before their expected date of delivery in hospital or in a bed and breakfast in Inverness as a precautionary measure. Not only would that be costly to the NHS, but what on earth would it do for the morale of those patients? Where was the choice and freedom from stress for the 11 mums who have given birth to their babies in ambulances en route to Glasgow and Paisley since the Vale of Leven hospital lost its maternity services in 2002? Where also is that choice for the patients who will have to be rushed up the dual carriageway from Perth to Dundee, if complications arise, when the unit in Perth loses its consultant cover? I suggest that those patients will take some convincing that their service has improved.</p><p>I accept that the problems are not easy to solve, but let us not kid ourselves that the service is altogether what patients want. The Government signed up eagerly to the European working time directive. It did not have proper regard to the consequences of that on the availability of staff. The result of the long-trumpeted new deal for junior hospital doctors somehow seems to have caught us unawares. The massive amount of extra funding that has gone into the health service has unfortunately been more successful in recruiting bureaucrats than specialists to the service.</p><p>We hear a great deal from the minister about the importance of patient involvement and public participation in planning the health service that everybody wants. Why is it that the wishes of many communities across Scotland, particularly those in the remote areas in which distances are <place-holder colnum=\"8442\"/> long and road conditions poor, are not heeded when the maternity services of the future are being planned?

If there were a focus on the needs of the patient and funding went with the patient, choice would open <place-holder colnum=\"8171\"/> up for them and the service would soon respond. Sadly, that opportunity has been lost.</p><p>The removal of NHS trusts apparently involves the removal of a layer of bureaucracy, but we see it as a move away from the patient towards centralisation because&#8212;essentially&#8212;the trusts have been subsumed as operating divisions of health boards, which are one step further away from patients.</p><p>There is merit in much of the bill, but we still have many concerns about it. The development of managed clinical networks deriving from regional co-operation between health boards is a step in the right direction, but it falls far short of our proposals to allow patients the option of receiving their treatment from any NHS provider or from the voluntary, not-for-profit and independent sectors if they choose, based on a national tariff system that would define set costs for specific procedures, as explained by David Davidson.</p><p>I will respond to the criticisms of our policies. As I have said often in the chamber, I am and always have been a passionate believer in the NHS. My family has more reason than many to be grateful to it, following my son's successful liver transplant 12 years ago. However, as Jean Turner did, I point out that many private patients are only private patients because they cannot timeously get the treatment that they need from the public service. I know many elderly people who are by no means wealthy and who have given their life savings to procure the treatment that they need. There is no reason why those people, who have contributed to the NHS all their lives through taxation, should not take a part of the cost of their treatment with them, which would free up space in the service for those who are still waiting to gain access to it.</p><p>The development of local health care co-operatives into community health partnerships has merit and will give local stakeholders and front-line staff a role in decision making on the delivery of local health care services, which must be in the interests of the patient. However, there is still much work to be done on the statutory guidance for CHPs&#8212;on their remit, role, membership, number and cost. It is extremely important that the Health Committee has the opportunity prior to their introduction to scrutinise the guidance and regulations relating to the operation of CHPs.</p><p>The duty on health boards to ensure public involvement is a positive step but, as the BMA stated, if the proposed Scottish health council and CHPs together are to engage the public and encourage them to play a meaningful role in community planning, it is essential that that work receive appropriate funding. We still have doubts about whether the proposed Scottish health council can be truly independent as part of NHS <place-holder colnum=\"8172\"/></p><p>Quality Improvement Scotland and we do not agree with the proposal.</p><p>We also have serious concerns about the cost of the provisions in the bill, particularly in relation to intervention, CHPs and the Scottish health council.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13317845", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The problem with the NHS in Scotland today is not funding, but that it is driven from the centre and has constantly to respond to centrally set priorities and targets, each of which puts more pressure on the system and results in more administrative costs, harassed staff and frustrated patients waiting to access the system.

I wish that I could say that that reflected the good nature of north-east folk, but I do not think that that is the case.</p><p>It is clear that there are two separate problems. One is that of parking within spaces allocated to disabled people by councils either outside their homes or in council car parks and the other is that of indiscriminate parking in designated spaces within privately owned premises such as supermarkets.</p><p>Today I was in touch with Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council to ask what the current situation is with parking areas for which they are responsible. Aberdeen City Council has 800 residential disabled spaces. As we know, those are courtesy places that other motorists are asked to leave clear, which means that they are unenforceable. No record is kept of how often that system is abused, although I am sure that it is abused from time to time. Aberdeenshire Council has 138 residential spaces for the disabled and further reserved spaces in 10 council-operated car parks. The council's spokesman said that relatively few problems were encountered with those spaces&#8212;certainly far fewer than the 20 per cent figure that was quoted for problems at supermarkets. Aberdeen City Council also has 23 disabled places in city car parks in which blue-badge and green-badge holders can park for free. A further 24 places are kept under council buildings for the shopmobility scheme and another 22 are kept in the city centre for green-badge holders, who are the more severely disabled. Between 260 and 270 penalty tickets are issued per year to unqualified users of the spaces in all those car parks. That figure is significant, but it does not present as major an issue as does the abuse of disabled parking at supermarkets and similar locations.</p><p>In the Aberdeen area, council-controlled disabled car parking works reasonably satisfactorily. It is monitored as far as possible and fines are issued to those who abuse the parking spaces. I do not have figures for the private sector in the area, but my own observation and anecdote suggest that selfish and inconsiderate parking is increasingly prevalent at large retail premises. I see no reason to dispute the Baywatch <place-holder colnum=\"8110\"/> campaign's 20 per cent figure but, like Mike Pringle, I wonder whether the actual figure is higher.</p><p>It is unacceptable that disabled spaces are taken up by able-bodied drivers, most of whom have given little or no thought to the hardship and distress that they cause to deserving people. I do not hesitate to support the proposal in the motion that all interested parties, including the Executive, should work together to increase awareness of disabled people's rights in the first instance and, if the problem continues, to consider empowering local authorities to enforce the proper use of designated parking facilities.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13317702", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Parking Spaces"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the debate secured by Duncan McNeil and Johann Lamont, which highlights an extremely important issue.

I am also happy to welcome the opportunity that MS awareness week gives to improving public awareness and knowledge of a condition that affects many people in Scotland. I agree that, in many areas, treatment and facilities for patients leave a lot to be desired.</p><p>I have just checked up on the situation in Grampian, where there are four neurologists&#8212;who I presume deal with all neurological diseases&#8212;and, as Margaret Ewing said, one specialist MS nurse. In addition, there are close links with the department of rehabilitation medicine. Newly diagnosed patients are referred to the MS nurse and those who suffer a relapse go straight to a neurologist. When I received that information, I thought that the arrangements sounded <place-holder colnum=\"7761\"/> reasonable, until I found out about the add-on that the waiting time to see a neurologist is a year. I am sure that that situation is not uncommon. Members should remember that MS patients are just one cohort in the neurological spectrum.</p><p>We were all impressed by the many sufferers who turned up at the Hub last November to lobby us and explain their problems. It was clear that many of them had made long journeys and endured significant discomfort to meet us. They are to be congratulated on their endurance and determination.</p><p>As a result of meeting patients from the north-east on that occasion, I had the pleasure in January of visiting the Stuart resource centre in Aberdeen, which David Davidson mentioned. The establishment of the centre was made possible by a substantial legacy. As well as being a wonderful meeting place for MS sufferers, it is a well-used facility that was greatly appreciated by all the users whom I met on my visit. It is sad that such good fortune does not come the way of all patients.</p><p>I visited another support facility, in Dyce, Aberdeen, where massage, positive pressure treatment and other therapies are offered to users at a modest charge. There is another good resource in the city, which is provided by NHS Grampian, but unfortunately it caters only for people who are under 65 years of age. Users get most upset when they are told that they must suddenly stop their attendance on their 65<sup>th</sup> birthday. I hope to visit the facility next month to find out whether there is any possibility of its being able to accommodate older patients who have found it particularly beneficial. Those facilities make a huge difference to the lives of MS patients in Aberdeen; it is just a pity that they are not available everywhere.</p><p>The people whom I met furnished me with a wish list of what they consider to be bare necessities. It is only fair that I read out the points on the list so that the minister can take note of them and, I hope, consider at least some of them. The people whom I met want prescription charges to be free for people with MS. They want to have regular contact with a neurologist, which should include the opportunity to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan at regular intervals. They want all MS sufferers to be able to have beta interferon, if only for a trial period. They want more training for general practitioners and practice nurses and they want cannabis spray&#8212;when it is available&#8212;to be offered to those sufferers who feel that they need it. They also want age-appropriate respite care for people with MS and a national standard of care.</p><p>Many of the needs of MS sufferers that I have spelled out are common to a range of neurological <place-holder colnum=\"7762\"/> conditions. The message comes across loud and clear from all the groups that members meet that there is a significant lack of consultant neurological advice and that many more specialist nurses are needed. I wonder whether the lack of such nurses might eventually be addressed by the new GP contract, if GPs pull together and share specialist nurse services within primary care settings. A national standard of care of the kind that the motion requests is needed right across the neurological spectrum.</p><p>I hope that the minister will take on board the issues that Tricia Marwick's motion raises and that he will widen his consideration to include other neurological conditions that cause similar difficulties for those who suffer from them.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am happy to support the motion and to congratulate Tricia Marwick on securing the debate.

It has been a well-informed debate, which has shown clearly the interest of the MSPs who are in the chamber in the mental health well-being of the population.</p><p>Statistics show the seriousness of the situation that faces mental health services at present&#8212;one in three GP consultations involves some aspect of mental health and a quarter of the population are affected by mental illness at some stage in their lives. That means that fewer of us will go through life untouched by mental health problems in one way or another&#8212;either personally or among our family and friends.</p><p>When we learn that more young men are dying at their own hand than are killed in road traffic accidents and that suicide is the leading cause of death in Scottish men aged between 15 and 34, we know just how important it is to tackle the problem head on and to unravel the complex issues that underlie it. Mary Scanlon touched on that point.</p><p>There is no doubting the Scottish Executive's commitment to maintain the mental well-being of the Scottish people and to improve the situation of those with mental health problems. As the minister illustrated in his opening speech, many of the initiatives that are under way have that intention. I was particularly pleased to hear the minister's statement about advocacy services. As has been acknowledged in the debate, however, there is still a long way to go before the Executive's aspirations are achieved.</p><p>Undoubtedly, there are serious shortfalls that have to be addressed in the provision of early intervention, crisis and respite services. Access to a range of treatments is patchy across the country; I am thinking of access to medication, complementary therapies, counselling, psychotherapy and social support. Services are not accessible at the local level, nor are they always effective in responding to people's needs. For many patients, a shortfall in specialist help can still result in GPs prescribing antidepressants and other mood-altering drugs when counselling, specialist help and psychotherapy would have been much more effective and beneficial. Bed blocking remains a serious issue and mixed-sex wards continue to cause distress to many of the patients who have to be treated in them.</p><p>As we heard, the national mental health services assessment highlights the many shortcomings of the current service and the pressures on staff to cope with the added demands of new legislation. It also highlights the perception of the chronic underfunding of services in the face of rising needs and the demands and expectations of the public and, indeed, politicians. The assessment <place-holder colnum=\"7647\"/> notes the continuous change agenda and restructuring that get in the way of the prime duty of caring for patients. Stewart Stevenson's quotations from Dr Sandra Grant's report revealed the worst in the service. Clearly, all of us hope that such conditions will soon be history.</p><p>The increasing bureaucracy that is associated with monitoring and accountability and the perception of increasing centralisation and control from the Executive&#8212;despite the rhetoric of devolved power&#8212;all lead to low morale in the service and contribute to difficulties in the recruitment and retention of staff. As Jean Turner pointed out, lack of concern for staff well-being is a major factor: it hits staff morale and leads to the loss of many able and well-trained people.</p><p>Dr Grant's report contained a clear recommendation that more authority, responsibility and accountability&#8212;including for budgets&#8212;should be devolved to front-line staff in the future, with the objective of enabling those staff to work closely with the voluntary sector, service users and carers. I hope that the minister will support that recommendation and that he will not be put off by the fact that it is in line with Conservative party policy.</p><p>I am pleased that Mike Rumbles and Adam Ingram highlighted the need for more work to be done with children who have mental health difficulties. I, too, heard and was impressed by Dr Bryce's excellent presentation at the cross-party group meeting yesterday. Dr Bryce gave us the frightening statistic, which Mike Rumbles and Adam Ingram quoted, that 10 per cent of the population aged between five and 15 years of age have serious mental health problems at any one time. That is 125,000 children&#8212;enough, as Dr Bryce said, to fill a football stadium.</p><p>The breakdown in health of many of those children can be foreseen by teachers, primary care and social work professionals who form the network of people who know about the underlying risk factors that hit those children. I am thinking of issues such as family breakdown, which is increasingly common, and the misuse of drugs, alcohol and other substances. The network, however, is not really in the loop as far as early diagnosis is concerned.</p><p>The children who were questioned by Dr Bryce's organisation cited the need for discussion about issues such as family breakdown. They want to have it out with adults; they want to know how family breakdowns come about and they want to talk about the emotional consequences. They also cited the need for adults to learn how to communicate with young people; how not to talk down to them; and how to find language with which young people are in tune. The children pointed out the lack of leisure and recreational <place-holder colnum=\"7648\"/> facilities in many communities. They showed concern that, although many schools pay lip service to issues such as bullying by having policies on paper, they do nothing very much to deal with the issues.</p><p>Work is under way to develop the NHS work force and the network of children's services. That includes several of the initiatives to which the minister referred in his opening speech, such as the see me anti-stigma campaign, the health-promoting schools unit that deals with emotional health and well-being and the choose life suicide prevention strategy. All those measures aim to move services closer to children, at home and at school. For those who are already ill, the mental health and well-being support group is looking at services for the seriously unwell and those who come under the provisions of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.</p><p>There are, however, major problems facing child and adolescent mental health services. There are serious shortages in all the professions, and there is difficulty in providing an integrated system for young people that involves health, education and social work services. The separate structures and budgets of those authorities make joint planning and joint service provision hard to achieve. I urge the minister to give serious consideration to unifying the health-related social budgets so as to help alleviate that problem.</p><p>I reinforce what David Davidson said about voluntary services and urge more use of the voluntary sector. It has the skills and expertise that are required, as well as flexibility and willingness to work with the private sector. Voluntary organisations know that they could do more and they feel frustrated that they are often left out of the equation, despite the fact that they are able and willing to help.</p><p>Mental health is a massive issue. Progress is being made on several fronts, but there is still a very long way to go before people who are suffering from mental illness get the care that they require. Money is tight and morale is low, and there is undoubtedly a serious lack of trained professionals in health and social work. That must be addressed. There has been progress, but much more is needed.

As has been said, they are not exciting diseases and they tend to be the Cinderellas of the medical world and of the world at large, but there can be few families who do not have at least one member who loses time from work or who suffers joint or back pain through arthritis or some related disorder. The impact of that, in human and economic terms, is enormous.</p><p>Like Fergus Ewing, I propose to confine my remarks to osteoporosis. The condition has always been fairly common among older people, especially women, but with our aging population its prevalence throughout the western world is increasing. It is also a complication of long-term corticosteroid treatment. Nowadays, an increasing number of patients of all ages are being treated with such drugs for asthma and auto-immune diseases.</p><p>As Helen Eadie said, treatment is now available to contain the disease and partially to reverse the bone thinning it causes. The treatment can cause a 10 per cent reversal of the damage. However, if the disease is allowed to progress, the complications and multiple bone fractures are painful and cost a great deal of money to the health service and the economy. This week, I lost a much-loved elderly aunt. She died from other causes, but she had occupied a hospital bed for more than six months following a hip fracture.</p><p>Much valuable research into the causes and prevention of this common condition has been undertaken in my local hospital and the University of Aberdeen by Professor David Reid. He has already been mentioned and he is renowned for his work in this area. He has for some time had in place in Aberdeen a screening programme to try to detect problems, or potential problems, at an early stage.</p><p>Unfortunately, the availability of facilities in Aberdeen did not keep up with the number of <place-holder colnum=\"6933\"/> patients who required to be scanned and, until recently, the waiting list for scanning had reached 4,000 people and the waiting time had reached four years. That naturally caused outrage among patients who were awaiting scans, and the potential consequences bode ill for the NHS locally. Thankfully, however, the minister has intervened and instructed the health board to take action to speed things up. Professor Reid hopes to have the backlog cleared in the next year.</p><p>The backlog is being tackled within Grampian NHS Board resources. I have no knowledge of which patients will, inevitably, suffer as a result of the switch of resources to the scanning programme. I flag up the unfairness of the Arbuthnott formula, which short-changes Grampian NHS Board. It is rather short-sighted: a shortfall such as that results in delayed diagnosis of a disease such as osteoporosis and the resulting costs of its complications. As we have heard, early diagnosis of the condition is patchy across Scotland.</p><p>I hope that the minister will address this issue in the long-term interests not only of patients' well-being but of the NHS itself.

Not all women aspire to reach the top of their careers, but if they do, they should not be stopped by the glass ceiling that many women say prevents them from reaching the peak of their ambitions.</p><p>The minister will be pleased to know that we do not take exception to the motion, because I hope that we all want to work together for the whole of Scottish society to open up opportunities for all women and to recognise their contribution to the country's economic and social well-being.</p><p>My only problem is that the report seems to assume that, ideally, everyone of working age should be involved fully in economic activity, which is not the case. The emphasis of the Government in Westminster and here on work-centred policies is fine for those who want to work, but research by the Centre for Policy Studies&#8212;I am sure that members agree that it is hardly a right-wing institution&#8212;which was published in its paper \"Choosing to be different: Women, work and the family\" has shown that many women would prefer to be at home with their families if they could afford to. If we really want to promote all women, we should respect the choice of those who want career breaks, who choose to work part time or <place-holder colnum=\"6873\"/> who choose not to work and who want to focus their ambitions on family rather than career.</p><p>My profession is a case in point. There are and have been for generations many career women in medicine. Such women have put everything into the care of patients, dedicated their lives to their careers and made a major contribution to society. However, there are many more&#8212;myself included&#8212;who have decided to split their lives between profession and family and who choose to work part time or not at all. That choice must be accepted as equally commendable, but the downside is that, as the number of female medical graduates is at an all-time high, that choice of lifestyle is having a significant impact on the running of the service and must be taken into account in work force planning.</p><p>As I am a Conservative, choice is important for me. Opportunity should be available to all&#8212;men and women&#8212;and Government involvement should be geared towards helping families to achieve the work-life balance that is best for them. Of course women should be respected and have equal opportunities in life, from education to career options. If they choose a working career, access to child care should not be an obstacle. If they choose a home career of bringing up their children or looking after their elderly relatives, that too should be accepted and supported.</p><p>That approach should apply to men, too. More men are opting to remain at home with their children as single parents or in the role of parent or carer while their partner pursues a career. Many of those men feel somewhat isolated. They too must be treated equitably by society.</p><p>For hundreds of years, women have made a major contribution to Scottish society in medicine, the arts, sport, politics, business and the voluntary services. Since my mother's generation, many more women have been able to develop their talents through educational opportunity, which has opened up career options that were unheard of when I was young and given women hitherto unknown independence. That is as it should be, and obstacles should not be put in women's way. However, encouragement should also be given to those who choose not to be economically active but to make their contribution to society through their families or through voluntary activities.</p><p>I suggest that the best way to help Scottish women to flourish is to help Scotland to flourish. If there are to be opportunities for all, we must have a prosperous country. The best contribution that the Scottish Executive could make would be to address the issues that are holding us back, such as high business rates and water charges, lack of choice for parents in education and patients in accessing appropriate and timely health care and the need for more police in our communities.

The intention is to focus more on the patient and to increase input from the patient; however, the structure will still be top down and driven from the centre. As David Davidson said, that concept is fundamentally at odds with our thinking, which unequivocally puts the patient at the heart of the service&#8212;a patient who is empowered to get appropriate treatment whenever and wherever it is needed.</p><p>Budgets that were progressively devolved to local levels through GPs would allow GPs to take responsibility for all their patients' care, including health-related social services, and would bring the budget for health and social care within the health service. That would allow social and nursing care to be commissioned from the most appropriate source in either the public or the private sector and would significantly reduce the problem of delayed discharge from secondary to primary care.</p><p>The gradual introduction of foundation status for hospitals in the public sector, together with the introduction of a patient passport, would eventually enable GPs to commission all care and would allow hospitals to plan on their own behalf in response to local demand. Alongside that, the role of health boards would be progressively reduced, bringing the service ever closer to the patient.</p><p>The Labour Party at Westminster has come close to adopting our approach by setting up foundation hospitals. Indeed, it has gone further by <place-holder colnum=\"6227\"/> planning independent diagnostic treatment centres for south of the border, which will allow many more patients to receive appropriate and timely secondary care in new centres that are staffed from outwith the NHS. That care will follow referral by the NHS and will be paid for by the NHS. The centres will help to overcome the lack of capacity in the health service and will work in the best interests of patients.

I am not a member of the Health Committee, but I have read the committee's report from cover to cover, including all the evidence that is appended to it. Almost every piece of evidence in that document contains caveats. Many witnesses said that the proposed structural changes, in order to be effective, would have to be accompanied by a culture change, with hearts and minds showing willingness to co-operate across boundaries, whether those are geographical, between health boards and local authorities, or between different professions in the NHS.</p><p>There are particularly widespread concerns about the composition and role of the proposed community health partnerships; about the independence of the new Scottish health council if it is placed, as planned, within NHS QIS; about the meaningful involvement of patients in planning and developing the service; and about the powers of ministerial intervention when the system shows signs of failure and who would bear the cost of such intervention. There is also widespread concern about how the proposed changes will be financed; few seem to agree with the Executive that the bill will be financially neutral.</p><p>I have heard those concerns voiced by members throughout the chamber this afternoon&#8212;by Shona Robison, Jean Turner, Rob Gibson, Eleanor Scott, Mary Scanlon, Des McNulty, Sandra White, Carolyn Leckie and even Kate Maclean. In fact, such concerns have been voiced by almost every member who has spoken in today's debate.</p><p>I am particularly concerned about the composition and size of the proposed community <place-holder colnum=\"6228\"/> health partnerships. Despite the minister's reassuring words, associated health professionals seem to fear that GPs and nurses will dominate the CHPs; almost every associated professional organisation is clamouring for representation on the CHP boards. I worry that that could result in large, unwieldy organisations, along with dilution of the essential primary care input and loss of the goodwill that will be required for the proper functioning of the partnerships. It is crucial that the CHPs are dynamic and that they work effectively, as Shona Robison said.</p><p>Co-operation with local authority services will be vital. Although coterminous boundaries will help with that, unified health and social budgets will be necessary for long-term success in the area. That is being planned in some authorities, as we have heard.</p><p>In the event that the motion is agreed to today, the statutory guidance and regulations in relation to the operation of CHPs will be all-important.

The state of the health service work force is the key factor for the success of the health service. Every party in the chamber is right to record its gratitude for the commitment, dedication and professionalism of all those who work flat out to maintain a caring service for their patients.</p><p>I support the Executive's efforts to protect NHS staff from abuse in the line of duty and I acknowledge that the Executive's intention is to achieve a long-term, sustainable NHS work force. There is no disagreement about the fact that unprecedented sums of money are going into the service, albeit not equitably across the country&#8212;at least as far as the Grampian area is concerned. However, that is a matter for another debate.</p><p>It is several years since I worked in the health service, but pressures were beginning to be felt by the work force even then. There were consultant shortages in some specialties, although not as many as there are today; dentists were becoming unhappy with their NHS work loads; and primary care was beginning to find it difficult to recruit and retain new doctors. What is worrying is that today, despite all the extra money, things are really no better, as Jean Turner pointed out. Patients are still waiting far too long for treatment and staff morale is low at all levels of employment within the service.</p><p>Since entering the Parliament, I have been shocked at what I hear of the amount of unmet need in the service. As members know, there are many health lobbying groups and every one has the same story: there is a lack of consultants, trained and specialist nurses and associated health professionals for multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, asthma, kidney disease, diabetes and children with special needs. The list seems to go on and on. Speech therapists are like hen's teeth. Radiologists, orthotists and <place-holder colnum=\"6139\"/> occupational therapists are struggling to cope with the demand on their services. NHS dentistry is hard to come by and we have heard today of the crisis in chiropody services in the Highlands. Chiropody is a vital service to old and infirm people; as Mary Scanlon said, without adequate attention to their feet, such people often become housebound. Like Mary Scanlon, I was pleased to hear the minister say that he is considering using the Highlands model for CHPs under the proposed new NHS legislation. However, I share Mary Scanlon's concerns that the demands that will be created by new legislation must be met.</p><p>The new primary care and consultant contracts will undoubtedly make life more pleasant for practitioners and will, I hope, encourage recruitment into general practice and the specialties. However, as members know, the nature of the service will change radically, particularly in primary care, and there will be far greater reliance on nurses and associated health professionals to keep the service running. It is easy to say that out-of-hours facilities will increasingly be nurse led and that nurses and associated health professionals will relieve GPs of a significant part of their current work load. However, that must be set against a serious shortage of trained personnel and a volume of recruitment that is well short of meeting even current demand, let alone the demands that will arise from the new contract.</p><p>The training of more doctors, nurses, dentists and AHPs is clearly needed urgently. Once trained, they need to be attracted to remain in their professions and within the health service in Scotland. I share Janis Hughes's views about practical training for nurses being better than a more academic approach. I remember the days when nurses did their apprenticeship in the wards and good, caring, professional and extremely competent nurses were the outcome. I accept that junior doctors used to work hours that were far too long, but they got much invaluable practical experience in the wards and in the operating theatres. There is a risk that their training could become less than adequate when the working time directive is fully in place. Much of the work that junior doctors did previously&#8212;mostly under supervision&#8212;will fall to qualified consultants in the absence of the junior doctors, who benefited greatly from senior doctors' experience in the old days.</p><p>Jamie Stone's proposals for rotational posts for consultants in remote areas sound interesting. I am sure that the minister will consider them.</p><p>I am pleased that the videoconferencing techniques that were pioneered in Aberdeen are paying dividends in remote communities. However, there are serious shortages of front-line <place-holder colnum=\"6140\"/> staff. Like David Davidson, I was appalled yesterday to learn that in the past year the number of administrative staff in the NHS in Scotland has increased by another 5.6 per cent, while the number of GPs increased by a mere 0.5 per cent and the number of nurses by 1.7 per cent. That comes on top of a 13 per cent increase in the number of administrators in the previous three years, compared with a 0.8 per cent rise in the number of GPs and a 3.5 per cent rise in the number of nurses and midwives. Those figures indicate that the service is top-heavy with administrators who are chasing Government targets, organising and carrying out consultations and dealing with initiative after initiative from the Executive.</p><p>For goodness' sake minister, please release the health service from bureaucracy and put money where it is needed&#8212;towards front-line staff who could deliver patient care far better if they were freed from the Government's apron strings and allowed to get on with the job for which they thought they were trained.

Before my mother died 17 years ago, macular degeneration was a crucial contributor to her failing health because it made her less able to cope with other health problems that were much more serious in their own right. From being a very outgoing person who was young for her age, who went into town to meet her friends every day and who never had her nose out of a book when she was at home, my mother became down-hearted and depressed.</p><p>My mother became unable to read newspapers or even large-print books. Obviously, she had to listen to, rather than see, her favourite television programme. Her quality of life was utterly ruined. When she went out, she had very little confidence and, all in all, she found her eye problem to be a massive handicap. Because only central vision is destroyed, it is hard for onlookers to perceive the problem. My mother could pick a pin up off the floor if she happened to catch sight of it out of the corner of her eye, so it is difficult to equate that level of peripheral vision with blindness for all practical purposes.<place-holder colnum=\"5519\"/></p><p>I suspect that my mother had dry AMD, which we know is as yet untreatable, and I have other relatives who are similarly afflicted. However, I have also seen what I presume to be the wet form of the condition in another elderly relative who in a very few months went from being able to drive a car to being unable to read or watch television. Such an experience is devastating and in a short space of time takes someone from being completely self-sufficient to being heavily dependent on care services. That certainly happened in this case. For such a person, photodynamic therapy early on would be a godsend: it would hugely improve quality of life and it would save scarce care resources.</p><p>I heard what Stewart Stevenson said about the cost of treatment; however, I was told that it comes to around &#163;2 million a year for the whole of Scotland. That is a drop in the ocean as far as NHS budgets are concerned and it is even less when it is balanced against the savings in care services and benefits that could be made, not to mention in respect of lost productivity of people who are at the younger end of the condition's age spectrum. As the treatment has been approved and is recommended by NHS QIS, it should be funded&#8212;and quickly&#8212;right across Scotland, not just according to health board area.</p><p>We have an aging population and increasing numbers of people are experiencing handicaps and disabilities that are complications caused by longevity.

Undoubtedly, many children who have records of needs will not have co-ordinated support plans because their educational support needs are met only in the education service. Naturally, parents who have had to fight hard to achieve a record of needs for their child are worried that they will lose out under the bill. That must not be allowed to happen; children must retain the legal entitlement to have their additional support needs met. I am pleased that the minister has given some reassurance on that point today.</p><p>Unanswered questions that have been highlighted by the Education Committee, the Finance Committee and the Equal Opportunities Committee include the cost implications of the bill, the number of staff who will be required, and the number of children who are likely to be eligible for a co-ordinated support plan. The bill will classify many more children as having additional support needs, including gifted children, children whose education has been disrupted because of illness and children with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. It seems clear that significant resources will be required to cope with those children's needs in addition to the current funding for those with complex support needs.</p><p>What worries me most is that, because of a serious shortage of therapists and other professionals, the expectations of some of the most vulnerable young people in the community might not be met. In the few months during which I have been in the Parliament, I have heard about those shortages time and again&#8212;not enough speech therapists; long waits for physiotherapy; splints and other appliances outgrown within <place-holder colnum=\"5245\"/> weeks of acquisition. Parents are reaching extremes of anxiety and emotional exhaustion because their children cannot access the facilities that they need in education, health and social services.</p><p>The recent members' business debate on children's therapy services in the north-east highlighted those problems graphically and the north-east is by no means unique in Scotland. Even when the minister knows how many children will require additional support under the new system, how will he provide support for those with complex needs? Even with funding made available, how will he find the human resources to meet the needs, given the serious shortage of trained personnel throughout the country?</p><p>Auxiliary aids and equipment for the disabled are not dealt with under the bill, so there is a need for the current duty on local authorities to provide those items to disabled children to be continued. Another concern is about the time that is proposed for transitional arrangements for older children who are preparing to leave school. Many witnesses and committee members think that the 12 months that the bill proposes is well short of the time that is needed to put appropriate support in place to ensure a smooth transition from school to the adult world.

Soap operas were born and celebrities were created. Sex was openly discussed and portrayed explicitly by the media. Children began to grow up with latchkey lifestyles. Nowadays most mums and many grannies go out to work.</p><p>The influence of churches has gradually waned, until we now live in a largely secular society. Most households nowadays have alcohol in them all year round and not just for special celebrations, as was the case in my youth. Recreational drugs have an influence that was unknown to my generation, and communication via the internet has put people from childhood onwards in touch with a mass of information&#8212;good and bad&#8212;which has a great influence on their development and their knowledge.</p><p>The downside is more casual relationships, with an emphasis on sexual activity, more broken homes, households with children who are deprived of one or other parent, and a rise in sexually transmitted diseases and the ensuing complications that Mary Scanlon described graphically.<place-holder colnum=\"4789\"/></p><p>As a number of speakers have said, many young people are sexually active long before they are emotionally ready for it. Often they are pressurised into it by their peers, and often it occurs under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs. Many regret it and, sadly, as we know, more than 9,000 teenagers become pregnant in Scotland every year. Half of them undergo the physical and emotional traumas of termination, and many others face single parenthood, with restrictions and responsibilities for which they are not prepared.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308752", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Health and Relationship Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been interesting as it has demonstrated differing viewpoints on the important issue of sexual health and relationships.

Parents and school boards should have the final say on the sex education materials that are used in their schools. Parents must be at liberty to withdraw their children from formal sex education if they are not happy with it. That is a right of parents, and I stand up for it.</p><p>There is a clear and welcome intention by Government to promote positive sexual health in Scotland and to tackle the problems of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, which affect so many people today, but in any health strategy the sexual health of all groups should be included. Like Patrick Harvie, I am pleased that the draft strategy touches on the problems that are faced by people of all ages with disabilities and impairments that lead to sexual difficulties, and the particular health and discrimination issues that are faced by the LGBT community.</p><p>The draft strategy is ambitious and wide ranging but, as page 17 of the summary document states,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Improving sexual health and changing behaviour\"</p><p>cannot be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"brought about by the Scottish Executive Health Department and NHS services\"</p><p>alone.

There is clearly a consensus on the report in the chamber.</p><p>Who would have thought in the late 1970s that within 25 years home ownership in Scotland would have almost doubled from 35 per cent to nearly 70 per cent, satisfying the aspirations of many Scottish households who had previously only dreamed of owning their own homes? The increase in home ownership has led to the upgrading of many properties that were previously in the public sector, but there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly in private rented properties and in the communal areas of privately owned tenements&#8212;there are many extremely attractive and well-maintained flats within buildings whose maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. I welcome the private housing and <place-holder colnum=\"4708\"/> tenements bills that the Minister for Communities proposed earlier in the debate.</p><p>The task force's report is timely in identifying the responsibilities of owners and the standards that they should be striving to achieve. It offers a challenge to all those who have an interest in private sector housing.</p><p>Owner-occupiers, private landlords and housing professionals all have a role to play in encouraging and achieving investment in private sector properties. One particularly welcome proposal, which Shona Robison and other members have highlighted, is for the provision of better information to buyers and sellers through a single detailed survey.</p><p>Local authorities have a responsibility to engage with the private sector at a local level to achieve better housing quality. The Scottish Executive must provide a statutory framework to encourage good stewardship of the private sector housing stock and support it with effective funding mechanisms to help owners to achieve the desired standards.</p><p>I was pleased to hear of the Executive's practical response to the recommendations in the report and I was pleased to hear the minister detail the measures that are being taken. However, I have two specific areas of concern. The first is our aging population and the difficulties that many older people face&#8212;both financially and practically&#8212;in maintaining their properties to an acceptable standard on a reduced income. That will become an increasing problem as the Scottish population continues to age and more people remain in their homes into their 80s and 90s and sometimes even into their 100s. I hope that suitable grant funding will be put in place to help those people with such problems.</p><p>The second area of concern is rural housing, which Mary Scanlon touched on. In rural areas, the private sector accounts for 56 per cent of the rented stock. The current issue of <em>Landowning in Scotland</em>&#8212;the journal of the Scottish Landowners Federation&#8212;contains an interesting interview with Andrew Bradford, the chairman of the federation's housing committee, who goes into significant detail about the barriers to the provision of affordable housing in rural areas. Nearly all of Communities Scotland's budget goes to housing associations, but a mere 2 per cent of rural rented properties are provided by housing associations. Indeed, Mr Bradford points out that Kincardine Estate, which he manages in the heart of rural Aberdeenshire, provides as many rented houses as all the housing associations in the three local settlements of Aboyne, Ballater and Braemar.</p><p>Many estates are ideally placed to provide housing and, with a little financial assistance from <place-holder colnum=\"4709\"/> the Government, they could cost-effectively deliver affordable rural housing where it is not currently available. I ask the minister to meet Mr Bradford and to consider the vital part that landowners play in providing affordable housing in rural Scotland and the further action that they could take to help people in their areas with just a little assistance from the Executive.</p><p>Tommy Sheridan and Murray Tosh outlined the researched need for housing, which is, at present, substantially unmet across Scotland. I hope that, as Murray Tosh suggested, further work will be done on that and that targets will be put in place so that demand can be satisfied at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>The task force's report makes some important recommendations, but its impact will depend on how those recommendations are implemented by the Executive. I look forward to hearing how the proposals are progressing in the months ahead. I am happy to support the SNP amendment, which calls for a timetable for the implementation of the recommendations, and I also support the amendment in the name of Mary Scanlon.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I welcome the housing improvement task force's report and the wide-ranging debate today about improving Scotland's housing.

I hope that the new contract will achieve the necessary balance between recruiting new GPs and retaining more of the older ones to make general practice a more attractive career option for medical graduates.</p><p>If Carolyn Leckie and Tommy Sheridan had their way, however, GPs would flee the health service like snow off a dyke&#8212;unless they plan to lock them into their surgeries and take away the keys.</p><p>The passage of the bill today will allow the implementation of the new contract to go ahead next April in Scotland as well as in England, which is important if we are to retain GPs in this country.</p><p>By and large, the terms of the contract have been welcomed by the profession. The focus on the primary care team and funding based on patient need as well as numbers will allow GPs to plan their work load more easily and, at the same time, to improve the service that they give to patients. For the first time ever, they will be rewarded for any enhanced services that they provide over and above the essential and additional services that most GPs currently give their patients. The transfer of responsibility for the provision of out-of-hours care to health boards will take an enormous load off GPs. Having been married to one for over 30 years, I know what that work load is.</p><p>Many GPs will opt out of out-of-hours provision, but many will continue to work out of hours in co-operatives, as they do now. In most parts of Scotland, that will be adequate and satisfactory provision.

They constantly struggle against the odds to do the best for their children. We heard from the mum of a little boy with autism and haemophilia who is at risk of bleeding every time he lashes out in frustration; the mum of young triplets, two of whom have serious special needs, who struggled to tell her story because she was exhausted and emotionally drained by her efforts to cope; and the mum whose child waited so long for the splints that would allow him to walk that he outgrew them within a month of their being provided.</p><p>Those mums are coping with tremendous problems every day of their lives&#8212;some of them on their own because their marriages could not survive the stresses and strains. Like all of us, they want the best for their children. They want them to receive the help that they need to become functioning, independent adults who will be able to make a positive contribution to society; they do not want their children to be so handicapped by their disabilities that they are dependent on society for their care and welfare throughout their lives.<place-holder colnum=\"4363\"/></p><p>The lack of available resources means that parents struggle to get the speech therapy for their children that they need. The lack of orthotists means that aids to mobility are not there when they are required. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are not available as often, or as regularly, as they are needed for optimum improvement. The parents are tired of battling and they want something to be done soon to improve the availability of facilities for their children.</p><p>It must be stressed that parents have absolutely no criticism to make of the associated health professionals who are in post and who do as much as possible to provide the services that are needed. It is important to get that message across to professionals, because the last thing that we need is for people to leave their professions because of low morale and a feeling that their efforts are not appreciated.</p><p>There is no doubt that we urgently need more such professionals. That is not entirely a funding issue. In Grampian, for instance, serious efforts have been made to recruit and retain therapists across the professions by spreading the recruitment net throughout the United Kingdom and beyond, by making accommodation available to those who are not in a position to get into the housing market and by offering flexible working conditions. However, so far, those efforts have not had much success.</p><p>Although I stress that Grampian NHS Board has made no reference to this, I fear that the Arbuthnott formula for NHS funding, whereby the 10 per cent of Scotland's population who live in the Grampian area receive only 9 per cent of national resources, is not helpful. The Scottish Executive should consider that fact without delay.</p><p>At the recent meeting of MSPs and parents, we discovered that at least three of the mums in the group were keen to train as speech therapists, but how on earth could they attend training classes in central Scotland, even if places were available, when they are so committed at home? As Richard Baker said, NHS Grampian is doing its best to persuade the local university to provide an MSc course in speech and language therapy. If training were available locally, those mums would undoubtedly sign up for it. A pool of such trained people could at least provide cover for maternity, holiday and sick leave, even if the establishment of therapists remained relatively unchanged.</p><p>I say to the minister that we have serious problems in the north-east, which must be addressed both locally and nationally. Services in Grampian are no worse than elsewhere&#8212;indeed, they are considerably better than those in some areas. However, that is irrelevant. NHS Grampian is being as helpful as it can and has offered to meet a representative group of parents to discuss <place-holder colnum=\"4364\"/> possible solutions. I hope that that meeting will take place early in the new year.</p><p>The Scottish Executive must also recognise the problems and take steps to solve them soon, so that our constituents can achieve the quality of life that they expect and deserve.

I can still see and feel my red and painful toes, which had chilblains for most of the winter. Thank goodness that time has moved on and that fewer and fewer people have memories such as those.</p><p>The latest \"Scottish House Condition Survey\" shows a considerable decrease in the total number of inadequately heated households. However, there are still 239,000 pensioner households&#8212;that is, more than one third of such households&#8212;where people cannot afford to heat their home properly. Those people spend a lot of time indoors and they need a higher temperature than younger people to sustain their body warmth. Every winter, they have to make choices between food and adequate heating. Sadly, each winter we are reminded of the statistic that hypothermia is a factor in three times more deaths among the over-65s in Scotland than it is in England and Wales.</p><p>Few would disagree with the Scottish Executive's fuel poverty statement of last year, which aimed to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, fuel poverty is eradicated in Scotland by November 2016. Efforts to improve the home conditions of less affluent families have been going on since the early 1990s, when the Conservative Government introduced the home energy efficiency scheme. Between 1991 and the replacement of that scheme by Labour's warm deal programme, 3 million households had been helped to install energy-efficient measures such as loft or cavity-wall insulation in their homes. As Mary Scanlon said, the warm deal scheme is really a continuation, with modifications, of Conservative policy.</p><p>The Executive's five-year central heating programme is set to benefit 140,000 homes, of which 40,000 are in the private sector. That is <place-holder colnum=\"3524\"/> commendable, but there is still a significantly high level of fuel poverty, particularly in the private rented sector. There is certainly no room for complacency.</p><p>As the minister said, the number of households that are being disconnected from their energy supply due to debt is a serious concern. That leaves people without heating, lighting, warm water and cooking facilities because they cannot afford their bills. That is happening against a background of a real-terms decrease in energy costs for consumers, since the Conservative Government privatised the utilities and drove down prices. The only soaring cost to consumers today is the cost of water, which we did not put into the private sector&#8212;the sooner that that industry is in the hands of its customers, the better.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13305627", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I still have vivid childhood memories of fuel poverty in the late 1940s in immediate post-war Aberdeen.

There has been a drop in recruitment and retention and an increase in early retirement to the extent that it is becoming well-nigh impossible to provide adequate primary care in parts of Scotland, particularly in the more rural and remote areas. Jean Turner&#8212;who is a former medical classmate of mine&#8212;gave a graphic description of the reasons for falling morale over the past 12 years. My husband retired early from practice for such reasons. He now helps to keep the system going by doing locums, which gives him the freedom to practise medicine as he was trained to do.</p><p>The new contract, which focuses on the primary care team rather than on the GP alone and bases funding on patients' needs as well as list size, will allow GPs to improve the service for patients and, at the same time, to be more in charge of their work load. They will have more time to spend with their patients and will be relieved of their responsibility for the 24-hour provision of patient care. For the first time, they will be rewarded for any enhanced services that they provide for patients over and above the essential and additional services that are currently provided by most practices. That is good news for patients in most areas and for the profession in general. A majority have voted in favour of the new contract.</p><p>However, I would like to make a case for an important section of the profession that is more <place-holder colnum=\"2676\"/> than a little concerned about the future. I refer to those GPs who also run community hospitals, of which there are many in rural Scotland. Such hospitals are not part of general medical services, but are an integral part of medical services in the areas that they serve, such as in Inverurie, Stonehaven, Huntly and Brechin, to name but a few places in the north-east. Currently, their staff deal on a 24-hour basis with accident and emergency attendances, daytime and overnight admissions, acute management of relatively unstable patients and palliative care, among other services. If those hospitals become nurse led out of hours because the local GP is no longer available, there will be inevitable limitations on what can be dealt with. Currently, the service that is provided is a service of extended care that uses an integrated team approach, including the community hospital, and patients in those areas already receive significantly more than core and additional services.</p><p>The GPs in those areas find their work professionally rewarding and see the new contract&#8212;particularly its out-of-hours provision&#8212;as a potential threat to the high standard of care that they provide, unless it is appropriately resourced. Many of them do not see an out-of-hours co-operative as being able to provide the standard of service that is currently available to their widely scattered practice population.</p><p>It is clear that primary care is not uniform throughout Scotland and it is important that the contract does not create disincentives to the pattern of care that I have just described. Otherwise, communities that are remote from acute services and depend on extended primary care could find themselves without access to a generalist diagnostician who has the clinical authority and experience to make decisions on future care. Patients in those areas would, by default, be referred to acute services, with all the consequential implications that that would have, such as delayed discharges, blocked beds and lengthening waiting lists.</p><p>I am a little disappointed that the Health Committee has not heard evidence from the Scottish Association of Community Hospitals, because it has an important case to make. I hope that the Minister for Health and Community Care will pay heed to what I have said and take what steps he can to ensure that this invaluable resource is properly funded in the interests of patient care and the health service in general.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13303423", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The passage of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill is crucial to the future of primary care in this country, as recent years have seen a crisis in morale in the service.

The facility is available two days a week and follow-up home visits are carried out if possible. That has benefited many patients who are referred to the clinic by nurses, occupational therapists, consultants and other people who are concerned with the patients' care. Using the CABx to give advice on social welfare issues frees up the time of health care professionals to treat patients instead of filling in forms. Nurses and other hospital staff are very often not up to speed with benefit entitlements or with the complicated form-filling that is entailed. The CABx service relieves staff and their patients from a significant amount of stress, giving them more time to deal with health concerns. As has been said by several members, patients gain from having their non-medical problems dealt with; it relieves them of worry and aids their medical progress. Carers also benefit from the help that they get to deal with the practical concerns that they have to handle on behalf of patients.</p><p>Unfortunately, the health board in Aberdeen has withdrawn the &#163;5,000 that it gave initially towards the &#163;10,000 annual running cost of the service.

However, it is perhaps not so surprising given that, until fairly recently, in most local authorities equal opportunities issues were discussed by women's committees rather than by equal opportunities committees.</p><p>I studied the mainstreaming equalities report with great interest, especially the <em>Official Report </em>of the evidence-taking sessions. I was particularly struck by Cathy Peattie's comments:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It always seemed to me that the equal opportunities policy was something that people talked about but put in a filing cabinet and did nothing about.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee</em>, 14 January 2003; c 1705.]</p><p>She added that it was her strong belief that, to mainstream equal opportunities policy and to make it work, more is needed than \"tools and experts\". To work efficiently, hearts and minds must be won. Only then will we get away from experts having to make decisions and from equal opportunities issues being marginalised to people who are interested in them or for whom that is their job.</p><p>At a subsequent meeting, Cathy Peattie asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Have hearts and minds been won? Are people signing up to equality issues without being given a hard kick?\"</p><p>The minister replied:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is political commitment to equality issues at the top of the Executive, throughout the Cabinet and from other Executive ministers.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Equal Opportunities Committee</em>, 4 February 2003; c 1764-65.]</p><p>I am delighted to hear that. I hope that the Executive will take on board the Equal Opportunities Committee's recommendations.</p><p>I also hope that all committees will adopt the <place-holder colnum=\"2205\"/> equality guidelines in the planning of their work programmes and that they will use an equalities checklist as they consider legislation. Training should be provided for MSPs as well as parliamentary staff and the Equal Opportunities Committee should have a continuing role in monitoring the implementation of the draft equality guidelines.</p><p>There is no doubt that, over time, many disadvantaged groups have felt left out. They have felt that their views were not taken into account and that the issues that they faced were not addressed. As the minister said, the Executive introduced its equality strategy to deal with that. The strategy gives ministerial support to the incorporation of equality in policy and in the working of all departments.</p><p>The strategy's long-term aim is to ensure that policy making is fully sensitive to people's diverse needs and experiences. It seeks to achieve improved policy making through better information, greater transparency and openness in the policy process. It involves effective consultation among groups and individuals who experience inequality and discrimination so that they can inform policy making. It encourages wider participation among disadvantaged and excluded groups. As Margaret Curran will know from my recent questions to her, I am concerned that not all consultation is meaningful or effective.</p><p>The strategy also tackles structures, behaviours and attitudes that lead to inequality and discrimination. It tries to avoid policies and programmes that perpetuate or worsen existing inequalities. As the report states, mainstreaming</p><p class=\"indent\">\"complements lawful positive action designed to address\"</p><p>the long-term historic disadvantage that is experienced by specific groups as a result of discriminating practices and strategies. Those are fine words, but I repeat that mainstreaming is a long-term process. Hearts and minds will not be won overnight.</p><p>My party is happy to accept the report's recommendations on mainstreaming equality in the work of parliamentary committees. We believe that scrutiny is necessary to ensure that no section of society will be disadvantaged by whatever legislation is enacted. We welcome the recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Committee and we hope that the Executive will ensure that committees get enough time to implement them.</p><p>I end on a cautionary note. I am a passionate believer in equality&#8212;when I say \"equality\", I mean equality and not discrimination, whether it be positive or negative. I was brought up with the adage that we are all Jock Tamson's bairns and I believe that people are people the world over.<place-holder colnum=\"2206\"/></p><p>Many equality issues centre on employment, an issue about which I feel strongly. I believe that people should be employed on merit and that the choice of employee should be based solely on their ability to do the job effectively. The best people should be selected, be they able bodied or disabled and whatever their ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual orientation or beliefs.</p><p>Sometimes in people's attempts to overcome disadvantage there is evidence of positive discrimination, which is as bad as the reverse. For example, my party has not gone down the road of having all-female candidate lists&#8212;thank goodness. Whether it is right or wrong, I am here today because my party members thought that I was fit for the job, not because I am female, middle aged or white, or for any reason other than the fact that I wanted to be here and my party members thought that I was up to it.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mainstreaming Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a new member of the Equal Opportunities Committee and as a fairly new MSP who is attending my first debate on a committee report, I am somewhat diffident about making the   lead contribution for my party on a report that I had absolutely no part in formulating.

However, we have had a wide-ranging debate, which has given many members the opportunity to set out their stalls and to highlight their own particular and local concerns about the health of Scottish people and how it should be improved.</p><p>Members have highlighted the widespread difficulty that patients experience in accessing health services in Scotland, although there is no criticism of NHS staff or treatment once they get there. Mary Scanlon spoke eloquently about difficulties in access in the Highlands and Islands and the waiting-time problems that still beset the service despite the large sums of money that have recently been poured into it. Without reform, money will not greatly help the situation. The Executive needs to address that fact with the utmost urgency.</p><p>There is clear cross-party agreement on today's challenges to the health of our nation. Those challenges include the need to tackle obesity, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, which is an underlying cause of coronary heart disease and several common cancers. Other challenges are the proven risks of smoking and alcohol abuse, the need to encourage healthy eating, the promotion of mental well-being and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies&#8212;a plethora of public health issues, covering the whole spectrum of life from the womb to extreme old age.</p><p>Much has been achieved in recent years. The infant mortality rate has been more than halved <place-holder colnum=\"1922\"/> and survival rates for coronary heart disease, strokes and breast cancer have significantly improved. However, as the minister said this morning, Scotland's health is not improving fast enough and more needs to be done.</p><p>I am sure that there is not a single member in the chamber, from any part of the political spectrum, who does not want to improve the health of people throughout Scotland. The differences that we have are in our emphases and how we believe we can best achieve the improvements that we want.</p><p>As members know, my party believes in individual responsibility and choice. We believe that the Scottish Executive's approach has too often been to adopt a nannying tone and to centralise control. That comes across to some extent in \"Improving Health in Scotland&#8212;The Challenge\", although to be fair it was not so evident in the minister's opening speech.</p><p>We believe that people and patients must be at the core of service planning and that many public health issues are best dealt with locally. I am pleased that the minister stressed the importance of the voluntary sector and community-based action. As Eleanor Scott hinted, some of the advice that comes from NHS Health Scotland is hardly rocket science and the number of glossy campaign documents that come from the Executive is prolific. I wonder whether we are always getting best value for money, or whether some of the resources that are being spent in that way would have more impact at community level, where the effective work is done.</p><p>Public health planning is crucial to improving the nation's health, but we must not forget that treating those who are already suffering is of the utmost importance. The reform of key public services is needed urgently to help the most vulnerable in our society, who are most likely to suffer from ill health. David Davidson made plain our approach to a patient-focused health service and I reiterate our commitment that quality and choice in health care should be available to everyone. People who are on low incomes, the increasing elderly population and the large number of dedicated carers, young and old and many who are not yet identified as carers, are all groups whose needs must be considered and who should be involved in health care planning, delivery and evaluation.</p><p>I am pleased that Janis Hughes so clearly explained the continuing concerns about the patchy development of carers' information strategies and the need to identify hidden carers. I am also pleased that she paid tribute to the valuable work of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, which, in the same way as the other voluntary bodies that were described by Christine Grahame and Sandra White, is not adequately <place-holder colnum=\"1923\"/> funded for further development of the services that it offers to carers. The trust merits more help from the Executive.</p><p>We heard detailed comments from Liberal Democrat members about the partnership agreement. From the expressions on ministers' faces during those speeches, I wonder whether the agreement on health issues was not quite so dominated by Liberal Democrat manifesto commitments as we were led to believe.</p><p>Frances Curran passionately criticised meaningless public consultation. John Scott drew attention to an on-going consultation in Ayr that looks as though its outcome will be pre-empted by decisions. In my experience, widespread cynicism is generated by that sort of thing. That is why I asked questions last week about the importance of meaningful public consultation. There is serious concern about that issue and it must be sorted out.</p><p>Shona Robison covered many issues in her opening speech for the SNP; I will not go into them in detail. We are in agreement with some of what she said, but David Davidson's speech gave a pretty clear indication of where we disagree. Suffice it to say that because we are a unionist party, we are confident that the problems within the NHS do not require independence for their solution.</p><p>Adam Ingram rightly drew attention to the stigma that is still associated with mental illness and the need to make the public more aware of it, so that mental illness can be talked about more openly and with understanding. We have seen the benefit of such an approach in recent years with patients who suffer from malignant diseases such as cancer.</p><p>Rob Gibson made some interesting comments about problems in the Highlands and Islands and other rural areas that are home to 30 per cent of the Scottish population. Phil Gallie and John Scott told us about the shortage of junior doctors in Ayr. That shortage is due in part to the effect of the working time directive on junior doctors' hours. That is a serious problem throughout Scotland; it is threatening acute care in many areas and it is very difficult to address.</p><p>Finally, having worked as a doctor in the NHS in Aberdeen for more 20 years, and having consistently and vocally supported the NHS as a universal service freely available to all who need it, I find Kate Maclean's perception that Tories do not care about patients a little offensive. David Davidson is also a health care professional.</p><p>Although public health in Scotland is undoubtedly better in many respects than it was in our parents' and grandparents' time, we now face major health problems as a result of our modern lifestyle: the fast pace of life and workplace <place-holder colnum=\"1924\"/> stresses that are caused in no small measure by modern technology and the speed of electronic communication; broken relationships; the ready availability of junk food and alcohol; the scourge of drugs; and the demographic time bomb of an aging population.</p><p>The challenge is great.

If not dealt with properly, it can result in blindness, coronary heart disease and renal failure.</p><p>Obesity is also a causal factor in many other serious diseases.

Those costs will escalate as obesity becomes more prevalent. We are sitting on a health time bomb. We must tackle the problem head on.</p><p>As the motion states, the Executive and local health care providers are already attempting to address the problem.

We did that thoroughly incompetently, too.</p><p>A great deal of progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers. Survival rates for breast cancer are hugely improved. Leukaemias and lymphomas respond well to chemotherapy. By no means is all doom and gloom nowadays when the big C is diagnosed.</p><p>However, as several members have said, cancer in its many forms is still one of the greatest health problems facing Scotland. In the course of our lives, we are all touched by it in one way or another. Sadly, as several members have said, our success rates are lagging behind other western European countries. Early diagnosis is essential if cure rates are to improve and screening tests are successfully diagnosing early cervical, breast and colorectal cancer.</p><p>I was impressed with the Grampian and Tayside colorectal screening pilot that I recently saw in Dundee. I was involved in researching colorectal cancer, which is a common cancer in the north-east of Scotland, so I am delighted that something is to be done about it, as early diagnosis can make a huge difference. I hope that the screening programme will be rolled out, but, as Shona Robison said, there is no point in rolling it out if we do not have the back-up facilities. A successful colorectal screening programme will result in a huge demand for colonoscopic investigation.</p><p>Patients must have early and equal access to specialist services wherever they are available. I make no apology for saying that if those services are available in the private sector, rather than the public sector, that is where patients should be treated. Patients who have a potential diagnosis of cancer hanging over them do not really care where they get treatment. They want the best available treatment, when they need it, wherever that is provided. I hope that political ideology will never again prevent patients from receiving the best available care at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>The Executive has pledged that by 2005 for all cancers the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment will be two months, with urgent treatment for breast cancer to begin within one month of diagnosis, where clinically appropriate. However, even that is a long time for someone to live with the threat of a potentially fatal disease hanging over them. Margaret Ewing put the issue very well. I was not given a diagnosis of cancer, <place-holder colnum=\"1464\"/> but I spent two or three weeks not knowing whether I had the disease. That is a traumatic time for any patient.</p><p>Nearly all our hospitals have unacceptably long waiting times for the two biggest killers&#8212;lung cancer and bowel cancer. Staff shortages are a major problem. Radiographers, pathologists, senior specialist nurses and oncologists are in short supply throughout the country. It is important that cancer care nurses receive appropriate study leave and cover, to facilitate their continuing education and professional development in this important field.</p><p>More people need to be recruited into the understaffed oncology specialties. That will take time, but we do not have much time, as the post-war baby boomers are reaching the age at which cancer takes its toll. There is no doubt that cancer becomes more common as people get older. Although it must be acknowledged that the Executive has invested money in cancer services and that survival rates for many cancers have improved, the problems are by no means solved. The motion smacks a little of complacency in the face of the realities.

Around a third of carers are over 60 years old, 19,000 are young, the majority are female and 91 per cent of them believe that their caring role adversely affects their health. There are all sorts of issues about lack of support, lack of information, lack of carers assessments and lack of access to respite, which is a particular concern.

A GP register of carers would go a long way towards giving us more accurate information about the number of carers.</p><p>Once the carer population is identified, it should be much easier for local support groups to be set up throughout the country to help to address carers' needs.

Moreover, in a recent case accepted by the Office of Fair Trading, it has become clear that the public sector is subject to the provisions of the Compassion Act 1998 and may not subsidise its own care homes at the expense of the independent sector, a ruling that I am told applies in Scotland as well as south of the border.

That must be done immediately.</p><p>For the future, adoption of Scottish Conservative proposals for a unified budget for health and social care, controlled by general practitioners via our fundholding policy, would allow patients' own practitioners to procure health-related social services for them. In that way, the most appropriate care for patients would be commissioned from providers in either the public or the independent sector. That would help to reduce the problem of delayed hospital discharge and ensure a level playing field for care home providers because local authorities would not be able to discriminate in favour of their own services.</p><p>A long-term solution will also have to be found, as demographic change will result in two thirds of our population being of retirement age by 2050.

Equally, there are reasons why the status quo is unviable and why changes must be made in...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "Mrs", "url": "/msp/?m=80086", "house": "4", "member_id": "80086", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "13297215", "hpos": "353", "gid": "2003-05-29.304.0", "epobject_id": "13297238", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2003-05-29.294.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g304.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "17:30:00", "speaker_id": "80086"}, {"body": "<p>My name is Nanette Milne.</p>", "hdate": "2003-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13296859", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dental Services in Grampian"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My name is Nanette Milne.", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Nanette", "last_name": "Milne", "title": "Mrs", "url": "/msp/?m=80086", "house": "4", "member_id": "80086", "person_id": "14064", "party": "Conservative", "constituency": "North East Scotland"}, "section_id": "13296859", "hpos": "169", "gid": "2003-05-28.164.0", "epobject_id": "13296885", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2003-05-28.146.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14064+section%3Asp#g164.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "17:48:00", "speaker_id": "80086"}, {"body": "<p>First, I congratulate Richard Baker on securing the debate. I welcome the opportunity to discuss NHS dental service provision in Grampian and the serious and growing problem of recruiting and retaining dentists in that area. As the oldest new girl in the recent intake of north-east MSPs, I am happy to support the motion from its youngest member. Although I do not imagine that such happy political consensus will endure for the next four years, it is vital that we all work together on an issue that is of such importance to the people of north-east Scotland.</p><p>The timing of this discussion is opportune, as it comes just ahead of next week's dental healthfit conference, which is being organised by NHS Grampian. The conference will consider the current pressures on the system and the forces and drivers for change within dental health, with a view to planning Grampian's dental services in the medium to long term.</p><p>From speaking to local dentists and from reading some of the papers that have been prepared for next week's conference, it would appear that, although Grampian's problems are many and complex, the major issue facing the service is, as Richard Baker said, the recruitment and retention of dentists within the area. As we have heard, against a Scottish average of one dentist to 2,700 patients, Aberdeen has one dentist to every 2,900 patients, while the more rural Aberdeenshire has only one dentist per 5,000.</p><p>Despite the clamour from several politicians for the provision of a dental school in Aberdeen, local dentists do not seem to see that as the solution. The existing dental schools in Dundee and Glasgow would already be training enough dentists to supply local demand if the dentists could be persuaded to remain in Scotland and if they could be attracted to the more peripheral areas such as Grampian. Several inducements have already been tried, with varying levels of success.</p><p>Many graduates wish to practise where they have trained, so the outreach centre promised by the new Scottish Executive for undergraduate training in Aberdeen is to be welcomed. If that <place-holder colnum=\"151\"/> were coupled with good postgraduate facilities in the area, a lifelong learning continuum could be established which, it is reckoned, could go a long way towards retaining good young dentists within Grampian. A good postgraduate centre could provide resources for all members of the dental work force and would become the backbone of vocational and general professional training, which will undoubtedly assume increasing importance in time to come.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's commitment to consult on the further development of dental training in Aberdeen, but I suggest that consideration should focus primarily on the provision of postgraduate facilities within Aberdeen rather than the provision of a further dental school for undergraduate training.</p>", "hdate": "2003-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13296859", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dental Services in Grampian"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I congratulate Richard Baker on securing the debate.
